00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.609
a mom i is proposing a new law that
would make it easier for debt collectors

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.529
to call cell phones in order to collect
student loan debt

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:16.070
name this is a little disaster is right
now according to the current law uh...

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.689
debt collectors can make those robo
calls to land mines however they cannot

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.980
make robo calls to cell phones okay and
al i think that was put in place in

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.079
order to prevent harassment however the
obama administration wants to collect

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.559
the amount of money that said his only
student loan debt and andy needs that

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.449
collect that money because when an
economic disaster here you should do if

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:42.990
you want since if you got their student
loan debt ukraine's shops to chechnya

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.309
and this is your

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.949
collecting money and it seemed so you'll
have a robo calls harass panthers cell

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.470
phones

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.890
to wake up for some film of the thing i
i was here as you said the uh...

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.610
it's captain just to the to the federal

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.560
that's because

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.390
yasser arafat's yes is the problem that
that the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.830
so bring as well as we have the gun

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.940
that really work

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.600
i don't know if you were because of a
sudden making if you'd that you don't

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.010
have my degree of response dot alone

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.230
when that will cost

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.280
i forgot i keep my fifty thousand
dollars in cash

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.790
and under call cost of memphis and i
keep looking to do something about i

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.570
mean insult unbelievably

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.940
stupid and makes a lot of the clinton
show

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.780
okay if this is your way of tackling the
debt and having federal funds paid back

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.890
to the government this is a g_o_p_ all
you're doing ok you need to create jobs

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.550
i'd know that's easier said than done
right but this is not a good way to

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.680
solve the problem handing automatic
calls go through cell phones to her

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.260
arrested precedence to pay back money
that they don't have is not going to

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.009
work it's not gonna help our economy for
tomorrow on this routed to get that done

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.909
is on the same understand no

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.010
you know since a lot of these things are
in the store

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.130
graduates are in the situation now

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.260
let's try and fix it so that the future
student caught up in the same situation

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.300
for the colors doesn't have people inc
printing two thousand dollars after they

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.159
get out

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.629
since they have a chance

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.250
that their success in life when they do
get the job

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.079
that itsy-bitsy i think so

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.540
overwhelming do you happen to get the
poetry of robo calls calling for sixty

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.639
that's yeah i mean the whole system she
said i wasn't

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:29.059
america right and senator gramm is doing
nothing more about people later on to

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.590
get rid of the problem as well

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.620
and there are a lot of fair let a
problem on his job proposal was awesome

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.740
obtained his

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.950
economic recovery proposal was over his
debt recovery proposal i i think it

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.030
overall was a good one okay so he is
working hard on that front however this

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.690
is asinine this is stupid this is the
kind of stuff that is easy to grasp and

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.680
the american people anaesthesia grass by
mainstream media they will talk about

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.800
this and he will make it look like a
fool this is not playing a right

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.500
politically and it isn't gonna get
anything done if if i was telling this

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.270
type of proposal was actually can be
effective then i would say it appears

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.209
that the media does with that ok world
pass and and let's see what happens men

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.429
and women who work in canada defended
its so stupid

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.989
yeah i just wonder how much people
wondering about the rule coffee

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.500
and how it could be arresting some other
people coming out and this coming out of

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.510
uh... because planetarium possibly notes
you know

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.950
with so many things and unseemly
salacious enough for a while ago but i

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.759
think you know if without robo calls and
that could make a momentum

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.039
but they didn't over the border
