Hi! I'm Shelly Cordsen with expertvillage.com
and we are making are making luggage tags

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.760
today. Two of the items you do need just for
the luggage tags is craft pellon , craft pellon

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.520
is you could get it in different weights.
For this project this project we need a thick

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.420
heavy weight and make sure that it says pellon
craft bounding. Interfacing will now work

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.071
you need have this pellon and you could find
it at any fabric store. Another item that

00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:38.679
you are going to need is some plastic you
will find this at your fabric store or your

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:44.269
local Wal-Mart and they would be on big old
rolls because a lot of people buy it as tablecloths

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.350
covers just to lay on there tables. You don't
need very much but one of my recognition is

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.829
when you get home with it is that you spread
it out and put it somewhere where it is protected.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.829
I attend to get my folded and then I get a
lot of wrinkles in it and I can't use it and

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.320
I waste alot so take it from me lay it flat
somewhere at home if even slide it under your

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.960
bed. What you are going to need is some of
that plastic 3x5, the pellon you are going

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:27.050
to need a strip and we would cut this interfacing
pellon 3x11 1/2. You would fabric of your

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.719
choose. This one I'm choosing little frogs
I have a daughter that she is going to be

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:40.180
traveling and she is into frogs. We need one
strip 3 1/2x12. We are going to cut our strips

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.891
to 3 1/2x12 strips and you could use the lines
on your cutting board I tend to use my ruler

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:54.789
alot. I have a straight edge here and I will
find 3 1/2 on my ruler, lay that edge right

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:04.280
down on my fabric and then with my rotary
cutter cut one strip. And I have my strip,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:17.460
now I need it to be 12 inches long and so
I happen to have a ruler that is 12 inches

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:25.550
and I'm going to put that right on there.
Cut that. The other thing we are going to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:36.110
need is a strip for a handle and the handle
is going to be 2x14 which is exactly I have

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.200
my 12 one and I'm goign to use my board on
this one to 14. Line up my lines right here

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.620
and cut that and that would be for my handle
and that is all we need for our luggage tag.
