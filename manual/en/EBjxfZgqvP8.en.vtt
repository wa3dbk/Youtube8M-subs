00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.550
Hey youtubers it’s charlie and The first
episode of The Musketeers just aired.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.969
It basically takes the spot on sunday nights
that’s been used by Sherlock for the last

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:15.969
couple of weeks.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.810
So you can assume that with Peter Capaldi
playing a big role that both Sherlock and

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.599
Doctor Who fans will enjoy it and it does
look like a lot of fun.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.880
So what I’ll be doing this season is weekly
reviews for each episode.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.000
There are 10 total.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.650
Be sure to subscribe to get everything.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.130
I also ask a big question at the end of this
video about future musketeers whatnot and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.320
another new show I’m thinking about doing
at the end of this video so it would be awesome

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.320
if you guys answer that.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.621
This video will be a review of the first episode
with some background information about the

00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:43.190
actors and Peter Capaldi, because he might
not come back for series 2.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.350
For US people, these episodes will air on
BBC America in April or May so careful for

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.350
spoilers.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.780
So let’s do our top 5 moments from the premiere,
and then I’ll do my review.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.000
Number 5 - The Red Wedding Crossover.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.930
This is kind of a meta moment, but the queen
is played by Alexandra Dowling who played

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.190
Roslin Frey in the red wedding episode on
Game of Thrones.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.430
All I could think was this is not going to
end well.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.620
I know in canon her character is totally safe,
but if David bradley ever guest stars everybody

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.880
start to worry.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.850
On the show her husband Ryan Gage is the king,
but he’s also alfrid from the desolation

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.850
of smaug.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.320
Both of those characters are royal douchebags.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.140
Number 4 - Lady De Winter.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.540
Her part in the premiere is small just because
they had to introduce everything but she’s

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:30.120
played by Maimie McCoy 
from Wallander.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.670
After the cardinal and the musketeers she’s
the biggest character on the show.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.630
If you haven’t read the canon then I won’t
spoil her backstory.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.940
But the episode kind of explained why she
wanted to frame Athos.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.509
Think of her as being a cross between Cersei
Lannister and Melisandre.

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.159
Number 3 - Changes from the canon.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.680
Most of the musketeers movies that have been
made change a few things, but this version

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.799
deviates pretty early.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.040
The role of the rochefort character was given
to Go-dey.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.380
Who was killed at the end of the episode.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.490
He’s not in the credits, so maybe they’ll
introduce him later in the series.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.259
Because he’s like the colonel moran to the
cardinal’s moriarty in the canon.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:12.340
They did include dartanion trying to fight
all three of the musketeers at once though.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.829
Their famous catch phrase one for all and
all for one, won’t be part of the series

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.900
until later in the season though.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.540
As we see them now, the Musketeers.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.720
The foursome, will slowly become a unit.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.160
Number 2 - Paris 1630.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.500
I’m talking about the world of the series.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.570
I’m a huge fan of period adventure dramas
and they go a long way towards making the

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.410
environment feel very authentic.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.050
Most of my attention went to the more depressed
locations like the tavern where dartangan

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.970
meets lady dewinter and Mendoza.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.630
When the serving lady dumped the bowl of entrails
in front of him all I could think of was the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.220
Thenardiers inn from Les Miserables.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.450
Like everyone is living in extreme poverty.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.730
Interestingly enough.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.340
The final events of le mis take place almost
exactly 200 years after the events of this

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.340
series.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.300
and my Number 1 moment - Rule Number 1 the
doctor always lies.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.450
You don’t have to be a doctor who fan to
enjoy Peter Capaldi playing a villain.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.410
But it makes it so much more fun to watch
him using doctor who as context.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.750
I feel like the people of tumblr have a real
responsibility to make this mashup happen.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.160
Call me Cardinal Master Doctor Who.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.200
For anyone that’s curious, Musketeers finished
filming before capaldi was ever cast as Doctor

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.600
Who, so any references in his dialogue are
just a coincidence.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.040
But that won’t stop us from having some
fun.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.260
On the show Capaldi said that he’s worked
really hard not to make his Cardinal a traditional

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.260
villain.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.310
Like he says in the episode.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.229
Everything he does is in the best interest
of france.

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:38.389
And you can see it’s his plan to not allow
france to get swallowed up by Spain.

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.980
I haven’t seen a lot of Capaldi’s other
work outside of Torchwood and The Hour so

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.199
I’m mostly excited to try to extrapolate
the cardinal into the doctor which is still

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.720
about 8 or 9 months away.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.530
As a side note, they’ve already finished
filming series 1, but the producers have said

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.660
that they expect Capaldi’s Doctor Who commitments
won’t allow him to come back for series

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.660
2.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.560
But he could always come back in a cameos.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.030
Let me know what your favorite moment was
from the premiere.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.590
Are you a big fan of the canon and what was
the last three musketeers version you saw?

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.760
Overall I really liked it.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.160
All of the musketeers were great.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.500
Luke Pasqualino was a good protagonist. and
Maimie McCoy is going to be a lot of fun.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.750
If you’re a fan of fullmetal alchemist brotherhood.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.579
She is a good analog for Lust.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.440
One big aspect of the canon that they’ve
really turned up is the ‘shipping aspects.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.410
It’s pretty clear that d'artagnan and Bawn
ah sew are going to be shipped hard as well

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.410
as De Winter and Athos.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.790
It’s not going to be game of thrones levels
of sexposition, but I’ve seen a lot of comparisons

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.430
to the show with respect to the story structure.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.460
The Musketeers episodes are all going to be
stand alone adventures.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.640
So each week the plot will resolve itself.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.640
This week it was mostly the plot to discredit
Athos.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.150
Game of Thrones on the other hand is highly
serialized.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.460
The plot carries over from one episode to
the next.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.880
I’ll say I’m a little concerned just because
highly serialized shows tend to pay off bigger

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.880
in the end.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.650
It’s kind of deflating to know that each
week everything is going to be explained.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.410
It doesn’t leave a lot of room for anticipation.

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.190
But I’m still really excited for the rest
of the series.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.120
There’s going to be a ton of celebrity guest
stars.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.870
Jason Flemyng is going to be blowing up the
Louvre next week and Vinnie Jones is going

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.370
to play one of Peter Capaldi’s guards in
a future episode.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.783
I’ll be posting my review videos sundays
from now on.

00:05:16.783 --> 00:05:18.490
Be sure to subscribe to get everything.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.280
Eventually it’s going to be Musketeers and
Walking Dead sundays on my channel.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.810
Swords and zombies for the win.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.810
Since I won’t be doing Q&amp;A videos for the
musketeers if you have questions about the

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.570
plot or just about the series in general just
leave them in the comments and I’ll try

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.570
to answer everything there.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.221
Also as a side note, I’m thinking about
doing videos for Black Sails.

00:05:35.221 --> 00:05:41.210
So please let me know in the comments if that’s
something you guys would be interested in.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.210
Right now click here for my review of Sherlock
his last vow and click here for my spoilery

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.700
breakdown of the game of thrones trailer.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.850
There are some spoilers so be careful.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.110
Thanks for watching, see you guys tonight.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.460
High Fives!
