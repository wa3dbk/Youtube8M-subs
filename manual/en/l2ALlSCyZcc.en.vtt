00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.540
How to do a windmill into a flare.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.540
Damn!

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.740
All right, now we're going to go pick it up
a little bit more.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.660
I'm going to go through two stages.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.380
The first stage is how to do a flare from
a tabletop position or down in a kind of like

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.610
a baby-ish position.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.290
We're going to work on that real quick.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.642
Remember, I'm going to say a bunch of different
names of different moves, and most of you

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:47.252
are probably like, if this is your first time
seeing this video, you're going to be like,

00:00:47.252 --> 00:00:49.290
"What's a windmill?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.450
What's a hand glide?"

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.460
Blah, blah, blah, whatever.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.960
Make sure you see the other videos, it's very
important.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.290
We're going to be here, right here, what some
of us call a tabletop.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.560
A lot of people might have different names
for it.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.560
Don't get mad.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:11.369
So here, we're here, and basically we want
to do like a hang glide motion, and then we're

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.380
going to pick up.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.000
It's very important that you go kind of like
a spin.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.649
You want to get momentum on this in order
for you to get to a flare.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.330
I'm going to demonstrate it real quick.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.180
So here, spin, and then up.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.860
Here, spin, up to a flare.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.860
One more time.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.770
I'm going to do it.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.480
Spin, flare.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.200
All right?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.920
Practice that.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.310
It's very important you practice that a lot.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.810
You got to master that.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.920
If you could go back to a tabletop and then
do it again, that's even better.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
Let's see me do that.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.530
So here, spin, boom, there, up again.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.700
We going to, keep doing that.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.200
If you can do it ten times, good.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.259
Now, let's do the windmill.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.810
This time, we're going to use our head.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.290
There are different ways to get from a windmill
to a flare, but I'm going to show you what

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.680
I believe is the easiest way.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:19.230
I'm going to do a windmill, and then as soon
as we get back to the pilot position, or tabletop,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.410
I'm going to slide on my head, and do the
hang glide position again, but I'm sliding

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.410
on my head.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.220
And then when I'm ready, I'm going to push
up into a flare.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.829
Here we go.

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:38.129
So windmill first, pilot, spin, up.

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.440
All right?

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.390
Do it again.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.150
Windmill, up, flare.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:03:08.040
Now, I'm going to do it all out.
