00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.336
The President: Hello, everybody.
 Twenty five years ago this

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.972
month our nation came
together and took another

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:08.675
bold step for equality
and opportunity with the

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.577
Americans with
Disabilities Act.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.146
It was one of the greatest
civil rights triumphs

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.348
in our history.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:18.084
Like all milestones it was
the culmination of many

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:22.055
years of struggle by those who
marched, organized,  and refused

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.591
to be treated as
second class citizens.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.228
And on this anniversary we
honor all of the Americans

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.508
who made this
progress possible.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.934
Of course as with any great
movement, the work goes on.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.960
That's why as President
I've made sure that we're

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.340
continuing to invest in the
education, community living,

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.060
training, and employment of
Americans with disabilities.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.446
We're proud to have more
people with disabilities

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.749
working in federal service
than in any time in

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:51.351
three decades.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.686
We've set new rules that
require federal contractors

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:55.455
to develop strategies
to hire people with

00:00:55.455 --> 00:01:00.059
disabilities because they have
so much to offer our country.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.429
And thanks to the Affordable
Care Act Americans with

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.998
pre-existing conditions
including those with

00:01:04.998 --> 00:01:07.618
disabilities cannot
be denied coverage.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.104
Today there's a whole
new generation of young

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.007
Americans with disabilities
who have only known life

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:15.975
with the ADA.

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:18.878
They call themselves "the
ADA generation," after a law

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.981
that strove to make good on
the promise of America a

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.417
promise that belongs
to all of us.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:27.954
That isn't confided to any
one race or class or group.

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:30.123
These Americans inherited
the story of the

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:32.258
Disabilities Rights movement
and they continue to write

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:33.178
it today.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:37.464
The lives of this ADA
generation are not free of

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.233
obstacles or hardships but
they are testament to what's

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.536
possible when as a nation we
keep striving to fulfill our

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.438
founding ideals.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:48.975
And on this 25th anniversary
they're an inspiration to

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.946
all of us to rededicate
ourselves to this cause to

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:55.715
make real our enduring
commitment to equality,

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:58.918
dignity, and opportunity
of every American.
