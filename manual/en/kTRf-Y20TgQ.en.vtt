00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:06.561
Jeff Zients:
So Trudy is the winner,
but Trudy's idea,

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:09.661
which is going to save millions
of dollars, is one of 18,000

00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:11.761
different ideas that
was submitted through

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.828
the SAVE Award contest.

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.828
176,000 votes were cast.

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:19.094
To figure out what the
very best ideas are,

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.728
many of these ideas are going
to be hardwired into the

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:25.661
President's budget and will be
implemented in the coming years.

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:29.594
Eric Holder:
I thought the idea was superb
and one that in some ways is

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.161
obvious but in many
ways is ingenious.

00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:37.194
Jeff Zients:
Trudy recognized that every
week a paper copy arrived at

00:00:37.194 --> 00:00:41.328
her office delivered via U.S.
mail of the Federal Register.

00:00:41.328 --> 00:00:42.594
Trudy Givens:
When I first started
working with them,

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:45.761
we used them because there
wasn't an online base,

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.161
but now we still receive them,
and the Federal Registers is

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:50.361
all online now.

00:00:50.361 --> 00:00:52.161
It's easily accessible
to look things up,

00:00:52.161 --> 00:00:54.695
and by the time we
get the hard copy,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:57.328
we've already researched
what we need to see.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:59.594
Jeff Zients:
Even more importantly than
the individual ideas is a

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:01.261
change of culture.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.461
The President meeting with Trudy
today sends a real signal to the

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:07.895
federal workforce that the
President believes that the

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:11.528
best ideas for improving
efficiency, saving money,

00:01:11.528 --> 00:01:13.227
making the government
more effective,

00:01:13.227 --> 00:01:14.761
exist on the frontline.

00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:17.428
And that culture change, where
there's a recognition that

00:01:17.428 --> 00:01:21.061
that's where the best ideas are,
is the most sustainable way to

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.361
improvement government service.

00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:27.161
President Obama:
So, if I'm not mistaken, guys,
we could have saved about 500

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.027
bucks on this thing?

00:01:28.027 --> 00:01:31.061
Jeff Zients:
Absolutely, and then this idea
applied to other things we mail

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.695
for no reason could be to
tens of millions of dollars.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:35.594
President Obama:
Tens of millions of dollars
that we could end up saving.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:40.761
So, you know, your mom,
she just has common sense.

00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:43.428
Trudy Givens:
It's really encouraging that
Washington is, you know,

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:45.928
requesting and implementing
some of these ideas,

00:01:45.928 --> 00:01:48.728
because what we see every day
isn't something that people in

00:01:48.728 --> 00:01:50.194
Washington are seeing.

00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:51.494
Eric Holder:
We are trying to get leaner.

00:01:51.494 --> 00:01:53.528
We are trying to
become more efficient.

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:55.428
Something that seems
relatively small,

00:01:55.428 --> 00:01:58.494
if replicated over the
full length of the federal

00:01:58.494 --> 00:02:01.628
government, can really result
in pretty substantial savings,

00:02:01.628 --> 00:02:04.494
and this is exactly the kind of
award that I think will help

00:02:04.494 --> 00:02:08.061
generate that spirit among the
great federal employees that we

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:11.261
have, who I think, you know, are
inclined to operate in that way,

00:02:11.261 --> 00:02:12.294
in any case.

00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:14.528
Trudy Givens:
As a business administrator,
I kind of scrutinize, you know,

00:02:14.528 --> 00:02:17.528
purchases and look for the most
economical ways to spend the

00:02:17.528 --> 00:02:20.861
taxpayer money, and it's
just been really a wonderful

00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:22.761
experience to see
that the people up

00:02:22.761 --> 00:02:25.027
in Washington are listening.
