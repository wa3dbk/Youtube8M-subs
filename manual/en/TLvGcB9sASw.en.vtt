00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:09.019
A lot of people don't realize that they do
science in everyday life just by seeing a

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.169
problem and figuring out they're asking the
question "why is this happening?" and then

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.460
testing it somehow and determining "okay this
is why the problem is occurring, this is what

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.730
we can do to fix it." That's the scientific
method and everybody does it. The beauty of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.960
the scientific method is first of all we observe
the environment. And from those observations

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:43.530
we come up with questions. And from those
questions we come up with possible answers

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:53.370
to those questions, a hypothesis or hypotheses. And then we create tests to test those hypotheses to

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:01.730
see if they are indeed correct or not. In
order to test a hypothesis, we collect data,

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.200
analyze that data, and then come up with a
conclusion on whether or not our hypothesis

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.350
was correct or was it close or was it incorrect.
Everyday we will have things that come up

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.270
that don't work exactly right. We know how
we think it should work, but when we do our

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.770
work we look at the results and we say, "that's
not the way it happened yesterday. What happened

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.979
here?" And then we go back and we've made
extensive notes as to who did what, what time

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:44.240
it was done, what procedure was followed,
and we also make notes if we notice anything

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.340
that is not the same as it was the day before.
Paleontology, like any other science, has

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.079
to follow strict rigorous methods to be truly
scientific. It is possible to speculate about

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.610
things and have a lot of fun doing that but
if there is no scientific rigor in it, then

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.390
its really not a very important avenue of
thought or exercise. What I mean by scientific

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.760
rigor is that a strict hypothesis needs to
be formulated, data has to be acquired, and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.500
then you test your hypothesis against that
data. So that's what the scientific process

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.260
is. This initial research of the problem, the
formulation of hypothesis, the testing of

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.680
the hypothesis, and gathering concluding something
out of your work. People often think we go

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.200
out and we try to find fossils to prove our
ideas and that's absolutely the wrong way

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.210
to look at it. What we do is we set up a hypothesis
and we go out and find fossils that disprove

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.490
our ideas. Hypotheses in science have to be
falsifiable. That means you set up a hypothesis

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.430
that, if you find the right piece of data,
its going to knock your whole idea down and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.740
you have to start again from scratch. The
way science works, and paleontology as well,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.950
is you start with an idea, you test that idea
over and over again, and if you can't overturn

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.010
it you have developed more confidence that
you're on the right track.
