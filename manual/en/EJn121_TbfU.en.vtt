Hello friends. Today we are in the bathroom
because I want to show you how to fix the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.900
toilet tank when no longer get away
Water. In addition, we will learn to open

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:24.199
a cistern with dual flush. The others
They are very easy to open, because they will thread

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.630
but they have dual flush trick. Come on
go for it. Well: the first thing we will

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.579
do is a screwdriver
on the pushers. Smallest first

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.870
and then the larger. Here we find
a bolt connecting the lid, the unloader

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.359
and the bezel. We raised a little and
we can remove the bezel. When lifting

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:56.410
Top we find a piece that is the downloader
and it is that is giving us problems.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.239
Rotate it as if he were a little thread,
until it "click". You can catch one

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.020
bit, but it's easy. The circular piece
see here is the one with the rubber. Go to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.690
the plumbing shop with complete piece
for they give the exact rubber to be

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:28.970
change. Once you changed turn back to put
Downloader, You place the cover. We put

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:48.590
everything in reverse order've done before.
We again bezel, and
Now tighten the screw and place the button.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.910
I forgot to say that you must have
water logically closed and check before

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:04.650
closing that has solved the problem.
As you can see is very simple, and does not cost too

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.900
time. It is done.
