00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
in this video we're going to cover the
basics of getting started with Windows 10.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.660
When you first turn on a Windows 10
computer you'll see the lock screen.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.509
Just click the mouse or press any button on the keyboard to unlock, then choose a

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.449
user account and enter your password.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.980
You should have been prompted this setup this account the very first time you

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.010
used Windows 10. Once you've signed in,
the desktop will appear. This is the main

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.640
workspace your computer and it's where
you'll open programs, access files, and a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.350
whole lot more. For example, to open an
application, just click the Start button

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.440
in the lower left corner of the screen,
then choose the app you want.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.050
If you don't see the app you're looking for, click All apps to see a full list or

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.030
choose one of the tiles on the right. In
this example I'm going to open Microsoft Edge.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.260
Just like previous versions of
Windows, you'll click the X in the upper

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.120
right corner to close the app. Now if
you're looking for faster method, you can

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.390
try searching for an app instead. To do
this, click the Start button or press the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.970
Windows key on your keyboard then start
typing. For example, if you wanted to open

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.640
PowerPoint, you could click the start
button and then start typing "PowerPoint".

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.009
It should be the first result that
appears. Another method is to use the

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.180
File Explorer, which you can open from
this icon on the taskbar. From here you

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.450
can navigate to any file or folder on
your computer, including any files that

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.119
are stored in your OneDrive. As with any
computer, it's important to know how to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.259
change your settings if necessary. To do
this, just click the Start button then

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.790
click Settings. The Settings app will appear, and from here you can change lots

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.180
of different things about your computer, like your desktop background,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.500
user accounts, and a whole lot more.
Now if you're used to using the Control Panel

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.610
like in previous versions of Windows, you
can still access it but it's sort of hidden.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.130
To open the Control Panel, just click
the Start button and then start typing

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.070
"Control Panel"

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.539
it should appear at the top of the
search results. From here you can use the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.990
Control Panel to adjust lots of different
settings on your computer and those that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.270
can't be adjusted from here will direct
you back to the Settings app.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.070
Finally, when you're done using your computer, it's important to turn it off correctly,

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:29.040
or at least put it into sleep mode. To do
this. click the Start button, select Power,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.900
then choose Shut down.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.100
OK, so those are the basics and they should be enough to help you get started with Windows 10.
