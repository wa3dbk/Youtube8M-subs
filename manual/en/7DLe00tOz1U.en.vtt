Hello there, this is Lynn Allen.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.840
Welcome to another AutoCAD tip, courtesy of
the fabulous Cadalyst magazine.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.100
As you can see, I'm coming to you from yet
another hotel room.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.060
This time in Phoenix, Arizona, and it's about
110 degrees outside.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.150
So I'm happy to be inside.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.930
Yay, air conditioning.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.320
Today I'm going to share two tips that I think
you'll find valuable and be able to use.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.891
The first tip has to do with something so
simple -- just drawing an arc.

00:00:35.891 --> 00:00:40.430
I'm going to go into the Arc command, and
I'm going to do the Center option because

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.549
it's the best way to show this.

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:47.750
Now as you know through the years, the Arc
command loves to draw arcs that are counterclockwise.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.430
When you try to draw it clockwise, it's like
"Oh no, it's not going to go like that."

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.629
It always wants to draw it counterclockwise.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.739
Really cool feature that was put in a couple
of releases ago is the ability to override

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:03.739
that command.

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.350
By holding down the Ctrl key, AutoCAD will
let you break that rule.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.850
Now I can draw an arc that is clockwise.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.780
It's something that if nobody tell you about,
you're never going to know.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.259
Very, very simple.

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.149
Let it go, and it goes back to counterclockwise.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.979
That's my first tip.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950
Don't forget that when you are drawing an
arc.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.640
Of course, over the years, people have managed
to get around that.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.190
Now you don't have to.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.920
The other feature, also put in a couple of
releases ago, is the ability to fillet an

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.999
open polyline to itself.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:41.880
Now in the past, if I tried to fillet an open
polyline to itself, AutoCAD would once again

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.969
be like, "Oh, no.

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:44.340
It's not going to go like that."

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.710
Bossy AutoCAD.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.679
I'm going to show you what I'm talking about.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.570
Another thing that if nobody tells you about
this feature, you are just going to continue

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.649
to think that it's not available and can't
do it.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.390
You can see this polyline, isn't it cute.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.299
I'm going to go into the Fillet command and
very simply select the two endpoint there.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.100
It doesn't matter if they are polyarcs or
straight polylines, I can now easily go in

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.440
and fillet that open polyline to itself.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.440
Double awesome!

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.849
So there you learned two tips that I hope
you'll be able to apply.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.310
Thank you so much for joining me.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.260
I'll see you back here in two more weeks.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.150
Peace out.
