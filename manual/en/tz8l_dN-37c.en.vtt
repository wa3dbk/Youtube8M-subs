00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.720
the idea of a personal computer
invulnerable to any form of attack is

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.360
just plain silly

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.419
for many years Mac users prided
themselves not having to worry about malware.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.879
they believed they were invulnerable to
any of the nasty stuff floating around

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.140
the net

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.999
Or on floppy disks in the old days.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:24.079
Remember these?

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.310
Even apple themselves on more than one
occasion defended this idea.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.070
There may have been a grain of truth to
this way in the past when Macs were few

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.760
compared to Windows PCs.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.150
It never really made economic sense for
the bad guys to target a minority system

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.990
so the myth that they were impervious

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.230
persisted.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.870
Unfortunately, for Mac users

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.150
Apples became cool.  Ah,not those
apples. Sorry,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.390
iMac, Mac mini, Macbooks, Macbook Air - the
growth in market share has meant that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.920
Apples desirable computers and the Mac
iOS operating system

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.810
have become tasty little treats for the online
criminals of today. Malware for Macs is nothing

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.600
new.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
In fact, back in 1982
the first-ever PC virus was for the Mac not the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.170
Windows PC

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.910
The "Elk cloner" from 1982 for the Apple 2E did no real harm just

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.080
replicate itself, on and off.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.490
As technology evolved, so did the
malware that take for example the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.130
flashback twenty three two thousand and
flashbacks version exploits the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.479
vulnerability in oracle's java software

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.820
which allowed it to install itself from
an invisible without even requesting you

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.020
to tap into the classroom

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.600
the victim simply have to visit to the
malicious or complex twisting max around

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.530
the world under the control of criminals
have been a giant pumpkins

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.250
every one of those victims was at risk
of having their personal information

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.889
stolen to be traded on the criminal
underground

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:53.140
becoming victims identity theft

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.130
some say the battles built-in
protections enough

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.090
flashback among others

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.040
says it's not

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.790
it's true that recently apple changed a
security philosophy from safeguard

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.930
rotated budget nothing too

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.750
dual right think regardless flashback
trojan affected more than six hundred

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.790
thousand computers

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.609
got that right

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.269
this complacency leaves many mac users
with mistaken belief that i the maximal

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.130
bulletin allen or that none exists for
their platform will boast

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.550
impacting their ability to make informed
decisions when downloading or installing

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.329
the software

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.459
opening attachments of visiting
questionable sites

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.719
hence the need for security program
automatic

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:43.069
saying that just a few years back but it
has a friend snorting into that detracts

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.939
pediatrician machines

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.949
even now it might raise a drive smile in
some quarters

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:54.469
but the way winter is coming

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:58.019
over ninety seven percent of mac users
are not protected by any kind of

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.709
security software

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.889
but if the two-and-a-half percent that
off

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:06.229
ninety seven percent of those rely on
trend micro and online criminals are

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:07.859
targeting mac o_s_

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.249
and they don't care if you believe it or
not think about it

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.299
i'm reporting from trend micro

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:13.659
thanks for watching
