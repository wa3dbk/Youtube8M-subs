Heirloom Frames

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.230
Hi, I'm Monica Rich Kosann, I'm a photographer
and a designer

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.039
I like to think of myself

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:16.099
as being in the memory business I capture
people's memories and document their lives

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.689
and I like to work with them and teach them
how to display their memories

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.199
when you walk into a pottery barn you know
that their philosophy is all about surrounding

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:25.749
yourself

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:28.840
with the things that you adore and cherish

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.530
and it's all about making memories for your
family and for your friends

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.170
and my philosophy for my collection is very
similar to that

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.680
and that's why I'm so excited to be creating
this airline collection for pottery barn

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.960
because it's all about living with the things that we
love

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.510
in the early nineteen hundreds there was a great
artistic accessory

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.320
luxurious accessories going on in the world
and those were the

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.680
cigarette cases and the powder compacts and jewelry
and they were all very personal and every piece

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.470
that

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.690
anybody owned

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.920
was for you it was a piece of art

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.499
and what I would do is I would actually take
the old powder out and I would cut

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:11.600
the photographs out and put them into

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.200
the powder compacts

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.369
and then I was give them to my clients as gifts
and what I loved about them is that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.680
these were heirlooms

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.130
in an heirloom

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.920
and that's kind of how it started because
it was just a beautiful way to keep a memory

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:25.990
to hold

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.420
a friend or a family member close and dear to
you

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.860
and that's the inspiration for the heirloom
collection and what's great is that they sit

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.310
beautifully with

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.829
all different types of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.840
collectibles. They sit beautifully with candles
they sit beautifully grouped together on a tray

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.949
they sit beautifully

00:01:43.949 --> 00:01:49.460
in a bedroom they sit beautifully on a desk
and friends and family are so important and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.540
you know we all worked so hard in

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.790
and this is such a fast world we live in and I feel by sitting
down

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.030
and by feeling nostalgic and looking

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.090
at a group of photos and heirloom pieces this is a
way to ground you and make you connect

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.070
to your family and your background and your
culture

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.439
if you buy some of the pieces from the heirloom
collection, you take them home

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.849
and you put your family photos in them they
become a cherished piece for your family they

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.439
become an heirloom for you

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.849
and I it's just great it's
like the pieces of the past

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.019
and something that you can keep in your family
forever
