00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.750
Brothers and sisters.
It is a brand new day.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.130
About five minutes ago,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.700
the Global Defense Initiative
lost contact with a little

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.490
orbital carrier they
like to call the Methuselah.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.140
And in exactly three minutes,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.860
they will lose contact with
the city of Chicago.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.810
I am going to cut the head

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.780
off the monster and bleed it out.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.590
I will drink deep,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.180
I will make this moral sacrifice
for you.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.950
I wish I could do this
in the name of Kane,

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.200
like my father before me.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.010
But I will not kill in the
name of a traitor.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.060
I will kill in the name of NOD.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.930
Captain, we are confirmed! The
Methuselah is on an impact course with...

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.930
I heard the kid, Lieutenant.
Kelly, I need intercept heading now.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.640
I have got the Methuselah's commander
on the line.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.850
Put him through.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.460
- Is this Captain Pierce?
- Commander, what is your situation?

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.400
We have got the whole ship, but
they have got the bridge locked down.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.140
Can you get on the
shipâ€™s internal coms?

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.390
The loudspeakers?
Absolutely, sir.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.360
Do it. Order a shipwide evac.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.640
- But we are dropping into atmo
- You are getting thrown at a city.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.930
Order the evac.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.400
- Yes, sir.
- Shipwide coms.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.760
You are on, sir.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.200
This is the Captain.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.160
You heard that Nod coward.
He is throwing our own rocks at us.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.110
But I am not letting him
take out our home.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.770
I am ordering a shipwide evacuation.
Effective immediately.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.040
It is been a pleasure serving
with you.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.010
Sir, what is going on?

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.380
Get in the escape pods.
That is an order.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.970
- You are scuttling the ship?
- No.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.200
I am saving Chicago.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.040
Christian?

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.250
Christian, do you hear me?

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.520
Do not got a lot of time,
Madame Gen-Sec.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.260
Dammit, Christian, what the hell
do you think you are doing?

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.650
Has the Methuselah launched
it is escape pods?

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.220
- Every one!
- Good.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.490
I need you to authorize
the kennedy's auto-destruct.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.870
Captain, you are not authorized
to scuttle the Kennedy!

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.590
You have to stop the carrier...

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.620
- Do not worry about the carrier.
- That is it!

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.660
- I am activating the Ion Cannon...
- Evelyn! Please!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.960
- Self destruct sequence initialized.
- Just trust me.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.460
Ion reactor overload detected.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.550
Complete core breach in 5...

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.760
4... 3... 2... 1...

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.330
Look at you. Right on time.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.090
I knew you had come.
I knew it, you know?

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.250
And here you are. A little banged up,
but hey. Beggers can not be choosers.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:39.820
Chicago...

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.640
is it...

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.210
You are wondering about
your little billiards move?

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.200
Yeah, it worked.
8-ball corner pocket.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.270
Good job. Congrats.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.030
You killed my plan!
You wasted my money!

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.050
You wasted my time!
I should kill you.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.300
- Chri... st...
- What?

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:01.720
Christian...

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.240
Pierce...

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.980
Captain Christian Pierce,

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.690
Global Defense Initiative.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.930
ID number 2201824.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.070
Stationed aboard the
Support Carrier Kennedy.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.460
Oh... no. Sorry.
That is not entirely true.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.450
Fact is, Captain...

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.140
You work for me, now.
