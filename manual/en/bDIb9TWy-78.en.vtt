00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.089
Now

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.400
this is a wonderful demonstration of

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.840
what I love about martial arts

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.619
and martial artists. I was at the mixed
martial arts Expo in Toronto and I was

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.529
scheduled to do a demonstration

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.760
on a Sunday morning and my students, who were going to

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.570
help me out with a demonstration, were
unable to make it.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.059
So, the martial arts school in front of
me,

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.149
"Lanna MMA and Kickboxing,"

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.710
they were doing a demonstration ahead of me and were

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.770
planning to quit when my turn came along
and I just said, "Well, I don't have any

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.820
students to demonstrate on. So,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.120
you folks may as well just continue

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.920
and do the demonstration."; and the chief
instructor there

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.180
said, "Well, would you like to moral one of
my students?"

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.960
I said, "Well that would be very kind
of you!

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.059
"Are you sure that's okay?" He said, "Sure" and he just

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.270
pointed to one of his senior students and said, "You're learning Tai chi.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:13.220
Get out on the mat." Now, I have never
trained with this particular club. I've

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.400
seen them do their demonstrations but
I've never visited their school

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.439
I'm and not a kickboxer myself.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.369
I didn't know much about their
lineage and they didn't know much about

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:23.930
me.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.150
But they though enough of me to

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.970
respect why I was there and what I was
doing.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.390
and if you watch, this is the second
demonstration we did that day.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.479
This is one of the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.259
assistant instructors from Lanna MMA

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.740
and look at how

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.579
good-natured he is and so very nice

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.060
and relaxed.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.509
He gives a really good honest
application

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.740
and its at no point

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.979
does he let his ego get in the way.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.920
At no point does he worry about whether
or not he could kick my butt.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.330
Instead he just make sure that he

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.349
gives me the opportunity to demonstrate
my skill.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.680
and without trying

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.340
too hard to make me look bad. In fact, he

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580
makes me look pretty good in a couple
places.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.920
There is something about martial arts. 
You find that

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.319
the more skill that people have the
better they get

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.830
and the better quality of skill that you
find

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.750
at a martial arts studio or martial arts
school....

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.760
the nicer the people are. In fact, you can
judge

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.420
the quality a school's martial
arts

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.209
by the character of their students and by
the personalities of

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.090
the instructors. Because nobody who has
anything worth teaching

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.010
is going to waste their time teaching
somebody

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.069
who is it worth it. Nobody is going to
waste their time teaching a jerk.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.060
Not only that, but in order to master
martial arts

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.200
you need to master yourself. This is
not just

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.760
and idealistic principle this is a very
practical thing.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.590
Every time there's a thought there's an
emotion. every time there's an emotion there is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.790
a physical response.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.959
So, people who master martial arts

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.659
have to work through their own "stuff." So,
there's no room for

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:32.510
fear, hatred, or anger, ego, or anything

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.970
on the floor. Everyone has to be paying
very close attention to very fine

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:37.730
details

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.500
and constantly respecting their training
partner, because if you break your

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.810
partner, you don't get another one.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.349
So, here's a fine example a really

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.209
obviously a wonderful martial arts
school. Now I didn't know

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.349
much about them until I did these demos.
I just seen them do their demonstration

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.170
in the past.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.319
So, when I finally got around to checking
out

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.629
who these people were who very kindly
volunteered

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.420
to help me out with my demonstration,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.030
I found out that the chief instructor,
Kru Mel Bellissimo,

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.320
trained in Thailand with a very famous
Muay Thai

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.340
master named,  and I'll see if I can
say this

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.630
properly,  Ajahn Burklerk Pinsinchai.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.820
Now, he is referred to as the Mohammed Ali

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.729
of Muay Thai. So, my point is that

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.750
these very nice people

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.160
could have shown me up very easily

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.810
and I certainly wouldn't want to
get into the ring with any of them

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.440
and yet here you would think that I was

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.100
some great martial arts master just
because all the way to they're

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.240
helping me out with this
demonstration so it

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.620
bears my point. The better a martial arts
school - the nicer the people,

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.169
and the higher the level of skill -

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:13.169
the nicer the personalities of the
instructors.

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:25.729
 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:40.100
