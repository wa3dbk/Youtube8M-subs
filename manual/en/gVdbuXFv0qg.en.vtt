00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.319
there's david beckham and she asked and
david packard dot com this is a really

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.420
cool story in northern inuit in a small
honor you know that we can call it it's

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.799
how night is a small phillips called he
didn't know

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:12.570
it's not

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.119
the way that the town is situated in
this is a a couple hundred german

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.890
buddhist live here

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.039
there's eighty three days from november
eleventh of february second where the

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.400
sun disappears altogether now this is it
like being in the north pole where

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.130
there's literally no day it's simply
that because of the angle in the

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.000
placement of the town no sunlight
reaches anywhere in the town

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.250
they've decided to install a hundred
thousand euro

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.190
but a hundred and forty thousand dollars
which will redirect sunlight into the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.560
village and will actually give them
uh... sunlight throughout this period of

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.090
time where they normally wouldn't get it
says you can see on this graph if you're

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.640
watching the way that the sun angle
comes across you simply don't get any

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.140
sunlight down in the village they're
gonna put a mere overhear which will

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.910
redirect light down

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.510
this is unjust it interesting for a
number of reasons number one is that's

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.740
uh... it's innovative and and its it's
interesting just kind of a face value

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.570
but the other thing is let's think about
that would be curious

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.740
if you think about this place only has a
hundred an eighty five residents of this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.460
may not be the best example but we could
foci do it

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.670
hundred and forty thousand dollar mir

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.939
i wonder how much in health care costs
will be saved over the life of that near

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.400
by having sunlight

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.080
rights are number one if you talk about
seasonal depression

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.650
this is certainly going to be mitigated
by having reflected sunlight in the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.430
village

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.460
how much in health care costs are you
going to save in terms of whether it be

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.299
people they get bad enough that they
need to be medicated or therapy or

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.030
whatever it is again with a hundred
eighty five people

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.659
it may be years before you make that up
but if you think about the town of

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.989
five thousand a ten thousand with a
hundred and forty thousand dollar mare

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:52.290
you may be thinking about something else
altogether

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.319
do we know is this mirror in reflecting
sunlight also reflects

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.130
the vitamin d there's absorbed from the
sun do we know that

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.120
i don't know naye suma dot so i would
assume it doesn't sound by assume it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.500
does i just don't go away what you're
saying this would be useful for in a

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.010
town or a city that doesn't have this
shadow no i'm saying in in if the town

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.980
were bigger and it had this shadow
problem right the cost of the mirror

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.600
itself could be easily be made up for

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.370
by the health and lights of having the
some although if you look at the town if

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.960
it were to slightly bigger the bigger
area would be outside of the area that

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.280
under the shadow nosair will decide this
hypothetical i'm not saying it more

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.690
people lived here but if you applied
this artificial sunlight so that it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.329
gives us at the broader question which
is how else

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.279
ken modifying the natural climate or
lighting

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:45.909
affect health and we know as we know
about health issues for people who work

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.349
night she makeshift since it during the
day and we know about health issues for

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.779
people who live in places where you
might have months at a time with no

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.489
daytime at all so i think that this just
opens up a lot of interesting things

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.299
uh... and i know wards ramirez are
expensive equipment yourself

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.139
pieced together

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:03.909
squalor mayors

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:04.760
save some money

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.099
well abort wouldn't those mirrors
together and the connecting of them have

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.989
cost about a hundred thousand euro
anyway i mean i think it's it down i

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.310
think what i said on the computer
operated to move uh...

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.300
as the sun moves throughout the day that
ricardo alarcon via computer out here

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.260
about twenty thinkin computer operator
yeah

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.519
this is a serious there

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.349
tilts with uh... with the sun ok yep
itself interesting story i wonder how

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.599
else aka a sunlight can be modified for
health benefits

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:31.079
the question
