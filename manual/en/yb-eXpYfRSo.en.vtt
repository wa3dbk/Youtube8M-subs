00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So what you're saying is

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.500
this is literally the most WTF item we've ever done

00:00:06.413 --> 00:00:08.413
[WTF music]

00:00:08.413 --> 00:00:10.413
*sigh* I'm so lonely

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.280
Martina is out getting her eyelashes done

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.380
and what am I going to do here by myself?

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.840
oh, hello there

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.920
are you here for me?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.340
Thank you for coming

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.000
lap-pillow

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.800
so we found this thing on g-market

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.020
and we thought this was equivalent to Beshall

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.240
If you remember from a while ago

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.440
the boyfriend man pillow

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.840
which is the torso and the arm you can snuggle against

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.780
that's for women

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
men, we don't care about upper-torsos

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.780
all we care about is lower torsos

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.780
so here I have the lap pillow

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.360
which is supposed to be a girl's legs

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.060
in a skirt

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.060
and you can see her terrifying feet

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.060
flaying in the back right here

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.060
it's supposed to be like she is "on her knees"

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.280
and I'm supposed to use it as a "pillow"

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.280
now I want to warn you

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.920
this item right here might not be very family-friendly 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920
so the things I'm about to say

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.340
might not be appropriate for your children

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.740
so please unless you've taught them all about sex

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.820
and perversions

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.980
get them out of here

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.000
so the number one question I have with this is: where am I supposed to put my p*nis?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.440
oh, it's not one of those things?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.540
Ok, so I'm just...

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.260
oh... God I looked up the skirt

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.760
the last one was Beshall

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.260
this one is Bertha

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140
Hello Bertha, say hello to the audience

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.640
hi, my name is Bertha

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.840
why do you sound like Spudgy?

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.420
oh this video would be so much better if my wife was here

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.840
so I'm supposed to try to rest on this pillow

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.500
In a way that's somewhat appropriate for YouTube videos

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Hello there, Bertha

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
let me see how comfortable you are

00:01:28.093 --> 00:01:30.093
oh, this is surprisingly comfortable

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:31.453
I don't want this to be comfortable

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.260
because I don't want this in the studio after I'm done shooting this video

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.820
but Bertha I think you and I might actually get along quite well

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.820
what am I supposed to do with this thing?

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.920
I feel so uncomfortable

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.920
Please Bertha keep your skirt down

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.520
we've got people watching 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.520
Can we get a blanket for Bertha's legs?

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.140
This is like one of those Kpop interviews in which you have idols coming and you gotta put blankets over they skirts

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
stop perving on Bertha

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.020
you guys are gross

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.860
Thank you Leigh

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.520
a cookie blanket. There you go

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.920
Why don't you introduce yourself, Bertha?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.680
You can't coz you don't have a mouth

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.860
or functioning lungs

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.220
Iloah corporation toy house

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.720
If I was a little child

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.080
and I went into a toy house 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.540
like "mommy I want a teddy bear"

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540
"mommy ooh let me get that giant totoro"

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.140
"mommy let me get that... lower torso of a woman in her mini-skirt"

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.280
This is not appropriate for a toy house

00:02:15.287 --> 00:02:16.967
oh yeah

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:18.967
oh Bertha

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:21.147
Bertha why are your legs so firm, do you work out?

00:02:21.147 --> 00:02:22.947
Must be all that pilates

00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:24.987
I think I might even use this as a neck pillow

00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:26.567
this could easily rap around my neck

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.715
and I'm sure everybody on the airplane would be totally ok with this

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:31.155
does anybody actually use this in public?

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.400
Hey, how may of you actually own this item right here?

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.000
let us know in the comments 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.180
I want to know...

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.680
no you know what never mind

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.560
I don't want to know what uses you have for this thing

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.980
let's just keep that at that

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.100
I think this is the perfect item for somebody's bachelor party

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.820
here you go

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.620
you can sleep on Bertha's legs

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.100
if you want to buys this lovely item

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.100
you can get it on Gmarket

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.100
I wonder how many colors Bertha comes in

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.100
SooooooZeeeeee

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.360
was there only one color?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.480
There was only one color for Bertha

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.900
But I can see right now with this video

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.080
There is going to be a whole expansion line of different Berthas

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.800
blue skirts

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.800
what about darker legs perhaps?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.300
What happens if you're not into pale thighs?

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.380
Bertha seriously

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.340
I could wrap my whore arm around your thigh

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.620
Bertha probably weighs 80lbs if she had the rest of her body with her

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.100
I feel like this awkward version of "whose line is anyways"

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.600
and every single way I use this prop

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.620
Is going to be inappropriate and banned for TV

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.620
that's it for this week's Wonderful Treasure Find

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.060
Can't wait for my wife to come back

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.060
Duckyyyyyy

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.280
Stop making me do these videos by myself

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.460
Oh Bertha

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.860
What the hell is going on here?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.700
what is this?

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.480
Who is that?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.460
Baby it's not what it looks like

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.960
no, really, you don't know

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.140
Bertha what have you done?

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.140
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!???

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.740
Oh penguin...
