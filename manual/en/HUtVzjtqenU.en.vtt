00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.430
In this series we're going to be learning
how to draw a variety, a very wide variety,

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.940
of medieval weapons. We're going to start
with the first couple of clips, learning how

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.860
to draw different types of swords. First of
which is going to be the famous long sword.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:25.460
We're going to come right here in the middle
and we're going to start by drawing the handle.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:37.110
The handle for a long sword is quite, for
lack of a better word, long itself. It's supposed

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:47.159
to be because the overall design is supposed
to. A long sword is meant to have a long piece

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:56.480
right here to, basically, I think, it's all
about protecting the sword owners hand. What

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.290
we're going to do is I'm going to show you
how to draw a character holding each one of

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.350
these designs that we do. This will be the
top portion of one of the hands and since

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.260
this sword is meant to be held with two hands,
immediately underneath the first one, we're

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:22.940
going to draw a thumb and then a set of fingers
here, as well. And in a way someone would

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:34.520
hold this sword, like this one, would be,
it's got a very long handle so you can get

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:47.320
a good grip on it. Come in here and draw the
base like that and then working our way up

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.860
the handle here, you draw a little bit of
texture there. Basically, since it is your

00:01:50.860 --> 00:02:00.590
sword you can pretty much do whatever you
like with the handle design, don't feel limited.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.740
Basically, use your imagination, just the
one thing you want to keep in mind is the

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:13.700
handle has got to be very long and you want
to make that very clear. It is a long sword,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.850
it has that name for a reason, the blade and
the handle, both quite long. Add as much detail

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:32.349
as you'd like and then what we'll do, once
we have the handle down, we'll come out here

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.550
and we'll draw the blade. The blade doesn't
necessarily have to be very wide. Learning

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.810
how to draw swords is a great way to learn
how to draw straight lines and one way to

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.650
do that is keep your eyes on where you want
the line to end up, I know that's a trick

00:02:46.650 --> 00:03:01.130
you all have heard. Drawing up, to draw the
point, like so. One way, when you're drawing

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.099
a sword if you want to draw a lot of detail
and really make the sword stand out, a good

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.959
way to do that is show the width and depth
of the blade itself. Since this blade is not,

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.080
it is a flat blade but it's not completely
flat, one way to do that, to give it a little

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.800
bit of a third dimension, is to draw a line
right up the middle like this so you can clearly

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:28.629
see the blade and its thickness and just how,
generally, how big it is, in relation to the

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:41.770
hands that we've drawn right here.
That's how someone might hold it. There you

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.530
go, you have the long sword and this one is
your standard knight and shining armor, charging

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.450
the dragon or defeating the evil knight, type
sword. It's very big and heavy though so whenever

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.060
you draw it, make sure you make it so the
character's holding out with both hands, otherwise,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.599
it just won't be believable. This is your
Excalibur or blade like that. Now, if you

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.849
got that one down and you might like your
design, let's move on to another type of sword.
