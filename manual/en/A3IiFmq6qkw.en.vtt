Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week;
your guide to everything that's

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:04.900
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.400
This week: The President spent
several days in talks with

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.567
Congressional leaders in an
ultimately successful effort to

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.934
reach a bipartisan compromise
around a central promise of the

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:15.700
President's
re-election campaign;

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.066
preventing an income tax
increase on middle-class

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:21.333
families; while asking the
wealthiest 2% of Americans to

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.300
pay a little more to help
deal with our deficit.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.200
Also, White House staffers
shared some of their New

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.667
Year's resolutions.

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:32.533
That's December 28th to January
3rd or "Welcome to 2013:

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.500
"The Annual
Resolutions Edition!"

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.767
On Friday, with just four
days left before tax rates are

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:41.333
scheduled to rise, the President
invited Senate and House leaders

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.166
to the White House to try
to hammer out a bipartisan

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.433
agreement to prevent
a tax increase on

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:47.433
middle-class families.

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:49.033
Kevin Xu:
This is a two-minute
warning for the President.

00:00:49.033 --> 00:00:50.967
Narrator:
Then the President made a
statement in the Brady Press

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:51.967
Briefing Room.

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:54.767
The President:
I'm modestly optimistic that
an agreement can be achieved.

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:57.633
Nobody's going to get
100% of what they want.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.734
But let's make sure that
middle-class families and the

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:03.600
American economy, and in
fact, the world economy,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.500
aren't adversely impacted
because people can't

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.500
do their jobs.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000
Narrator:
On Saturday, the President
sat down for an interview with

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.834
"Meet the Press," the longest-
running television series in

00:01:12.834 --> 00:01:14.734
American broadcasting history.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:15.934
The President:
If you look at the facts --

00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:18.734
Narrator:
On Monday, the President
offered an update about where

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:21.667
negotiations stood on the
so-called "fiscal cliff."

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:24.567
The President:
The people who are
with me here today,

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.900
the people who are
watching at home,

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.100
they need our leaders
and Congress to succeed.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.166
They need us to all
stay focused on them.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:36.700
Not on politics, not on,
you know, special interests.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.500
They need to be focused on
families, students, grandmas,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.333
folks who are out
there working really,

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:48.000
really hard and are just looking
for a fair shot and some reward

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.100
for that hard work.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.600
Narrator:
After his remarks, the President
visited with some of the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.567
middle-class families who had
come to the White House because

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.800
they had spoken up and gotten
involved in the fiscal cliff

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800
debate at WhiteHouse.gov.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.834
The President:
Do they get a chance to, like,
at least look around the White

00:02:00.834 --> 00:02:01.667
House a little bit?

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:02.433
Visitor:
Yes!

00:02:02.433 --> 00:02:03.133
White House Staffer:
If you would like.

00:02:03.133 --> 00:02:04.100
Visitors:
Yes, yes!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
The President:
Okay, can you set up --

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.934
White House Staffer:
I'll facilitate it.

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:07.700
The President:
-- facilitate like a little
tour for them or something?

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.233
White House Staffer:
We'll do that, yes,
right after this.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:10.133
The President:
Right after this.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:11.033
All right.

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:13.767
Pedro:
It's an awesome,
incredible experience.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.266
Just soaking it all in.

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:18.033
Narrator:
On Tuesday, the President
spoke about the passage of the

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:22.367
American Taxpayer Relief Act of
2012 which received a bipartisan

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:25.233
majority in both the
House and the Senate.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:29.834
The President:
Thanks to the votes of Democrats
and Republicans in Congress,

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:33.100
I will sign a law that raises
taxes on the wealthiest 2% of

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.333
Americans while preventing a
middle-class tax hike that could

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:39.567
have sent the economy
back into a recession.

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.900
Narrator:
And now, back by popular demand,
West Wing Week brings you its

end of the day knowing that
I made an impact and did

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:05.967
something good.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.867
And finally, the one I'm really
going to work on is to get more

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:19.133
