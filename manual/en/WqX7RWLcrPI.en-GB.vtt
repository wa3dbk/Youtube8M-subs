Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Best
Ever Cream Cheese Frosting Tutorial where

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.360
I'll be showing you a recipe and tutorial
for making the most delicious and perfectly

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.630
pipeable cream cheese frosting that you will
have ever tasted.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.050
Tools and equipment that we will be using
today:

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.460
I've got an electric mixer with the whisk
attachments on.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.270
I've got my trusty spatula.
I've got 5 cups or 40 oz. of icing sugar otherwise

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.070
known as confectioner sugar or powdered sugar.
Now I will mention with this icing sugar,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.079
I did measure it out unsifted so the unsifted
weight or the unsifted amount is 5 cups, and

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.540
then I sifted it. Once sifted it does come
to that 6, 6 ½ cups so make sure that you

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.149
are getting that unsifted weight.
I've got a tablespoon of lemon juice.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.540
2 teaspoons of milk.
In my bowl over here, I've got 125 grams or

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.440
4 ½ oz. of softened butter, so just room
temperature butter. It doesn't matter if that's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.740
salted or unsalted.
I've 125 grams or 4 ½ oz. of cream cheese.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.640
Now cream cheese is usually kept in the fridge
so I've popped mine in the microwave for about

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.090
45 seconds just to soften it down so that
it's room temperature as well.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.110
I've also got a spoon over here.
To start off with today, we are going to mix

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.830
our butter and cream cheese together with
that lemon juice. Now this frosting, the texture

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.990
of it and the consistency is all about the
way you mix it. So we are going to start by

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.189
mixing this on a high speed for 5 minutes,
absolute minimum of 5 minutes, and you'll

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.280
see why once we get through the mixing phase.
So firstly we're going to add that lemon juice.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.340
Now we add lemon juice because it just provides
a little bit of a tart flavor and it takes

00:01:46.340 --> 00:02:06.130
out some of the sweetness of buttercream frosting.
Now at this point, I do just want to show

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.670
you, I've been scraping down the sides of
the bowl with my spatula. And you can see

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.340
here, some of the darker yellow butter, that's
the color that we started out with. This is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.620
how beautifully whipped butter and cream cheese
mixture. So you want to avoid this yellow

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:28.360
color. And when you know it's done, it will
actually be this lovely light white color.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:39.010
Alright, so that's looking beautiful. Now
you should have something that looks like

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.569
this. So what you've got is a lovely, a whipped
of butter and cream cheese mixture and it's

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.569
really nice and white as I mentioned -- really
nice and fluffy. That's going to form the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.230
base of our frosting.
Now from here, I'm going to take this icing

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.959
sugar or powdered sugar and I'm just going
to start tipping it into the bowl. So I don't

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.950
want to put the whole lot in. I'm just going
to put in, maybe, about a third. Then we're

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.510
going to start that mixer on a low speed.
Starting it on a low speed so I don't end

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.769
up with too much of a dust storm. And I'm
going to gradually add in the other 2/3 of

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:34.319
that bowl as I'm mixing.
Now, you'll see here as I'm mixing, it's actually

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.350
starting to get just a little bit too dry
so that's what our extra 2 teaspoons of milk

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.349
are for. Just judge your frosting, if it is
looking like it's wet enough and it's going

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.290
along nicely, you don't necessarily need to
add that 2 teaspoons of milk. But I'm going

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.540
to turn that mixer back on and I'm just going
to add in those 2 teaspoons of milk because

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:59.040
I just feel like this frosting needs a little
bit more moisture.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:15.413
Now we'll turn that speed right up to high.
And we're going to let that go for another

00:04:15.413 --> 00:04:16.970
5 minutes.
So there you have your completed beautiful

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.280
cream cheese frosting. Now just have a look
at the consistency of that. You'll see there

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:28.210
it's a really nice, spoon-able, pipeable consistency.
You can run your finger through it quite easily,

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.249
holds itself quite nicely.
Now I will also mention that your milk is

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.779
the way that you can control the firmness
of this frosting. So if you want it slightly

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:40.340
firmer, a little less milk. If you'd like
it a little bit moister, add a little bit

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.192
more milk. But just add about a teaspoon at
a time because you don't want to put it in

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:50.409
too much and end up with a wet sloppy frosting.
