00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.900
My name is TJ Kern.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.990
I'm in beautiful British
Columbia.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.900
Riding on the Whistler Blackcomb Glacier. Today I'm going to teach you how to do a barrel roll back flip.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.900
You're going to want to know the necessary speed for the jump that you're

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.100
coming in to hit, and want to get to a point where you know you can drop from

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.200
straight-line into the jump and you're going to have
good speed

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.150
once you figure that out, you're going to want to stay flat based, a little on your toe edge

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.010
and just

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.260
go for it. Send it! Send it to flat! Ha ha!

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.270
When you get to the takeoff and you're
trying to do a backflip

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.070
you pretty much want to just be thinking in
your head like you doing a backflip

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.470
on a trampoline or off a cliff or any
other place you would be

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.310
doing a backflip or you've done one before.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.200
Just come up get a little bit on your
toes

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.350
pop and  just throw your head back.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.900
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.460
 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.799
Alright, when you're in the air,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.860
and you're doing a backflip, with your rotation going, the main thing

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.970
is you want to stay committed. Once you start your rotation,

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.500
you're going to want to keep going with it

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.320
Once you get half way through your flip, and you're upside down, have your head back.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.080
You want to try and spot the snow, and spot your landing.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:46.080
See how much time you have left in the air and decide
whether you want to

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.179
keep going at the same speed

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:56.119
or open up and slow it down a little bit.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:03.119
My first back flip experience was actually

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.750
in Mount Hood. It was real slushy snow, perfect for
learning new tricks.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.319
You could pretty much land on your head
and you're going to be alright.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.620
We just built a real steep lip, maybe
waist-high.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.360
Salted in really good, made it really sturdy and just

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.350
went for it.
