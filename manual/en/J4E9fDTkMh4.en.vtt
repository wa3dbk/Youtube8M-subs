00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:05.850
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.070
In heritage restoration &amp; Design
Studio's specialty shop,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.690
we provide fine repairs and restoration

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.949
to a wide variety of products. Today

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.999
we are refinishing a 75-year-old piano

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.149
removing the old varnish and replacing
it with a new

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.039
lacquer based coating. After planning the
project

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.290
with the client, the piano is then moved to our
location.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.870
It is now carefully disassembled to allow
access

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.970
the various parts that require refinishing. A
stripping compound

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.770
is applied components, then they are left to sit.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.560
The compound is then scraped off,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.600
removing the old finish and exposing the original wood
grain.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.270
A similar process

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.270
is then applied to remove the worn
manufacturers decal.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.850
The parts are then hand rubbed and smoothed.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.290
A lacquer solvent is added as a final 
improvement to the cleaning process

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.610
Heritage is careful to protect the sensitive
inner workings of the pianos that we service.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.780
The company that manufactures this piano

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.490
closed in the 1960's, but this 
is no problem.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.159
Heritage Restoration &amp; Design Studio has
the ability to provide

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.080
accurate decals for antique pianos. The parts

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.439
are then taken to our spray booth. Here

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.759
we apply as many coats of lacquer as the client
specifies.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.100
This piano requires up to six. The components
are then left

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.470
to cure for two to three days. Once the curing
is complete

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.569
the piano is reassembled for inspection. Once
it passes,

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.380
it undergoes a final tuning and other small
repairs to the inner workings.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.980
After a final once over, the repairs

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.959
are complete. Now the piano looks

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.930
and sounds great!
