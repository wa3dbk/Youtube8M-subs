00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.390
here's how to culture wingless fruit
flies: Drosophila melanogaster

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.820
for your fish, frogs, lizards, and more. You will need:

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.130
an escape-proof, ventilated container

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.000
you may use deli cups with ventilated lids, like the one shown here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.029
which are commonly sold with commercial
fruit fly kits,

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.500
or you can fashion your own container
with a glass or plastic jar

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.220
a cloth, and an elastic band. Other
possibilities exist as well.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.550
The important thing is that the lid be
escape-proof and well-ventilated

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.090
a resting surface for the flies

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.690
folded coffee filters or excelsior

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.190
(wood wool)  are often used. I prefer the
excelsior.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.360
Culture medium. You can use a commercial
medium

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.000
or make one yourself. Commercial fruit
fly culture media are very nutritious,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.440
convenient, usually reasonably priced, and
very easy to use.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.239
just measure, add the proper quantity of hot
water,  and stir.

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.780
I occasionally use do-it-yourself medium

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.210
here's the recipe I use: 1/2 cup potato
flakes

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.930
2 teaspoons nutritional yeast 1/2
teaspoon spirulina powder

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.920
1/3 a teaspoon of cinnamon one-quarter
cup

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.330
or more of boiling water and one-quarter
cup

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.130
or more of white vinegar. Add the boiling
water to the dry ingredients until 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.159
uniformly moist

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.650
add up to 1/8 th of a cup of additional water and
vinegar as needed

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.960
to moisten.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.180
SETUP. Whether you use commercial or do it
yourself

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.729
medium the mixture should be moist
enough so that the surface of the medium

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.680
quickly becomes

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.759
smooth. If it is lumpy, at a little more liquid

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.610
the medium pictured here may need a
little more liquid added

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.430
once the mixture is complete

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.610
push a handful of excelsior into the
medium. Put the lid on to prevent

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.040
contamination with wild fruit flies or
other unwanted insects

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.750
allow the culture to cool for about 20
to 30 minutes

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.750
at this point at about 50 flies

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280
write the date that you made the culture

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.459
on the container with the marker. Keep your fruit
flies around 70 to 75

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:36.250
degrees Fahrenheit out of direct
sunlight. MAINTENANCE

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.610
the fruit flies need little in the way
of care. Within a week or so after

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.720
starting the culture

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.380
you should begin to see adults emerging
from the dark pupal cases that dot the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.200
excelsior on the sides of the container

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.670
soon after this, you should start another
culture with some of the new flies

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.050
once the culture begins to produce flies,
the most important maintenance task is

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.650
to harvest from the culture daily

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.720
or almost daily to prevent overcrowding
and a subsequent crash

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.250
about one month after you make a culture
it is time to discard it

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.350
to help prevent mites from contaminating
subsequent cultures

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.350
HARVESTING:  tap the container a few times
so that any flies near the top of the

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.730
container fall down towards the bottom

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.900
remove the lid, tap the container, and tap
the flies out

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.230
this may be done directly into an
aquarium or other animal enclosure

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.110
or if you wish to dust the flies with
a supplement, into an appropriate

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.110
container

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.440
up
