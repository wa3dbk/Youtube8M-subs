00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:08.590
Inotia 4: Assassin of Berkel neatly encapsulates
the worst of the RPG genre together with the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.580
worst of mobile gaming.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.730
Ropey localisation results in a flat group
of characters, while the ever-present spectre

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.850
of in-app purchases limits your progress.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.409
Starting out, you choose from six different
classes.

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.109
As is traditional, these will give you different
starting stats as well as limiting the weapons

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:25.109
you can equip.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.609
No matter which class you choose, you'll still
be playing as Kiyan, a young man in the Shadow

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.860
Tribe sent on a mysterious quest to hinder
two factions about to go to war.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.270
The combat is enjoyably simple - level-up
your chosen skills and push buttons in rotation

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.070
until one or the other of you is dead.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.820
Mobs will drop mana blobs and loot for the
crafting system.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.020
However, the fusion machines required for
crafting are few and far between, resulting

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.120
in the components nicely filling your inventory
and encouraging you to purchase a bag upgrade.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.600
You can bring up to two mercenaries in your
party, and have 16 more on stand-by.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720
These are crucial for boss battles.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.070
While they'll happily keep fighting once you
hit a target, your mercenaries won't initiate

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.899
a fight even in self defence, and nor will
they take potions automatically.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.230
You have six hotkey slots for skills and equipment,
a virtual D-pad on the left, and a 'use' button

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.399
on the right.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.539
Annoyingly for iPad gamers, Com2uS hasn't
learned from the previous game in the series,

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:21.109
and so this interface is clearly designed
for a much smaller screen.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.580
There's no contortion in which you can safely
hold your iPad and reach all the buttons you

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.580
need.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.450
It's particularly stressful when you're in
a tough boss fight and find yourself walking

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.420
in squares around the all-important mana pick-ups
instead of replenishing your supply.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.639
Every character in the game speaks in a charmingly
modern tone.

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.200
This doesn't make up for the terribly slow
expositional exchanges in which Kiyan and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.619
Eara (also known as The Channel) will talk
about how Kiyan is here to save Eara because

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.909
she is The Channel and therefore everyone
wants her power and she can't go back because

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.560
she is The Channel and there's going to be
a war because she's The Channel and so on

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
ad nauseum.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.359
Fortunately, there's a 'skip' button for almost
all of the dialogue, leaving you free to get

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.709
back to your skill rotations and inventory-management.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.789
Inotia 4 on the iPad has all the hallmarks
of a decent linear RPG.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.009
Sadly, it lacks the writing, character development,
and combat depth of a good one.
