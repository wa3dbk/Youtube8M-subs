00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, I read the fucking books!

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.000
I said, I read the fucking books!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.210
I read them years ago

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.420

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
I've got a signed copy of "A Feast for Crows"

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.369
Then a six year wait for "A Dance With Dragons".

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.369
A six year wait for "A Dance With Dragons".

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.369

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.250

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.850
His name is Joffrey not Geoffrey!

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.740
Get a fucking library card!

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.100

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.800
Your imagination is a fun place to explore

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.100
Go to a library or a fucking book store

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.500
take it from me, you'll enjoy the book more

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.100
"Harry Potter", the book was better

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.900
"The Hunger Games", the book was better

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.100
"The Lord of the Rings", the books were probably better

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.100
"The Cat in the Hat", the book was better

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.100
and whilst I'm on the topic

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.100
