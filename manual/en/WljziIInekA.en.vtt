00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.871
We have driven some different types of 6 series

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:26.483
a while ago we drove the 320 HP 640i convertible

00:00:26.483 --> 00:00:29.210
we also drove a 640i gran coupe

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.855
which was tuned to around 380 HP

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:35.086
than at the top there is the M6

00:00:35.086 --> 00:00:36.653
incredible car

00:00:36.653 --> 00:00:40.513
very fast and a lot of excitement

00:00:40.513 --> 00:00:42.776
what fills the gap between those cars

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:44.715
is that neither fish nor fowl

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:46.530
or is it the way to go?

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.097
that's what we're going to find out

00:00:55.593 --> 00:00:57.350
to start with, the power

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.471
it comes from a V8 with

00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.290
two single-scroll turbos

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.652
450 HP and a significant 650 Nm

00:01:04.652 --> 00:01:07.447
which take it from 0-100 km/h in 4.6s

00:01:07.447 --> 00:01:10.937
and the top speed is limited at 250 km/h

00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.393
the horsepower is sort of the middle ground

00:01:15.393 --> 00:01:17.212
between the 640i and the M6

00:01:17.212 --> 00:01:19.722
the engine in the front, the N63 engine

00:01:19.722 --> 00:01:23.174
is basically the same engine as in the M6

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:25.057
there it's called S63

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:27.435
to get the power in the M6 they added

00:01:27.435 --> 00:01:29.851
a different exhaust manifold

00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:31.742
a higher turbo pressure

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:33.554
and the turbos are different

00:01:33.554 --> 00:01:34.648
these are single-scroll

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:36.875
the M6 has twin-scroll

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:39.163
those adjustments have been made

00:01:39.163 --> 00:01:42.054
to gain peak power

00:01:42.054 --> 00:01:43.963
the torque is only 30 Nm higher

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:46.511
the M6 has 680 Nm

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:49.493
but the peak power is 110 HP more in the M6

00:01:49.493 --> 00:01:52.128
especially when you give it some beans

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:55.482
you notice the torque

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.615
you feel that the difference with the M6

00:01:57.615 --> 00:01:59.844
is not that big

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.792
but I can't really compare it to the M6

00:02:02.792 --> 00:02:04.799
that's a totally different car

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.182
handling wise, the difference with

00:02:07.182 --> 00:02:08.575
the M-sport package from the 640i is quite big

00:02:08.575 --> 00:02:10.712
there you felt what the car did better

00:02:10.712 --> 00:02:12.270
you could feel what the suspension and

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.191
wheels were doing

00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:17.224
there was more contact with the car

00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:20.965
the distance between car and driver

00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:23.063
is a bit bigger in this

00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:25.514
in terms of sound it slots between

00:02:25.514 --> 00:02:27.609
the 640i and the M6

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.026
you do get the V8 sound

00:02:29.026 --> 00:02:30.595
but it's a bit muted in this car

00:02:30.595 --> 00:02:31.945
especially on the inside

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:34.018
from the outside it does sound great

00:02:34.018 --> 00:02:36.534
this exhaust has valves in the back

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:39.545
on both sides, the inner pipe has a valve

00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:41.483
which opens above a certain RPM

00:02:41.483 --> 00:02:43.557
and than it does sound excellent

00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:45.841
a bit ominous

00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:49.134
very dark

00:02:49.134 --> 00:02:51.079
and it suits the car very well

00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:02.395
this one has some great extras

00:03:02.395 --> 00:03:04.277
like the brown metallic paint

00:03:04.277 --> 00:03:06.315
it's called Jatoba

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:08.069
it looks absolutely amazing

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.764
especially with these wheels

00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:11.089
20 inch

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:13.941
and at first I didn't really like them

00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:17.829
It's a bit odd, the black with the aluminium

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.085
but as I looked at them for a while

00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:20.773
I started appreciating them more

00:03:20.773 --> 00:03:22.661
which I found striking

00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.607
It also has some black accents

00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:27.183
like the exhausts

00:03:27.183 --> 00:03:28.877
the grill in the front

00:03:28.877 --> 00:03:31.607
it all makes it very stylish

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:34.249
but also impressive at the same time

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.978
the 650i is in terms of price

00:03:35.978 --> 00:03:38.136
closer to the 640i

00:03:38.136 --> 00:03:39.862
it costs â‚¬118.000,- (NL)

00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:43.412
and the M6 is tens of thousands of euros away

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:45.919
but when it comes to power

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.673
it's much closer to the M6

00:03:47.673 --> 00:03:50.340
so is the performance

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.959
on paper it might look like

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.559
you're making concessions with the 650i

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:57.100
it seems like it's fish nor fowl

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.680
but in reality it proves an amazing compilation

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.530
of different components from the 6 series

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.099
components in which the 6 series excels

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.612
the cruising but also the performance part

00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:15.642
the 650i scores an 8 in every section

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:19.149
which makes it the ultimate allrounder

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.120
among the 6 series
