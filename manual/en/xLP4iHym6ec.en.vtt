LEAVING "REI PELÉ" TRAINING CENTER

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.644
Come on, let's do it!

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:17.928
Look, it's Gabigol!

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:19.850
Take a picture of everyone!

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.711
- Did you take it?
- Thanks!

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:25.407
Isn't he cute?

00:00:25.912 --> 00:00:29.075
Look how cute that child is,
look at him!

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.336
I'm marvelous

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:33.979
I'm very handsome!

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:34.962
Yes, you are!

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:44.735
You nailed it, Pirata!

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.261
Speak low!

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:52.556
You keep talking.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.539
He's becoming...

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:56.227
- I'm Geuvânio!
- He's Geuvânio...

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:58.389
- But his nickname is "Caveirinha"...
- My name is Geuvânio!

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.602
I'm Geuvânio,
not Ronaldo!

00:01:00.603 --> 00:01:03.003
He's becoming "Caveirinha."

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:04.467
I'm Geuvânio,
not Ronaldo!

00:01:04.468 --> 00:01:06.947
He's writing his own history.

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:09.513
- Congratulations, Geuvânio!
- Thank you, Cícero!

00:01:09.514 --> 00:01:11.412
He has scored 996 goals.

00:01:12.463 --> 00:01:14.542
Actually, 997 goals,
he scored three times.

00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:16.912
- 997.
- That's right!

00:01:17.084 --> 00:01:17.873
That's right.

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:19.878
997 goals,
did you hear that, Pelé?

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:22.721
- That's the math.
- 997 goals.

00:01:29.048 --> 00:01:29.631
Look, Vlad!

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:13.051
SNACK TIME

00:02:40.386 --> 00:02:41.909
Let him sleep!

00:02:42.624 --> 00:02:44.269
If he wants to sleep,
just let him!

00:02:44.986 --> 00:02:46.621
Do you want some?

00:02:49.058 --> 00:02:50.987
Are you eating chocolate?

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:52.869
That's great.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.906
Film this, Pirata!

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.522
Do it.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:02.065
Do the other one,
the slower one!

00:03:08.176 --> 00:03:09.801

00:03:17.053 --> 00:03:20.034
What are your expectations
for this match?

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:22.017
It's a very important match,

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:23.143

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.222
I hope I manage to play well...

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.248
and that our team wins,
which is the most important thing.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.304
You know the place
very well, don't you?

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:32.664

00:03:32.665 --> 00:03:35.697
I know the city very well,
I hope I get adapted again...

00:03:35.698 --> 00:03:37.259
in order to play well.

00:03:38.363 --> 00:03:39.558
Lucas!

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:42.223
Are you anxious to debut?

00:03:42.224 --> 00:03:45.168
I'm anxious,
thanks to God I here,

00:03:45.302 --> 00:03:47.150
