Cranberry relish is easy and quick to make.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.040
First I will slice the cranberries in halfs

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.300
and mix with all the spices.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.740
Heat the oil with asafoetida and pour over it.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.100
Mix it well and store in glass jar or glass bowl.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.940
First slice the cranberries.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.900
In halfs.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.800
I have already sliced the cranberries in halfs.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.440
And now I am going to add all the ingredients.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.020
Except oil and asafoetida.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.900

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.100
This you can adjust to your taste.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.520
Mix it well.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.420
And next, I will heat the oil with asafoetida.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.280
And add to the cranberry mix.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.900
As you see it is looking really pretty.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.800
Heat is on, medium high.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.960
So first I will add the oil.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.140
I like to use mustard oil

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.420
but you can use the oil of your preference.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.580
After oil is moderately hot, I will add the asafoetida.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.260
Oil is hot.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.160
Add the asafoetida.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.080
And turn off the heat.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.020
And pour it over cranberry.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.960
Looks great.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.620
Mix the cranberry well.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.620
So oil and all the spices are mixed.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.020
And as you see it's looking so colorful.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.480
White, red and green.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.940
After mixing this store it in a jar.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.560
And let it sit or marinate for a day for the best taste.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.800
Cranberry relish is looking very tasty and colorful.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.520
I like to store this in glass jar.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.760
It tastes great after it has marinated for a day.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.780
You can store this for a week at room temperature

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.600
or refrigerated for a month.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:59.580
