00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi, this is Sean Hobson, and what we're doing
right now is working with our point guards

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.400
on feeding the post. It is very critical for
our guards to be able to feed the post properly.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.259
To be able to read the defense, and to be
able to also read the post player. It's partially

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:19.890
the responsibility of the post player to tell
the point guard where to pass to. He's either

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.779
got to show him with his bottom that he wants
the ball on the bottom hand, or he's going

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.640
to show him with the top hand that he wants
it fed it up to the top. Or if the post player

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.829
doesn't think that he can get it from this
angle, sometimes the post player will tell

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.289
him to kick the ball to the top, then the
post player can relocate himself to get the

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.710
ball there. So, once that post player then
starts to tell the point guard where to go,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.519
then it's the point guards responsibility
to figure out whether we need to throw a chest

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:51.059
pass. If the post is playing behind--go ahead--if
he's playing behind and the post can get his

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.149
hands out there ready, then the point guard
can probably fake--always want to fake first--then

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.960
step and feed the post on a chest pass. Go
ahead and show them what that looks like.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.170
Good. Now give it back. Now, go ahead and
spin up to the top side, Ben. If he's guarding

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.079
his top side, then the post is going to post
to the bottom. This guy has to be able to

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.570
fake it--you see how he stepped around through,
sealed the defender out, and dropped the ball

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.991
down to the baseline. And then we'll show
him--go ahead and guard him on his bottom

00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:21.700
side--and then we'll him where he's feeding
the ball to the top side, and he can go ahead

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.899
and give it to him that way. One other one
I'm going to show you is a very difficult

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.100
one. Go ahead and get it back. This time I
want you to front the post. If there's a man

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.560
that's fronting the post, what we want our
post players to do to is to walk this guy

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.079
up, and to point straight up in the air. This
is the hardest pass to throw for a point guard.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.020
He's got to be able to fake his guy down,
and get that defender down, and then he's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.009
going to lob it. But when he lobs it, he can't
throw it straight up. He's got to throw it

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.200
over the post's head so that he can go get
the ball and finish. And it's going to look

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.969
something like this. Good. There was no way
this post player can get to that pass because

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.409
he threw it over his head. Those are some
good ways that our point guard can feed the

00:01:59.409 --> 00:01:59.619
post.
