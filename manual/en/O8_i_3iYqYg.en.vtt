00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.080
Joe: Hey, it's Joe.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.530
I've got another question.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.880
"Dear Joe, how is it possible to buy with
zero down?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.130
I know an agent here in Philly who lost his
license and went to jail last year because

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.890
they were doing zero down deals.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.050
Apparently, they would raise the price of
the house and get a kickback at closing to

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.529
cover their down payment.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.550
They took all of the money and then the houses
went into foreclosure.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.640
Can you really buy with no money down or are
you teaching the same method this guy was

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.810
using?"

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.260
This one's from Michelle in Oklahoma
Joe: Well, Michelle, what he was doing is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.520
illegal.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.540
And he's committing loan fraud because he's
lying to the lender.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.360
He's raising the price of the house, which
is harder to do these days because there's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.050
a lot more scrutiny for appraisers.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.579
But still, it's possible, and especially when
the markets change, those types of things

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.579
can happen.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.840
But they're also getting new loans on the
property and then they're pulling money back

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.150
out and creating shadow seconds.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.539
So what they're doing is defrauding the lender.

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.070
Obviously you don't want to do that.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.869
Joe: What we're doing is perfectly legal,
though.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.630
Let me give you an example of a zero down
deal so you'll understand the structure and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:26.530
how it works and maybe a little bit of some
of the ins and outs of this process.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.179
I have a hierarchy of structures that I use
from best to worst, depending on the type

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:37.259
of deal that it is, what the seller needs,
what they're trying to accomplish and what

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.860
you're going to do with the property after
you get it.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.040
The hierarchy is subject-to at the top, then
multi-mortgage, then land contract or contract

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.689
for deed (it's the same thing -- just different
names in different states -- if you're in

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.950
a trust deed state its contract for deed,
and in a mortgage state its land contract).

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.859
Then there's lease option, and then assignable
cash purchases.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:07.049
Those are the five zero down structures that
you can use and I use them in that order,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.380
based on the type of deal that we're going
after.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.270
Joe: So let's take just one of them.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.170
Let's take subject-to because that's one that
I like the best and that I think is the strongest.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.610
It's at the top of the hierarchy.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.600
It's very easy to use with no risk, no credit,
and no money down; really a nice process.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:32.190
Basically, what subject-to is -- let's say
you've got a property that's worth $150,000.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.320
Let's say they owe $145,000 on it now.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:44.500
If you were to sell it for them as an agent,
it would cost them $10,000-$15,000 to come

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.251
to closing, to be able to pay the commission,
for any negotiation, repairs, the title and

00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:54.240
all of that stuff -- it would cost them that
much to sell that property at this time.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.540
And they're not in a position to do that for
one reason or another, or maybe they just

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.550
don't want to.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.470
They can't pay a realtor to sell their property
for them.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.650
We all know that about 85% of for sale by
owners don't succeed so the likelihood is

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.030
that they're not going to sell it for sale
by owner and save the commission, either.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.230
So they don't have a whole lot of choices.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.660
If you go to them and say, 'I'd like to buy
this property.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.290
Here's how I can structure the deal.'

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.270
They owe $145,000 on it.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.680
They're making payments on it.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.220
A lot of these interest rates they've got
are still pretty good.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.660
They've got interest rates of about 6-7%.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.950
Some of them have ugly interest rates and
you've got to deal with those in a little

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.950
different way.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.310
But most of these properties out there that
people need to sell but can't sell because

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.230
they don't have the equity -- they have decent
interest rates.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.980
So you can take over this property.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.560
Joe: There's a lot of different things you
can do with it, but the way you're going to

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.380
take it is that you're going to have them
deed you the property.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.910
Now, you're not qualifying for the loan, you're
not applying for the loan, you're not pulling

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.340
your credit, and you're not giving them any
down payment -- you're going to just start

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.670
making the payments.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.120
Basically, what I like to do is ask them to
make the next 30 day payment.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.540
So if their payments are due on the 1st, I
have them pay on the 1st.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.620
That gives me 30 days to find a tenant or
a lease option buyer to put into the property

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.500
before I have to make the next payment.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.980
Now, if you're brand new at this, and you
don't want to take the risk that you're going

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.980
to have make a payment without having a tenant
(and I wouldn't suggest that you do this if

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.090
you're brand new anyway because until you're
positive that you can fill those properties,

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.840
you don't want to take on that debt) the way
you do it instead is to put together a purchase

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.660
agreement.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.030
I have a purchase agreement for subject-to
deals, and basically what it does is it gives

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.720
you 90 days to go out and find a buyer that
you can assign the deal to.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.240
So you don't even have to close it.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.770
You don't have to deed it to you at all -- you
could have it deeded directly to another person

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.360
who gives you an assignment fee to buy that
property, or you can buy the property and

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.620
you can sell it on a lease option.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.000
That protects the seller a little better,
and I like that way better, plus it builds

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.790
your wealth -- it builds your portfolio of
properties, which is something that is really

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.650
important to be doing if you want to have
a good retirement

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.430
Joe: As an agent, you don't have a retirement
plan or at least most of you don't have retirement

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.170
plans, and when you stop working or when you
stop making commissions, you stop making income,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.590
and that's not a good situation to be in.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.789
You really need to own rental property -- every
agent should own a bunch of rental property

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.669
-- at a minimum, 2 to 5 pieces of rental properties;
everyone should own that.

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.710
And I would go so far as to say that it's
a better investment than the stock market.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.150
If you look at the leverage position, and
if you buy good, solid, stable properties

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.120
that you can rent for the long term and don't
have negative cash flow, it's a great way

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.240
to save for the future.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.870
It's a great way to leverage your money.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.980
And, there's no tax implications on the money
that it's making.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.390
In fact, it saves you money on depreciation.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.840
So you want to keep those properties.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.300
Joe: I'm getting off on a tangent here...

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.680
Anyway, on subject to deals, you take these
properties, they deed them to you, and you've

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.480
got the property -- that's a zero down deal
-- it's as simple as that.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.990
Multi-mortgage gets a little bit more detailed.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.680
Land contract is a little bit different.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.760
Lease options are a little bit different.

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.770
I spend 2 or 3 hours at my buying events teaching
these structures, plus it's in all of my programs,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.990
because this is the core material of what
I teach.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.980
Joe: So I hope that helps.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:38.770
Good luck with it.
