00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:05.683
It is September sixteenth. We are in beautiful Salt Lake City, Utah.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.360
Behind me, the church, and in front of you, me.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.728
We're going to be interviewing a man named Scott Hall.

00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:18.569
Scott Hall is running for the senate seat currently held by Orrin Hatch.

00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:20.390
My name is Henry Rollins, 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.023
and I'm embarking on a tour through every state capital in America.

00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.878
all the way up to November's Presidential elections.

00:00:28.546 --> 00:00:31.996
I want to learn a few things, and knowledge without mileage equals bullshit.

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.157
So, come follow me into what Mark Twain called

00:00:35.157 --> 00:00:39.282
'The Territory.' This is capitalism 2012.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.410
Mitt Romney, Scott Howell, Harry Reid. 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.342
We all have these fundamental beliefs of our faith,

00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:51.875
and it's too bad that people would use the faith

00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:54.889
as a reason not to vote for President Romney.

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.845
But, as a Mormon Democrat, there's a lot 
 of things that I'm trying to dispel.

00:00:58.845 --> 00:01:00.733
In fact, I got invited back to the DNC

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.852
to speak about Mormonism in America today.

00:01:04.978 --> 00:01:06.752
If someone is a religious affiliation, that's one of the great things about America,

00:01:06.752 --> 00:01:10.628
that we have religious diversity, freedom from and freedom of religion.

00:01:10.628 --> 00:01:13.661
And so, I've noticed, and I watch the Presidential race very very closely,

00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:18.851
it's not been coming up very much in the bigger picture of Mr. Romney,

00:01:18.851 --> 00:01:21.804
and I'm very glad about that. It says a 
 lot about where America has come from

00:01:22.203 --> 00:01:25.604
because I don't think it should be a restriction to voting for anybody.

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:28.963
I really don't think so, and so, I'm glad about that.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:33.654
I'm glad that you're running openly, as a Mormon.

00:01:33.654 --> 00:01:38.508
That, I think will help to dispel things further. 
 America has a long way to go.

00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:41.800
You know, we've come a long way, and there's still quite a journey ahead.

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:46.350
Should we get a Romney administration, what do you think that will mean

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.750
to the state of Utah and to Mormon people?

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:53.470
It is a Mormon moment right now. It's exciting because, you know,

00:01:53.468 --> 00:01:56.040
we've lifted our faith out of obscurity.

00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:59.360
Me running for the United States Senate. Mitt Romney running. 

00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:00.740
And we all have the same beliefs.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.120
You can't help but feel like somebody in the family might have a shot

00:02:06.082 --> 00:02:09.170
to be the leader of the free world all over.

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:12.730
Now, that doesn't mean we all agree with Mitt Romney's policies,

00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:16.140
but if he does get elected, there genuinely is a scripture that 

00:02:16.142 --> 00:02:19.800
I wanted to share out of our doctrine covenant with the whole world.

00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:22.000
This is a revelation, given to Joseph Smith,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.220
and I think this should put at ease and calm 
 of every person out there that would be afraid

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:31.070
that mormonism would be the next policy of the country.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.720
And Joseph Smith said, 'We do not believe it is just

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.600
to mingle religious influence

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.850
with civil government, whereby one religious society

00:02:41.987 --> 00:02:43.500
is fostered and another

00:02:43.503 --> 00:02:47.710
prescribed in its spiritual privileges and the individual rights 

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.510
of its members as citizens denied.

00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:53.160
That's very powerful words coming from the Lord,

00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:58.830
and so, I want my non-LDS friends to really be able to understand

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.370
that a true believer of our faith would have just as much respect

00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:09.950
for a non-believer, for a Jewish, for a Muslim, 
 for a Protestant, for whoever it might be

00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:14.860
because, when we lead the United States of America 
 or I lead in the United States Senate,

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:18.670
I don't care about their faith. What I care about is people.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.340
Mr. Howell had some very interesting points of view.

00:03:21.337 --> 00:03:23.640
He also faces some very unique challenges,

00:03:23.645 --> 00:03:27.340
in that he's going up against Orrin Hatch.

00:03:27.341 --> 00:03:30.850
Orrin Hatch is an extremely long time politician.

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:32.820
We're talking decades.

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.370
He's also very well funded, and, so, Mr. 
 Howell is going to be vastly outspent.

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.260
There's no way around it.

00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:44.700
So, he's got a hell of a challenge facing 
 him all the way up until November.

00:03:44.696 --> 00:03:47.580
I'm going to be on stage here, very very soon

00:03:48.265 --> 00:03:51.250
This is a city, Salt Lake, that I've played many many times.

00:03:52.246 --> 00:03:52.860
I've had a really good time here in my life. 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.040
The first time I did a show here in 
 Salt Lake City was the summer of 1981,

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:59.270
so I have quite a history with this place.

00:03:59.274 --> 00:04:04.160
I'm 51. I've been doing shows in your city since 1981.

00:04:04.518 --> 00:04:10.740
So far, I've not had a bad time. 
 Some of the venues have been trying.

00:04:10.744 --> 00:04:12.850
I'm going to get out of the venue, meet everyone by the bus.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.310
We're going to get on the bus and roll all night to Boise, Idaho,

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.070
the capital city in the great state of Idaho.

00:04:19.072 --> 00:04:22.750
It's a gorgeous piece of real estate, and I'm looking forward to it.

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.360
So, until then, stay tuned.
