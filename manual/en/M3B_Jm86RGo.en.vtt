00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:09.559
Five parts, clock motor, hour and minute hands,
clock dial &amp; wall hanger. Making a wall clock

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:15.719
with a quartz clock movement can be amazingly
simple. These battery clock movements allow

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.109
you to make a very functional accurate timepiece,
without much effort.

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.880
You will need a piece of stiff dial backing
material that you are going to glue an 11-1/8”

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.829
clock dial to. It could be a piece of plywood,
In this case we used masonite.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.079
Just cut the material about 12-13
inches wide so that there is a small border

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:52.820
around the 11-1/8 clock dial.
Measure how thick your material is. If it’s

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.539
¼”, then get the MVT7160A or MVT7190A clock
movement. If it’s thicker, than just choose

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.930
a movement with a threaded shaft that is 1/8”
longer than the material thickness. The threaded

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:15.150
shaft has to go through this backing material
as well as the 11-1/8” clock dial with about

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.040
1/8 of an inch to spare.
You will need to drill a 3/8 inch diameter

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.920
in your backing material to allow the movement
shaft to go through. Be careful to get the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.850
exact center of your circle marked correctly,
Here we are using a compass and a ruler to

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.380
determine the exact center.
Next you will want to finish your dial backing

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.560
material as desired. Here we used masonite
and have puttied and sanded the edges. Then

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.640
we sprayed on a quick coat of primer, then
when dry, some black spray paint on just the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.530
edges.
Once the 3/8” center hole is drilled and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.770
the paint is dry, it’s time to mount the
clock face to the backer material. There are

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.519
2 methods I use. The easiest is to use a role
of thin double faced tape. Place 3-4 small

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.909
pieces around the center hole, and maybe 10
small pieces around the outside edge of the

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:28.099
clock face. A piece ¾ to 1 inch long works
just fine.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.390
The best way to mount a clock face to a backer
material is a contact adhesive. It’s applied

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.299
to the back of the clock face and carefully
on the front of the backer material. Once

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.870
dried and carefully installed it will give
you the best possible bond.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.999
Whichever way you have chosen to mount the
clock face, you will probably find that having

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:56.370
something to align the center of the backer
material and the clock face is very helpful.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.040
I normally hold the backer material up in
the air a bit by using a few scraps of wood.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:09.549
I place an unsharpened pencil in the mounting
hole. Often, I have to use some masking tape

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:16.400
wrapped around the pencil to get the hole
size right. If you had a piece of a 5/16 inch

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:23.430
dowel rod cut to 4-5 inches long it would
be perfect.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.299
Carefully slide the adhesive backed clock
face over the pencil and slide into place.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.659
Make sure you have the “hole” centered
as best you can. Press the clock face in place

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.680
by use a soft cloth to smooth out the clock
face from the center, then going out to the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.599
edge.
Now, it’s time to install the clock movement

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.049
and clock hands. The only tool you might need
is a pair of needle nosed pliers. Install

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:59.889
the steel wall hanging bracket over the movement’s
hand shaft. Then place the small black rubber

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:07.310
washer over the hand shaft next.
Slide the clock movement hand shaft through

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.779
the 3/8” center mounting hole. Now, slide
the small round brass washer over the hand

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:22.410
shaft. Carefully thread the brass hex nut
onto the larger threaded part of the shaft.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.210
Tighten the hex nut as tight as you can with
just your fingers. If the movement can be

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.540
turned, then tighten 1/8 to ¼ of a turn.
Do not over tighten this nut. It could cause

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.880
the movement to run slowly.
Time to install the clock hands. Try to work

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.870
in a well-lighted area, and grab your reading
glasses if you need them. Just to review,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.750
the hour hand is the short one and the minute
hand is the long one. Take the shorter hour

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.370
hand and press it firmly onto the Nylon hour
hand shaft. Do not press on so far that the

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.340
hour hand actually touches the threaded metal
shaft below it.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.870
The minute hand does not have a round hole.
It’s oblong with 2 flat sides. Make sure

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.500
you line up the flat sides of the minute hand
with the flat sides of the metal minute hand

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.070
shaft. Press the minute hand on the metal
minute shaft. A slight “wiggling” may

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:33.550
be required. Once the minute hand is on, carefully
thread the minute hand cap nut onto the end

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.990
of the shaft.
You’re almost done. Just use your fingers

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:49.710
to move both of the hands to the 12:00 position.
Then use the time setting knob on the back

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:56.650
of the clock movement to adjust to the present
time. Install a AA battery in the correct

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:03.270
position and you are done! Hang it on a wall.
Tell your friends that you made your own decorative

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:10.210
wall clock using an accurate quartz clock
movement.
