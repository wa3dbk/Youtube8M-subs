00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.930
Episode 4 - Uphill

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.200
For riding uphill we also have three different
phases.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.000
First - Starting
Second - Steep climbs
Third - Switchbacks

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.900
First - Starting

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.700
If I'm riding uphill I'm using a low gear.
But to start on a steep hill I need a higher
gear.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Then I stand angular to the incline.
The top foot touches the ground and the lower
foot is on a 1am posititon. Then I start.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:59.500
Then I stand angular to the incline.
The top foot touches the ground and the lower
foot is on a 1am posititon. Then I start.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.300
"Hey I'm Lisi Osl from Kirchberg and I'm going to show you how to get up steep climbs properly"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.600
At steep climbs we need the basic position
again. We do so by pushing the elbows close to the body.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.740
The shoulders are vertical above the handle bar.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.150
We also slide to the tip of our saddle because then our front wheel stays on the ground and we can still pedal hard.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:35.000
Please do not forget that also the rear
wheel needs traction and so we do not lean over too far.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Third - Switchbacks.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.600
The front wheel goes through the switchback on the very outside of the turn. We also push the handle bar to the inside of the turn.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.800
The front wheel goes through the switchback on the very outside of the turn. We also push the handle bar to the inside of the turn.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.750
But our upper body is leaned to the outside of
the turn and still bent forward.
