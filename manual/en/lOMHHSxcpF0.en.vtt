00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.904
If the fructose in sugar
and high fructose corn syrup

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:12.826
has been considered alcohol
without the buzz

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:15.629
in terms of the potential
to inflict liver damage,

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:18.882
 what about the source
of natural fructose, fruit?

00:00:19.442 --> 00:00:22.953
Only industrial,
not fruit fructose intake

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:25.704
was associated
with declining liver function.

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:28.900
Same thing with high blood pressure.
Fructose from added sugars

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:33.466
was associated with hypertension;
fructose from natural fruits is not.

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:36.366
If you compare the effects of a diet
restricting fructose

00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:38.573
from both added sugars and fruit

00:00:38.698 --> 00:00:41.236
to one just restricting fructose
from added sugars,

00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:44.184
the diet that kept the fruit
did better.

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.620
People lost more weight
with the extra fruit present

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.595
than if all fructose was restricted
across-the-board.

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:53.667
These deleterious effects of fructose
were limited to industrial fructose,

00:00:53.792 --> 00:00:56.167
meaning table sugar
and high fructose corn syrup,

00:00:56.292 --> 00:01:00.196
with no evidence for a negative effect
of the fructose in whole fruit. 

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:02.533
This apparent inconsistency
might be explained

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:05.222
by the positive effects
of other nutrients

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:07.546
(e.g., fiber and antioxidants)
in fresh fruit.

00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:09.409
Well, let's find out.

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:13.447
If people drink a glass of water
with 3 tbsp. of table sugar in it,

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:15.111
which is like a can of soda,

00:01:15.236 --> 00:01:19.887
this is the big spike in blood sugar
you get within the first hour. 

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:22.776
Our body freaks out
and releases so much insulin

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:26.018
to drive down the spike
we actually overshoot,

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:29.279
and by the second hour
we’re relatively hypoglycemic,

00:01:29.404 --> 00:01:31.793
dropping our blood sugar
below where they it was

00:01:31.918 --> 00:01:33.718
before we drink the sugar.

00:01:33.987 --> 00:01:35.252
In response,

00:01:35.377 --> 00:01:39.628
our body dumps fat into our blood stream
as if we’re starving,

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:43.587
because our blood sugars just dropped
so suddenly below fasting levels.

00:01:43.712 --> 00:01:45.262
Our body got worried.

00:01:45.904 --> 00:01:50.989
What if you add blended berries
in addition to the sugar? 

00:01:51.114 --> 00:01:52.864
Like a berry smoothie?

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:55.583
They have sugars
of their own in them,

00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:58.684
an additional tablespoon
of sugar worth,

00:01:58.809 --> 00:02:01.728
so the blood sugar spike
should be worse, right? 

00:02:01.853 --> 00:02:06.040
No, not only
no additional blood sugar spike,

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:11.222
here’s the critical part,
no hypoglycemic dip afterwards. 

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:15.015
Blood sugar just went up and down
without that overshoot,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.461
and without the surge
of fat into the blood.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.270
This difference may be attributed

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.875
to the semisolid consistency
of the berry meals,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.602
which may have decreased
the rate of stomach emptying

00:02:26.727 --> 00:02:29.342
compared with just
guzzling sugar water.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.995
In addition, the soluble fiber
in the berries has a gelling effect

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.861
in our intestines
that slows the release of sugars.

00:02:36.405 --> 00:02:39.959
To test to see if it was the fiber,
they repeated the experiment

00:02:40.084 --> 00:02:44.378
with berry juice that had all the sugar
but none of the fiber.

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:48.395
As you can see, a clear difference
was observed early on

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.370
in the blood sugar insulin responses,
at the 15 minute mark.

00:02:51.495 --> 00:02:54.477
The blood sugar spike was significantly
reduced by the berry meals

00:02:54.602 --> 00:02:56.288
but not by the juices,

00:02:56.762 --> 00:03:00.608
but the rest of the beneficial responses
like at 90 minutes

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:04.056
were almost the same
between the juice and the whole fruit,

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.596
suggesting that fiber
may just be part of it.

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:11.228
It turns out there are
fruit phytonutrients that inhibit

00:03:11.353 --> 00:03:14.491
the transportation of sugars
through the intestinal wall

00:03:14.616 --> 00:03:16.517
into our blood stream.

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:20.355
Phytonutrients in foods
like apples and strawberries can block

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.835
some of the uptake of sugars
by the cells lining our intestines.

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:26.860
Adding berries can actually blunt

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:29.446
the insulin spike
from high glycemic foods.

00:03:29.827 --> 00:03:32.907
Here’s what white bread does
to our insulin levels

00:03:33.032 --> 00:03:34.753
within 2 hours after eating it.

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:38.653
Eat that same white bread
with some berries though,

00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:40.621
and you’re able to blunt the spike.

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:44.859
So even though you’ve effectively added
more sugars, in the form of berries,

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:47.923
there’s less of an insulin spike,

00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:52.202
which has a variety of potential
short and long-term benefits. 

00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.950
So if you’re going to make pancakes,

00:03:56.075 --> 00:03:59.615
make sure they’re blueberry pancakes.
