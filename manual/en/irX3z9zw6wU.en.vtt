hi I'm Joe wiesenfelder senior editor
of cars. com getting a sneak peek here at

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.029
the chicago auto show it at the GMC
denali XT concept art now this is

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.410
interesting because it's a pickup truck
but it's based on our platform and it

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.500
has a large interior more like an SUV
but with a cargo bed in the back now the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.239
general EXT is a two-mode hybrid this
one's a little bit unfamiliar with a 4.9

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:35.750
litre v8 it's not quite the size we're
used to seeing another interesting thing

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.469
is it

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.850
it runs on e85 ethanol it's a flex-fuel
vehicle so you have the combination of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.839
better fuel efficiency from having a
hybrid and you can run it on a renewable

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.570
fuel source that comes from the United
States obviously if you gotta pick up

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.210
you need a cargo bed and this one has
one but beyond that it has a GM

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.460
exclusive feature the mid gate which
folds down when you fold the back seat

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.320
forward and it gives you a very long
cargo area extends into the cabin now

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.409
you'll notice that the window here
doesn't come out but it's still a very

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.660
large past three down low so here's the
big advantage to having a big date you

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.350
get the best of both worlds you get the
cargo space and then raise the mid gate

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.180
lower the seat cushion have a decent
amount of room carry the family around

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.160
now you've got the rear-wheel-drive
tunnel help here in the middle which is

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.780
kind of unavoidable but if there's no no
this is a car based platform unibody

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.230
platform which means it's actually more
space-efficient so if you are in a truck

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.360
based vehicle like this you would have
less room inside or the car would have

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.950
to ride higher in some way you would end
up with something larger on the outside

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.510
to get what we're getting here on the
inside this is a very luxurious interior

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.480
because it's a concept car we don't know
if that would reflect what you would

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.160
really get if they built this but has to
meet 3d gauges an indicator that tells

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.970
you when regenerative braking is
happening that's when it's recharging

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.060
the battery and stuff like the pulsing
start/stop button and control screen

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.650
here

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.750
nice touch so the denali xt is a trial
balloon for GMC to see what people in

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.610
the other shows think about this type of
vehicle small car based pickup truck

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.849
other than others like this before for
example there's the honda ridgeline

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.379
which hasn't done as well as hoped the
question is are things different enough

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:34.540
now with fuel prices as high as they are
and we'll elements like the mid gate

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.409
that gives you more flexibility with
cargo and passengers be enough to make

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:44.290
this one worth building for additional
information on this car or any other go

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.810
