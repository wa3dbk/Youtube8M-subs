00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.340
The number one thing you're gonna need when
it comes to gear, is an infant car seat.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.550
Most hospitals will not let you leave the
hospital without an infant car seat for your

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.550
baby.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.880
It's a safety thing, very important.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.770
So, you're gonna wanna look into these.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:22.900
I've had the same one.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.930
I actually have a Graco.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.040
I've had it since 2004 with my first baby,
and I've never had a problem with it.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.960
Number two thing I'm gonna list in the baby
gear department is, what's called a car seat

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.540
carrier, okay?

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.840
This is made by...

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.949
Graco makes one, Universal makes one, and
basically, what this is, is it's a form of

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.380
a mini stroller.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.399
It's very inexpensive, or relatively, it's
like 50 or 60 bucks.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.329
You can put your car seat on top and it's
an easy thing for you to use if you're getting

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.760
in and out of your car, you're getting in
and out of cabs, and it's a very easy thing

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.489
for you to have in the early days.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.050
And actually, one of the things that occurred
to me with my last baby, number five, is like,

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.050
whoa!

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.050
You know what?

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.229
You got the car seat, you got the car seat
carrier, you really don't need a stroller

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.550
for at least the first couple of months.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.100
You could take your time and look at all the
strollers out there and really analyze what

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.140
kind of stroller you need.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.390
But you can get by, for a long time with just
the car seat and the car seat carrier.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.660
Okay, couple of words about strollers.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.570
I've had the same stroller since 2004.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.210
I have had a Bugaboo.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.520
At the time, it seemed crazy.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.219
It was like the Cadillac of strollers.

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.049
It's very expensive, but I found the quality
to be unmatched.

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.670
I've never had a problem with it.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.970
This, however, is not something you can use
if you're like going to the mall, going to

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.549
the grocery store, in and out of your car
all the time.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.800
I've seen a lot of Inglesinas coming back.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.070
People really like those strollers.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.590
Peg Peregos are great.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.590
Take your time.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.600
This is something you're gonna wanna spend
time on.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.950
Number four thing in terms of baby gear, I
would really consider investing in a BabyBjörn

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.570
or a sling.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.570
This is a great thing.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.640
It's great for walking outside with your baby,
especially when you're baby is quite light.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.299
It's a great thing for when your baby gets
fussy, especially during that fussy time in

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.480
the late afternoon, you could put the baby
in the Björn if you can't get your baby to

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.140
stop crying and you can go about your business,
you can even safely cook dinner, or get some

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.340
emails done, or whatever.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.340
It frees up your hands.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.909
It's a really nice way to keep your baby comforted
and to travel with your baby.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.150
Slings are also very popular, so consider
those.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.150
Okay.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.640
So, let me just sum up here, what are the
sort of gear things that you're gonna be wanting

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.420
to get in line as you anticipate the arrival
of your new baby.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420
Okay.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.420
Alright, sorry.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.629
[chuckle] I just got a note from my producer
here, the diaper bag.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.502
You have to have a diaper bag.

00:02:37.502 --> 00:02:38.502
Diaper bags are important.

00:02:38.502 --> 00:02:42.510
You really can't have a regular bag, because
you got too much stuff that you need to organize.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.040
You are gonna have to have bottles, you have
to have something that's waterproof, you're

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.430
gonna want little areas for diapers, for a
changing pad, for a bra pad, for whatever

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.069
else you have going on, outfits.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.340
It's really just not practical to throw all
this into a regular bag, especially bottles

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.340
that you wanna keep upright.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.599
So, you have to invest in a diaper bag.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.170
One more essential item is a baby monitor.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.849
I found a sound monitor for the baby to be
super useful when I was away from the baby's

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:08.849
room.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:09.849
Okay.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:10.849
So, that's the gear.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.860
Let me put up a graphic just to walk you guys
through exactly what you're gonna need in

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.860
the baby gear department.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:23.019
Carrier, a stroller, car seat, a car seat
carrier, a stroller, a BabyBjörn or a sling,

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.220
a diaper bag, and a baby monitor.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.910
Okay, what am I gonna need for my baby in
the house in order for my baby to be able

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.110
to play and be a little bit independent?

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.360
Now, the number one thing you need, this is
not just for travel, is the Pack 'n Play.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.650
The Pack 'n Play is a really great and useful
thing.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.250
It's great for travel, but it's also great
in the home because you can bring your baby

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.010
around with you wherever you are.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.800
If you wanna have your baby sleep in the room,
they can sleep with you in the Pack 'n Play.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.700
If you wanna bring your baby with you into
the kitchen, your baby can be in the Pack

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.700
'n Play.

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.410
And as time goes on, you can put safe toys
in the Pack 'n Play and your baby can play

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.370
safely in the Pack 'n Play.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.049
Number two, and to me, this is absolutely
essential, is the bouncy seat.

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.209
Absolutely essential.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.829
I feed my baby, get her burped, and then,
I stick her for a little bit in the bouncy

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:16.329
seat because she's upright, she can continue
to digest the milk, it's better than placing

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.591
her in a reclined position, and I actually
like the bouncy seats with the lights, with

00:04:21.591 --> 00:04:23.870
the music, with the vibration.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.020
Some people are critical of these.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.280
They think they're bad for babies.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.530
They think they're over stimulating, but I've
never had an issue with these.

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:30.530
And you know what?

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.990
All my kids so far seem to be turning out
fine.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.002
They read, they don't seem to have an issue
with over stimulation, and believe me, they

00:04:36.002 --> 00:04:39.750
all spent plenty of time in that overstimulating
bouncy seat.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.180
And that is the way that I survived.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.220
So, okay.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.490
Play mat or gym.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.710
These things are great.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.840
You can get these, again, with music, with
lights, they've got fun little animals.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.820
This is a very nice soft place to put your
baby either on the carpet or on a hardwood

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.750
floor and it's a nice place for the baby to
play.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.360
You might even find that your baby rolls around
for the first time in this play gym.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.070
So, that's a really, really nice thing.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.830
So, let me put up a graphic, so that you guys
won't forget any of this.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.530
Okay, Pack 'n Play, bouncy seat, and a play
mat or a gym.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.770
I hope that this show has helped you figure
out exactly what you're gonna need to have,

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.139
to get your baby around and have your baby
play safely at home, and all the best of luck

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.630
in bringing home your new baby.
