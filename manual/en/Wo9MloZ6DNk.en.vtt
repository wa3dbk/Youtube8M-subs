00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.700
Installing a SSD or solid state drive in your new Dell notebook or ultrabook PC 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.300
has many advantages over the older hard disk drives,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.840
like faster boot times and longer battery life.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.420
And they are easy to install too, here's how.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.700
But before you begin there are a couple things you need to know.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.700
 First, if you're installing an SSD in a new computer, setup will be a breeze,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.300
just make sure you have the install discs that came with your computer.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.040
Otherwise, you will need to backup or clone your existing drive.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.020
And before upgrading anything in your computer,

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 it's always a good idea to make sure your system BIOS is up-to-date.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.500
Check Dell's website before you begin.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.440
Next, your work surface should be clean and you should ground yourself first by touching

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.260
 an unpainted metal surface to prevent damage to any components.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.900
And lastly, in many cases, a simple Phillips head screw driver is all you'll need 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.040
to replace the hard drive in your notebook computer.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.040
With your computer shutdown, remove the power adapter and the battery. 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.360
And just to be sure all the remaining power is drained from the computer

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.140
press the power button after the battery is removed.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.680
Next, find where the hard drive is located.Usually on the underside of your computer.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.720
If you have trouble finding it, check Dell's website first.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.520
Now, unscrew and remove the cover and you should have a good view of the old hard drive in your computer.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.880
Each model will be slightly different, but carefully remove the screws,

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.880
to disconnect the SATA and power connector,

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.040
usually by sliding the drive away from the connection to remove the drive from the computer.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.560
And if you have a supporting bracket, like we do, remove it and set it aside.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.140
When installing the new SSD drive,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.800
re-attach any brackets that were used on the old drive to the new SSD drive first.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.670
And it's important the SATA and power connection is 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.740
securely connected when you slide the SSD into the drive bay.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.420
It'll fit snugly, but don't force it in.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.860
Screw it into place.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.380
Replace the cover and the battery, now flip the computer back over and turn the computer on.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.020
You may be alerted that there's no operating system,

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.560
just insert the original install discs that came with your computer and restart again and boot from the CD-ROM.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.860
Just follow the prompts to install the operating system and restore from a backup.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.360
And that's it. If you have any other questions or need additional help installing a SSD in your computer,
