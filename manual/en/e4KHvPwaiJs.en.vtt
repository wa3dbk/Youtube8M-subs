00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.560
At the couch of your best friend

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.420
My name is Willem Nieuwland, 45 years 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.740
This morning I stepped into my favorite car to get here...

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740
I mean my Ami 6

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.940
A Citroën from the sixties

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.120
A car with good memories about from my childhood

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.360
My parents had several of them

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.780
So, a good reason for choosing this car

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:37.660
Another reason is I admire Citroën for the technology, it always was progressive

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.800
And the Ami is a good example, both in design and technology

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.560
Technology is based on the well known 2CV

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.860
The technics are fairly simple...

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.920
...so I am able to do much work on it myself

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.240
My name is Hans van der Meulen, 42 years...

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.240
...and proud owner of a Ami8 Break

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.320
My fathers first car was a Citroën Dyane...

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.480
...and we, the kids, loved the car very much...

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.020
... and when I got my driverslicense...

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.360
... and I really needed to have a Citroën. At home I have a poster with all Citroën models on it

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.660
As I looked at it I saw the Ami, the Break. Such a handsome one

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.920
We bougth this Ami in 1990

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.060
We went to France with it several times

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.280
I bought several Ami's after that but this one...

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.800
...because it was my first, I always kept

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.940
The other 2, from which Willem is driving one...

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:51.780
...I had to sell because I owned 3 oldtimers and it went too costly to maintain them all

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.800
I love riding it, also for daily travelling

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.440
Technology is fairly simple and...

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.640
...when I can't manage, I just can ask others in our club...

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.640
...how things should be done

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.420
And most of the time someone will help out

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.020
In my youth I stayed many hours on the backseat of the Ami6 and Ami8

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.880
I have lots of memories of travelling through France for holidays

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.940
Riding small French roads with fairly high speed

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.100
The hot leatherette that was very popular at the time

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.920
These things I never forget...

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.460
... and see them again in the eyes of my own children

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.040
Well, my first ride in an Ami, I was astonished by the behaviour of the car

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.600
I only was passenger with my father before...

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.420
... and finally driving one myself was quite an experience

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.740
The little space it offers...

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.140
... and you have to get use to the speed

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140
You must be in no hurry

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.080
But finally it will bring you in a relaxed mood...

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.820
...and things gets less important

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.120
Enjoying, with a big smile

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.580
Actually, everybody shows a big smile...

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.900
...the car is apparently appealing

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.500
The car has a high cuddle factor

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.920
It finally turned into a kind of lifestyle over time

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.440
The Citroën Ami6 was introduced in 1961...

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.840
...and was meant to close the huge gap between the 2CV and the ID/DS

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.320
They had the same chassis in mind to save costs...

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.780
...and in a way they succeeded 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.040
It is a comfortable car. Anough space for 4 people. It suits a family fine

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.280
Typical for an Ami is the sound

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.380
The very well known 2CV boxer engine sound

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.000
It has very soft seats. seats you would like in front of your TV at home

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.540
Extremely soft suspension, so you can take every bump in the road at any speed you like

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.980
All my life I worked in the automotive industry, working on modern cars...

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.380
...but it doesn't meet driving an oldtimer 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.000
I sit here with a big smile on my face

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You really have to work in this car...

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.220
No break assist, no powered steering

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.860
You have anticipate on the other traffic...

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.860
The car in front of you is equipped with ABS it stops much easier than this car

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.860
So you need more distance

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.440
This is the pure way of driving

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.840
The Ami, and Citroën in general...

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.020
gives some atmosphere, uncommon design

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.400
the urge for new technology

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.460
...an atmosphere of 'Joie de vivre'

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.840
Enjoying live, a glass of wine, baguettes...

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.640
A lot of Citroën adepts also go to France for holidays

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:16.680
End this tells enjoying life comes with this car

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.980
The word 'ami' translates to 'friend' So in our Ami club we have a lot of friends

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:27.280
So, not only the cars are friends but also the people like Hans and myself

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.700
We know each other for 12 years because of these cars

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.600
and it grew into a close friendship

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.840
