00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.740
What has happened to Good Neck?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.420
Well... As you see...

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.960
Our first Good Neck

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.820
is being closed

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.020
I'm planning to

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.080
open a new store

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.960
in Yeon Nam Dong

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.760
Many people came by

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.060
to see Good Neck for the last time

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.960
My friends and acquaintances

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.740
came to share good memories

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.960
We talked all night long

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.280
looking back on the past

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.340
You still look sad

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.480
to talk about it

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.820
I had put a lot of efforts into this place

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.240
so I felt really attached to it

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.980
Right now, it feels like it's time for me

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.900
to face the reality once again...

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960
It took me 3 months to work on this place

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.920
and paint it...

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.640
Every corner of this place is very meaningful to me

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.760
I feel sad to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.260
tear down this place...

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.500
What is your most memorable memory of this place?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.340
Each and every one...

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.460
But when the famous soccer player

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.460
Son Heung Min

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.960
came here to drink and play soccer

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.480
I felt really proud

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.700
I was very happy!

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.740
This wall was like

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.160
the icon of Good Neck

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.540
Now, I have to say goodbye...

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.500
I'll start breaking this down

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.460
I'm really going to start!

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.260
I feel so tired...

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.240
Now, I'll head to our new store in Yeon Nam Dong

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.420
Bye!

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.180
What a nice day!

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.320
It's been 3 months already

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.520
While I was working on this place alone

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.380
I got the desire to make it more perfect

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.200
So the grand opening has been delayes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.140
But I'm satified with this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.280
You look more happy

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.500
than the last time we saw you

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.300
Do I look happy?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.940
I feel better

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.680
than the last time

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.060
because I'm making a new start

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.400
I don't know if you would have noticed

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.740
the entrance looks like the number, 7

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620
I have a thing for the number

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.760
seven

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.040
And I restored the old signboard

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.380
exactly the same way!

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.400
I didn't want to change

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.480
the whole thing

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.920
Welcome!

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.900
I left this spot empty because

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.640
I wanted to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.860
let any customers

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.020
who has an intereting idea

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.240
to make use of this place as they wish

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.740
The more fun people, the more excitement

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.160
I'll get for running this business!

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.240
What is the biggest difference

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.340
from the former Good Neck?

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.060
We used to sell both coffees and beers

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.340
but now we are focusing only on beers

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.400
We saw that HYEOKOH visited this place

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.460
Yeah, they came several times

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.920
They came here to celebrate

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.860
after their showcase too

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.820
I think we became friends really fast

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.480
because we are alike

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.380
What?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.360
No...

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.240
I'm your big fan!

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.940
How about watching

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.340
the first episode of 'Good Neck TV' here?

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.680
I'm haven't seen this for a long time

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.340
I think...

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.380
We had filmed this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.340
before the 2014 Brazil World Cup

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.220
Maybe it was last May

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.360
Exactly a year has passed

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.100
You are right!

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.840
It's been a year

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.860
It's so hard to meet the ICONtv!

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.280
While I was running the previous store

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.840
I was busy enjoying my own life

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.000
I made use of the place as a workplace

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.600
and a pub

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.340
come to think of it...

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.420
But now that I moved here

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.600
I have ambition

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.700
to run a real pub

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.460
To behave more like the owner of this place

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.480
I have rolled up my sleeves for cleaning

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.940
My attitude toward this business has been changed

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.000
I've been working hard!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.760
This is it!

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.620
This is the 'Good Neck'

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.260
of Chritiano Ronaldo!

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.200
It's made of real gold

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.020
Oh, really?

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.960
I was just kidding...

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.980
I've been always waiting for this moment

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.340
I had times when I

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.300
longed to live an entirely free life

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.120
But I'm past all those times

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.920
Now, my life needs some realignment

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.600
I had played too much!

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.500
You seem very confident

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.280
about how you'll look

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.260
on this episode of 'Good Neck TV'

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.020
Why shouldn't I?

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.180
I'll look just as myself!

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.640
To anyone who visits us

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.900
after watching the ICONtv

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.460
I'll give you a glass of beer for free

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.400
Good Neck!

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.720
Should we end it like this?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120
I think we have done enough talking

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.620
See you again!

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.280
Bye!
