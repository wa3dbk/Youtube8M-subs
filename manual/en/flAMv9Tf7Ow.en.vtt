Hello, my name is Gordon Johnson.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.940
You are now on tbilaw.com, which is a webpage
that I have had on the Internet since 1996.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.730
This video is now being shot at a time that
I have changed the title of tbilaw.com from

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.070
the Brain Injury Information page to Crashing
Minds.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.800
Why the title Crashing Minds?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.830
Well Crashing Minds is a book that I have
been writing for the last couple years and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.610
it seemed like it was time to incorporate
some of the themes of that book in TBILaw.com

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.140
which has hundreds and hundreds of pages of
information on it since I put it up in the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.360
mid 1990s.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.980
I use the term crashing minds because the
brain in a brain injury does crash in similar

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.379
ways to what your computer might do if you
in fact overload it and/or did something to

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.879
make it crash.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.640
Now there's no comparison to the devastation
of a brain injury to a computer crash, but

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.060
as we begin to understand the way in which
computers work, the average person now knows

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.890
what RAM is and a hard drive is, it becomes
easier for me to explain similar processes

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.040
that happen inside the brain when there's
a brain injury.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.690
I'm not a doctor, I'm a lawyer.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.970
I've been writing about brain injury virtually
my entire career as a personal injury lawyer.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.900
These pages have information I've learned
on them , both when undertook the massive

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.970
undertaking to really understand brain injury
when I became a brain injury specialist, but

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.550
also what I've learned from listening to you,
the people with brain injury, my clients,

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.850
loved ones, family members of my clients,
and the things that I've learned in the years

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.600
of doing battle with doctors who were hired
by defense and insurance companies to basically

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.960
deny that anything we know to be true could
be true.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.140
Tbilaw.com is really not like anything you're
going to read in a medical book.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.580
It does have medical science as its primary
basis, but it's not written like a doctor

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.260
would write for another doctor, and it's not
written like a brain injury survivor would

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.030
write for another brain injury survivor.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.250
The goal is to combine a technical understanding
of brain injury with the communication skills

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.140
both written and verbal that I have developed
in my career as both a journalist and a writer

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.240
and also as a lawyer, but to combine those
things in a way where I can teach, I can inform,

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.870
and I can advocate.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.740
We hope that these pages are self-accrediting
to you that you will see yourselves, you will

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.480
see your loved ones in these pages and through
them you will in fact get a better sense of

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.140
what is ahead and what it is that you need
to learn, you need to do, to ensure the best

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.260
recovery for you or your loved one.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.930
Throughout our web advocacy we have seen three
basic themes that come up.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.420
The questions come up over and over again.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.400
The first is someone is in a coma, their loved
one is in a coma, and the doctors are all

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.790
saying, the only information the doctors are
giving is that you will just have to wait

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.110
and see.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.570
Well predicting the outcome of a coma while
someone is still in a coma is a very very

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.700
difficult thing to do, there is legitimate
information, and it's a very important time

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.870
for the family member to learn as much as
possible about brain injury.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.040
The second theme is that you suffered a concussion,
your family member had suffered a concussion,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.680
and the doctors are saying everything's going
to be better, and when you are a week after

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.069
the concussion, a month after the concussion,
that's what you want to hear, and it may in

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.220
fact be the case, but for a significant minority
of people, 10 to 15 percent of the people,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.169
that may not be the case, and the doctor's
advice that everything will go away, don't

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:23.560
worry, you'll be fine in six months, isn't
always true, and for the significant subset,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.889
the significant minority of people, there
needs to be more information, there needs

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.380
to be more assistance and more focus has to
be beyond long-term recovery and we've tried

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.990
to address that issue.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:44.910
The third major issue is what is almost a
complete devoid of information about the long-term

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:51.430
potential disability that can come either
after a severe brain injury or after concussion.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.620
In the concussion cases it is obvious why
that information isn't given; because in concussion

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.870
cases the doctors don't think there could
be any disability, but remarkably there's

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.850
still very little information given about
the long-term consequences, long-term behavioral

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.230
changes after a severe brain injury.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.480
In the severe brain injury case there is this
huge focus of care and attention in the first

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.639
90 days; hopefully it extends out for a year,
but once you've gotten away from the neurosurgeon's

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.990
care, once you're outside of the requisite
number of speech pathology visits or physical

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:33.210
therapy visits, then there's very very little
done given information provided and focus

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.080
on long-term recovery.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.330
We started a project called TBI Voices a little
over two years ago and we've offered almost

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.449
daily installments of the voices of people
who survived injury, primarily severe injury,

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.240
and what their life was like as they went
through it and what's it's like now.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.670
We are creating new pages as we go that incorporates
what we've learned from listening to the TBI

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:06.430
stories on TBI voices to help people understand
the future impact of brain injury.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:12.270
To help them understand the long-term symptoms
that they may suffer.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.900
We hope that you click on it.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.150
We hope that you find what you need here.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.620
We hope that you will come back.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.460
We hope that you will use tbilaw.com, crashing
minds, as your troubleshooting guide for the

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.590
challenges that are ahead for those with brain
injury.
