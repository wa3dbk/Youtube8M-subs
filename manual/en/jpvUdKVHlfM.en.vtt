In the ongoing quest to add to even more videos
to your Inbox, AppSpy is proud to introduce

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.850
this new segment - our weekly news wrap-up.
What can you expect? Well, other than dropping

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.530
a highlight on some of the significant news
of the week I'll also be naming our game of

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.680
the week and in the future we might be organizing
competitions through this mini-vodcast. For

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.940
those concerned about the re-use of the 'top
list' footage, new overlays and intros are

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.250
in the pipeline, but for now... courage.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.570
First up! It's no surprise that a great game
can be made even better when a developer is

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.870
able to take the time to continue to support
it after its release. Bumpy Road by Simogo

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
was already a fantastically enjoyable title,
but a recent update has taken things even

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.200
further by adding new tracks and additional
modes to add a little more value for your

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.200
dollar.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.050
Bullet-hell lovers beware, CAVE has announced
the upcoming release of Deathsmiles for the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.879
iOS. The gothic-themed side-scroller from
2007 has already passed its way through the

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.540
Xbox 360 and now iDevice users get to experience
the intense madness of this shooter title.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.070
New features for this release include another
character, along with a new story (following

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.830
on from the original campaign) complete with
RPG elements. I'm a sucker for shooters and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.990
anything that sounds and looks like Symphony
of the Night, so I guess I'll be set once

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.070
this puppy launches. A release date is yet
to be announced.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.210
In a talk with Computer and Video Games, Bioshock
creator Ken Levine let slip that the iPhone

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.350
might be his next port-of-call for developing
a game, saying, 'Some mornings I wake up and

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.000
go, "I'm going to make a turn-based iPhone
game, and do it in three months". To be fair,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.310
this is hardly a promise and I'm sure just
about every developer has mused about taking

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.780
some time out to plonk a game on to the App
Store - then again, it's possible we may have

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.530
already seen where this will end up. Anyone
else disappointed we didn't get Bejewelled

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.780
in Bioshock 2?

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.210
Lastly, don't forget to take advantage of
the sales for Father's Day. Gameloft and EA

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.690
have both gone a bit crazy and games like
Ganstar: Miami Vindication, Spider-Man: Total

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.860
Mayhem, Real Football 2011, FIFA 11, Need
for Speed Hot Pursuit, RISK and Fight Night

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.560
Champion are all going for dirt cheap. Check
out their catalogs on the App Store and bulk

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.600
up on your catalog of time-wasters.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.930
Now, seeing as the Wrap-up is a new feature,
instead of one game of the week I'm going

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:14.530
to hand out two - if you're an impulse buyer,
you may want to hide your wallet. For this

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.719
week my stamp of approval definitely has to
go towards Rocket Bunnies - it simply oozes

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.900
with humor and manic charm and if we can expect
more Android titles like this for the App

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.569
Store, I say 'bring it on'. Speaking of ooze,
last week's thumbs up goes to Feed Me Oil;

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.730
mastering the creation of complex machines
to feed terrain-defining monsters has never

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.010
been more fun.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.000
And that's the wrap-up for 17th of June, 2011.
As always I'll be working to kick things up

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.049
a notch so look out for next week's installment
of this new segment. You can subscribe to

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.510
us via Twitter, Facebook and RSS - and seeing
as it's a Follow Friday, don't forget to spread

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.970
the love!
