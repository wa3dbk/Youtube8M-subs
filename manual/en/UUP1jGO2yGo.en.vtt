00:00:08.208 --> 00:00:09.458
When I was young,

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.417
I was very fortunate to see a potter
when I was 12 years old

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.292
and watched him throw on the wheel,

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.166
and I just thought it was magical.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.792
That initial pull when the clay
goes from a lump

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:25.083
up into a vessel just within seconds
in front of you, just--

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:26.417
still, it is magic.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.959
I was taught by my grandmother.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.500
She started teaching me
at the age of 5

00:00:31.584 --> 00:00:34.292
at a little basket stand
on Highway 17,

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:36.375
and by the time I was a teenager,

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.500
I already knew how to make
every type of baskets

00:00:39.584 --> 00:00:40.917
my grandma had taught me.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.750
When Angela and I first met,
she began teaching me her lifelong craft.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:49.333
It took me two weeks
to do my very first basket.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:53.625
And I was so proud of it,
I gave it to my pastor for his birthday.

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:57.208
My mother majored in art
and gave me paints when I was little.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:59.917
So one of my earliest memories
is sitting on the kitchen floor

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.041
and drawing and coloring
while she was cooking.

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.500
I never wanted to do, really,
anything else.

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:06.917
In today's society,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.625
we are so used to the same stuff
that everybody else has.

00:01:10.709 --> 00:01:15.000
Potters, on the other hand, are saying,
"Unh-unh. You're an individual.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:19.375
I'm gonna let you drink out of something
that there are no two alike

00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:22.959
because you're not the same
as anybody else.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.625
I always start my baskets
the same way,

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:28.709
and as I have an idea
of what I want it to be

00:01:28.792 --> 00:01:33.417
my hands basically let me know
what the finished product is going to be.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.041
Our ancestors,
they gave us a good start.

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:39.333
So now we're getting more
and more creative.

00:01:39.417 --> 00:01:42.667
If you have the dream to do it,
you can create it.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.125
South Carolina has a range of places
that are incredibly enticing

00:01:48.208 --> 00:01:50.000
to view and to paint.

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.750
Being connected to a space
where I grew up,

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.876
where my family grew up,
where I have a long connection

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.458
that goes deep makes a big difference
in how I paint it.

00:02:00.542 --> 00:02:03.709
Art is actually communication

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:07.417
because I think art is what happens
in between people.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
As an artist, what I'm trying to do
is connect with the viewer

00:02:10.584 --> 00:02:13.000
and give them a little bit
of the experience

00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.125
that I had when I was observing
the landscape

00:02:16.208 --> 00:02:18.000
through the way
that I've handled the paint.

00:02:18.083 --> 00:02:22.584
What I want people to take
when they see sweetgrass baskets

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:27.083
is not only getting a piece
of South Carolina art,

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:32.876
but they're actually getting the history
of that basket maker's family

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.584
because this was passed down
through the generations in that family.
