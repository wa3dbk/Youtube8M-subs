00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.120
So as I began to explore what I wanted to
do with my life I really became so focused

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.310
on the different access to resources and opportunities
that different people have.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:28.060
And how that influences what happens generation
after generation after generation.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.330
So I was always fascinated by power, I was
always fascinated by, you know, what makes

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.600
places the places that they are.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.239
Who decided that?

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.110
And, where's the money going?

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.019
And so, when I went to urban planning school,
I think I was somewhat of an outlier.

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.739
There were a lot of people there who were
drawing maps and writing reports and doing

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.670
all these technical functions, but not ever
stopping to think about fundamentally, where

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.510
are our resources going?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.439
And how are those decisions being made?

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:10.770
Ended up enrolling in a two year City and
Regional Planning Master's degree.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.399
And I thought, 'Great, this is where we'll
really get down to these issues that I've

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.310
been living through my whole life.'

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.890
And, when I got there nobody wanted to talk
about power.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:34.370
Nobody wanted to talk about how places became
they way they are, talk about money, talk

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.569
about resources, talk about decision making.

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:46.289
There were a handful of us and in my cohort
group of 30+ those of us who were asking those

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.070
questions, we were all students of color.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:02:00.939
One was from Latin America, one was African
American, one was Filippino, there was myself

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.600
and one was Chinese.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.819
And there we were, the five musketeers.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:17.390
And we had a group we called Student of Color
in Planning where we were trying to fill in

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.410
the gaps of what we saw the actual underpinning
to everything we were learning was, but that

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.750
no one was talking about.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.420
Boy is born.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.480
He is beautiful, as everyone is.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.160
He is brown, like his parents.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.960
He is loved.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.160
He grows.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.840
One day coming from school cops stop boy.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.190
Cops do not love boy, tell boy so.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.260
Call him stupid.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.260
Bad.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.260
Stupid.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.260
Ugly.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Brown.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.260
Black.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.260
Black.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.260
Brown.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.260
Ugly.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.260
Call him stupid.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.260
Bad.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.450
Ugly.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:21.540
T.V. tells boy what cops say, true.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.950
Teachers show boy, they believe what cops
say, true.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:42.250
News say, tube say, people say, seem like
even steeples say, what cops say, true.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.050
Boy blue.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.820
You know, when I get the occasion and I don't
get it very often to sit down and do trainings

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.250
or workshops with law enforcement officers.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.890
One of the things I do, usually in the first
five minutes, is to ask them.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.540
What's the very first thing you think when
you see a young Black or Latino male driving

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.200
a nice car in your community?

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.390
And almost invariably and with very few exceptions,
including among the officers of color, they

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.710
will respond, 'probably a drug dealer.'

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.930
I will then ask them, next question.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.010
When you see a young white male, same age,
driving the same kind of car in your community,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.160
what is the first thing you think?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.240
And, almost every time, without exception,
including among the officers of color.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.430
They will say, 'spoiled little rich kid, Daddy
probably bought him a car.'

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.840
Now, on the one level, you know, we've been
together for five minutes, me and these cops

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.610
and we've got a two hour--three hour workshop
coming and they're already outed themselves,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.729
fundamentally, as racist in the sense that
they've acknowledged their perception, which

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.199
is solely based on skin color, is one that
is negative toward--in this case-- black or

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.710
brown kids.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.830
How is that gonna manifest?

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.639
Well, logic tells you, that if you're a police
officer who has that reaction, you may not

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.099
like the spoiled rich kid--in fact you probably
don't--but you're not gonna hassle him because

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:55.849
you're afraid his daddy might have some power.

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:59.770
On the other hand, if you think the black
or brown kid is a dealer, you're gonna stop

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.889
him, you're gonna search him, you're probably
not gonna find anything, according to the

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:04.889
data.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.449
But now you're gonna have his name in the
system, you're gonna be on the lookout for

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.180
his car, you're able to in effect, tag him
as a possible wrongdoer.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.729
And then that's how these folks get caught
up, young black and brown men, in particular,

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.770
in the system being harassed over and over
and over again.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.680
While the white folks, according to the data,
are the ones more likely to have drugs in

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.449
their car, more likely to bring drugs through
airports, the ones that are the least suspected

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.360
are the ones that are actually the ones most
likely to be guilty.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:36.779
So you have the combination of personal bias
and the reality then of systemic mistreatment

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.120
and then the irony of it all, is that it actually
leads you astray and doesn't allow you to

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.120
do your job effectively.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.840
If you're a cop and thinks the black or brown
kid's got drugs and the white kid has drugs,

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.169
you're not even doing your job well.

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.199
So, at some level, you know, these personal
biases not only effect systemic behavior,

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:57.250
but, they actually have profound larger social
consequences, in that, our criminal justice

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.099
resources are really deployed in the completely
wrong areas.

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.719
Brown boy blue.

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.110
Forgets he is loved.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.620
Love does not love him.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.610
To him, only bad love him.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.580
Only black love him.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.460
Cops say, black bad.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:24.259
T.V. say, what cops say is true.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:28.080
Brown boy blue.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.919
Gets his own face misconstrued is what t.v.
say is true.

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.669
Brown boy gets hot, burning red hot.

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:42.479
Brown boy, red hot, get pushed and popped
passed point of control.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:45.650
No one to hold him.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.080
Just scold him.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:53.110
Mold him into what cops say true.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.819
T.V. say, what cops say true.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:04.850
But brown boy just blue.
