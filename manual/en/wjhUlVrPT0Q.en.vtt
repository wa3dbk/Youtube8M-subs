00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.840
This is John Kohler with okraw.com, travelling
here in Chicago, the windy city.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.370
It's windy and it's actually a little bit
snowy, but travelling, and I found this really

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.960
cool place for produce.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.770
Always when I'm driving around I find these
cool places and I don't even plan it that

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.770
way.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.600
So, this place called Stanley's fresh fruit
and fresh vegetables.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.670
It's 1558 North Elton Ave, Chicago.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.390
Phone number 7732768050.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.170
Driving by, and, you know, I saw this in the
window.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.219
There's signs and they say organic navel oranges,
49 cents a pound.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.679
You know, they have a large conventional section
and, you know, a smaller organic section.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:48.999
So, most of the time these kind of stores
don't like me filming inside, but, you know,

00:00:48.999 --> 00:00:55.449
there's another side, organic lemons, 7 for
a buck, and I had, you know, one pint of organic

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.719
blueberries for $1.98.

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.809
So, that's actually insane.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.939
That's actually cheaper than California prices,
here in Chicago where I'm literally freezing

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030
right now.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.350
Here's organic produce section.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.530
Kale's $1.49 a bunch.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.780
There's the small blueberries for 98 cents.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
Carrots.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.670
I mean, I was just over at the whole foods
which is just a few blocks away and they're

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.890
significantly more expensive on all the stuff.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.659
I mean, these are straight up California prices
here, you know.

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.270
I mean, parsley for 98 cents, char $1.49.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.610
Crazy insane prices.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:38.429
Check this out, green leaf lettuce here at
Stanley's, 98 cents.

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.749
Wow.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.799
Here's your organic mangoes, 79 cents, man.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.369
They're not even that cheap in California.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.710
They're 99 cents.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.039
Man, super insane.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.719
Apple, just regular prices, $1.98, $1.49.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:56.159
Best deal is the organic Fuji's.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.250
They have a bag of organic Fuji's, 3 pounds,
for $1.49.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.399
Organic bananas are .79.

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.570
They're .99 over at whole foods, and the organic
navels, .49 cents a pound.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.049
That's an amazing deal.

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.379
Organic lemons 7 for a buck and besides the
organic produce, they even have a larger section

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.670
of nonorganic produce if you choose to eat
nonorganic, although I encourage everybody

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.959
to eat organic as much as possible.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.989
So, hopefully you enjoyed this episode here
at Stanley's.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.040
Once again this is John Kohler with okraw.com,
and, so, come to Chicago, come to Stanley's.
