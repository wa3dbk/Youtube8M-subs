00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Alright, guys. I have had many requests for this, so

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in this video, I'm going to show you how to dual boot your

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
computer. Although I am going to try to make at as

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
easy to follow of a process as possible,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
please do not attempt this unless you know exactly

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
what you are doing because you could really screw up your

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
computer. The purpose of dual booting is to put more than one

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
operating system on a single computer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
For instance, if you like Windows and you like Linux,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but you do not have two separate computers to put them on and

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you do not want to mess with the limitations of Virtual PC's, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
then you could dual boot both of the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
operating systems and be able to put both of them

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
on a computer and run them independently 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
without that many conflicts. There is a lot to go over

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in this video. Let us go ahead and get started.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If you are running a Windows environment and you want to install

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Ubuntu linux as  a dual boot, then there is an

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
easy way to do that if you go to wubi-installer.org.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Wubi is an application that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
installs Ubuntu as a program within

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Windows so that you can add and remove it just

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
like any other program. Once you

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
run the setup for that, you can choose the installation

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
size, the desktop environment, and then put in a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
password and click "install" and it is going to download the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
image, create a partition for it, and set up dual

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
booting on your computer. So when you click "Finish"

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to reboot your computer, you will see a screen like

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
this whenever it boots back up so you can choose either

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Windows to boot to, or Ubuntu.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I just chose Ubuntu and it is going to finish the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Ubuntu installation setup.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And it is going to boot to it

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as if it were installed alone on this computer.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The good thing about using it through Wubi is

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that if you decide in the future you want

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to get rid of Ubuntu and get everything back to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
normal, just go into Windows and go to Add/Remove

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
programs, choose Ubuntu and you can uninstall it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and it will get rid of everything for you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The next thing that you want

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to download is a program called "Iso Recorder".

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This step is for if you just want to partition

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
your hard drive off. "ISO Recorder" is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
a free application that allows you to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
burn ISO files to a cd

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
rather easily. If you don't have Windows,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I think this is Windows only, you can use

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
any other type of burning software like NERO

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or something like that. Just run the setup

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
applicaiton and install ISO

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Recorder. Whenever you are through, close out of all the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
folders and go back to Google and do a search for

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
GParted. Now GParted is a linux

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
distrobution that handles partitions, 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
editing them and formatting

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
them and creating them. You just want

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to download the ISO image for the Live

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
CD of GParted to your computer. And

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
since you have ISO recorder installed, just put in

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
a blank CD, right click on GParted, and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
select "Copy To Image", and it is going to bring

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
up a dialog box that allows you to burn

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
it to a blank cd. Whenever it is through burning

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to the CD, just click "Finish" and reboot your

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
computer. You will notice on the splash screen of your

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
computer, it tells you a button to press to enter setup, mine was DEL,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
but yours may be different. What you want to do is get into

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
setup, and find where it lists

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the order of the boot devices, and make sure you

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
have CDROM listed first and Hard Disk listed

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
second. Your setup may not look like mine, so just

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
mess around with it until you find those options

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and then save the changes and reboot your computer.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, whenver it reboots, it should

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
boot to the GParted CD that is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
in your CD drive. I am just going to go with the default

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
settings for this. If yours does not work, you may

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
want to change up the settings, but this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
gives you the options for the keyboard layout, and then

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the language you prefer, and then if you want to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
start up GParted automatically.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is what GParted looks like. It goes

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
through and tells you the different partitions on your

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
computer.If you want to resize one, just select

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the partition you want to resize and drag the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
slider bar over until you get to the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
size of Gigabytes that you want for the new

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
partition and then click "resize".

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Then select that new partition that you just created

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and click "New" at the top, the "New" button,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and you can choose how you want to format it.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Whether it be NTFS or FAT32. Then just

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
click "Apply" and sit back and wait

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
because it will take a couple of hours for this to finish.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
When it is through, exit out of it and reboot your computer

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and you want to take out the GParted CD

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and put in the CD of the Operating

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
System that you want to install.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The main thing that you want to watch for is

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
whenever it asks you what partition to put it on, be

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
sure to select the partition you created, 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the second partition, because if not, it is going

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to install it on your main partition and wipe out everything

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that is on your computer and you don't want to do that.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
If you get a little carried away with installing stuff on your

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
computer, you might screw up your boot menu and

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
how your system boots. In case that happens, 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there is a pretty cool program that I have found

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to organize all of that, and it is called GAG.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So if you open up a web browser, and do

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
a Google search for

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
"gag boot menu", the first result is going

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to take you to the GAG Graphical Boot Manager

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that you can download. And this just organizes

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
everything to make your boot up

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
process a little bit simpler. Just download

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
it and extract all the files form the zip

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
archive, and you will find an ISO

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
CD somewhere in there. It is called

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
CDROM.ISO. And using ISO

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Recorder, you can burn it to a blank CD

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and whenever you reboot you computer, it is going to boot up

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and you want to hit "4" to install, choose your keyboard

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
layout, and then choose your language.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Then you want to hit "S" to enter setup and then hit "H"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to save it to the hard drive. Then hit "A"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to add a new Operating System. I am going to

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
choose "B" and this is my Windows XP

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
partition, so I am going to type that in. You can even

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
put a password in, if you want, and then change the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
icon for it. So now I am going to hit "A" again and choose "C"

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
this time. This is my Windows Vista partition.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So I am going to put that in and I am not going to put a password

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and then hit "C" for the icon. Now hit

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
"H" again to save everything to your hard drive

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And when you boot your computer back up, 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
you are going to see a menu that looks like this

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and you can choose what you want to boot to.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
If you ever wanted to uninstall it, just

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
boot back up to the GAG CD and choose "5" to

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
uninstall it and when you reboot your computer, 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
it should be back to the way it was before

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
you installed the program. So that is a good way

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to organize your boot process

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and a good way to clear it up if you end up not

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
liking it. So, again, be careful with this if you

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
do it, because you could seriously screw stuff

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
up on your computer. If you have anymore tips, feel free to leave those
