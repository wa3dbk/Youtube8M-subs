00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.600
Well for a long time
scientists and many people

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.533
have been interested
in what environment

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:07.267
did early humans evolve?

00:00:07.267 --> 00:00:08.533
Where did we originate?

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:10.200
Was it the African Savanna?

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.000
The grassland?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.400
Or the Ice Age of Europe?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.200
And so I went to East
Africa to the Great Rift Valley

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.633
to understand something
about the environments

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.967
of early humans.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.000
I kept walking up and
down the eroded gullies and

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.133
hillside and
seeing layer after layer,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.400
and at one layer maybe
the lake was present,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.200
and at another
layer the lake was gone.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.100
There was a drought.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.067
Another layer there was
a forest or a woodland.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:36.400
Another layer a grassland,
and I kept thinking,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.567
"Maybe it wasn't just
one environment where early

00:00:38.567 --> 00:00:42.400
humans evolved but rather
it was the changeability,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.700
the ability the environment
to change back and forth

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.667
between one another that
was the key ingredient in

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.800
how humans evolved and
how we became so adaptable

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.600
-- able to live
anywhere on earth."

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.300
So, if this idea was
right, then early humans,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.800
our ancestors, should
be associated mainly with

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.667
places on earth where
environments changed.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:07.067
And so I went to
that part of the world,

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.067
South China, where there
was the reputation for an

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:12.300
unchanging environment,
a place where there was

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.667
environmental stability of
forest that existed for a

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:19.467
million years, and so I
already knew that Chinese

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:21.900
scientists had
found stone tools there.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.567
So what were early
humans doing there if the

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.200
environment was so stable?

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.667
So I went there, and dug
with my Chinese colleagues,

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.900
and indeed what we found in
the ground were stone tools

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.300
indicating the
early humans were there.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.167
In that layer we
found these also.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:41.200
These are what are
known as tektites.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.667
These are pieces of molten
earth rock that had been

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.400
blown out of the earth
due to a meteor impact

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.467
-- a meteorite impact -- in
Earth's upper atmosphere,

00:01:50.467 --> 00:01:53.600
heating up of the earth in
that region of the world,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.267
and these tektites were
spread all the way the out

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:59.400
of this explosion from
Australia to to southern

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.967
China and these hot objects
burned down the forests,

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:07.067
and so what we think then
is that the early humans,

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.300
the makers of
the stone tools,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.333
were able to come across
that landscape and take

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:14.700
advantage of the
animals that had died,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.200
perhaps some of the
burned meat and burned

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.867
plants that
they could eat...

00:02:19.867 --> 00:02:23.067
it's almost like cooking, and
that they were able to survive

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:26.500
in a landscape that had
been completely devastated,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.467
and they were indeed
creatures of change,

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.867
that they were
adapted to survive on this

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:34.367
changing landscape.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.867
And so it meant that my
idea had some viability,

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:39.467
that it is perhaps correct,

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.533
that it wasn't a bad
idea after all.
