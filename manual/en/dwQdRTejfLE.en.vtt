00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.059
Welcome to Kickstart where you get to see
new products here at AutomationDirect.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.099
Today I am going to show you more of our new
safety products.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.980
We are now offering industrial safety gloves
and sleeves.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.610
9 Styles with 52 new pairs are available and
offer high levels of cut, puncture and impact

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.090
resistance, anti-static as well as arc flash
tested electrical gloves.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.640
Gloves are available in sizes ranging from
extra-small to extra-extra-large, depending

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.860
on glove type.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.480
We have general purpose gloves made of nylon
with polyurethane “auto grip” coatings.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.610
Have you ever had a pair of gloves on and
couldn’t perform a task like installing

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.740
a nut on a bolt?

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.960
A lot of gloves prohibit the full use of fingers
and make it difficult to accomplish small

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.100
tedious tasks.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.190
Well, not these gloves..They work great – right
away I noticed how well the auto grip coating

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:08.130
allowed my fingers to grasp even the smallest
nuts and bolts and allowed assembly with ease.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.970
Here we have leather palm with Velcro wrist
style and are a general work gloves or mechanics

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:15.750
style gloves.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.580
Next up is our Anti-Static gloves.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.560
These are used to protect from electrostatic
build up.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.080
The nylon resi-stat yarn dissipates static
and these are all prewashed and ready for

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.080
use.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.920
Here we have cut resistant nylon knit with
Tilsatec rhino steel core, and a polyurethane

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.670
palm.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.060
Also are our nylon knit with Tilsatec rhino
steel core, but these have NBR foam Nitrile

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.640
palm and back of finger coating and are cut
resistant as well.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.939
Also are these Tilsatec rhino steel core fibers
with reinforced thumb webbing for greater

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.659
cut resistance.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.580
These are a full leather glove made of goatskin
with nylon and Tilsatec rhino steel core liner.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.400
They are arc flash tested and cut resistant.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.579
This glove is often used in railroad, metal
fabrication, glass handling, waste management

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:23.680
and most material handling applications.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.040
These are cut resistant sleeves – 18 inches
long and make of Tilsatec Rhino steel core

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.579
knit that offers excellent protection against
cut.

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.999
These sleeves protect the forearm and palm
and have integrated finger and thumb holes.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.120
Last are our puncture resistant gloves that
are cut and puncture resistant.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.299
They are made of Nylon polyester material
with Tilsatec Rhino steel core and Rhinoguard

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.639
palm.

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:58.340
Some models offer Velcro wrist straps and
some models have rubber knuckle protection.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.180
The manufacture has test videos on their website
showing how the glove resists 25 gauge hypodermic

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.340
needle punctures.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.760
I was impressed with the results!

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.079
All of the cut resistant gloves are tested
under ASTM F1790 and EN388 ratings.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.610
Now, I don’t plan to create my own test
ratings, but simply wanted to show you that

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:33.099
these are tough gloves and can withstand cuts
even from my small pocket knife.

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.809
