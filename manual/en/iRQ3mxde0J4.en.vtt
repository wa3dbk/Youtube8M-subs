00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.100
 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.220
 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.290
Welcome to Ski Talk. I'm Steve Kopitz - the ski buyer and 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.470
Ski-E-O for skis.com and today I've got joining us John Kerkoff

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.590
the 20 Nordica rep.
Yep. Thanks Steve. Appreciate it.
Not that you're 20 years old but...

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.680
I wish I were.
Exactly, so do I.
So, let's talk about the

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.730
Nordica Cruise 110. So, there's 4 boots in the Cruise line.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.860
This is the 110. This is actually a new one in the Cruise line.
It is. It's definitely the flagship in the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.940
collection.
And this is the stiffest boot of that line.
It is and it's

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.010
a true 110 flex on our index.
So, why did Nordica decide to add a

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.180
stiffer boot, a stiffer version of a boot that you guys have had

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.320
a successful line up for quite a while.
Yeah, that's a great question. A couple reasons. One

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.610
is just feedback from the skiers that are out there saying, hey we've got some big guys out there that are strong skiers.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.700
Just have a high volume leg shape or high volume, ya know, foot last looking for more boot

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.760
and it's a straight up, it's a high-performance ski boot.
So, usually when you think of a 104 last

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.890
you think of a more recreational skier but this really for that high-performance skier

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.990
that just has that wider fit and needs that more comfortable...
Right on the mark.
Okay.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.050
So what else does this boot have on it that can help with performance and fit

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.200
and things like that?
Ya know a couple things and one of the more unique technology is something called

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.330
Natural Foot Stance that Nordica created years ago and it's basically an abducted stance

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.380
to give that skier better stance, better balance and, as importantly, easier access

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.440
to the edge of the ski as well so Natural Foot Stance is definitely one of the more unique things.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.570
Okay. It's got four buckles. Are they micro-adjustable?
Oh, for sure. Yep.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.660
All new aluminum hardware that's got great ergonomics in terms of the way it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.720
feels in terms of the way it wraps and grabs your foot. So over the forefoot or at the top of the boot

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.880
it really gives you good closure and precision.
And it's important to know that they are aluminum

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.030
as opposed to plastic so they'll be a lot more durable.
Yep. Absolutely.
And then the top buckle

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.110
has extra adjustability on it, right?
It does. Two interesting things here is one

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.180
we use a macro buckle and this macro buckle makes it easy, tools-free

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.340
to adjust either for a smaller leg shape or a larger leg shape but the other thing we

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.360
ran into...
Can you show them how that works? Because it's kind of cool just how it slides.
Yeah, we kind of call it the MacGuyver buckle.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.450
It just slides back over.
Slides back-and-forth which is nice. The second thing

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.530
I was going to point out is we ran into an issue for a lot of skiers

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.660
with that larger lower leg shape that they also get a ton of forward lean in the boot.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.760
And by doing that, it literally drains your legs.
Because the calf muscle sort of pushes them forward.
Oh yeah.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.820
Exactly. And there is an ideal stance or forward lean that we're looking for

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.990
in a ski boot for the most energy, most conservation of energy. So we actually created something called

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.120
the adjustable cuff profile that allows you to adjust it fore or

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.230
aft to dial it exactly the right stance for each and every skier.
Okay.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.270
Great. So, I also wanted to point out, they probably can't see it at home but

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.330
it's got clear windows on the shell which allows you to kind of see into the liner

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.420
which I think is very cool.
Yep. Translucent shell, actually a performance

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.490
upgrade too, it gives you a better wrap. That shell is going adjust, you know, somewhat to the foot

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.660
which is really nice. You know, again, pin back here so it's got a lot of response

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.790
to the boot in terms of progressive, flex and rebound too.
So, it's not just that it's clear,

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.880
it's also softer allowing it to overlap the foot a little better.
Bingo.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.900
Okay, it's got side cant on it, correct?
Lateral cuff adjustment.
Or lateral cuff, I always call it cant but really

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.050
really cuff. What about the liner? What can you tell us about that?
It's again

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.160
it's a liner that should be in a $600 boot. It's our highest

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.240
performance called Precision Fit Liner so it's the most dense, most precise.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.290
It's actually a different zone so it really takes a great solid form to your foot.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.420
Yeah, it's a little bit of furry corduroy on it.
This is plush.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.510
Heated leather seats is my joke on this one.
Okay, so this is

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.580
the 110 flex. Let's talk about the customer who needs a 110 flex boot.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.730
Ski anywhere. Anywhere on any mountain any time. You know, pow day,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.830
Spring corn, steeper pitches, you know, again, if you're an 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.900
intermediate skier who's athletic looking to aspire to the next level - bingo. If you're already there,

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.950
this one will fit you right as well.
Okay, perfect. Did we forget anything?

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.070
No. It's loaded.
And from a price standpoint, this is a very economical

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.150
boot. It's a $399 retail. It's got features on it that you find in

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.180
boots that are $200 more.
Easily.
Yep, all right. Great. So here you have it

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.340
the Cruise 110 men's from Nordica. I'm Steve Kopitz. This is

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.530

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.630
