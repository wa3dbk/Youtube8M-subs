00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The concept of the Channel in a box behind  Hardata.TV is 
the idea that all you need in a TV channel

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.500
is integrated in this box. What we are
seeing now in this playlist for example

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.500
is in addition of a HD image, we can see
graphics

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
such as sockets, CG, animated logos.

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:44.004
One of the main necessities of a TV Channel is the hability of having a LIVE signal

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
and to be able to overlay graphics on them

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Then we will see the easiestentonces vamos a ver de que manera sencilla se
puede incorporar un segmento de vivo en HARDATA TV,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.000
We are going to analyse now for example on this segment
after the clip we are watching,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:11.000
we are going to insert a LIVE material, 
we complete the Name, i am going to name it CAM and we have to assign it a time, 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
let´s say, 1 minute

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.500
By doing this we already added this LIVE material, 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we forward the previous material, and in order to incorporate this LIVE segment

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.000
I have here a home camera connected on a composite video input on the Hardata.TV

00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:49.500
When this clip ends the system will broadcast the LIVE material

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:58.500
well it already ended and now the system is broadcasting the LIVE signal

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is our camera

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I can overlay graphics over the LIVE signal.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.500
we publish them and now we can see an animated logo

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.500
let´s select another one so we can see it better, 
and there we have a socket, an animated logo and a CG with scroll

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and when the LIVE segment ends,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we enter a FADE OUT comand, 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.000
The command is called  FADE OUT
PROJECT, one second before  

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.500
the clip end the system will remove the graphics  

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.000
as can see it right now on the screen, and it jumps to the next clip

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
This is basically how Hardata.TV handles LIVE signals

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.000
this particular model is the Hardata.TV 6120 which has only one LIVE input

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:22.000
We also have another model, the Hardata.TV 6140 which has 3 LIVE inputs

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.500
when we have to broadcast a LIVE segment we can choose feed 1, feed 2 or feed 3.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It's that simple handling 
Hardata.TV CHANNEL IN A BOX.
