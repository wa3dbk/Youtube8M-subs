00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.980
Using Metallic is so easy, even I can do it!

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.930
Hi, this is Marti from Superior Threads. Today
we will be showing you how easy it is to be

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:29.930
running metallic thread on your longarm.
Superior Metallic is available in 25 colors.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.839
And it stitches beautifully as you can see
on the quilt behind me.

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.250
This quilt is called 'Feather Fantastique'.
It was quilted by Jamie Wallen using Gold

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.250
#7 Superior Metallic on his longarm machine. You can see how detailed the stitches are and just how much

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.500
metallic thread is on this quilt.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.250
Using the proper needle is important when
using any thread on your longarm. For quilting

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.250
with Superior Metallic, we use a size #19
(MR 4.0). This size has a larger eye to accommodate

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:19.950
the delicate nature of metallic. Make sure
that you have a good needle in your machine

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.590
Bobbin Tension is commonly overlooked when
longarm quilting. Before we start quilting,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.399
it is advantageous to make sure that our bobbin
tension is correct. We use the TOWA bobbin

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.289
gauge to help us make sure our bobbin tension
is where we want it to be. I've checked Superior's

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.989
TOWA reference guide to check where my bobbin
tension should be.

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:48.890
Metallic thread is delicate and we are able
to avoid putting extra stress on the thread

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.840
by making a few changes to how we thread it.
We recommend using a Handy Net with Metallic

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.840
thread as they help keep slick thread from
puddling down off the cone.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.720
Place the cone on your machine , and thread
it normally up to the thread guide with 3

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.879
holes.
We only want to thread our metallic through

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.220
one of these holes. Understand that the more
times thread comes into contact with your

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.220
machine, the more tension is added. If we
can reduce the number of times a thread touches

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.569
the machine, we can reduce tension.
If your machine has a secondary or rotary

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.340
tension, do not wind metallic thread twice
around. Only wrap the thread around Â¾'s of

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.120
the way and make sure that it catches in the
retaining spring.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.239
Finish threading your machine.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.239
For help with our top tension, We use Superior's
Top Tension Pro to record the correct tension

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.999
setting. It saves us a lot of time when we
switch back to using Metallic thread.

00:03:08.999 --> 00:03:15.170
It is much easier to start off with loose
tension and tighten as needed instead of starting

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.780
too tight and having the thread keep breaking
as we loosen.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.780
After a few minor top tension adjustments,
we are able to get an even stitch! By starting

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.310
off with a Quality thread, correct needle
size, and loosen our tension, we have no problems

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:44.579
quilting with Metallic thread.
If you follow these simple steps, you'll be

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.140
able to use gorgeous Metallic Threads on your
machine!
