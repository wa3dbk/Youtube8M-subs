00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:18.646
MIKE SPINELLI: Cheaff, duz

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:19.476
-(OFFSCREEN) Cheaff?

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:23.486
MIKE SPINELLI: In Munich,
they say Cheaff.

00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:25.186
Cheaff.

00:00:25.186 --> 00:00:27.416
Vhat is this Cheaff person?

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:28.906
Hey, welcome to DRIVE CENTRAL.

00:00:28.906 --> 00:00:30.166
Here's where you're going to
find out what's happening on

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.616
DRIVE this week.

00:00:31.616 --> 00:00:33.896
Welcome back.

00:00:33.896 --> 00:00:35.356
We've been away for
a little while.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:38.716
Don't forget @drive on Twitter,
facebook.com/drivetv,

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:43.096
or our new website on something
called Tumblr.

00:00:43.096 --> 00:00:47.536
It's slashdrive.tv

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:50.146
This Monday Matt Farah kicks
off the new season of TUNED

00:00:50.146 --> 00:00:53.576
with a Group B Rally-inspired
Porsche 911 by California

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:55.776
Porsche Tuner BBI Motorsport.

00:00:55.776 --> 00:00:58.706
The math, or is that maths--

00:00:58.706 --> 00:01:01.036
I know we get a lot of Brits--

00:01:01.036 --> 00:01:02.096
check out the maths.

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:04.656
It's 400 horsepower,
2,300 pounds.

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.009
And let's take a look at that.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:35.096
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:37.826
That's TUNED every Monday
this season on DRIVE.

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:41.116
And this Wednesday, Chris Harris
sets up an epic sports

00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:41.706
car battle.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:45.746
It's the Porsche 911 Turbo S
versus Audi R8 V10 Plus--

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:49.406
or pluz, if you're in France--

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:53.316
versus a 700-something
horsepower Nissan GTR.

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:54.466
That sounds freaking awesome.

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:55.614
Let's take a look.

00:01:55.614 --> 00:02:38.966
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.606
That's CHRIS HARRIS ON CARS
every Wednesday on DRIVE.

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:44.556
And on Thursday, it's
AFTER/DRIVE, our new show

00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:49.266
where we talk about cars after
apparently driving them.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.196
We drive them, and then
after we drive them

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:52.756
we talk about them.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:53.996
Doesn't it make sense now?

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:55.446
Yes.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:56.896
And this week, we've got
guests from Jalopnik.

00:02:56.896 --> 00:03:00.436
And keep an eye out for this
week's question on @drive on

00:03:00.436 --> 00:03:02.176
Twitter and
facebook.com/drivetv.

00:03:02.176 --> 00:03:04.226
Because we know you like
answering questions, because

00:03:04.226 --> 00:03:06.181
questions are awesome.

00:03:06.181 --> 00:03:09.726
And this week on Friday, Leo
Parente is back with the kind

00:03:09.726 --> 00:03:12.076

That is SHAKEDOWN every
Friday on DRIVE.

00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:17.626
And that's it for DRIVE
CENTRAL this week.

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:20.586
Watch us every Sunday to find
out what's happening on DRIVE

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:25.266
for the week, or if I finally do
get my hair shaved into the

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:27.716
shape of the dog's bollocks.

00:03:27.716 --> 00:03:29.866
I don't what that is but
Chris Harris says

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:31.976
it will look great.

00:03:31.976 --> 00:03:36.316
Also find us on slashdrive.tv,
jalopnik.com, and

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.756

MIKE SPINELLI: [LAUGHING]

00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:43.599
Sorry, Cheaff.

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:44.836
-(OFFSCREEN) No, don't
be sorry to me.

00:04:44.836 --> 00:04:46.536
MIKE SPINELLI: I'm
not sorry to you.

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:49.256
I have changed my mind.

00:04:49.256 --> 00:04:51.806
I've changed my mind.

00:04:51.806 --> 00:04:53.056
DRIVE CENTRAL.
