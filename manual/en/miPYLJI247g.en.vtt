00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.410
Oh the pressure

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.700
Dear Lila

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.950
Dear Joey

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.050
dear first-year me, Hola, Hey kid

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.960
remember when dad said that the first six months of anything is the hardest

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.600
well that is completely true here
everything is going to be okay

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.970
things may seem tough right now times me
feel like you want to give up

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.329
please don't just know that you'll make
a great teacher

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.839
you are probably wondering why in the
world that I ever get into this

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:05.430
profession

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.869
just take a deep breath I know that
everything feels

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.270
overwhelming, terrifying even, but your
gonna make it through this

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.479
those kids in front and you they want to
learn

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.560
they need to know. Try every crazy thing
you think of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.899
in the end those are the things that
they'll remember your students need you

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:25.350
there

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.810
in front of the class and they truly appreciate
all that you do for them

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.520
even if they don't show it all the time
you'll have trouble the first day of

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.590
school with a student throwing a book at you.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.319
It will miss but don't worry that student
will come back five years later

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.960
introduce you to his new family and
thinking for having

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.270
is back all the time even after that
first day

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.920
when a kid says her class is boring

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.970
don't take it personally that happens to
everyone

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.009
holding your kids accountable is the greatest act of love

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.220
you can get them teaching is never an
exact science

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.660
and it's okay to struggle to find the
answers this is one of the most

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.440
important lessons to learn as a teacher

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.310
you will fail you make mistakes and you will embarrass yourself

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.599
when you do accept it with grace and
humility don't be afraid to ask for

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.819
or admit you need help. You will also learn
that you never stop learning to become

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.180
the teacher you wanted to be on day one
I want you to know

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.440
that what you expected to happen on the first day of school won't happen

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.800
until maybe the third and fourth or even
18th year

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.099
you're teaching. Lives and futures depend
on you

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.129
That's scary an exhilarating and you will know that this is exactly where you need to be

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.110
no matter what you might think

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.850
you are doing a good job through it all

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.560
the good and the bad just trust yourself it's gonna be okay

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.050
seven years later you're still gonna
love coming to work every day

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.530
So keep up the great work seek help from
those around you

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.980

the greatest importance
