00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:14.860
Hello, this is Michael from Hunter Industries.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.980
In this video gonna keep covering more
of the programming features that are offered in

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.270
the ACC controller.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.550
We are going to go over the System Off
dial position

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.930
We'll be talking about programmable days
of known as well

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.070
and we'll be doing the Easy Retrieve
Function which allows you to retrieve a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370
controllers memory that was preset from
before

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.870
We'll walk you through how to do a test program as well, we'll be doing

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.140
the reset procedure for all the
different functions and the controller

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.030
and we'll talk about setting the station
names as well as the program names.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.269
Remember all these features are just the
same what your ACC is conventional

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.269
or a two-wire decoder system.  The System Off dial position allows you to shut down

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.390
any occurring irrigation and if left in
this position it will keep the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.049
controller from

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.960
activating any programs.  If the dial is
left in this position the controller

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.240
will not run any automatic programs.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.140
You can run manually if you're using a Roam
or Roam XL remote control with the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.409
dial in the off position

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:24.409
otherwise no automatic programs will
start on their own.  Within this dial

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.570
position you can also use Programmable
Days Off

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.039
or Rain Off.  This is a feature that
allows you to turn the controller off

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.140
for a set number of days.  You turn the dial back to the run position

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.119
the days will count down and when the days expire, the controller will be back in the

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.119
automatic mode.

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.070
This is a very handy feature if you know
you have so many days have

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.460
severe weather ahead or maybe a special
event planned where you need the controller

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.250
off for X amount of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.399
days.  Simply press and hold the plus (+)
button

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.840
for three seconds to access this mode.
From there use the plus (+) button to go to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.350
the desired amount of days

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.159
and turn the dial back to the Run position.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.670
It will then countdown each day showing the
number of days until

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.190
automatic irrigation will resume.  You
need to turn the dial back to run within

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.210
about five seconds or the Days Off setting
will time out.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.210
The Run position also offer some hidden
features.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.730
One of these is the Easy Retrieve
Function.  This function allows you to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.410
retrieve

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.300
a prior saved program in case the one you're
currently using has been altered.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.830
To save a program make sure the dial is
in the Run position.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.460
Press the programs and information button
at the same time.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.750
If there is a program already saved the
display will ask you whether you want to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:47.830
save the program

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.240
or retrieve.   If there is no saved
program

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.770
only the save option will be shown to 
save and press the plus button to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.390
confirm.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.320
To retrieve a program that has been saved

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.760
the process is the same you just need to
use the down arrow button to move from

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.800
save to restore.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.410
Besides the ability to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.760
manually run a station or a program from
the run position

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.490
you can also run what's called a test
program and a test program allows you to

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.880
run

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.120
every zone for selected amount of time.  
This allows you to test the entire

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.640
system.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.600
By pressing and holding the program
button while the dial is in Run,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.750
you'll be able to enter a short run time
that will be automatically pasted into

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.960
the rest of the station's

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.660
to run a test program.  Note in decoder
systems

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.360
the minimum test run time is 15 seconds 
to allow the decoders time to respond.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.750
You can also have the test start on a
station other than number one

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.230
by using the up and down arrow buttons
to advance to the desired stations

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.050
starting number.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.490
The program will start running in three
seconds after no more buttons are

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.070
pressed.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.370
Once running you can advance or reverse
to the stations with the right and left

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.340
arrow buttons.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.620
Remember the test program will try to
start all stations counted by the

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.170
controller.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.170
The ACC controller allows you to reset
some or all of the controller settings.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.840
With the dial in the run position press
and hold the program

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.660
button.  Then use a pointy object to
depress the recessed

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:29.560
reset button and release it.  Keep holding the program button until the next

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.670
screen appears.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.600
From this menu

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.210
you can reset programs, flow totals, logs

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:43.090
names or all data.  Keep in mind that once
you choose one of these the information

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.360
we permanently erased

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.840
with the exception of an Easy Retrieve 
Backup if one was made.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.250
Resetting programs means that all Start
Times

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.260
Run Times and Days to Water will be
erased.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.110
Choosing flow totals will restart the
running flow total history at 0.0

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.050
if a flow sensor is in use. Resetting
logs will clear all

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:12.150
alarm logs.  Choosing names will
clear all names assigned by the users to

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.360
programs,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.130
stations or SSG's and if you choose
reset

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.070
all data you'll be deleting everything
mentioned returning the controller to its

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.580
original

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.490
out of the box configuration.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.970
So, finally let's look at the Set Station
Program and Name Style position.

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.050
This function allows you to assign a 
name to your station

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.389
and your program to facilitate
identification.

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.950
It also allows you to set your contact
information within the screen.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.030
When you turn the dial to Set Station
and Program Names,

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.250
you'll notice that the default contact
information is Hunter Industries.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.180
By pressing the down arrow button you
can edit this by entering letters with the

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.470
plus (+) or minus (-) buttons.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:01.420
Notice that the letters are listed in
alphabetical order starting with capital

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.520
letters

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.220
in small letters followed by numbers and
finally symbols.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.510
 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.740
Use the right arrow to move the next
character field and enter the following

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.280
letters.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.530
To assign program names

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.230
move up with the row and use the plus (+)
button to select

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.360
assign program names. Just like we did
with the contact information.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.650
Go down and start entering the new names.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.360
The main concept applies to station
names and simultaneous station groups or

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.340
SSG's.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.900
Simply go up and selected designation
you want to change

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.940
and start in turn the name with the plus (+)
and minus (-) buttons.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.490
The program and station names can also be
downloaded directly into the controller

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:54.810
with IMMS Central Control Software.  Even
without a central system

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.190
the demo version of the software can
directly load names

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.540
as well as other program information in
the facepack

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.360
with the USB connection.  So this
completes this section of the extended

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.130
features

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:11.040
of the ACC controller.  We showed you how to use Programmable Days Off

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.350
as well as Save and Retrieve a program, 
Run a Test Program

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.350
and also how to use the different reset settings.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.500
We also showed you how to assign names, stations,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.520
programs as well as SSG groups.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.870
For more detailed information

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:34.370
on how to program extended features review the ACC owners manual
