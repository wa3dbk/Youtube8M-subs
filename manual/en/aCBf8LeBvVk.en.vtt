00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.250
Hi everyone.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.320
So the Galaxy S5 appears to have
leaked

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.500
out early. The announcement was actually  meant to be this evening

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.199
but someone has managed to get some
pretty high resolution pictures really

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:23.660
of

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.769
what the Galaxy S5 is going to look like as well as

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.380
some of the software and features we may
very well expect. Now

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.370
Obviously none of this stuff is confirmed, 
these could be incredibly good fakes

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.500
but it seems unlikely at this point with
the handset going to be

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.250
announced in just a few hours. So what are  my reactions? Well,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.110
largely it doesn't appear that the Galaxy S5 has

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.610
changed that much from the Galaxy S4. Certainly on the front it

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.030
appears very similar. Now, various rumours are suggesting that the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.900
fingerprint

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.300
scanner is built into the home button
and simply swiping down with your

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
chosen digit will allow you to unlock the
device and also make payments

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.580
via PayPal. Now there also appears to be

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.990
a waterproofing added to this device.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.100
Certainly the USB port on the bottom
now has a giant plug

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.430
so whether this is just the active version of the Galaxy S5

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.600
that we're looking at or whether this is
actually going to be standard across

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.240
the S5 range, not too sure, be interesting to find out.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.540
Now the back cover is probably the thing
that makes me go uh!

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.790
the most. It doesn't look particularly attractive

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.050
certainly in the various colours that have leaked out so far. It

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.280
does look from a distance to be  rather fugly.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.260
But as with anything it just depends
what it actually looks like when you get it in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.860
your hand.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.670
Images especially if they've used flash or if they've got light hitting the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.770
device at a particular angle can make these
back covers look particularly grim.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.220
But it doesn't look like Samsung have made a major change here

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.180
in the all-polycarbonate body of the Galaxy S5.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.520
Certainly all the rumours that they were going to go premium don't appear to have

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.610
materialised. This is

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.299
very much the same look and feel of the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.410
Galaxy S4. Potentially just with a slightly bigger screen. Difficult to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.450
tell unfortunately on these images. Now one thing that

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.280
I noticed was apparently a feature called download booster.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.770
Now apparently this will allow you to use your wifi and your

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.970
4G connection simultaneously to  download files

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.069
even quicker, which is great unless you're on

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.950
as pretty much everyone in the UK is, a
metered 4G plan.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.590
Very much this is something that is going to be great in South Korea, probably

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.880
useless in the rest of the world where our
telecoms companies love to charge us

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.130
through the nose for data.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.530
Obviously that is going to be a feature that you're probably going to want to turn off.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.670
Essentially the way it appears to work is
that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.890
if you are downloading a file over 30meg
and you're on wifi and  you've got your 4G

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:52.560
available,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.810
it can download twice as fast or faster by

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.270
pulling the data from both of those streams
simultaneously. This is a technique

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.989
that we've seen

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.280
used on desktops with multi-part downloads for a very long time.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.349
Worryingly scary to see it on a mobile
device to be honest, where, you know,

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.590
data plans? Mmm. They are very expensive and so is going over your

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:12.800
data limits.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.680
So not something I think that's going to
become particularly popular in the UK

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.640
unless you really, really want that download
fast. But if you're connected to wifi

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.000
you're probably already getting it pretty fast. You know?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.900
Not really an awful lot more here. We
don't currently know what the resolution

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.720
of the display is going to be.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.160
I personally think it's going to be a 1080p display,

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.550
if it is a quad HD display I will be very, very surprised

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.780
mostly because there just doesn't feel like
there's a need for it. There's no content for starters.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.330
 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.370
There is no real desire out there right now
not at this stage of

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.560
2014 for 2k displays. I think towards the end of the year

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.550
certainly I think the Note 4 will pack a 2k display

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.959
but I can't see it on the Galaxy S5 personally

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.510
otherwise we would more than likely have 
heard a number other manufacturers like

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.280
Sony for instance who obviously is very big
in displays

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.560
would have also gone to 2k at this point in the
cycle. I just don't think it's likely.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.400
So, that is what we know of the Galaxy S5 so far.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.009
I will be back later today or probably tomorrow morning with

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.189
more thoughts depending on well, if we actually get to see the device and if it

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:22.079
turns out to be the Galaxy S5. Thanks for

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.270
watching.
