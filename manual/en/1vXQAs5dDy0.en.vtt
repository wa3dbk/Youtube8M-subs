00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.460
Hello and welcome to our YouTube channel
today I'd like to introduce you to the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.790
RX 3 4 4 7 round metal sunglasses from
the ray-ban collection ray-ban is

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.490
synonymous with luxury eyewear and since
its creation  in the 1950s it's been worn

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.590
by everyone from presidents to movie
stars actors and actresses to musicians

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.900
fashion designers to fashion models
today I'd like to show you the RX 3 4 4

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.089
7 pair so we've got 2 pairs here and I'm
going to try on this pair so these

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:44.670
frames have a gunmetal round frame so
they're a kind of more modern take on

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.440
the original pair invented in 1960s and
then we can see here that we've also got

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.619
the gunmetal and handles or temples
these frames measure  50 millimeters

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:02.369
and they also come in a slightly darker
so like a kind of black and brain shape

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.170
suit for a dark color that'll be great
for that look and they're also unisex of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.829
their gender neutral so they're great by
the guys or girls and I think they look

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.719
really good they have a really cool and
you know modern and and very retro look

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.829
so this model in particular I really
like them because they're really really

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.979
light so you can't actually tell by the
extremely light and they've also got

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.590
this kind of curved bridge here and then
the nose pads are also adjustable so

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.260
they feel really really comfortable and
they don't kind of

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.460
irritate me after a while as I said
we've got two colors here and they come

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.450
