Melanie Humphrey-Sonntag: Ethics First is
a program

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.670
developed by NCRA
to recognize and promote court reporters

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.030
who have made a commitment to abide by
and promote the rules of the

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.300
Code of Professional Ethics
regarding gift-giving.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.300
Laurel Eiler: The NCRA Code of
Professional Ethics dictates that

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.730
court reporters should refrain
from giving, directly or indirectly,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.140
anything of value to attorneys,
clients, witnesses, insurance companies

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.289
or any other persons or entities associated
with the litigation except for items

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:45.710
that do not exceed $100 each year,
however the rules governing court reporters’

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.780
conduct may not go far enough to
protect attorneys, who have their own

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.539
ethical obligations to uphold.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.539
Lisa Migliore Black: Many of these
incentive programs target the staff

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.509
that book depositions--$100 gas cards,
iPods, Wii Systems, points redeemable

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.259
for limousine rides, etc. To protect
against these practices, many law firms

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.360
and governmental agencies have a strict
policy that prohibits acceptance of gifts

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.110
from vendors.” Implementing such a
policy for your law firm is the safest

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.110
course of action to avoid a number of
unintended consequences.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.369
James DeCrescenzo: “It is important
to be aware that accepting these so-called

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.420
“Rebates” offered by court reporting
firms may attract the attention of the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.979
Internal Revenue Service.&nbsp; Free iPods,
mall gift certificates, theatre tickets,

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.540
cash, rounds of golf….&nbsp; There are
anecdotal reports in court reporting

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.619
circles of payments in excess of $25,000
going to a secretary to switch court

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.100
reporting firms. An active litigator,
or his staff, can accumulate rebates

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.789
valued in the thousands of dollars a year.&nbsp;

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.950
Early Langley: These practices are
not without consequence for all involved

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.540
and can even jeopardize a victory of a
client’s case,as&nbsp;was the case for one

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.230
Florida attorney who was faced with the
choice of explaining the embarrassing

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.230
situation to his client, possible ethical
violations, or paying $6,300 out of pocket

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.049
to resolve the matter off the record.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.730
Sonntag: We must work together
to uphold the integrity of our court records.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.290
It’s always best to choose a reporter
based on skill, ability, and credentials,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.170
not based on the gift, kickback, or reward
being offered.
