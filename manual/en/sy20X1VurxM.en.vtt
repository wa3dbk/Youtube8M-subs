00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.920
They come from all across the United States
with different expectations and diverse dance

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.840
experience.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.220
Upon completing the dance program at the University
of Southern Mississippi dancers are exposed

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:35.070
to a wide array of experiences and inspired
to become uniquely driven artists.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.920
I expected, when I came into the department,
to be challenged, to grow, to change, to adapt.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:51.199
And I feel like I have learned a lot about
myself through this whole process, I never

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.140
would have thought that I would have grown
into the artist that I am now.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.510
The department has really broadened my gaze
as to what's available for me.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.820
The faculty especially has inspired me to
do what I want to do for the rest of my life,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.770
they've told me where I need to go, who to
connect with, and how to achieve those connections.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:16.350
I have a very close relationship with each
of the teachers that I admire very deeply,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.880
there's not a single one of them that I couldn't
approach if I ever had a problem.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.760
I'm very grateful for that.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.500
It never gets old, it never gets tiring.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:36.830
Yeah you wish you could sleep sometimes, but
if it's what you love to do it's definitely

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.420
where you want to be.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.650
Weekly experience for a dance major, Monday
through Friday dance nonstop.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.760
I feel being in this department has helped
me grow as an artist a lot because when I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.940
would create things in high school before
I came here with my hip hop dancing, it was

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.909
kind of I don't know, I would do movements
and I would like them but ever since I came

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.360
here and got trained in ballet and minor aesthetics
I feel like I can really feel the movement

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.819
that I create with my other style of dance
that I enjoy.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.190
And emphasis on high quality training, faculty
mentorship, and experimentation in both contemporary

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.330
and traditional dance forms is what sets the
Southern Miss Department of Dance Program

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.760
apart
