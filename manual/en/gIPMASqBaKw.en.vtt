00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.260
We can barely hear each other

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.580

Oh, and here we did a random dance

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.920
Well, that was it!

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.620

- Yes, and we've met so much people and Youtubers

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.400
So it was a crazy cosy day

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.820
