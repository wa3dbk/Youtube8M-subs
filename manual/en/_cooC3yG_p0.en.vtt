00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.420
What I want to do in this
video is familiarize ourselves

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.830
with a very common
class of sequences.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.630
And this is
arithmetic sequences.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.890
And they are usually
pretty easy to spot.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.290
They are sequences where each
term is a fixed number larger

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.920
than the term before it.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.820
So my goal here is to figure
out which of these sequences

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.259
are arithmetic sequences.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.050
And then just so that
we have some practice

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.680
with some of the
sequence notation,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.220
I want to define them
either as explicit functions

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.880
of the term you're looking for,
the index you're looking at,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.110
or as recursive definitions.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.500
So first, given that
an arithmetic sequence

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.540
is one where each successive
term is a fixed amount larger

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.790
than the previous one, which of
these are arithmetic sequences?

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.940
Well let's look at this
first one right over here.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.470
To go from negative 5 to
negative 3, we had to add 2.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.780
Then to go from negative 3 to
negative 1, you have to add 2.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.490
Then to go from negative
1 to 1, you had to add 2.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.810
So this is clearly an
arithmetic sequence.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.669
We're adding the same
amount every time.

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:07.210
And there are several ways that
we could define the sequence.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.022
We could say it's a sub n.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:11.480
And you don't always
have to use k.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.360
This time I'll use n
to denote our index.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.480
From n equals 1 to infinity
with-- and there's two ways

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.300
we could define it.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.520
We could either
define it explicitly,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.070
or we could define
it recursively.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.910
So if we wanted to
define it explicitly,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.070
we could write a sub n is equal
to whatever the first term is.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.290
In this case, our first
term is negative 5.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.340
It's equal to negative
5 plus-- we're

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.530
going to add 2 one less
times than the term we're at.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.290
So for the second
term, we add 2 once.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.620
For the third term,
we add 2 twice.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.490
For the fourth term,
from our base term,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.000
we added 2 three times.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.150
So we're going to add 2.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.890
We're going to add positive
2 one less than the index

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.380
that we're looking
at-- n minus 1 times.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.960
So this is an
explicit definition

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.260
of this arithmetic sequence.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.950
If I wanted to write
it recursively,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.910
I could say a sub 1 is
equal to negative 5.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.490
And then each successive term,
for a sub 2 and greater--

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.780
so I could say a sub n is equal
to a sub n minus 1 plus 3.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.120
Each term is equal to the
previous term-- oh, not 3--

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.790
plus 2.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:31.230
So this is for n is
greater than or equal to 2.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.030
So either of these
are completely

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.420
legitimate ways of defining
the arithmetic sequence

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.230
that we have here.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.970
We can either define
it explicitly,

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.950
or we could define
it recursively.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.330
Now let's look at this sequence.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.950
Is this one arithmetic?

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.480
Well, we're going from 100.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.252
We add 7.

00:02:52.252 --> 00:02:54.976
107 to 114, we're adding 7.

00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:58.440
114 to 121, we are adding 7.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.760
So this is indeed an
arithmetic sequence.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240
So just to be
clear, this is one,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.300
and this is one right over here.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.840
And we could write that this
is the sequence a sub n,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.800
n going from 1 to infinity
of-- and we could just

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.610
say a sub n, if we want
to define it explicitly,

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.190
is equal to 100 plus
we're adding 7 every time.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.330
And then each term-- the
second term we added 7 once.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.280
Third term-- we add 7 twice.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.430
So for the nth term, we're
going to add 7 n minus 1 times.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.340
So this is an explicit
definition of it,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.840
but we could also
do it recursively.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.270
So just to be clear, this is
one definition where we write it

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.730
like this, or we
could write a sub n,

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.240
from n equals 1 to infinity.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.836
And in either case
I should write with.

00:03:53.836 --> 00:03:55.460
And if I want to
define it recursively,

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.950
I could say a sub
1 is equal to 100.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.170
And then, for anything larger
than 1, for any index above 1,

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.560
a sub n is equal to the
previous term plus 7.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.822
And so we're done.

00:04:10.822 --> 00:04:12.280
This is another
way of defining it.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.920
So in general, if you
wanted a generalizable way

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.149
to spot or define an
arithmetic sequence,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:20.680
you could say an
arithmetic sequence

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.910
is going to be of the form
a sub n-- if we're talking

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.930
about an infinite one--
from n equals 1 to infinity.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.460
If you want to
define it explicitly,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.540
you could say a sub n is
equal to some constant, which

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.790
would essentially
the first term.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.470
It would be some
constant plus some number

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.090
that your incrementing--
or I guess

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.089
this could be a negative
number, or decrementing

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:47.670
by-- times n minus 1.

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.380
So this is one way to define
an arithmetic sequence.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.000
In this case, d was 2.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.160
In this case, d is 7.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.350
That's how much you're
adding by each time.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.280
And in this case, k is negative
5, and in this case, k is 100.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.850
The other way, if you
wanted to the right

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.000
the recursive way of defining an
arithmetic sequence generally,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.180
you could say a sub
1 is equal to k,

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.270
and then a sub n is
equal to a sub n minus 1.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.170
A given term is equal
to the previous term

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:22.250
plus d for n greater
than or equal to 2.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:24.110
So once again, this is explicit.

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.110
This is the recursive
way of defining it.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.140
And we would just
write with there.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.780
Now the last question I have
is is this one right over here

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.630
an arithmetic sequence?

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:34.730
Well, let's check it out.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:35.860
We start at 1.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.910
Then we add 2.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:38.929
Then we add 3.

00:05:38.929 --> 00:05:40.970
So this is an immediate
giveaway that this is not

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.970
an arithmetic sequence.

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:43.470
Now we are adding 4.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.780
We're adding a different
amount every time.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.130
So this, first of all,
this is not arithmetic.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.400
This is not an
arithmetic sequence.

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.139
But how could we define
this, since we're

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:57.430
trying to define our sequences?

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.220
Let's say we wanted to
define it recursively.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.790
So we could say, this is
equal to a sub n, where

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.830
n is starting at 1 and
it's going to infinity,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:20.100
with-- we'll say our base
case-- a sub 1 is equal to 1.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.580
And then for n is 2
or greater, a sub n

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.400
is going to be equal to what?

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.810
So a sub 2 is the previous
term plus 2. a sub 3

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.170
is the previous
term plus 3. a sub 4

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.200
is the previous term plus 4.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.980
So it's going to be the
previous term plus whatever

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.210
your index is.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.030
So this looks close,
but notice here we're

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.640
changing the amount
that we're adding

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.765
based on what our index is.

00:06:47.765 --> 00:06:50.090
We're adding the amount of
index to the previous term.

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.340
And so this is for n is
greater than or equal to 2.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.000
Well for an arithmetic
sequence, we're

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.110
adding the same
amount regardless

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.900
of what our index is.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.800
Here we're adding
the index itself.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.440
So this one is not
arithmetic, but it's

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.970
an interesting
sequence nonetheless.
