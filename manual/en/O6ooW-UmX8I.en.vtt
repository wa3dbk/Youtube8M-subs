00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.490
Palliative care is a very new medical speciality.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.530
I’d say palliative care is a philosophy
and it’s a way of looking at medicine in

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.760
a different set of eyes than most of us have
been trained.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.640
Every day I get asked, “What is palliative
care?” I tell families palliative care helps

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.810
patients and their families in two particular
ways. The first thing is, I often will help

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.650
patients that are having symptoms that are
difficult to control. So they and their doctor

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.280
have been trying to control their pain or
their shortness of breath or their nausea,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.269
and it’s been a real challenge. They can
ask for our expertise in helping them have

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:52.280
the most comfort and quality of life that
they can for whatever lies ahead for them.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.149
There are also a lot of patients and families
that we help with making decisions about what

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.170
type of care do they want, making decisions
about potentially end-of-life care. So we

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.090
help in a multitude of ways and every patient
is really different. On one patient, I’ll

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.300
go in and strictly be seeing them for pain
very early in their illness. Other patients

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:18.760
we show up and help them with a lot of end-of-life
questions and helping them have a dignified

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.170
and peaceful death.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.720
The difference between palliative care and
hospice is something that I’m asked very

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.630
often. Hospice, most people feel like they
understand better than palliative care. Hospice

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.330
is basically the same philosophy as palliative
care in that it’s about quality of life

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.110
and comfort. But hospice is a program that’s
limited to the last six months of your life.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.530
And palliative care is not a program; it’s
a medical specialty that helps with quality

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.640
of life and comfort, no matter where you are
in your illness.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.810
When we show up to help a family, we are advocates
for that family. We’re not there to help

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.480
make a decision for them, but help to show
them what choices and options they have ahead

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.060
of them and discuss with them their goals
and needs and wishes, so we can help them

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.890
and their medical team make the right choices
for their care. There are times when absolutely

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.780
we are managing symptoms and we’re continuing
all of the therapies that we’ve been doing.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.310
There are other times that we’re helping
families decide when do we stop doing the

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.870
type of care that we’re doing and focus
more on comfort. It all depends on the patient’s

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.470
situation and we don’t go in with any preconceived
notions; we go in, we know the medical situation,

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.630
we get to know the family and we help them
all come to a consensus on what would be the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.810
best thing for this instance.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.280
I always say the nurses and the doctors in
the hospital are very cure-oriented and it’s

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.890
hard to kind of come off that orientation
every once in a while and look at the big

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.750
picture, or what I would call the “10-Thousand
Foot View” of what’s going on with people.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.040
And to make sure that what we put quality
of life and comfort at the forefront of these

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.610
very life-prolonging in-curative therapies.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.380
Choices are really hard for patients; when
they’re in the hospital, they’re overwhelmed;

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.830
they have many people involved in their care.
I often say we have a heart doctor and a kidney

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.330
doctor and a lung doctor, and it’s hard
for patients and families to know, “Am I

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.110
getting better?” “Is mom getting worse?”
Because they’re hearing many different things

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.550
from different teams. So we get involved often
to help those patients and families sort through,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.060
“Are we getting better, are we getting worse?”
And if this is not the direction that a patient

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.400
or family wants to go, we can help answer
questions about what is the best thing for

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
them.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.790
One of the benefits of our service is that
we take whatever time is necessary to get

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.410
family’s questions answered and get their
needs met. We do develop very close bonds

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.130
off with their families and one of the things
that I’ve noticed since starting this specialty

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.970
is how often families will contact us after
they’ve left the hospital to let us know

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.130
how their loved one is doing, update us on
how things are going and continue that connection.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.370
We often sometimes will see people through
multiple hospital stays. And so we get a consult

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.940
and we say, “Oh, we met them last time we
were here and the families are grateful to

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.919
have us involved again.”

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:28.779
I often hear patients and families ask me,
“Is this the right thing to do?” And I

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:33.550
often say, “There’s no right or wrong
answer.” Every person is different. Every

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:39.309
person will do something different. There
are people who will go through a lot of pain

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:43.599
and suffering until the very last moment of
their lives and there are people who won’t

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:48.919
even start with that and most of us are somewhere
in between. But the most important thing is

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.069
to find out from patients and their families
what’s the kind of person they are, what

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:55.621
they are willing to go through.

00:04:55.621 --> 00:05:01.520
Too often we see patients who aren’t able
to speak for themselves and we’re relying

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.439
on family to help us make decisions. And the
families often don’t have a sense of what

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.740
their loved one would want and it’s a lot
of pressure to make heavy decisions when you

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.949
don’t know. I think also too often our medical
system puts too much pressure on patients

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.469
and families to make decisions and palliative
care tries to help explore with the family

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.699
what the situation is, offer what are the
alternatives or what are our choices here

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.840
and help them make the best appropriate decision
for them and their loved ones.
