Hi, this is William Cane and i'd like to
share some information that will be

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.120
helpful to you to enhance your
appearance

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.829
it's the issue of contrast level which
most people never think about

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:16.179
the contrast level of a person is
measured by the difference in tone

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.300
between the hair

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.599
and the face

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.310
There are three types of contrast

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.179
a high contrast, medium, or low.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.860
A high contrast person, for example, has
black hair and white skin.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.160
medium contrast has light brown hair and
white skin

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.700
and low contrast would have black hair
and black skin

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.240
another example of low contrast would
be a blonde

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.960
who has light-skin and light hair.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.660
Our research reveals that if you duplicate

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.090
your contrast level in your outfit you
will enhance your appearance

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.430
for example a high contrast person 
who wears

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.040
a blue blazer and a white shirt will
have a high contrast outfit,

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.710
matching their hair and face contrast
level. They will enhance their appearance.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.799
An example of this would be Bruce Lee,
who had black hair

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.900
and light skin.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.670
A medium contrast outfit would, for
example,

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.720
be a beige jacket and a pale blue pastel shirt.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.490
And a low contrast outfit . . . for example
let's say Marilyn Monroe wanted to wear

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.680
something that would drawer additional
attention to her

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.530
well since she's a low contrast
blonde

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.290
she should wear a low contrast outfit,
for example a white dress . . .

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.400
and if you've seen Marilyn Monroe in a white
dress you know that enhanced her

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.549
appearance . . . not that she really needed much
enhancement but . . . 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.110
everybody could use a little help.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.180
Now, Manhattan Makeovers does research

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.310
to find out what actually is 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830
effective for people.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.850
And I want to tell attorneys
something very important . . .

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.410
The contrast level doesn't apply to you
when you're at work. There are

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.650
different rules entirely . . . we'll discuss
them in a new video. But for most people

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.839
especially salespeople or other
professionals, or

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:23.559
if you're on a date or in a social
situation, if you replicate your contrast

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:25.749
level in your outfit . . . 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:27.059
you're going to be a winner.

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.090
And i hope this helps you in your next
encounter with other people.
