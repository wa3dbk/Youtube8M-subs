00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:10.940
Okay, I am going to try to recess this back
in here a little bit, past the scar, which

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.071
I don't want that-- I want the scar there,
but I don't want it to be too prominent, so

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:21.730
as soon as I get more value around it and
I've taken advantage of the contouring around

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:29.590
here, getting a little more of that texture
around it, then I can come across and tone

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.780
down that scar.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.950
I can always pull something back out, but
I don't want it to be too bright.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.069
And pulling something out would be because,
maybe, one tiny little facet of that scar

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:48.989
might have a little bit of a variation in
it, and so there you have a chance to show

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:57.559
depth, contour, and curve, even within something
that small.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.440
I think it's worth it, myself, because we
don't want just to have a flat streak through

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.750
there because I took my eraser through to
create a scar.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:18.890
Okay, I still want to-- these are places later
on, we'll come back in with the 4B and just

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.939
touch up.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.229
But I also want to be careful.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.640
Think curve and contour.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.820
This is a round eye, just like this; this
is a round eye.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.880
And so you want to make sure that it is darker
on one side than it is on the other side.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.039
And so to do that, you're going to have to
vary your values.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.340
If I make the whites of the eye just as bright
over here as they are on this side, well then

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.859
basically all I've done is pasted an iris
in the middle of a while, you know, placement

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:55.960
for the eye.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.820
And this is one place where you can many times
really enhance the curve, by some of those

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.799
little, subtle things.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.390
So when it comes back this way, our-- look
at-- our apex is somewhere in here, and it's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.500
not just a line.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.140
I see, maybe, a little skin texture even in
that.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:25.530
But when it comes over here, towards the tear
duct, it shades down a little bit.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.890
And then you can also pull out something,
because he has, you know, maybe some blood

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.530
vessels in his eyes, a little variation, as
most of us do.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.410
And so we can - if we want to, just as long
as it doesn't become a distraction in my mind

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.200
- we can create something that's a little
more realistic, just by suggesting something,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.860
not to get too carried away with it.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.290
Let's see.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.090
I don't want these to become terribly dark
cracks, and yet I'm going to strengthen them

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:09.730
up, so they start becoming something different
than just the contour and shadow areas of

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.750
the skin.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.050
As it is wrapping around here, I want this
to all get a little darker, and then we have

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.960
these individual facets in here that are going
to have highlights, but not as bright as over

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:30.740
here on this side.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.910
So trying to come up with that little extra
contrast, and I'll come back in and I will

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:52.140
try to pick out, again, brand new, fresh highlights,
trying to make sure they're not all the same.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:01.820
Hmm, this is interesting; I see a little bit
different shape here.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.840
This has got a little bit of a peak to the
form of the eyelid there.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.590
I think it's there, but not as much as I had
it.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.760
And I want to recess this in, so I'm going
to make this a little darker.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.850
Got to have depth here.
