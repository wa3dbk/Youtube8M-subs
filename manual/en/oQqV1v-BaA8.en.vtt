00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.260
Hello and welcome to today's FM Friday feature blog for Football Manager 2014. 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.260
Here we’re looking at some major changes to how news is delivered to you in the game,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.260
and how you interact with it. 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.260
Your inbox is where you spend a lot of time dealing with club matters

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.260
and we felt it was time to make some key changes that will help streamline your role as manager.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.260
To start with, the entire inbox panel has been revamped

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.260
to make this area of the game clearer, easier to navigate around and prettier!

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.260
There is a much larger right side panel on the screen to display lots of information applicable to the mail item,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.260
keeping more detail in one place so you don’t need to navigate around the game to get this information.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.260
In addition to the brand new style of email and news,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.260
we’ve colour-coded news items based on category so that it’s instantly clear which messages are related to each category. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.260
You can now scan through your inbox and pick out important items easily and see what each item relates to.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.260
Transfer and match news items in particular are much more obvious

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.260
to make sure you don’t miss any important information throughout the season.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.260
The biggest change to the inbox section is what information is displayed within items, 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.260
and how you see it. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.260
Email items now features more info, graphics and action buttons

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.260
to allow you to deal with many club matters direct from your inbox.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.260
Here are just a few examples…

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.260
Scout reports for an upcoming fixture are now shown inside a mail item rather than linking off to a separate screen, 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.260
so you can immediately check-out the opposition from your inbox.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.260
Scout reports on players now contain a list of players with recommendations on every player scouted,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.260
plus buttons so you can shortlist or make an offer for any of the players.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.260
When you’re offered a player by an agent you will be able to see his attributes within the email

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.260
so you can immediately assess whether he might be of interest.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.260
Match analysis is now plugged into mail item stories for post-match reports

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.260
and you can click through to view more details on the player of the match in addition to the usual match report,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.260
overall match analysis and match confidence which looks at the board and fans’ reaction to player and club performances.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.260
We have also added more media speculation and excitement that comes with manager movements.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.260
When a manager is sacked there are now ‘next manager odds’ which shows who the most favoured managers are to takeover at a particular club,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.260
you can also see who the leading candidate for each job is on the job centre page, which shows who the likely next manager will be.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.260
You can also see odds for the next manager to get sacked 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.260
with the three most likely sackings for each division being listed in the news item when a manager is sacked.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.260
Another advantage of the new info item layout is the ability to set a player’s individual training focus within the item.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.260
If your assistant suggests your striker should work on his finishing,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.260
you then have the option to instantly change the focus of your striker’s training and the intensity.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.260
Loan and transfer acceptance and rejection dialogue now appears in your inbox, 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.260
so you can accept and reject multiple offers directly from your inbox.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.260
There is also a new element of interactivity within mail items

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.260
with the introduction of useful tools such as sortable tables in place of a static list 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.260
e.g. when you receive scout reports on players and you can now sort the list by their ability stars.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.260
There are many other new additions to the inbox that give you as manager more control over your squad and backroom staff than ever before, 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:21.260
such as; having the option to meet your squad when you first meet your assistant manager and introduce yourself to the players.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.260
You will also receive emails from medical staff when players who you currently have out on loan get injured.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:33.260
This will allow you to make the decision on whether to recall the player so they can be looked after by your own medical team instead,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.260
if the details of the loan deal allow this.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.260
Another new feature is when advertising for a new member of staff -

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.260
should you not receive an applicant that you believe to be suitable,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.260
new applicants will be highlighted when the second round of applications come through.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.260
This will make it clear to you who the new applicants are

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.260
whilst also keeping previous candidates in case you fail to find anyone of a higher standard. 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.260
In the past the season summary has been very top-line 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.260
but this year you will receive much more information on how teams and players have performed during the season.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.260
The season review now picks out key moments of the campaign.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.260
There are many other new features within this area of the game as well, such as; 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.260
transfer clauses will now specify the amount of total appearances needed overall to meet a clause in a news item,

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.260
so you can avoid paying these fees if you don’t have the budget.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.260
Registration news will remind managers of which players in their squad aren’t currently registered to play 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.260
and also when a player confirms his retirement there will now be an action button to save the player’s history,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.260
so you can keep a record of your greatest players. 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.260
The email section in FM14 is better than it has ever been -

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:46.260
more streamlined, but with extra variety in messages on similar items

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.260
and logical ordering of emails with completely consistent action buttons throughout. 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.260
It’s all designed to save you time and bring all areas of the game together on one screen

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.260
to provide you with a fully integrated and interactive experience when you are playing Football Manager 2014,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.260
i.e. now when multiple players return from loan spells these will all appear in one mail item.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.260
And finally, we’ve given the News homescreen a redesign 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.260
in a way that segregates key news, events, transfers and results in a much more easily digestible layout.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.260
We hope you’re going to enjoy the FM experience even more with these changes.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.260
