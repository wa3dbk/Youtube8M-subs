Hey guys thanks for clicking over to BigNate84

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.340
And In this video I will be showing you

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.680
Actual read and write speeds

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.790
Of the Western Digital My Book Live

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.780
In a real world situation

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.200
To save time I will be referring to the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.230
Western Digital My Book Live as the MBL

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.260
Write speed is the rate that

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.250
You can transfer data onto the drive

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.369
Read speed is the rate that

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.579
You can transfer data off of the drive

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.679
Here is the question I got on February 10,
2012

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.309
That prompted this video

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.300
@BigNate84 What kinda read/write speed can
you get with it?

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.969
Like if you're transferring a 2GB movie

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.190
What'll your average speed be?

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.879
I know that when advertising

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850
They'll quote impossible speeds

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.709
But I'd prefer a real-world example if you
wouldn't mind

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:58.139
I’m glad you asked

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:00.280
Before we get to the test results

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.399
Let me tell you about the

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.249
Hardware I’ll be using

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.140
Since hardware can have a big effect

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.510
On your read and write speeds

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.830
Of course I’ll be using the MBL

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.960
And if you look in the manual

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.860
It boasts of read speeds up to 100 MB/s

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.920
Just for fun I’ll be comparing it to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.500
A Maxtor Personal Storage 3100 USB 2.0 drive

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.330
Which boasts of a bus transfer rate of 480
Mb/s

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.250
Now 8 bits equals 1 byte so to keep things
simple

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.280
I’ll divide 480 by 8 which gives me 60 MB/s

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.460
So now we can compare the specs more easily

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.890
By keeping our units the same

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.030
In the left corner we have the Western Digital
My Book Live

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.620
Boasting of read speeds up to 100 MB/s

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.250
And in the right corner we have a Maxtor 3100

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.560
Boasting bus transfer speeds up to 60 MB/s

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.030
A spec sheet is one thing

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.780
So lets see how fast these devices transfer
data

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.499
In a real world situation

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.769
The computer I will be using to transfer data

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.620
Is a Dell Inspiron 1545

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.319
And the router is a Linksys WRT300N

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.519
First I will test the write speed

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.459
By sending a 4.87 GB folder from the laptop

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.109
To the USB drive

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:44.349
And the average speed is about 20 MB/s

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.819
Next I will send that same 4.87 GB folder

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.900
From the laptop through the router

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.510
And to the My Book Live

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:03.799
And the average speed is about 8 MB/s

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.010
For the last write speed test

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.989
I will send that same 4.87 GB folder

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.041
From the laptop directly to the MBL

00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:25.280
The average write speed improved to 9 MB/s

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.010
Normally you cannot connect two network devices
together

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.980
By their network ports without using a special
crossover cable

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.930
However the MBL has the ability to recognize

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.139
When a crossover cable is needed

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.889
And change the communication protocol

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.689
In other words this drive can adapt automatically

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.739
Whether connected through a router

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.150
Or directly to a PC with an standard ethernet
cable

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.909
In summary the write speed of the USB drive

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:59.629
Was roughly twice as fast as the MBL

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.980
And the router introduced a 1MB/s bottleneck

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.069
Now lets take a look at the read speeds

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.639
First I’ll send that same 4.87 GB folder

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:15.189
From the USB drive to the laptop

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:25.380
The average speed is about 30 MB/s

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.320
Next I’ll send that same 4.87 GB folder

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.660
From the MBL through the router and to the
laptop

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:45.070
The average speed is about 3 MB/s

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.750
And finally I will send that same 4.87 GB
folder

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.650
Directly from the MBL to the Laptop

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:02.650
And the average speed improved to 4 MB/s

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.500
In summary the USB drive

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.870
Was roughly ten times faster than the MBL

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.200
And the router seemed to slow things down
by 1MB/s

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.830
So there you have it the My Book Live lost
miserably

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.480
To a read/write speed test against

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.750
An old school USB 2.0 drive

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.400
The My Book Live had speeds roughly 90% slower

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.410
Than the spec printed on the side of the box

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.380
Even when I took the router out of the equation

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.010
The speed was only increased by about 1 MB/s

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.350
None of the tests I did involving the router
were done wirelessly

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.690
They were all conducted with a ethernet cable
hardwired

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.610
So I’m not really sure how to experience

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.730
That 100 MB/s read speed

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.780
Let me know if you have any tips or suggestions

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.380
I’m guessing that the biggest bottleneck
to my system

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.970
Was my Dell Inspiron laptop and the ethernet
components

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.730
That come standard with that model of laptop

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.000
Even though the read and write speeds of the
MBL

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.700
Were a lot slower than my USB drive

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.990
I haven’t really had any problems streaming
music, pictures or movies

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.040
Over the local network

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.210
It seems to work perfectly fine

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.980
I really haven’t had any problems with the
My Book Live

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.750
Other than the initial data transfer

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.990
It took about 24 hours to move all my files
over to that drive

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.230
At the end of the day I still really like
this product

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.560
It has great accessibility options for remote
access

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.390
And from Mac or from PC’s

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.390
But you should be aware

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.870
Of the actual read/write speeds

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:47.780
Before you consider purchasing this

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.640
Ok so I lied I did have one other problem

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.200
With the My Book Live but only on my Mac

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.990
I got an error message saying

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.460
Message from server “Skywalker3TB”

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:02.750
Something went wrong with the volume’s CNID
DB

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.840
Using temporary CNID DB instead

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.110
Check server messages for details

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.010
Switching to read-only mode

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.250
I haven’t really researched this thoroughly

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.210
But I think this server error is actually
a bug

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:20.330
In the Mac operating system

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.930
So I don’t think it’s anything a firmware
update

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.440
On the My Book Live would fix

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.760
Because I have the most up to date firmware

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.270
And I’m still experiencing this problem

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.340
I’m thinking it’s probably a Mac OS thing

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.750
But let me know if you figure out the solution
