Justin: Hey guys, Justin here with americanmuscle.com
on location for another calender shoot for

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.870
the 2015 American Muscle calender and we're
coming to you live from the Bethlehem Steel

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.519
Stacks in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:29.900
A lot of history here, guys.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.800
But first, let me talk about the subject for
today's calender shoot.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.220
We have the awesome Bama Fleet on location
with us here, the Bama GT500 behind me, the

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.280
Terminator, and of course, the Raptor.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.260
Now, let's talk a little bit more about some
of the history here.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.120
Over 150 years in service, this place supplied
the majority of the nation's steel, built

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.559
one-fifth of the naval fleet over the course
of World War I and World War II, and actually

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.850
supplied the majority of the steel for the
Golden Gate Bridge out in San Francisco.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.300
But unfortunately, this place had to close
its doors back in the 90s, but has since been

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.699
revived as a major tourist attraction, awesome
concert venue, the scene on all of the kinds

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:02.699
of fun stuff.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.220
Now again, a backdrop today of the calendar
shoot.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.050
It should be a good one, guys, and if you

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.730

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.220
And speaking of liking what you see, I think
this place looks pretty cool now.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.200
Wait until you see it at night, it'll be pretty
awesome.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:30.850
So we got a lot 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.410
to do today, get to work.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.410
Look at him.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.410
What's he trying?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.410
Where is he?

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.410
Trying to Marty make quiet.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:48.210
That's what we're trying to do.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.970
Justin: As you guys can see, right now the
photo team is shooting the Bama Fleet.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.211
We're giving you a behind the scenes look
at the calender here for the 2015 American

00:01:56.211 --> 00:01:57.211
Muscle Calender.

00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:01.610
Now, this place rocks, so much post-apocalyptic
craziness going on here in this factory.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.300
We got some big planned for you guys.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:27.040
You're not going to want to miss it.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:39.550
Justin: The 
Bama Fleet is looking sharp here.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.099
Now, we've got the fire ring going on.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.400
The place is all lit up.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.900
It really comes alive here at night at the
Bethlehem Steel Stacks.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.370
It's been a heck of a day.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.260
You guys are really going to take the calender
this year.
