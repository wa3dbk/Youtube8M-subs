00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:18.980
The Grimpoteuthis, otherwise known as the
“Dumbo Octopus” because of its ear like

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.691
fins, is one of the weirdest inhabitants of
the deepest darkest depths of the ocean. They

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:30.500
are found in oceans all over the world but
are very rarely seen because they live on

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.730
the bottom of the sea, unlike most species
of octopi that live in shallow waters.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.350
The Dumbo octopus swallows its prey whole,
for that reason the size of its prey never

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.640
exceeds 2 mms.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.010
A little less pretty is the Aye-Aye, this
peculiar looking lemur isn’t winning any

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.039
awards for good looks. Found only in the north-eastern
parts of Madagascar. It is categorised for

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:04.820
its scary appearance and the people of Madagascar
believe that seeing an aye-aye predicts death.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.049
If you think that’s weird, the hooded seal
has an inflatable bladder in its head. It

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:18.240
can inflate a large red sack from its nostrils
to either ward off predators or to impress

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.240
females.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.820
If you don’t want to sleep tonight then
say hello to the Promachoteuthis sulcus a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.320
squid with actual human-like teeth. We only
know about this rare species because of a

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.140
single specimen caught by a German research
vessel in the southern Atlantic ocean at a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.950
depth of 2,000 metres.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.030
The prize for the most bored animal goes to
the Cape rain frog, a species of frog endemic

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.740
to South Africa. It is essentially a rock
with arms, which can’t be much fun.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.200
The unfortunate looking Naked Mole Rat is
found in East Africa. It has a highly attuned

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.229
and usual set of physical traits that enable
it to survive in an otherwise harsh underground

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.599
environment. For example they have no pain
transmitters in their skin and as a result

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.260
feel no pain when they are exposed to acid.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:28.480
The Dugong is a large marine mammal related
to the manatee and elephant. They are basically

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.710
the vacuum cleaners of the sea, feeding on
underwater grasses with their sensitive snouts.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:42.269
Some believe Dugongs were the inspiration
for ancient seafaring tales of mermaids and

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.269
sirens.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:50.220
The superb bird of paradise is found in New
Guinea. The species is known for its unique

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.150
courtship display. The species has an unusually
low population of females so competition amongst

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.400
the males is fierce. This has led to the evolution
of one of the most bizarre occurrences in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.689
all of the natural world.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.330
In order to find a mate first the male clears
the dance floor by meticulously scrubbing

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.580
the floor using a leaf, until it’s smooth
and clear. The male then attracts a female

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.860
with a loud call and next comes the dance,
it folds its feathers into a large fan shape,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.700
forming an eerie blue face and dances in a
circle around the female.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.170
Even despite this spectacular display, the
average female rejects around 20 potential

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.970
suitors before consenting to mate.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.440
Probably the ugliest thing in the entire animal
kingdom is the Blob Fish. Seriously it was

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.340
actually voted the world’s ugliest animal.
It inhabits the deep waters around the coasts

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.950
of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. It’s
gelatinous mass of a skin helps it maintain

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.930
buoyancy at 1,2000 metres below sea level,
where the pressure is several dozen times

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.590
higher than at sea level. It feeds off tiny
floating matter and generally just makes other

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.570
fish feel depressed.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.011
The Galapagos Islands is home to a bat with
lips. Known as the Red-Lipped Batfish. These

00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:29.400
peculiar looking fish aren’t very good swimmers
and use their highly adapted pectoral fins

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.730
to walk on the ocean floor.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.880
The goblin shark is a deep sea monster straight
out of nightmares. It is extremely rare and

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:45.190
has been called a living fossil because it
is the only living representative of the Mitsukurinidae

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:54.000
family. A lineage some 125 million years old.
Specimens are rarely seen alive by humans

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.740
because it lives at depths greater than 100
metres beneath the ocean’s surface.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.639
The Glaucus atlanticus or more commonly known
as a blue sea slug seems like it could easily

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:12.690
be an alien from another planet. You can find
these otherworldly creatures floating on the

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.820
surface of warm waters in the ocean. It has
a gas filled stomach to help it float.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.370
And finally, we have Scotoplanes, commonly
known as Sea Pigs because of their plump,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.880
piggish appearance. Sea Pigs live on the ocean
floor at depths of over 1,000 metres, specifically

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.949
on the abyssal plain in the Atlantic, Pacific
and Indian Ocean. The obtain food by scuttling

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.440
along the ocean floor and extracting organic
matter from the deep-sea mud.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.919
