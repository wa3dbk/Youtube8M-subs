00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:07.256
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: My name is Kathryn,
I'm fourteen years old and I live

00:00:07.256 --> 00:00:07.976
in Mount Pleasant, Michigan.

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:16.606
&gt;&gt;I don't really know what
originally put it into my head.

00:00:16.606 --> 00:00:19.546
I'm not entirely sure, I think a
big part of it though was working

00:00:19.896 --> 00:00:22.266
and going to car shows and
just seeing different things

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.086
that people had built.

00:00:36.696 --> 00:00:40.186
&gt;&gt;It was kinda love at
first sight, you know.

00:00:40.626 --> 00:00:44.126
It's just like this cool little
sporty car that you can just drive

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:46.756
around and it can just be
you and one other person.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:49.626
And it's just-- I think
it's a cool little car.

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:54.436
&gt;&gt;When we first got the car home,
we put it into the back yard,

00:00:54.436 --> 00:00:56.636
because I wanted to get
started right away, of course.

00:00:57.526 --> 00:01:01.246
And so I was literally sitting there,
looking at the car and I'm like,

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:03.716
"Okay, where do I start?"

00:01:07.396 --> 00:01:09.146
&gt;&gt;Jerry: This is the
hardest one to get.

00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:11.156
Can you see where your
wear sleeve is down there?

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:11.796
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: Yeah, I can.

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:13.206
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Where the bottom
stroke of the piston is.

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:15.436
So you wanna be just
like just above that.

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:16.866
You got it, Pennello.

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:17.516
&gt;&gt;I got it.

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:18.006
&gt;&gt;All right.

00:01:18.046 --> 00:01:18.416
&gt;&gt;We're good.

00:01:19.476 --> 00:01:22.976
&gt;&gt;Dale: When we immerse ourself
in a big project or a problem set,

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:26.816
without even necessarily knowing
why or what the outcome is,

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:29.936
we have the opportunity
to learn new things

00:01:30.246 --> 00:01:32.986
that are unlike any
other opportunity.

00:01:33.556 --> 00:01:37.396
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Mm-hmm, look at that,
real close there on those two.

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:42.006
&gt;&gt;Dale: The project itself is
creating opportunities for her

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:45.506
to learn that she didn't
set out for that to happen.

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.986
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: So what I'm doing right
now is, I'm using telescope gauges

00:01:50.986 --> 00:01:54.256
and micrometers to measure
the bore of the cylinder

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:57.656
in three different locations,
top, middle and bottom.

00:01:58.136 --> 00:02:01.896
Then I'm also measuring the
diameter of the piston to make sure

00:02:01.896 --> 00:02:03.976
that my tolerance levels are
where they're supposed to be.

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:12.236
&gt;&gt;Dale: Imagine if she kinda did
this as an exercise on paper,

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.316
or watched someone else do it.

00:02:14.576 --> 00:02:17.526
The amount of real learning that
would happen would be minimal.

00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:23.096
So it's really almost that diving
off the cliff and into something

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:24.666
that is really-- it's risky.

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:27.646
You know, she's spending
a lot of time on this,

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:29.566
and yet she's holding
it all together.

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:31.956
I think that's pretty amazing.

00:02:36.116 --> 00:02:36.986
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: When I first
started school,

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:38.556
like all through elementary
school really,

00:02:38.556 --> 00:02:39.966
I wasn't very good at math at all.

00:02:39.966 --> 00:02:43.786
Like I had so many issues, like
we'd do flashcards every night

00:02:43.786 --> 00:02:46.446
and I'd still just
completely not understand it.

00:02:47.106 --> 00:02:50.456
And so like as I got older, it
started to be a problem, you know,

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:52.296
'cause you can't really pass
school without knowing math.

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:02.756
&gt;&gt;Then I started on this car, and
I could take lessons I'd learned

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:05.806
from the car and how I'd
used it mathematically to do

00:03:05.806 --> 00:03:07.526
and solve the problems
in the classroom.

00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:10.316
&gt;&gt;I'm not so sure it's solid.

00:03:10.316 --> 00:03:11.596
&gt;&gt;Jerry: What's not solid?

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:14.206
&gt;&gt;Dale: The most basic level,
that you're learning to learn,

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:16.196
so you're becoming a better learner.

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:19.896
And your engagement
around learning is higher,

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.616
you're going to be more receptive
and open to new forms of learning,

00:03:23.616 --> 00:03:25.536
even ones that don't
specially work for you.

00:03:25.746 --> 00:03:26.946
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: That's way too small.

00:03:27.566 --> 00:03:30.706
&gt;&gt;Some of the examples in my car
for math is like converting metric

00:03:30.706 --> 00:03:34.806
to standard systems and just learning
how to measure and place parts

00:03:34.806 --> 00:03:38.266
and to be able to understand how
much tolerance you need for it,

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:39.976
and so it helps to learn
your mathematical systems.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.556
&gt;&gt;The forum, it's been a really
big part of this project,

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:51.936
because it's an online place
where you post comments,

00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:55.066
almost like Facebook, and it's
called the Pennock's Fiero Forum

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:57.536
because it's pretty much
all based on Fieros.

00:03:58.416 --> 00:04:02.126
&gt;&gt;Jerry: So you got this that
you weld in, and there's some

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:04.976
of your nice holes in
your frame rail finish.

00:04:05.606 --> 00:04:08.676
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: You go in and there's
people working on all kinds

00:04:08.676 --> 00:04:10.696
of different projects
to do with Fiero,

00:04:10.696 --> 00:04:13.506
or just sharing feedback
or suggestions.

00:04:13.506 --> 00:04:15.066
It's kind of like having
a bigger form

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.826
of a family really, on the forum.

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:24.506
&gt;&gt;So if I post just up onto my
thread and be like, "Hey, I'm stuck.

00:04:24.506 --> 00:04:27.286
I need some help, SOS here."

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.706
And so, they'll be like, "All
right, what are you stuck on?

00:04:29.706 --> 00:04:30.626
Let's see how I can help.

00:04:30.626 --> 00:04:31.796
Here are some suggestions."

00:04:31.896 --> 00:04:38.406
&gt;&gt;Dale: To be able to go
out and find those people,

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:41.316
no matter where they live,
who are working on cars

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:43.376
and say, "I've had that problem.

00:04:43.686 --> 00:04:47.976
I know that transmission or this
replacement part that you buy

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:50.746
over here is not very good,
this one is a better one."

00:04:50.806 --> 00:04:53.656
They're navigating a world of
living knowledge, all right.

00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:56.426
It's not just book
knowledge, it's "real thing"

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:57.976
and how valuable is that?

00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:03.566
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: I definitely think
about how school could be better

00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:05.676
if they had more interactive
projects, because there's

00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:09.416
so many kids who don't get to go on
and learn what they could really do,

00:05:09.416 --> 00:05:11.496
because they don't have
these opportunities.

00:05:12.076 --> 00:05:15.396
And so I think that if like schools
could offer more interactive,

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:19.066
more what you wanna do into
your classroom systems,

00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:22.046
then a lot more kids would be willing
to learn, willing to go to school,

00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:25.536
and actually having a good time
there, opposed to, "Oh my gosh,

00:05:25.536 --> 00:05:27.576
I've got this next class
and I don't wanna go."

00:05:31.346 --> 00:05:33.826
&gt;&gt;Dale: The Fiero is
Kathryn's car, it's her.

00:05:34.246 --> 00:05:36.476
That object and her are aligned.

00:05:36.686 --> 00:05:40.946
&gt;&gt;Kathryn: If I'm like having a rough
day at school or something, I'm like,

00:05:40.946 --> 00:05:42.966
"Okay, in a few hours,
you're gonna be home.

00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:45.286
You get to go to your shop and
you get to work and you just get

00:05:45.286 --> 00:05:45.976
to forget everything else."
