00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.849
We had to wait for it
but I'm finally behind the wheel.

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:15.830
We heard a lot about it, it's been hyped.

00:00:16.484 --> 00:00:18.045
But now I'm behind the wheel...

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.238
...of the SLS AMG,
Mercedes's new super sports car.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.552
Like with all AMG products,
the beating heart is a V8.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.583
We know it from the C, the E, the S, the SL.

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:41.833
Actually we know it from every current
Mercedes product except the A, the B and the SLK.

00:00:43.958 --> 00:00:49.949
But this is a supercar, so AMG and Mercedes
set their priorities straight.

00:00:49.985 --> 00:00:53.026
We don't need a lot of space in the interior,
we don't need a big trunk.

00:00:53.123 --> 00:00:55.587
We just want a car that's crazy fast...

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.666
...and that has a lot of horsepower.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.885
So they've made a lot of space for the engine.

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:05.146
It's mid-engined,
it's in the front but behind the front axle...

00:01:05.154 --> 00:01:06.500
...so that the weight distribution is right.

00:01:07.315 --> 00:01:09.624
What does that mean for this SLS?

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.610
They had the chance to form the intake-
and the exhaust path much more optimal...

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.000
...to get all the air in this engine.

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:20.535
Therefore this car is more powerful than
the other available AMG models.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.022
In total it has 571 hp, 650 Nm.

00:01:25.302 --> 00:01:28.643
That's very decent.

00:01:37.708 --> 00:01:39.560
The performance is subsequently...

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:42.221
...great! It's just fast.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:45.933
Even for Patrick, sitting next to me,
who is used to a lot.

00:01:46.036 --> 00:01:50.018
Just daring to sit next to me
makes you some sort of hero.

00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:53.098
He was shocked by the car's acceleration.

00:01:53.458 --> 00:01:58.437
0-62 takes 3.8 seconds.
Top speed is limited to 197 mph.

00:01:59.173 --> 00:02:02.000
So maybe it could go even faster.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.561
But we've only driven this car in places
where we didn't make that...

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.987
...and where it, strictly speaking,
wasn't allowed either...

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.586
...so we haven't tried it.

00:02:17.422 --> 00:02:22.754
It gets up to very illegal speeds so very easily.

00:02:25.082 --> 00:02:27.862
The engine is attached to an AMG Speedshift...

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.954
...so no traditional
slushbox automatic transmission anymore.

00:02:31.097 --> 00:02:32.698
That has a couple of advantages...

00:02:32.825 --> 00:02:35.388
...it uses less fuel, it changes gears faster.

00:02:35.545 --> 00:02:37.266
But it also has some disadvantages...

00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:41.110
...you can't do burnouts for example.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.279
With a dual clutch gearbox you're probably like
10 seconds faster on the Nuerburgring.

00:02:52.466 --> 00:02:55.149
But I'm not on the Nuerburgring today...

00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:59.515
...so I don't care.
I want to be a hooligan from time to time.

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:10.395
Mercedes and AMG have tried
a lot of new things on this car.

00:03:10.551 --> 00:03:15.205
A torque tube for example.
It's fitted between the engine and the rear axle...

00:03:15.313 --> 00:03:18.148
...it makes a rigid connection between the two.

00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:21.358
And inside it runs the drive shaft to propel it.

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:24.115
It keeps it all together more firmly.

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:28.761
The whole car is made from aluminium,
it's a space frame.

00:03:28.803 --> 00:03:33.139
We know that from one of
Mercedes's premium competitors...

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:36.628
...who builds the R8 in a similar way.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:42.975
Coincidentally, they're also roughly the same
on performance-level.

00:03:44.026 --> 00:03:45.587
In the R8 the engine is really in the rear...

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:49.045
...and in this one it's in front of you
but it's still mid-engined.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:53.142
But the SLS weighs in at about 3570 lb...

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:56.950
...that's comparable to the R8.
But their performance is also evenly matched.

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:02.226
Not only its performance is appealing...

00:04:02.353 --> 00:04:07.224
...it's also a reference to
one of the coolest Mercedes' ever made.

00:04:07.356 --> 00:04:09.432
The 300SL, the Gullwing.

00:04:09.863 --> 00:04:13.390
This car has a lot of things that car had.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.951
A very long hood, 6.6 ft long.

00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:26.361
I could lie down on it and sleep very nicely.
No problem.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.445
And of course you have to compare it to
the previous supercar Mercedes built...

00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:34.031
...although it isn't technically its predecessor.

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:36.069
They did that together with McLaren.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:38.082
The SLR McLaren.

00:04:38.413 --> 00:04:41.551
That car was mainly ridiculously more expensive.

00:04:41.868 --> 00:04:44.365
It cost over 600.000 euro.

00:04:44.437 --> 00:04:46.980
That's 2.5 times more expensive than this one...

00:04:47.113 --> 00:04:50.427
...but it certainly doesn't offer 2.5 times more.

00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:54.442
This one drives more grown up in a way.

00:04:55.797 --> 00:04:59.044
In that sense this has become
a somewhat more normal car.

00:04:59.484 --> 00:05:02.375
I'd really like to say
something about the interior...

00:05:02.443 --> 00:05:05.368
...but there are not enough words for it.

00:05:05.713 --> 00:05:07.588
There's red and black leather...

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.240
...and everything's where you'd expect it to be.

00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:13.676
It isn't very spacious inside,
my head almost hits the roof.

00:05:13.761 --> 00:05:16.680
And there's carbon, nice.

00:05:18.077 --> 00:05:21.719
What stays with me the most
after driving this for a day...

00:05:22.627 --> 00:05:24.468
...the huge amount of sound it makes.

00:05:24.576 --> 00:05:29.478
Whether you're inside or outside,
this thing produces such a great soundtrack.

00:05:29.872 --> 00:05:31.507
Full throttle with the V8!

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:33.668
And I'm going to leave you with that.
