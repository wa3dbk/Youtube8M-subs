00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.009
okay today we have our Toyota 4runner
all apart

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.380
we took the valve cover off which was
over on the cylinder head here our leak

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:31.890
is right in the back here this is our
EGR tube this is a camshaft the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.710
difference between this camshaft and the
BMW we did yesterday is that this is a

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.629
single overhead camshaft so the spot
problems are located on the outside here

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.870
which means
oil will not get on the spark plug to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:57.000
cause a misfire whereas the BMW you have
two camshaft with the spark plug in the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.160
center of the head so in this case if
you have an oil leak it won't cause a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.989
misfire but you'll get a lot of smoke

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.490
this is our fuel rail under the fuel
rail already injectors in this case you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:26.479
will have six injectors one two three
four five six this is our fuel rail here

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.570
this is our fuel pressure regulator and
this is our lower intake manifold to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.310
remove the upper intake manifold you
have one two three four five six seven

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:48.930
eight bolts also this is our fuel line
for the cold start injector when the car

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.860
is cold below 32 degrees this injector
will give you a prime of fuel to get the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.240
engine started and then these six
injectors will take over so these hose

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.459
have to be labeled if you're going to
remove them in my case I appear to be a

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.060
professional I know where to go so I
don't have to worry about that

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:25.470
this is our new valve cover gasket made
by fel-pro this is the old ones kind of

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.290
dry riding this is a passenger side PCV
valve very important that you change

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.590
this

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.400
you
