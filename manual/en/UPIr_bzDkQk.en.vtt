00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.229
- And this just in as well,
a car company responding

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:07.459
to new concerns of hackers
infiltrating your automobile.

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:09.008
- And you know the bad
guys can't be far away.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.794
- Steve Manzuik of Duo
Security in Ann Arbor

00:00:11.794 --> 00:00:13.593
is a friend of Miller and Valasek's.

00:00:13.593 --> 00:00:16.145
The fact that it's stacked
up to the remote idea

00:00:16.145 --> 00:00:17.905
really has them nervous

00:00:17.905 --> 00:00:20.217
and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration,

00:00:20.217 --> 00:00:22.318
which is charged with
making sure you don't die

00:00:22.318 --> 00:00:25.189
behind the wheel, fault the car itself.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.356
(intense music)

00:00:39.674 --> 00:00:42.274
- No sooner than Petunia
had given the word

00:00:42.274 --> 00:00:45.064
than seven greedy mice tore open the box,

00:00:45.064 --> 00:00:48.481
grabbed the candies out of it and kaboom!

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.343
(car beeps)

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:57.533
The end.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:59.283
Alight, time for bed.

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.195
(teapot whistles)

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.330
(car beeps)

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.712
- Requesting authentation.

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.295
(phone alerts)

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.967
Access denied.

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:29.690
(car alarm honks)

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:33.754
- Papa, what's that?

00:01:33.754 --> 00:01:37.543
- That was two-factor for our car.

00:01:37.543 --> 00:01:38.691
- Duo for cars?

00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:41.321
- That's right, sweetie. Duo for cars.

00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:42.541
Sleep tight.

00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:46.708
(alarms ring)
