00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.610
The Grace Scarf is the first product that
a women makes when she enters into the Rethreaded

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.520
family. And this product has a lot of symbolism
for us. This scarf is made up of individual

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.420
strands that we bound together to make this
beautiful scarf. And its symbolic to us because

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.090
in order for us to come together and make
something beautiful we have to have grace

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.420
for one another. So a lot of you have told
me - Kristin we love the Grace Scarf, we love

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.050
the meaning behind it, but we just don't know
how to wear it. So that is why today I'm gonna

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.230
teach you three ways to wear your Grace Scarf.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.800
The first way to wear your grace scarf we're
gonna call the Single. This is the easiest

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.719
way to wear your grace scarf. All you do is
take it, pop it over your head and done. You

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.539
can wear the wrap behind your neck or you
can wear it out as a decorative piece and

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.149
this goes really really well with something
long and flowey like this skirt and top I

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.920
have on or even a maxi dress.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.100
The second way to wear your Grace Scarf we're
gonna call the double and this is by far the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.880
most popular way that most people wear their
grace scarf. It goes great with a tank top

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.000
and jeans, t-shirt and jeans, it just adds
a good pop of color. So you are going to take

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.620
your grace scarf put it over your head, then
your gonna take take it in front of your body,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.900
loop it over reloop it back over your head.
At this point, you can wear it in a double

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.610
layer or you can make it a single layer. Either
way it adds a great pop of color to jeans

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.260
and a t-shirt.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.850
The third way to wear your Rethreaded Grace
Scarf we call the knot. The knot is my absolute

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.360
favorite to wear with business suits or whenever
I want to be dressier its a super classic

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.030
look. So how you do the knot is you hold both
ends of the grace scarf, you take one hand

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.200
and you twist it twice twist it twice pull
it a little tight and then your left with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.710
these two loops. So you take these two loops
put them together just like this pull it down

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.900
tight and then your gonna put your head through
the two loops that you just formed, and at

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.670
the end your left with a knot that goes cute
with any business suit or business attire.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.890
But the most important thing to remember about
the Grace Scarf is that when you wear it you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.700
become an advocate. One of our employees said
to me, "Every time someone wears a Grace Scarf

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.470
they remind me that my past doesn't matter,
that they have shown me grace."
