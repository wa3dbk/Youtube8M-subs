00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.620
So people ask me, is love

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.580
really the most powerful thing in the
world?

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.240
 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.139
And what I'm gonna say is:

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.939
Yes, it is. I'll just give you a sense of it. 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.950
Sometimes that power can be negative, 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.180
we now understand as scientists that
when you turn and criticize your partner,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.730
when you send your partner a message that
somehow

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.100
they're not quite the way you want to be,
this

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.540
is really taking into their brain as a
danger

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.489
cue. It's really filed as something
that's a threat.

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.910
And one researcher described it as, low
grade punches to the brain.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.970
So we might think that we're giving
advice,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.500
or just sort of giving somebody a little help,  but they're going to hear

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.880
it

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.700
as punches to the brain. They're gonna have
a hard time with it.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.420
We also understand that turning away and
shutting down shutting somebody

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.509
out, if they love you when they need you,

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.229
is terrifying for them. Their brain goes
into

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.110
alarm. When we understand the negative
impacts of

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.350
love we can love more intelligent. When
you think about the positive effects of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.840
love,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.030
the new science is very clear. When we are
loved

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.530
we blossom. Love: a good love
relationship, a good secure bond,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.690
helps us feel good about ourselves, helps
us know who we are,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.590
protects us from stress, encourage us
to be

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.930
open, and out into the world and explore.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.650
Actually impacts our mental health, we're
less likely to get depressed.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.790
It just makes us stronger and more whole
as human beings

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.900
and creates these amazing relationships

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.080
that give us a safe haven to take us
through life.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.250
A safe place to stand and grow. So yes,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.240
science says love indeed

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.479
is the most powerful thing in the world - for us.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.489
Yes it is, for our species.

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.650
We are homo vinculum: the one who
bonds.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.930
We are not just social animals, we need
love.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.550
