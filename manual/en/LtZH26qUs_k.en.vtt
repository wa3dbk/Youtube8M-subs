00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:06.089
Okay.

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.389
We're at the drill press, and we're getting
ready to remove the material for our mortise.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.400
We've marked it out.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.199
And, the one thing you want to set here is,
first get our Fortstner bit in here.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.590
A Forstner bit is a drill that creates a flat-bottom
straight-side hole, and that's perfect for

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.610
making mortises.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.869
We've got that in, it's a half inch bit.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.800
The other thing we're going to want to set
is a depth stop, so we only go down as far

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.960
as we need to, and on a drill press you usually
have a way to force the drill press to stop

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.480
at a certain point, and that's what this is.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.329
So, I've set these nuts so that they're going
to stop right on the line down here that I've

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.370
marked, that represents the depth of our tenon,
and how far it's going to go down.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.350
Now, one thing with mortises and tenons - you
want to leave a little extra room at the bottom

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.930
for the glue to collect, so we'll be doing
that as well.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.610
We'll be going a little deeper than the tenon's
actual length.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.490
But that should cover us with the depth.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.140
Now we're ready to drill.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.650
When you're drilling out a mortise on the
drill press, one of the things you always

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.950
going to want to do is to...you're drilling
holes like this in succession - drill one

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.369
at the end, at one end, and one at the other
end, first, and then you hollow out the middle

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.079
parts, as necessary.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:18.609
The rest of this extra stuff we're going to
chisel out.

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:20.250
All right, so first cut.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.399
We want to get it set on the end of the line
here, and I've got my Fence already set up

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:38.689
so that I'm going to keep parallel, so I'm
ready to drill.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:47.789
Forstner bits - you want to just take a little
material at each pass, until you get down

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.200
to your bottom.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200
There we go.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.450
That's one side.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:02.559
Now we'll do the other.

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:10.979
Okay.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.129
Now I can get the rest of this out, just by
going through the middle.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:23.159
There we go.

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:29.700
There's not much to grab onto, so the drill
press and the bit are going to move around

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.700
a little bit.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.969
That's okay.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.019
Okay.

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:39.530
We've roughed it out, and that's what we have
to work with.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.359
So, now we can square this out using the chisels.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.629
Now we're making the tenon, and we're using
the table saw, with a set of Dado Blades.

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:53.290
Dado Blades are a set of blades that you stack
up in to make a very thick cutting blade that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.719
removes a lot of material at once, and it
makes the table saw capable of doing all kinds

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.459
of different joinery, including, making tenons
very easily.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.299
There's a couple steps to setting this up.

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.870
The first one is we've gotta get the saw blade
at the right height.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.459
Now, we're going to be passing this piece
of wood over the top of the Dado Blades, like

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:15.999
that, so that means we have to set our blade
height such that we capture the height of

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:18.400
the tenon.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.910
With table saw blades you have to be careful...you
want to be at the maximum height of that arc,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.099
when you're checking.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.599
I'm just lowering the blade now.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.120
A little bit of eyeballing here, and one of
the things when you do eyeball measurements

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.060
like this, you should always run a piece of
scrap through first, and check your set up,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.980
before you work on your actual pieces.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.010
We've got the height set.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.010
Now, our other set up, is...what we're going
to want to do, is make our first cut along

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.970
the shoulder of the tenon.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.150
That's the lower limit of the tenon as it
comes down into the piece of wood.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.060
That shoulder has to be even all the way around,
evenly cut all the way around on this piece

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.250
of wood, and so, we're going to have to find
a way to make that cut in the same place every

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.250
single time.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.739
We're doing this cut four times on this piece
of wood.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.760
So, the way to do that in woodworking on a
table saw, is to use a stop block.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.209
A stop block is just basically a piece of
wood that you push up against every time you

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.940
make a cut, so that you're in the same place,
and if I rotate it around, I can bump up against

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.350
it again, and make the same cut.

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.310
I'm lining up that pencil line with the outside
edge of the blade.

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.490
Just looking down on top of it, getting it
set up.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.720
It's right up against there.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.720
Okay.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.830
With that in place, I'm going to hold that,
I'm going to bring the Fence over, top it

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.430
up against there, with the block in place.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.380
The block's not going to be here, but I'm
just setting the Fence with it there.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.819
Now I'll lock the Fence down.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.620
Now I can take out the block, and put it back
here somewhere in a safe place.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.940
I'm going to clamp the block to the Fence
back here, so now when I bump up against that

00:04:52.940 --> 00:06:17.280
block, I'll be in the right place to make
the cut.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.450
And there's our tenon.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:29.800
And I'll just chop these out real quick, using
a couple of bench chisels.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:37.400
So, we have to go down the whole depth of
the mortise, but it's not really a good idea

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.460
to go all the way down with these bench chisels.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:44.000
They don't have enough thickness, like a real
mortising chisel would, to get the whole depth

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.099
out at once.

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:51.460
We're just going to go gradually, and get
the material removed.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.879
All right.

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.240
We're almost down to the bottom.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.380
Get the waste out, and, a little more clean
up, and we'll be done.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.380
There we go.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.380
Okay.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.340
Got all the chips out, and we'll fit the mortise
in.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.979
Nice, tight fit.

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.869
It fits nice and square and snug, pulling
those two pieces together.
