00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.411
Now that we have the fabric cut out for the
strap of the purse. You'll remember that we

00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:15.290
did 6 inches wide and 39 inches long so it
can be finished at 37 inches long and 5 inches

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.779
wide. And in order to make the strap 5 inches
wide what we're going to do is get the fabric

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.750
and just put right sides together. This fabric
you can't really tell because the right sides

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.590
and wrong sides look the same so I'm not really
concerned about it. But your fabric might

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.760
not be this way. You just want to make sure
that the right side of the fabric is on the

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.079
inside. So you put right sides together, that's
basically what that means is laying across

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.809
each other. And then I'm just going to start
sewing it. But before I start sewing I'm going

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.680
to get my ruler and make sure that this strap
is going to be 2 1/2 inches from the edge

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.171
to where I sew. And we're going to leave a
half inch seam allowance that we're going

00:00:56.171 --> 00:01:02.870
to press out after this. Okay, so from where
my needle is to the edge of the fabric over

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.630
here is 2 1/2. In most sewing machines, most
likely your sewing machine too, has marks

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.530
on it and you can just catch a mark. So I
know from here to right here on the edge of

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.780
my sewing machine is 2 1/2. I don't have to
go through and remeasure the whole time. I'm

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.440
just going to go ahead and sew. Start right
here and back stitch. Well, that happens a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.930
lot so we just have to re-thread it. It wont
take but a second. It actually happens a lot

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.829
and if you're a seamstress you know that.
It comes out so many times. So anyways lets

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.729
start this again. Let's back tack right here.
And so this is my edge. I'm just going to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.740
make sure that fold is right there on the
edge the whole time when I sew. And I also

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.650
need to make sure these guys meet right there
on top of each other. And just hold it and

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.070
sew. And we're going to sew all the way to
the end just like this. And just keep folding

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.020
it over and holding it against it just to
make sure. There we go. I like to come and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.479
just hold it, press it flat, then we just
pull it a little bit. And this is the inside

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.610
of the strap and this isn't going to show
at all. There we go. And then if you've got

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.780
it cut a little bit more wider than 6 inches
this is where you take out the extra fabric

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:33.030
and make sure that it's just 2 1/2 inches.
So, here we go. Get it flat. Here we come

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.271
to the end and what we want to do is make
sure you back tack because we don't want that

00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:45.180
coming loose when we're trying t flip it out
to the right side. And now that we have this

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.440
sewn what we're going to do next is go ahead
and iron this seam open. Just like that. But

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.120
let's get the iron ready and we'll show you
how to do that in the next clip.
