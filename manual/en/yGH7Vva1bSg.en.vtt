00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.650
whats up youtube fans and tech fans.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:18.270
welcome to another show of era of the geeks,
i'm your host han and this, is a build video.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.360
so first off before we head on to the build
video i'm gonna run down through quickly of

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.270
the components that i chose for this build
his budget was around 3300 ringgit give or

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.270
take a few hundreds

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:37.620
first off i have the processor which is the
intel i7-4790 which is the new haswell refresh

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:45.620
or code named devils canyon and for the motherboard
i chose the asrock b85 killer for the price

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.720
to performance that it offers and the ram
that i chose was the kingston hyper x fury

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.780
ram which is one of the latest lineups from
kingston.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.540
this one is the 4gb i bought two of these
so it totals up to 8gb

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:10.660
they don't have the 8gb kits available but
i'm not sure if they even have any and for

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:20.620
the power supply i have the xigmatek vector
s 650 watt 80+ silver and for the cooling

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:30.090
i chose the thermaltake tt water 3.0 pro if
i'm not mistaken, yeah i've got that one because

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.190
even if he is not overclocking he wants the
processor to last a little bit longer than

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:45.010
it should so good cooling would be better
because silicones and heat, not good.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.100
and last but not least, oh i'm sorry.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:57.759
for the storage i've got the samsung 840 evo
ssd for the price for about 200, i think about

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.350
280 the performance is good, the read and
writes are good.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.810
talking about performance i'll have a short
benchmark of these components right here at

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.549
the end of the build video so stay tuned for
that and i have leadtek gtx760 graphics card.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:22.930
for the price it performs quite well and checkout
the benchmark video later on.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.999
and for the case i've got the bitfenix shadow,
design looks fine, and the price is not too

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:37.719
expensive and it is also aesthetically pleasing
to look at, the build quality is great for

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.540
a budget case, totally like it.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.010
so don't forget to like the video if you liked
it, dislike if you disliked it and comment

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.800
