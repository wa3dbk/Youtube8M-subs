00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.920
The performance that you just saw was the
Lion Dance (wu shi), a Chinese traditional folk art.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.680
Lions are considered brave and auspicious in China.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.160
People perform wu shi on festivals to
ward off bad luck and pray for a happy life.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.640
There are two dancers - one for the head and
one for the rear.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.700
They cooperate with each to other to make
the different gestures of the lion.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.280
"I hold the head, and it is a tiring job.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.360
The performance is becoming more difficult."

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.850
The dancers must have basic martial arts training,
therefore they can accomplish difficult manoeuvres.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.160
Now wu shi is not only popular in China but
also in any place where Chinese live.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.500
"If there's a Lion Dance in your country,
why not watch it?"
