00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.000
Clock!

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.200
Can you help me clean... The outdoor... Kitchen.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.000
Sure...

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.700
What the heck Clock?! Why do you have to clean up Pie's stupid kitchen!?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.500
Basket Ball this is a bad idea, they have to help each other.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.019
What is your point Pillow?! Pie and Clock are DATING!?

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.500
Clock can you change my voice?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.039
Sure, I guess....

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.000
Okay, now I have to put this voice--

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So... Will you put it on me?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.600
Okay. Now test it.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600
Okay. Hey it works!

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.640
Hey guys!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.700
Seriously Pie, your voice sucks even more!

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.430
There is no time talking. It's time for Cake at Stake.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.790
"This is Cake at Stake"
"Who will get a cake"

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.940
"Who will now get out"
"We hope he doesn't shout"

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.940
-What THE HECK WAS THAT?!
-This was our first Cake at Stake song.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.810
This is your elimination...

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.060
...area

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.780
So, we got 35 votes. This is a record!

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.990
And today's prizes are something special.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.560
-Really?
-Yes, they are pokeballs.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.700
So Lollipop and Saw are safe with one
vote each.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.000
-Fanny is safe with 2 votes.
-Finally.
-Remote is safe with 5 votes,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.560
Are you serious?!

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.020
Cake has 8 votes, while Basket Ball has a record of 18 votes.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.640
But no one is eliminated yet. BB and Cake...

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.640
..Come with me.
-Why?
-Not you Barf Bag.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.270
Why are we on contestant throwers?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.940
Team Runaway Stars will pick
someone to join their team...

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.210
...while the other is eliminated so, Pie...

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.730
...Choose--
-Wait, what?!
-I pick Cake, just don't try to eat me.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.250
I will.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:38.250
BB is an idiot!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.040
I pick Cake.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.269
Well, I'm afraid...

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.040
...about Cake, so I guess I pick BB.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.170
I agree

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.940
Well, Cake is a funny person, he won in Episode 3, but...

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.490
...he is dumb.
-Thanks for that you...

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.410
...called me...

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.200
...dumb!
-And Basket Ball, you won the...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.810
...challenge in Episode 3, but lost in episode 4.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.960
-Can you pick already?!
-Um... I don't know!

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.190
-Sigh, fine, I guess I'll pick Basket Ball.
-Whaaat?!

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.190
Because, they will go to the JK.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.120
Yoyleberries.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.420
Eggy, why did you eat those yoyleberries?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.250
-Yeah Eggy, why!?
-I was hungry...

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.489
...And I wanted to turn into metal.

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.180
Eggy...

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.209
-You're the dumbers person!
-Wow Eggy, are you okay?

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.670
Yes, I'm metal, I'm so strong!

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.900
-Good--
-SHUT UP BB!

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.080
-Not you Barf Bag, it's not you!
-Okay then

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.800
-So your challenge is to escape the maze of doom.
-Yes!

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.800
Not cool!

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.269
Great! I'm alone!

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.280
I will eat you!

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.690
-What are you doing here Cake?
-I was hungry.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.800
Go to the JK.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:39.190
-You're not alone.
-What the?! Empty Pie?! He's dead!

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.300
Pie is a girl.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.150
I have to recover her!

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.600
-Cloudy and Bell, why are you guys here?
-I'm on your team.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.340
-And I think we are the first to escape the maze.
-HI PIE!
-Hi and Pie rhymes! But anyways.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.360
-What is it?
-I JUST CAME TO SAY HI!!!

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.000
Marker, do you think we will EVER escape?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.370
Yeah... But we have to be sure Evil Leafy doesn't appe--

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:15.370
Run!

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.840
-Wait... I have something in my bag.
-Yoyleberries?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.310
No... A MECHANICAL PUFFBALL!

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.570
Team Castaway got first place, but it's down to...

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.630
...Team Losers and Team Runaway Stars.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.780
Fanny! You can fly, take us out of this maze.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.810
I can't take you DUMB IDIOT!!!

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.810
Then YOU...

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.000
...fly out of the maze!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:58.770
-Like, I got an airplane!
-LIAR!!!!!

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.600
Let's run!

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.469
-Where's Lollypop?
-Where is Basket Ball?

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.310
I can't run!

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.000
Bye bye sucker!

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.100
I will beat you old teammate!

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:25.080
A MOVING WALL!?

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.000
Bye Basket Ball!

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.500
Yes! I escaped!

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.870
