Pitch to Rich is an annual competition, an
opportunity for entrepreneurs across the UK

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.430
to pitch their ideas to Richard Branson.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.710
Earlier in the year we put out a call right
across the UK saying if you've got a business

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.210
that you're in the start up stages of we want
to hear your ideas.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.779
We invited people to vote.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.980
The idea was that four of the most popular
would be selected for the live pitching event.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.020
I'm really excited about having this opportunity,
all this exposure is just fantastic publicity.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.949
So when we're gonna be actually pitching to
him directly it's going to be a pretty surreal

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.370
experience I think, but very very happy to
be here.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.370
My business is about engines.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.079
Very high combustion efficient engines.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.960
It was amazing, just a great opportunity,
it's so surreal that we were actually on the

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960
stage.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.890
Okay well we've heard all the pitches and
now we're off to deliberate!

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.320
Really excited to be part of today and part
of Pitch for Rich.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.320
I like talking to people that are about to
set up a business or are in early stages of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.281
their business because you know, it's not
that long ago that I was setting up my own

00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:18.600
business and I think like most entrepreneurs
we all like sharing our war stories or giving

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.409
someone a nugget of advice or a tip that we
think might help them, because we've all had

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.250
people along the way that helped us.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:31.070
Okay give us a shout out as to who you think
has won.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.000
You're right!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.240
This is like the best thing I ever won, ever.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.929
This is just a great achievement it's still
so surreal that we've actually won the award.

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:46.979
The advice I would give the next year's competition
would be to come up with something that people

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.369
really need, that will actually change people's
lives.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.460
Entrepreneurs have certain types of qualities,
I think number one is self-belief because

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.409
you get knocked down all the time, not everyone
believes in your ideas but it's that inner

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.549
belief in what you have and also what your
idea is to go ahead and execute it.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.920
Enterprise is for me, and what you see around
here is a mindset it's not about business

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.920
it's about a mindset.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.150
Don't try to copy your friends or do something
that makes yourself look good, do something

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.480
which makes you feel happy and keep going.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.480
Never give up.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.610
It made a really large impact on the business
because it meant that I had some money to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.800
go make some prototypes, but also it got a
following behind the project because when

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.860
someone like Richard Branson is behind you,
other people start to be interested.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.170
When they're building their businesses, they've
just got to concentrate on survival, but once

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.550
they've got their business in a state where
they know it's going to survive and they can

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.250
start, you know, thinking about helping other
people.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.590
If we can get every single business in the
world to think like that then we can get on

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.460
top of most of the world's problems.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.740
You've got an idea for starting a business
or you know a friend who wants to start a

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.940
business, either yourself or your friend you
should get involved with Virgin Media Pioneers,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.000
who have got thousands of people developing
their businesses and lots of mentors to help

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.340
you.
