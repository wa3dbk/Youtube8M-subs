00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.770
Hey, this is Richard Jefferson.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.480
Today I want to talk to you guys about heaven
for a couple of moments.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.230
The greatest decision I've ever made in my
life is giving my life to Jesus Christ.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.789
And there's a place that every person will
go when they leave this earth.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.590
It's either heaven, or it's hell.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.690
And heaven's going to be a place, like it
says in John chapter 14, He says, let not

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.130
your heart be troubled, but believe in God,
believe also in Me.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.000
I go to prepare a place for you.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.920
A place where you can come if you come to
the foot of the cross today.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.260
And heaven is going to be a place where there's
no more sorrow, there's no more tears, there's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.650
no more, there's no more pain, there's no
more struggle.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.370
I know we live in a crazy world today, I know
we live in a place of, of uncertainty.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.540
Maybe you're not so certain, maybe you're
not so certain in your mom, maybe you're not

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.770
so certain in your dad, maybe you're not so
certain in anything around you, your job.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.610
I don't know, maybe you're not so certain
in school.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.870
I don't know where you are in life today,
friend, but let me tell you this, that there's

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.940
a place where you can go when you leave this
earth.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.149
That there will be no more sorrow, there will
be no more of anything that you guys are going

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.149
through today.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.160
There's going to be a place that's going to
wipe all that place away.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.209
I know a lot of people have their, you may
have your concept or your perception on what

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.889
heaven really is, but heaven is a place where,
where, where literally, right now, angels

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:21.409
and, and different people that have gone on
before us, and that have died, maybe it's

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.640
your grandmother, maybe it's your dad, maybe
it's your mom, maybe it's your brother, maybe

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.100
it's your sister, that have given their life
to Jesus Christ years ago, are today, but

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.100
that have passed on.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.270
They're in a place called heaven where there's
nothing going on right now but just praising

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.020
and worshiping God their Creator.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.609
The heaven of the universe, there's angels,
that's all heaven is is just one big praise

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.280
and worship service.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.100
Heaven is described as a place that's going
to be with pearly gates.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.670
There's going to be streets of gold.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.599
I know a lot of you guys today, you guys are,
or maybe some of your families are struggling,

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:53.880
or maybe you say "You know what, I'm going
to grow up one day and I want to own a mansion

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.889
on a hill, I want to drive the best car, I
want to go to the finest schools, and I want

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:58.279
to accomplish this and that."

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:03.850
Or maybe you're working so hard to get a diamond
ring or, you know, a gold bracelet around

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.390
- but we're going to walk on the streets of
gold, and the Bible said that we're going

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.900
to be clothed in white robes, and we're going
to have gold slippers on our feet and we're

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.050
going to have a crown, we're going to be crowned
one day to the faithful.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.360
So let me tell you heaven is a place that
you can't afford not to go.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.530
You can't afford not to go to heaven, you
guys need to go to heaven, you guys need to

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.190
make up your minds and say "You know what,
I'm going to give my life to Jesus today."

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.570
I know everything can seem so uncertain, and
you guys may say, "You know what, how do you

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.190
know that heaven is a certain place?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.560
I live in such a world of uncertainty, how
do you know that heaven is a certain place?"

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.590
Because if heaven wasn't a certain place,
everything that I'm telling you guys today

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.780
is just a lie.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.430
But you know what, even if everything that
I am telling you guys is a lie, let me tell

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.350
you, there's life after death.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.490
You guys are gonna, you guys are gonna go
to one place when you guys die, it's either

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.880
heaven or it's hell.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.410
It's like when you do something wrong on this
earth, you guys either go to heaven, I mean,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.100
you guys either go to jail, or guys are out
of jail.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.950
You guys have a choice, though, what are you
guys, who are you guys going to serve today?

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.200
You guys have a choice to make that decision
to either go to heaven or go to hell.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.570
I mean, He gave us a description of heaven,
what heaven's going to be like, friend.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.040
And that's a description of just what I told
you guys.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.460
So once you guys open up your heart today,
and if you guys were to leave the building

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.180
or leave the place where you guys were right
now, and die, do you guys really know if you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.510
guys are going to go to heaven or not?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.700
Or are you guys going to go to that other
place?

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.510
I know that you guys say "You know what, I
don't know, I don't know about this God thing."

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.620
You guys can't afford not to know about it.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.110
So open up your heart today and really, really
see the picture, really hear what I'm telling

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.220
you guys today, because you know what, friend?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.500
When you die you are going to stand before
Jesus.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.240
He said it's appointed unto men, in Hebrews
9:27, He said it's appointed unto men once

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.770
to die, and after that the judgment.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.960
So you guys have a place, you guys, you guys
are going to stand before the King of Kings

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.350
and the Lord of Lords when you die.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.750
You guys are one heartbeat away from eternity.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.810
If your heart was to stop right now, friend,
you guys will stand before God.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.090
You say, "My body will fall here" but you
guys have a soul and spirit, how do you know

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.510
you have a soul and spirit?

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.950
When you go to sleep at night, what wakes
you up in the morning?

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.180
It's called your soul, it's called your spirit.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.990
That's how you, that's how there's, that's
how, that's why I'm telling you, friend, that

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.320
you really need to give your heart to Jesus,
so you guys can go to that place today called

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.510
heaven.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.900
And that's the best way I can explain it to
you, friend.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.820
Thank you.
