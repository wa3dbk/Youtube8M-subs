00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Why should we bother building greenroofs and greenwalls?

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.320
Attempt number 7

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.340
Hi, my name is Cynthia Villalba and I am a recovering addict

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.200
I am addicted to create greenroofs and greenwalls where there is only gray and concrete

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.600
My addiction started 10 years ago

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.740
In 2004 I presented a business case to the executive board of an important financial institution

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.940
To implement a greenroof at the new Headquarter building that was under construction at the time

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.640
right in front of The Angel of Independence monument... I know, I was naive...

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.580
Specially when I was new at the institution

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.820
and my job position was not a really high one

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.080
It took me by surprise and it was great to my addiction...

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.860
when only after a couple of weeks I got an email from the Banks CEO himself

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.320
It was a Thank You email for the environmental proposal and the budget authorization

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.200
to build a greenroof at the HSBC Headquarters offices in front ot The Angel monument plus 4 more bank branches

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:07.360
In that moment I felt a bloodstream with dopamine, endorphins, and adrenaline flowing all over my body

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.880
beneath the skin... this "green demon" within me was alive!

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.300
I guess thats what Hulk feels when he transforms... btw Hulk is also green...

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.000
I think this new addiction that I recently learned about myself was always there, dormant

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.280
So I allowed that this addiction took control of myself and thus it changed my life radically

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.180
i quit my financial career and I dedicated completely to this new career

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.980
Now I am a "greenroofer" with a specialization over "greenwalling"

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.140
Yes I know... :P

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.760
Despite the fact that I might not be the more suitable person for the job since...

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.960
I do not hold any degree on Architecture, Engineering or Biology...

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.720
This is what I DO!

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.740
And I love what I do!

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.980
Greenroofs and greenwalls can be addictive

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.720
They are great mix of elements... some of the best I had tasted... so far (lol)

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.300
Some amazing effects of greenroofs are:

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.280
to capture storm water and return a body of this liquid to its own natural cycle

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.820
to capture pollutant particles like CO2 and plumb generated by our cars and industry

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.160
that otherwise would end up in our lungs...

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
We also decrease over the air conditioning consumption within the buildings

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.940
Btw, studies had proven that cities had increased their temperature compared to

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.280
the surroundings up to 13 celsius degrees (55 F)

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.500
All this due to the increase of pavement surface and the reduction of the green areas

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.380
This is called urban heath island effect.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.240
Also greenroofs recover a lost space... the so called fifth faÃ§ade

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.500
that sometimes is only used to stock up useless objects, in the best scenario

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:56.240
Greenroofs as well as greenwalls are a good space to grow vegetables and food production

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.360
they hold the potential to create thousands of jobs related to production of plants and the implementation of the system

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.980
Green areas are inversely proportional to the crime rate in a given city

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.880
This is... the greater the green area the lesser the crime rate in a city

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.040
greenroofs and greenwalls are relaxing and they beautify the urban landscape

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.080
in a really special and magical way...

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.340
We are no longer used to see beauty in our cities

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.800
We are used to observe only gray, dirty in the streets

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.700
what is wrong with us?  If we are not going to the woods lets bring the woods to our cities

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.020
Cities are becoming on densely populated centers

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.620
country-side inhabitants migration to the cities in search for opportunities to achieve a better life

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.220
is rapidly increasing... and thus the demand for services within the cities is increasing as well

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:54.160
simple services suchs as: clean water, clean air, employment, food, security...

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.480
greenroofs and greenwalls represent an opportunity  to transform our cities

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.920
lets say they are a doorway to evolve the way we live and we relate to each other

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.200
World Bank estimates that by 2020, 50% of world population will live within cities (megacities)

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.340
We cannot stop this trend

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.400
and we cannot control the decision making process of millions of people who will migrate to cities in the next years

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.560
but what we CAN DO is to prepare for the change, adapting ourselves and our cities

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.860
We can use this powerful capabilities living within our heart and that are called

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.520
... Human Creativity and Tenacity

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.420
not just because its a global trend but because We ARE THIS WORLD!

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.820
And each one of us can make a decision that will benefit ourselves and also our community

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.100
greenroofs and greenwalls are part of this new economical-social-environamental generation

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.360
There were times when we thought that we lived disconected from each other, but those are part of the past

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.920
Now we know that we are so connected to each other, more than ever

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:05.640
Whatever I do will benefit or damage you as much as whatever you do will benefit or damage me

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:12.400
In 2008 I founded a Company that has build greenroofs and greenwalls in several cities in Mexico

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.520
Our projects had been recognized internationally

00:05:16.788 --> 00:05:19.668
We had greened more than 4,000 m2 (43,000 sqft)

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.300
and we are up to green 3,000 more

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.400
however, like all the addictions, it is never enough

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.060
We need a radical change.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.760
So we started with training courses to other professionals

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.560
and a common question on these courses is "why do you do this?"

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:46.420
"why do you share your knowledge with people who will eventually become your competitors on the short or long term?"

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.120
And I always answer the same way...

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.900
We need to start thinking as a community

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.140
it is exactly that selfish-benefit way-of-thinking which brought us to this point

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.080
this economical-socio-environmental catharsis

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.900
If you start from what I can share... You will reach farther and unimaginable places

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.220
and together with you the rest of humanity will keep progressing

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.880
My name is Cynthia Villalba and even when I am addicted to greenroofs and greenwalls

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.660
I dont want to recover myself... because of one only reason

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.800
this makes me feel connected and alive!

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.400
this "green demon" that lives within me has no cure and it was not a mistake

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:31.020
and it has everything to do with you and with me as well,  Thank you for watching!
