of smokes that's right apistogramma was
I haven't always been too hot on the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.260
species I'll admit my boy Kurt used to
keep I didn't think they were that great

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.010
he's since moved on to Colorado to
become a ganja preneur but then I picked

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
up this bad boy at an HD a like five six
years ago not really sure a pistol is

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.980
folks let's get into it they come from
all over South America there's like a

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.460
hundred different species they come from
slow stagnant low pH waters in fact I

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.180
put them with my own two bare hands you
can click here to see the video I've

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.280
been catching a pista crumb a bite and
yata in Peru's totally sick experience

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.780
note I am going to Peru again in January

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350
with me here and click the link here to
find out more about it or drop me a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.840
comment apistogramma the word literally
means your regular lateral line and

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.200
there's all kinds of species of epistles
works like a hundred different species

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.540
um some of my favorites apistogramma
caca toy tease obviously apistogramma

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.869
bitey nyata
there's panduru my boy Mike Bernard has

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.780
a steel blue epistle Michael if you're
going to pray with me dog let's make it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.189
happen okay and what's tight about them
too is they're readily available in the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.210
Hobby okay because they're typically
pretty easy to breed um some of them are

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.630
hair responders polygamous if you will
one male multiple females some of whom a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.560
monogamous one male one female just
depends on the species the females

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.689
highly involved in brood care the male
will defend the territory with sex of

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.670
the fry is affected by water changes
temperature the differences in the water

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.270
so warmer water and more acidic water
typically yields more males I found that

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.810
out from a guy in Cincy selling me the
triple red so a couple of notes about

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.160
officials I think we're noting here is
the female apistogramma oh look a lot of

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.629
like okay it's tough for me to tell
a lot of them so just make a note of

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.540
that you want to make sure if you're
hunting down a specific species that you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.629
do in fact have the female that is a
species you think it is because they all

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.859
look a lot alike okay
males pretty easy to tell apart so also

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:30.510
I've found these fish when you see them
in pet stores most pet stores they don't

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.139
typically look that great they're kind
of hiding and slump back and I will fat

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.310
get them home feed them up the color up
