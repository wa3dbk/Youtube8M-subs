00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.470
Welcome to "Revelation Unraveled",

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.070
I'm your host, William Tapley,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.750
also known as the "Third Eagle of the Apocalypse",

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.480
and the "Co Prophet of the End Times".

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.009
On this program I want to show you how to pray

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.219
the rosary,

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.500
and I was asked to do this video by

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.160
the YouTuber who was formerly known as 
Megaman2160.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.470
He is constantly under attack by the satanists

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.009
on YouTube,

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.160
and he now goes by other titles but

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.310
you can look him up if you want to.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.679
He also makes videos exposing

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.580
the evils in our society,

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.610
and he would like to learn how to pray
the rosary; I don't believe he is a Catholic.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.400
But, the rosary is not just for Catholics,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.880
and I have here a very large rosary that was
given to me,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.020
and this is mainly for demonstration purposes,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.230
and you begin the rosary by praying the

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.279
"I believe in God the father almighty", and so on,

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:03.590
in other words, the "Apostle's Creed". You can
look up the "Apostle's Creed" yourself

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.710
on the internet on exactly what words to pray.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.930
You pray that on the main crucifix which
is part of the rosary.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.299
Now, the first bead,

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.920
in this case it's a rose because this is a rosary
made out of roses,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.110
on the first bead you pray the "Our Father",

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.330
in other words, the "Lord's Prayer".

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.270
On the next three beads

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.170
you pray "Hail Marys".

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.700
The "Hail Mary" is a biblical prayer

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.860
it was first said by God the father to the
blessed virgin Mary

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.840
through his messenger the archangel Gabriel.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.380
In fact, it is God's

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.880
love letter to Mary.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.380
Following these three "Hail Marys" you pray
a "Glory Be":

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.619
"glory be to the father and to the son and to
the holy spirit,

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.090
as it was in the beginning, is now and ever
shall be,  world without end, amen".

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.170
And then I add the angels prayer from Fatima:

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.860
"oh, my Jesus, forgive us our sins,

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.940
save us from the fires of hell,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.060
lead all souls to heaven,

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.890
especially those most in need of thy mercy".

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.339
And then you begin the five decades of the
rosary,

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:10.919
and you pray

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.479
according to a certain

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.619
set of mysteries.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:15.960
The first set of mysteries are called

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.430
the joyful mysteries,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.549
and they include the "annunciation",
the "visitation",

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.510
the "nativity", the "presentation in the temple",

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.749
and "Jesus is lost and found again in the
temple".

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:29.719
So, on the first ten "Hail Marys" we will

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:33.689
concentrate on the annunciation; the 
angel Gabriel

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.109
announcing to Mary that she is to be the
mother of our savior.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.709
And, you begin a decade with

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.199
the "Our Father"

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.319
on this first rose, or bead.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.429
The next ten beads, one, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight, nine, ten;

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:50.290
those ten

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.019
you pray "Hail Marys".

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.109
Again, you conclude the decade by saying the
"Glory Be",

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.089
"glory be to the father", et cetera,

00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.029
then the angel's prayer,"Oh my Jesus", et cetera;

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.550
and thus you have completed

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.540
the first decade of a rosary.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.269
Then you begin the second decade; again, you
pray an "Our Father".

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.739
Then you pray ten "Hail Marys".

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.650
Those ten "Hail Marys", in case of the joyful mysteries,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.359
will be the visitation where Mary visits her
cousin Elizabeth.

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.979
Again, you conclude the decade, or ten "Hail
Marys",  with a "Glory Be",

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.739
and then the "Oh My Jesus", the angel's prayer.

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.090
Again, you pray another decade, another ten

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.589
"Hail Marys",

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.169
beginning with the "Our Father"

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:35.739
and saying ten more "Hail Marys".

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.189
In the joyful mysteries those would be,

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.449
you would think about the

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:43.539
nativity, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem.

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.040
The rosary is a Biblical prayer

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.139
and you should

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.439
think about the events in the rosary which
the decade signifies.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:54.479
Following the third joyful mystery, again

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.850
you pray the "Glory Be",

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.079
the angel's prayer, and then you go to the 
fourth mystery,

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.379
in this case the fourth mystery would be the
"presentation in the temple".  You begin with

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:04.340
an "Our Father",

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.429
as always,

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:08.629
you say ten "Hail Marys", on the next ten beads,

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.059
you conclude the decade again by saying the "Glory Be",

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:14.809
the angel's prayer, and you are now ready 
for the fifth decade

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:16.599
of the joyful mysteries.

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:18.359
You pray the "Our Father",

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.449
you pray ten more "Hail Marys",

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:22.489
and then you conclude with the

00:04:22.489 --> 00:04:25.120
"Glory Be" and the angel's prayer.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.500
The fifth joyful mystery would be:

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.629
"Jesus is lost and found again in the temple".

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.410
So now you have said

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.119
fifty "Hall Marys", five "Our Fathers",

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:38.279
the "Apostle's Creed",

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:40.189
which began the rosary,

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:42.939
and the intermittent prayers in between.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.740
And that is one complete

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.509
rosary.

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:48.330
You should really pray

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.949
four rosaries in a day,

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.779
and each of the mysteries 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:55.509
depict incidents in Jesus' life.

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.879
The second set of mysteries are the luminous
mysteries, the third set are the

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:04.349
sorrowful mysteries and finally you
finish with the glorious mysteries.

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.729
Now, if you are just beginning, Megaman,

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.930
I would advise you NOT to pray the whole
rosary. This is a spiritual exercise,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.259
and just like when you exercise your body
you start slowly.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:18.360
In fact, I would say just one "Hail Mary" the
first day,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.409
and then, maybe after a couple of days,

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.339
say a decade, which would be ten "Hail Marys".

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.740
Maybe, by the end of the week, or a couple of
weeks

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.370
you could try an entire rosary, and sometimes
you can split up the rosary, say a couple

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.830
of decades in the morning,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.179
a couple of decades in the afternoon, and
so on.

00:05:35.179 --> 00:05:39.889
Personally, I try, I don't always succeed, I
try to get in all

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.729
four mysteries of the rosary.

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.970
I believe the reason we have four mysteries

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.879
is because that is an end times number.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.750
For almost a thousand years there were only
three mysteries,

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.619
but Pope John Paul the second

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:52.330
added the

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.029
fourth set or luminous mysteries.

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.960
So, that concludes my

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.300
teaching on the rosary. I hope you found this
interesting, Megaman, this is for you, the

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.829
Lord told me to do this video for you

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:09.519
so, I hope you start praying the rosary and
I hope everyone in my audience does also.

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:11.020
This is the weapon,

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:11.990
Mary's rosary

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.930
is the weapon which will defeat

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.419
the anti christ along with Mary's scapular.

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:18.259
And, if you'd like more information,
