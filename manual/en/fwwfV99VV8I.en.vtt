00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.381
This is something that everyone needs to
know how to do. First step is to take the

00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:07.560
wheel off. You start by undoing the
brakes, and then undo the quick release.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.200
If it's the front wheel, you need to
unwind the quick release slightly,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.930
so that it clears the safety tabs at the
bottom of the forks. If it's the back

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.270
wheel you're taking out, you need to shift
the chain into the smallest sprocket at

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.170
the back. Make sure you pull the
derailleur back out of the way,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.580
so that the sprocket is clear the
jockey wheels when it drops out.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.330
Take your tire levers, and at the opposite
end of the wheel from the valve,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.320
you need to insert the first one
underneath the bead of the tire.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.500
Now this is the bit that sits inside the
rim. Take the second tire lever and insert

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.020
it under the bead of the tire about 12
centimeters further down the rim.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.150
When you lever the first one, and
then you lever the second one,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.600
the bead of the tire should pop over the
edge of the rim, and it also should free

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.070
up enough slack in the tire now, that you
can pull the rest of it off with the heel

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.868
of your hand.

00:00:50.151 --> 00:00:53.960
To take the valve, pull this
out of the rim. If there's a lock ring

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.680
that holds your valve in place in the rim,
you need to remove this first.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.670
Once you've done that, you can just take
the tube out. If you change your inner

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.960
tube because you've had a puncture, the
next step is really important.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.240
You need to check the inside of the tire
for any foreign objects that might have

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.300
caused your puncture, thorns or glass or
anything like that. Take a new inner tube,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.420
remove the dust cap and remove the lock
ring, and then partially inflate the inner

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.910
tube, just so that it holds its shape.
Take the valve of the tube and insert it

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.500
through the valve hole in the rim, and
then tuck the rest of the tube back into

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.750
the well of the rim. To refit the last
side of the tire, I find it really helps

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.030
if the wheel is on the ground in front of
me, pointing out, so I can just tuck the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.830
bead inside the rim with my fingers, and
then push it with both my thumbs on either

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.620
side, all around the rim.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.400
Take the last bit of bead and insert your
tire lever very carefully underneath it,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.220
and then lever it so that the tire just
pops back inside the rim.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.430
You might need two or three tire levers
for this last little bit.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.000
Be really careful at this point, because
it's quite easy to pinch the inner tube

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.700
with the tire lever when you're doing this
last stage. So just double check when

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.000
you've got the tire lever inserted, before
you start applying any pressure,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.620
so the inner tube isn't caught here. Make
sure that the tire is fully seated on the

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.080
rim and there are no bits of inner tube
sticking out, because when you re-inflate

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.160
it at this point, it could burst. Put the
wheel back in the frame,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.490
and away you go. Just remember, though,
that if it's the back wheel you're doing,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.020
you need to pull the derailleur towards
the back of the bike again,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.590
just so that it can clear the sprockets,
and the back wheel seats properly.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.880
Put your brakes back on, and you're ready
to go. You can take the tire off without

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.800
using tire levers, and this is my pro tip.
Take the wheel and put it in front of me,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.510
facing up. I take my thumbs, and I run it
on the inside of the bead,

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.510
trying to force any slack between the bead
and the rim towards the bottom.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.290
And then I take this, hopefully there's
enough there that it will clear the rim,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.867
and you can just pull it over with your
fingers or your thumbs.
