00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Love is Perfect Only You are in it

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Lyrics by DING Wei, Music by JIN Wulin, sung by NA Ying (ethnic Manchurian Chinese) and LIANG Bo

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.992
Leaving you like an army deserter,

00:00:52.214 --> 00:00:58.111
I had nowhere to go, no place to retreat.

00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:08.314
Tears of weakness kept reminding me of the taste of failure.

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:13.758
This made me so tired.

00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:21.992
The parting turned out to be so simple.

00:01:23.676 --> 00:01:29.309
A sentence changed everything.

00:01:31.053 --> 00:01:36.693
How should I plan my future?

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:44.144
Should I hide my heart?

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:49.514
Every little thing in the past,

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:52.976
Maybe you've forgoten it.

00:01:53.865 --> 00:02:00.000
Yet whenever I think of you, I always cry.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.229
Love is perfect only you are in it.

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:06.847
Yet I am unable to redeem it.

00:02:07.262 --> 00:02:10.634
Facing every long night alone,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:18.617
I don't want to know that you love another one.

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:52.017
The parting turned out to be so simple.

00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:59.129
A sentence changed everything.

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:06.657
How should I plan my future?

00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:13.967
Should I hide my heart?

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.982
Every little thing in the past,

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:22.653
Maybe you've forgoten it.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:29.140
Yet whenever I think of you, I always cry, cry.

00:03:29.404 --> 00:03:32.531
Love is perfect only you are in it.

00:03:33.121 --> 00:03:36.367
Yet I am unable to redeem it.

00:03:36.664 --> 00:03:40.340
Facing every long night alone,

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:43.837
I don't want to know that you love another one.

00:03:44.011 --> 00:03:47.238
The love becomes a pile of ashes.

00:03:47.707 --> 00:03:51.078
It was once burning so beautifully.

00:03:51.684 --> 00:03:55.006
Having tasted this love in my life,

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:58.938
I will never have my heart broken.

00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.566
Love is perfect only you are in it.

00:04:06.164 --> 00:04:09.424
Yet I am unable to redeem it.

00:04:09.846 --> 00:04:13.168
Facing every long night alone,

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:16.818
I don't want to know that you love another one.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:20.515
The love becomes a pile of ashes.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:24.073
It was once burning so beautifully.

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.769
Having tasted this love in my life,

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:37.130
I will never have my heart broken.
