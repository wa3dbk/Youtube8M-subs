00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's hard to spot them when they come from the right

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Think I'll move, in case we get Long-tailed Ducks

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Over there is one

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Probably won't come here

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Might be an Eider

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I's still alive!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Not anymore

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I will not take the shot

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The've all flown past us just like that...

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Don't move, it might come closer

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Hansi is pointing at something

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Birds approaching!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Mine is not loaded

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
...thought a bird was headed our way
[facepalm]

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
There's a gull!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Look over there

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Should I call on it?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We got its attention

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Think that guy will come back for a second look

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Coward...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Come closer!

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
That's a Tern

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Are those Goldeneyes?!

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
No, Mergansers...

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It dived...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Now he took off

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
...and now he landed

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The birds are over there...!
- That's alright

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Hope you were not in movie mode
