00:00:00.279 --> 00:00:04.279
hi everybody this is Matt your cruise
inspector from germany. Today we have a

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.780
look on the Norwegian Breakaway - the newbult in 2013. So

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.959
let's go aboard now.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.230
okay let's start with the warmth of
slides there are five slides

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.449
in the apple parked they didn't try them

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.890
because i was only

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.699
twenty hours on the west will but i
think you shots

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:24.090
defintely thrive

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.130
these spectacular slights when you are
of all fall for the norwegian correctly

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.480
this is the main pool and couple of
years in the fall of the kits pool

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.190
uh... business coast bias h too

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.410
always uh...

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.870
there will be the celebration

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.320
when the ships that failed

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.090
that's the someone made of glass

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.880
i don't think it would be the right over
me and i think i would feel a little bit

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.560
new word in this trauma

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.020
there are some more polluted and of
course the bartenders last tuesday

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.690
refuted repair

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.450
and in uh... waterfalls

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.830
locate let's go on

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.080
i think uh... enough seats

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.439
coming in this town

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.360
when it's on the political during our
crews

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.430
only young couple and of course fall
while food

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.640
there's a good bit more picky on the
school days because desperate states

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.850
with music hands on it

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.450
when you have read your ring the day out
on bond grill will be fine for you you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.970
can have a burger there

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.640
sandwich orders to drink

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.570
this is part of the haven you know this
is an area on where you can only do you

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.850
can win you have been

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.240
the haven stateroom

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.130
which is much more expensive visit to
wipe beach club

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.310
with the out calls very perfect to relax

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.619
and this is for the haven cost jobs

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.510
all over the place to relax

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.070
fountain pen also then do during the day

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.189
but with all through

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.409
homes for people

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.880
okay falta special of the haven state
rooms

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.629
this is the ropes called it's the
largest built schools at st

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:15.629
antietam escobar called

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:20.719
climbing ward

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.379
onto our shoes for teens from thirteen
to seventeen years

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.269
would alone dancefloor mp

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:31.019
godin cafe is a bossy men

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.789
how do you say bastille birthday i'm not
sure itself

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.069
though don't mind it was wrong

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.229
okay it's like a difficult but there is
the room

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.010
on the norwegian cruise line vessel

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.719
sellers

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.979
breadth

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:53.179
even to the very end brach

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:57.309
and i think when you have these machines
and the bus there s the wrong

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:00.729
you can have wind band you don't need a
bartender

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:04.339
date with your room key

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:08.299
if you if he didn't so much as you go to
the pool fitness center

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.589
they have several rooms this room with
the county machines

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.419
until some of the room

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:17.219
with uh... weight machines and the
weights

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:20.209
i think he looks like a men's health
model

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.089
unbelievable

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.819
the waterfront his might favorite on

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.629
norwegian breakaway

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.839
because there are several bombs and
restaurants on deck aids

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:33.119
where you can sit outside

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:37.679
that's a very rare on cruise ships
that's not the education deck

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.269
it's mints the special every hour

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:42.269
on the eight th

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.259
the education deck is olympic seven

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.269
it's very nice

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.079
unfortunately it was a little bit cold
you in our crew so i A

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.589
wasn't able to have dinner there about
this is really very nice

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:58.180
so um... less of a local on good
restaurants where you have to pay for

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.249
the

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.079
how do you say childress correa

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.809

the photos are in boxes and you have to
look up the number on your card

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.979

vendi f three n on what the genetic

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:08.100

where you can have time for food

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.360
around the clock as well and you have

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.869
downstairs

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:32.389

it's not allowed to should video and
because you know so uh... visit the

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:37.729
reason

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.900
i have to speed it up

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.870
so um... martha phillips and the coolest
nightclub

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:56.899

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:58.939
but you can have

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:04.059
them in that room is one of the three
restaurants where you can get for free

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:07.949
and where you will be sourced

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.030
it's at the heck authorship

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.819

very light

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:20.819
you can look outside if you want taste
his the second restaurant that is free

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.490

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.240
bagel assignment

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.170
devon uk he is very popular

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.330
on the cruise ships off more of the june

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:34.610
you have unconscious

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.060
at the table www

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.310
preparing a musical

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.469
the distal very nice designed restaurant

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.069
it's like a marketplace

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:46.549
and friends

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:52.069
so very much for all i think that
through my favorite restaurant

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:54.799
from the design

00:06:54.799 --> 00:07:00.149
the guests relations desk and on the
other side best the cruise consultant

00:07:00.149 --> 00:07:04.009
and the short explosions desk

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:06.099
okay let's a look in the theater

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.539
five whom crucial vote on the floor

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.219
i think it was mediocre that

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:12.749
probably because i think so many

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:17.369
holes conferences

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:21.069
and finally let's have a look and a
comedy club

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.759
there are comedians sometimes on the
positions

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.800
very nice place you will be evening

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.599
if you like uh... whittier la femme up

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:33.819
and you should definitely subscribe low
channels so you want to miss any video

00:07:33.819 --> 00:07:36.529
consonant roosters so see you next time
bye
