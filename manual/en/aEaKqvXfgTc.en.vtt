00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.689
Hey everybody, welcome to The Take Out DIet. I get 
 inspiration for the show from all over the place.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:11.912
And I saw a commercial the other day, Pizza 
 Hut is promoting their new big sliders

00:00:11.912 --> 00:00:15.952
and instantly I thought, " I could put that on 
 a portobello mushroom and it would be so good."

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:20.178
So that is what we will be doing today. Let's get started.

00:00:20.178 --> 00:00:25.392
Start by setting your oven to broil. I put mine on high, but 
 you know whatever high is on your oven, set it to that."

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:29.663
Next we are going to clean our mushrooms with a wet paper towel.

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:33.901
I am just going to wipe off the outside. I am going 
 to take the remainder of the stem out and 

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:38.939
I am going to remove the gills because a lot 
 of people says that the gills are bitter.

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:42.309
I don't really have a problem with them, so I you 
 don't have a problem with them leave them in.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.740
I am going to take mine out just so nobody will 
 complain about anything. It is the life I live.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:55.088
Next we are going to add olive oil, liquid 
 smoke, salt, and pepper to our mushroom caps.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:01:00.000
Place them in the oven and let them sit 
 under the broiler for about 3 minutes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.067
Next we are going to add our topping.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:07.593
I am going to use this tomato basil pasta 
 sauce by Newman's Own. It smells so good.

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:14.234
I love basil. Then after your tomato sauce, we are 
 going to put on our cheese sauce, then pepperoni.

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:19.273
I'm using these Yves veggie pepperoni, but you can use whatever 
 type of pepperoni you want . . . or not.

00:01:19.273 --> 00:01:24.265
And then a little bit of nutritional yeast, but these are 
 very versatile. You can use whatever toppings you want.

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:32.717
They will probably all taste great together. Put those back under the 
 broiler for 5-7 minutes until they are golden brown 

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:34.761
over the top. Nice hot and toasty, and backed through.

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.711
That is it. It is so simple.

00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:44.210
Now we are ready to taste. That was so good I think I saw 
 heaven and my eyes are watering right now that was so delicious.

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:51.600
The food that I have been making lately, if I can toot 
 my own horn beep beep, like it has been so flavorful.

00:01:51.595 --> 00:01:57.450
That was flavor flavor flavor. Like the cheese sauce, and 
 the pepperoni, and the tomato basil, and the mushroom.

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:01.510
Who doesn't love mushrooms? If you don't, I don't want 
 to hear it because we are not friends. 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.620
I must say that the pepperoni, does not exactly taste like pepperoni.

00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:13.190
Though I have never had salami before, I think I have 
 smelled salami and that is what the pepperoni taste like.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.930
It was still wonderful. It was magnificent in my mouth.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.530
And that is it for today. I have to go and finish this now.

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:24.730
