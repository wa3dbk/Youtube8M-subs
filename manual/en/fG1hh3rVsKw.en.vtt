Hi, I'm Carmen Lynne with Expert Village.
So now we're going to be talking about two

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.549
very important letters. T and I and this is
when the T and I are the small versions or

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:18.490
the lowercase versions of T and I. We're looking
at the T bar and the I dot. So when we're

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.740
looking at the T, we're looking at the stem
of the T and that's this part right here.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.410
And we're looking at the length and we're
also looking at where on the bar it occurs.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:40.980
So that would be like a regular T right there.
Now you might have someone with a very highly

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.760
placed stem or low stem or you might have
someone with a very short stem or a very long

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.770
stem. So all of these things are what factor
in and what that represents is a person's

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.409
self esteem and self confidence. As you can
see from this page right here, there are many

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.940
different ways of doing the T bar crossing
and the T stems. Not only the lengths and

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.620
the height of the T bar, but also sometimes
you've got something like this where its doing

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:20.470
a funny little crossover like that and extra
loops and loops by the way we'll get onto

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.710
that later. They indicate sensitivity generally.
And here there are even more T bar crossings

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.930
of all different types. Sometimes they might
slant down or up. They might have loops within

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.450
them. They might be wavy. And so we're also
looking at the I dot. Alright here you can

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.730
see the very different types of I dots. So
the I dot represents attention to detail.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.240
Obviously if you have the dot right over the
I, that means you are very meticulous. If

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.370
you have the I dot flying out ahead of the
I, that would seem to indicate that you're

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.200
impatient, hasty, want to get things done
and the opposite of that would be someone

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.190
with the I dot before the I like that. That's
someone who might be a little bit holding

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.090
back on getting things done. And then the
dot itself can also be formed in different

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.260
ways as I think we mentioned before it could
be made like a little circle, which would

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.410
indicate someone with a bit of an artistic
flair. Or it could be a wavy line and that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.260
indicates humor. Or it could be a dash which
indicates impatience.
