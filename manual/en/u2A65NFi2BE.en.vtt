00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
What's up Youtube?

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:02.099
This is El Tiro.

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:06.819
And today you're about to learn the most epic,
dopest finger tutting move ever!

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:13.830
That's coming up!

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.070
Welcome to tutorial Thursday.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.580
We're gonna learn an epic dance move or concept
to add to your freestyle or choreography.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.150
Today, we're gonna be learning this face dragon
tutting!

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.330
Roar!

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.949
Now I'm gonna give you the knowledge on how
to make the face dragon.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.170
How you get that in your dance is up to you.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.329
And we're actually gonna do a little mini
contest on Instagram where I can see how you

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:39.329
do it.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.219
Most creative person, I'm gonna hook em up
with something special that's me winking,

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.149
if you haven't noticed.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.379
Lets get started!

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.969
Hands, palms facing same direction.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.190
And they're actually facing to me.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.199
I'm just turning it for the camera.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.739
I'm gonna take my pinkies are touching like
that.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.809
The next finger which I think is the ring
finger or I could be wrong.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.729
They're gonna cross over each other.

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.440
It does not matter which one's down, which
one's up.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.049
They're gonna cross over like that.

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.140
And then these are actually the eyes of the
face dragon face dragon.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.590
Then I'm gonna take my middle finger and I'm
gonna wrap them over the eyes just like that.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.420
Let me get a close up.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.990
So those are my eyebrows to my face dragon
just like that.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.990
Ok?

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.609
Now I'm gonna take my pointing fingers and
I'm gonna bring them underneath the eyes and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:37.150
they're gonna make kind of a triangle.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.420
So my top looks like that.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.200
These are my little antennas, they're my pinkies.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.929
Then I'm gonna take my thumb and I'll bring
them underneath.

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:51.960
And when you do that altogether you have your
dragon.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.850
Now for extra bonus, you can, if you don't
like the antennas, you can move that and move

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.280
the pinkies underneath and then when you open,
you can have a tongue.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.829
So one more time, really slow.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.390
My palms are open.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.520
I'm gonna have my first fingers go down across
each other.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.490
Now I'm gonna have my eyebrows going.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.580
My pointing fingers are gonna come underneath
a triangle.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.940
And I'm gonna bring my thumbs in.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.240
Roar!

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.470
You can do tut dubstep.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.210
You can, I don't know, if you're lonely, it
could be your friend.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.280
Or you can do sweet finger tuts and then you
can bring it into the face tutting dragon.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.570
So that's your face tutting dragon move for
today.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.710
If you want more of these, I have tons of
different faces and combinations you can make.

the higher on the list of upcoming tutorials.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.010

job of creating it, dude, I'm gonna hook you
