00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.380
I haven't been cooking with my son for a long time.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.100
I have found an interesting recipe: Chicken salad with grapes.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.134
- Come on! We'll cook together!

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:15.954
For this recipe we will need: 150 g of boiled-smoked chicken breast,

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:18.836
1/2 red onion, 1 apple, 350 g of red grapes,

00:00:18.836 --> 00:00:22.160
parsley and spring onions,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:29.160
100 g of cheese, 100 g of cashews, mayonnaise, salt and pepper to taste.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.000
- Now I'll show you what to do with grapes.

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:38.600
Cut each in half .

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.610
You'll be removing all the seeds with a spoon.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.014
Shift grapes into a separate bowl.

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:50.334
Is it clear?

00:00:50.334 --> 00:00:52.334
Hold the spoon!

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:57.900
Cut the grapes. Hold.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.000
I place the grapes on the table, and you move them carefully.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.000
Now we'll cut the grapes into quarters.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.200
Take a knife. I'll show you one grape, and then you do it yourself.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.000
- Got It?

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.000
- Yup.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.800
- You will put it in this bowl. Try It.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.100
Good For You!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.174
I need to chop the onion finely.

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:39.700
I'll need half of red onion.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.034
It should be finely chopped.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.835
Some more.

00:01:57.835 --> 00:02:00.134
- Grapes are ready. Good job!

00:02:00.134 --> 00:02:06.015
I've also chopped onions.

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:11.965
- Now you have a difficult task: take one cashew and cut it in half.

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:17.800
Come on, show work! Well done!

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.700
And I will cut diced cheese.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.200
Put cheese into the bowl.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:45.074
Now - chicken breast. Cut it as cheese - diced.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.067
Put the chicken breast into the bowl.

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:05.300
This is one of the main ingredients.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.000
- I see that you've already chopped the cashews.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.314
Now I am giving you a parsley.

00:03:12.314 --> 00:03:18.870
You will tear off the leaves from the branches.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.659
Okay?

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:23.200
This is your mission.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.000
And I'll get an apple.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.100
I need also to dice the apple.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.414
Put the apples into a bowl.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.500
- Done?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.900
Now chop parsley.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.715
I gather it in a bunch.

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:06.800
And cut.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.200
Finely chop the onions.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.253
All components of the salad are in the bowl.

00:04:14.253 --> 00:04:17.438
Now salt lightly, to taste.

00:04:17.438 --> 00:04:22.094
- We will add mayonnaise. Take a spoonful of mayonnaise.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:27.516
Add.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
In to the bowl, mix well all the ingredients together.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.715
Our salad is ready! Good job. Yup?

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:47.555
- Yup! Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.000
