00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.500
The Fotodiox Pro 28x28 Studio In A Box

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.220
is the perfect solution for tabletop
product photography.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.720
This versatile kit works right out of
the box: just set it up and start shooting.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.119
Assembling the studio in a box is easy.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.359
Start by removing the items from the
three storage pouches in the carrying case. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.360
Unfold the case on a flat surface

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.450
and remove the backdrops stored inside.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.809
Lift the spine of the case upward,
forming an upside down V.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.309
Turn the white side of the case away from
you and unfold the diffuser flaps to the left and right.

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:58.660
Lift the center flap and attach it to
the top of the flap on the opposite side, creating a cube.

00:00:58.669 --> 00:01:04.309
Now you can mount the four included backdrops to the velcro strip in the top of the tent.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.300
Now it's time to assemble the three included softbox studio lights.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.659
Remove the light from its packaging.
Unfold and open the softbox,

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.850
pressing the center circle down until it
slips over the light socket.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.939
Screw a bulb into the socket.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.940
You can use any household bulb with
these lights, but we recommend using

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.080
Fotodiox 70 watt CFL bulbs, which are color corrected for daylight.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.360

below to learn more.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.120
Now slip the diffusion panel over the
four corners of the softbox and velcro it into place. 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.640
Unfold the light stand.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.320
Slide the softbox head over the top of the
light stand and tighten the locking screw.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.080
Now you can set up the lights around the softbox.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.840
Place a light on the left and right of the softbox and place the last light on the top,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.740
facing down. Plug the lights in and turn
them on.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.920
The tent's heat resistant fabric diffuses
the light

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.780
and delivers a uniform, evenly lit
shooting environment.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.980
Now it's time to set up your camera and
start shooting.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.340
With just a few simple steps you're set
to take beautiful,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:25.330
studio quality photos with the 28x28 Studio In a Box from Fotodiox Pro.
