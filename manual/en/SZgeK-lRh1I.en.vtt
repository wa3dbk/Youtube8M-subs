Stay Tune on Masak.TV

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:06.948
I'm Tirta Pane, I'm Faisal Lanin

00:00:06.948 --> 00:00:09.428
back again with us at Masak.TV

00:00:27.864 --> 00:00:29.064
On this Webisode,

00:00:29.064 --> 00:00:30.394
we will make Lemper

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:31.305
(Lemper is an Indonesian dish

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:32.225
made of sticky rice

00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:33.275
filled with chicken, fish or meat floss)

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:36.315
Same like parboiled, filled, steamed

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:38.235
and after that roasted

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.080
For the ingredients

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.540
we have white sticky rice and rice

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.000
For the filling

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.760
For the sticky rice,

00:00:51.764 --> 00:00:53.424
don't forget to add Daun Salam (Bay Leaf)

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:56.551
Here is the chicken fillet

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.570
and then Yellow Sauce

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.129
And that's all

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.000
For the rice, mix with the sticky rice

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.199
and then parboil it

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:13.835
Same like when you make Nasi Uduk

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:16.211
And then steam and roasted it

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.360
Okay, so Faisal will wash the rice

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.680
and Tirta will sautÃ© the seasoning

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.660
Prepare a spoon

00:01:33.638 --> 00:01:37.288
Put the yellow sauce for 1full table spoon

00:01:41.752 --> 00:01:45.162
Put the coconut milk in a bowl

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.140
Lower the fire

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.879
and we can put the chicken into the pan

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.079
In this part,

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.059
because I usually use thick coconut milk

00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:57.339
I will add the water

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:02.629
Mix the chicken fillet

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:03.949
with the yellow sauce

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:05.309
until it mixed together

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.749
For the rice,

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:11.639
add a little coconut milk into it

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.079
and after that parboil it

00:02:15.962 --> 00:02:18.212
This parboil same like we learn

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:19.762
how to cook Nasi Uduk

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.720
Untill the seasoning is absorbed

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.260
we have to mix all the ingredients

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.040
Until it parboil and we put it up

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.769
After that, we put the chicken fillet

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.769
&amp; the rice into banana leaf and steam it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.440
Put some salt and a little sugar

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:41.157
into the chicken

00:02:41.157 --> 00:02:42.897
and mixed it until the chicken

00:02:42.897 --> 00:02:43.887
become pieces

00:02:48.743 --> 00:02:50.943
Also, put a few salt to the coconut milk

00:03:03.778 --> 00:03:07.778
You reach to the boring step

00:03:07.778 --> 00:03:10.278
but you have to keep doing it,

00:03:10.278 --> 00:03:11.808
it is the stirring step

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:13.818
Keep stir it for over and over again

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.227
Water please, cun.

00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:22.408
Put a few of water into the chicken

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.549
You can see,

00:03:30.423 --> 00:03:33.123
the water has been absorbed

00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:35.443
by the coconut milk

00:03:35.718 --> 00:03:37.548
Actually, Lemper is not always filling

00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:38.778
by sautÃ©ed chicken,

00:03:38.778 --> 00:03:40.348
you may also fill it by floss too

00:03:40.348 --> 00:03:41.898
and the taste is still good too,

00:03:41.898 --> 00:03:43.948
such as chicken, fish and meat floss

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.020
We can taste the coconut milk

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:54.357
We can add a little coconut milk

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.360
Finish

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:06.907
It is okay, we will steam it later

00:04:09.548 --> 00:04:11.608
You put a banana leaf upside down!

00:04:12.682 --> 00:04:14.532
Put 2 full table spoon of coconut milk

00:04:14.532 --> 00:04:16.082
on a banana leaf and fill it

00:04:16.082 --> 00:04:19.512
with the chicken fillet in the middle

00:04:19.512 --> 00:04:21.722
We add more chicken again

00:04:28.608 --> 00:04:30.998
Roll up a banana leaf,

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.350
fold and flip both ends of a banana leaf

00:04:42.088 --> 00:04:44.308
Take Lemper to the steamer pan,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.330
make sure the water in the pan

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.370
has been boiled

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:51.138
As usual, we have to wait it

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.519
for 15 until 20 minutes

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:58.259
After that, we can grill it

00:05:02.014 --> 00:05:03.734
Suddenly, I want to laugh!

00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:08.493
Lemper is has to be grilled

00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:09.953
Oh, the cable is crossing

00:05:12.455 --> 00:05:13.525
Should we use the oil?

00:05:13.525 --> 00:05:14.425
Maybe a little

00:05:14.565 --> 00:05:15.755
Of course!

00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:19.744
Is it already hot?

00:05:19.744 --> 00:05:20.444
Yes, it is

00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:22.804
The biggest Lemper was made by me

00:05:22.804 --> 00:05:24.294
We take the biggest one,

00:05:24.294 --> 00:05:25.444
especially for you

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.640
Move these Lemper to the grill pan

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.710
and grill them until the leaf turn brownish

00:05:33.818 --> 00:05:40.008
After that, lift and drain these Lemper

00:05:43.228 --> 00:05:44.878
We try to cut these Lemper

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:51.150
Ouch, this is hot!

00:05:57.287 --> 00:05:58.267
This is perfect!

00:05:58.535 --> 00:05:59.595
Oh, don't forget,

00:06:00.045 --> 00:06:03.385
if you after steamed and grilled Lemper

00:06:03.385 --> 00:06:05.255
and finally those Lemper are flabby

00:06:05.255 --> 00:06:06.625
and you think you're fail

00:06:06.625 --> 00:06:08.555
You're not fail because you're never eat

00:06:08.555 --> 00:06:09.465
a hot Lemper

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:11.804
In my opinion, before you eat Lemper,

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.394
you have to wait until the heat

00:06:13.394 --> 00:06:14.164
is subsided

00:06:14.733 --> 00:06:16.353
Because when the heat is subsided,

00:06:16.353 --> 00:06:17.473
sticky rice will settle

00:06:17.473 --> 00:06:19.213
It is easy to make Lemper, isn't it?

00:06:19.213 --> 00:06:20.333
