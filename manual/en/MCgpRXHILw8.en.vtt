00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.560
My name is Martin Chiffers. So today I'm going to show you a couple of desserts 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.319
and how we assemble them

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.580
you know what I like in a dessert is
something nice and crispy

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.289
for this one we've got a sugar
chocolate

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.550
tuile, some of the soil that we made

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.800
cherry compote

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.160
cherry gel and then a chocolate mousse
and vanilla cream

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.429
bit of a variation on the black forest kind of thing

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.360
and we have some cherry ice cream to go with it

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.610
and a little cherry paper

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.650
crispy paper

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.430
we take one of our little sugar chocolate tubes

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.500
we're going to place a sponge

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
place that on the bottom

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.340
so a little bit of soil for a crunchy
texture

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.019
I've got a chocolate cream but this is
a light ganache

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.730
so we make a ganache and then we just fold a little bit of cream in at the end

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.710
I'm going to pipe in the base

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.360
I've got some cherries

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.350
fresh cherries, a little bit of sugar, lemon juice

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.369
we'll take a few of the cherries

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.660
drop those in

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.520
I've got some Chantilly cream building up

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.970
those layers

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.010
and here I've got a very light cherry jelly which I've 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.799
put in the espuma

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.220
now we've got some little cherry jelly spheres, they're made with cherry purée, a little bit of agar 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.770
and gelatin

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.700
I'm going to take a few more of my cherries

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.940
some more soil

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.190
a little cherry gel

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.840
put a couple of mint leaves

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.190
little bit of lemon zest

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.229
we're just going to put over the top

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.020
and our ice cream

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.039
and finish with a little cherry paper

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.560
so we have a sugar

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.970
chocolate tuile and then in the bottom we have a chocolate sponge soaked with 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.380
cherry syrup, finished with a light chocolate ganache

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.540
cherries cooked with lemon thyme

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.070
whipped cream and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.310
a jelly mousse

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.270
finished with a cherry ice cream

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.570
jelly spheres, and cherry paper

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.890
The next dish we have is a raspberry dish

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.920
so we have a freeze dried

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.819
raspberry and white chocolate sponge and then a chocolate crémeux

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.809
we're going to place that on a jelly then we have some

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:17.079
raspberry crémeux

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.479
and here our spheres

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.819
a little raspberry gel, freeze dried raspberry, a little

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.839
chocolate tube and then we're going to fill that with a raspberry cream

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.769
and decorate with some candied lemon. Normally I think about the flavours that we're going 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.259
to use and then try and 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:31.609
draw up the picture

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.749
in my mind, and on paper
I normally make some sketches and drawings

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.069
if you put it on paper

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.930
it'll give you a good idea of what you're going to do and if you don't then

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.949
you might forget something and when you actually come to make that dish

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:46.819
you're idea completely changes so

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:49.879
I think it's good to write it down and
draw some pictures

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.479
and move on from there until you perfect it

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.779
we have a raspberry jelly

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:56.529
this is made with 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.139
vegetable gelatin 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.939
so the chocolate I've used here is a madagascar

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:03.769
sixty seven percent high caliber
chocolate

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.629
I'm going to take some raspberry gel

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.079
and I'm just going to gel the plate

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.259
this is the raspberry crémeux, similar to a lemon but we're using a raspberry purreé

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.829
egg yolks and then it's

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.779
set with some gelatin and butter

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.909
and we've got some candied lemon

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.039
I've done the same there with a lime

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:26.959
again we can put a little mint leaf

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.369
so a little chocolate tube

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:31.029
so here i brushed it

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.689
with cocoa butter

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:37.669
scratched it, put some gold powder, spread the chocolate and rolled up the plastic to form a tube

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:44.669
take your raspberry cream and fill up. We're going to dip the ends in 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.029
freeze-dried raspberries

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.810
so here's our raspberry dish, it's a raspberry jelly

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.419
with vegetable gelatin

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:55.059
white chocolate freeze-dried raspberry sponge

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.459
and then we have the chocolate crémeux

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.749
with a chocolate tube filled with raspberry cream

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.109
and raspberry crémeux on the plate, and gel
