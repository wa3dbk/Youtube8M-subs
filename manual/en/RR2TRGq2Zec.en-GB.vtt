00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.530
"It has been photographed, it has been recorded
on video tapes so there is no doubt that there

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.449
is something going on up there."

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.930
A lot of the time, it's pretty easy to dismiss
UFOs. A hoax by film students here, a weather

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.640
balloon there.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.240
There is one example, though - The Hessdalen
Lights in Norway are a phenomenon so frequently

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.940
seen, tracked, videoed and photographed that
no-one, governments and universities included,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.580
can turn a blind eye. They've been radar tracked
at 30,000kph, and they appear in the exact

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:51.360
same valley, several times a year, for anyone
to go and enjoy. Oh, and no-one knows what

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.960
they actually are.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.700
The lights have been reported in Norway's
central Hessdalen valley as far back as the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.380
1940s, but really came to light, so to speak,
from 1981. Over a period of several years,

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.350
the lights were seen an astonishing 15-20
times every week, causing thousands of tourists

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.590
to flock to the area and camp out to witness
the phenomenon.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.210
So seriously was it taken that a research
centre was even set up and permanently manned.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.390
Project Hessdalen was initiated by Swedish
and Norwegian UFO groups, but its research

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:51.439
is now continued by various academic institutions,
which in 2007 took this astonishing video.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.920
Erling Strand heads up project Hessdalen,
so I asked him why he thought that these lights

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.689
in particular are taken so seriously whilst
many other phenomenon are laughed out of the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.689
park.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.329
"Well, I think there are several reasons why
Hessdalen maybe is taken a little bit more

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:15.150
seriously than other places where similar
sightings occur. We didn't only have stories

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:25.099
from people telling about their sightings
but we managed to have the instrument running

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:35.310
and record data when it showed up. It's very
easy to speculate of course I know many other

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:46.099
places do. My personal feeling is that we
should get more scientific data to base our

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:48.100
discussions on."

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.310
So what's so special about Hessdalen? Well,
it turns out actually it's not that special.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.970
"That's an interesting question of course.
We have asked that several times ourselves.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.840
There are also other places around the world,
similar amount. In Australia you have what

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:21.030
we call MinMin lights. We have other places
in Europe too, in South America there is certain

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:30.480
lights in the mountains, In Mexico too around
the volcanoes."

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.299
Erling's right, the lights are an example
of what is traditionally known as a Will-o-the-wisp,

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.000
a legendary phenomenon talked about for centuries
in European and far-eastern folklore, but

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.069
very rarely recorded. A bright light that
rises above swamps and water in remote countryside,

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.390
guiding travellers towards it, but always
just out of reach. They're often believed

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.230
to be the spirits of the dead, or guardians
of buried treasure.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.209
But that doesn't scientifically explain what
they are. Various theories have been put forward,

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.400
from incidences closer to the ground being
quad bike lights, although they're often noted

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.469
as being too smooth, to get this, extremely
rare electrically-charged luminescent crystals

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:20.050
formed in the ionization of ground radon.
Obviously. But then, a 30,000kph crystal?

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:25.919
Erling doesn't know what they are, no-one
does. But he knows they aren't a hoax.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:34.919
"Several sightings can be explained of course
if you've got this light high up in the sky.

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:43.319
It has been photographed, it has been recorded
on videotapes and so there is no doubt that

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:53.180
there is something going on up there. If someone
at this location could put up some instruments

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:04.000
to see if we've got the same readings as we
do, or other readings also of course, I think

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.259
it's very important to get data."

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:13.990
So here we have a genuine 100% unidentified
flying object. Not a creation of some after

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:20.770
effects genius, not an illusion, a real object
from old folklore that physically exists.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.349
Just what it is, alien craft, some bizarre
form of lightning or gas escape, or some strange

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:32.120
chemical reaction, we don't know - yet - and
that makes it pretty exciting but basically

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.970
Hessdalen is a lesson in how to do it properly.
No conjecture, no "this is proof", just a

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.229
slow, patient, waiting game for the real answers
to reveal themselves. A model, perhaps, for

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.259
how things should be done.

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:51.590
