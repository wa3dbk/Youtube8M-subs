00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hi all! Its time for stg that has never been befor, but We where begging for it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The big frost are comming

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Its gona be an other new test on the system, to prove that it can make it trough this winter.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And this is why I held and hold everybody back, till we dont finish this test

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And dont finsih it with succes, to spend your money on this, untill we find out if the system

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
stands these huge minuses. The forcast says -10s for night of the next week, and thy daily maxes are to be no more then -5.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We'll see what happens.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Right now its the luckiest time for the greenhouse. Its damn cold but we dont care as the sun shines.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If this damn cold comes with cloudy weather, thats worst case, but we had that already.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now I would like to show you whats the temperature.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In fact Im worm in this pullower.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I brougt the laptop out to not only believe the thermometer.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I can reach the Arduino datalogger with the laptop

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we can get digital measures with accuracy of one hudreds of a celsius.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
By the way its 12:30, this is the daily peak.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Around two its the hottest but still this is a nice hot, not pullover rather t-shirt climate.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What I would like to show -I hope the camera can see it. Yes it visible- 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
These are the back wall barrels.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You can see the cold sport as there is the vapor.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The vapor is on the coldes surfaces. The intresting thing i would like to show you.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That the upper pert of the barrel is dry, while bellow its wet.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Thats shows how the water in the barrels heat up. Its like that on all barrels. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The measured data wont be accurete as the sunshine distract the dataloggera bit.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But after the sun has left, we can compare the data from morning and the afternoon

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
do find out how much we have gained a day.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now lets check out whats out current state.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It says 20,5 C, thats the air temperature inside.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Compare this with the digital measures.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It says - if we could see it ... its shinnig from all directions, how should I hold it to be visible, I hope you can see it. -

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The first number is the system water temp: 8,25C

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The seccond one is inside air temp: 18,25C

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The third one is the back wall: 16,5C

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The fourth is outside temp: 4C

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
These are the important data. The point is we almost have 20C inside, while

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the back wall is collecting the energy like crazy.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I hope we can gain 1,5-2C with this nice sunny day, we need that anyway.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
How much sunshine the next week brings, or how few, thats the question. And its gona be intresting.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Lets get through this temperature topic, fingers crossed, check the temperature, see where the clouds are 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Cause where the sun shines its fine, every other place is sad.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I think we will make, ithout problem. So here is an othe thing I would like to show you.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Here it is. Can you see it. Yes? No? The pees start flowering. This is my first one.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I interspaced radish and salas as the start growing big.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This is the radish planted by the National TV News . They grow realy fast.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This is the salad planted by index.hu (online news portal), so you can see the growth of a week.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Once again the radish of the National TV News.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Radish is growing nice.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The fish are fine. The water temp is a little lower than waht I would like, but no worry, 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The current 8C is fine, I think we beat 9C till the afternoon.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Ok, I havent feed the fishies today, so we gonna feed tham. But before I had to put tha laptop away,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:34.000
As trout is a grateful eater, they might splash. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
They are nice fish in therms they are fun to feed.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:10.000
They eat like that... They feel fine, they are approx 40 but no worry, I'll bring catfish soon.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
According to the plan, the rest of the trout I'll keep until I can.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Ok, cross your fingers for me and the system to stand the comming big test of the weather.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Follow me on my webpage, of my facebook fanpage, or wherever you want as you like it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Take care, bye!
