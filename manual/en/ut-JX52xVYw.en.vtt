00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.269
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.010
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.630
Halloween is on the 31-st, and it's that time
of year when people like to dress up and become

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.080
something else for a while.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.480
Longtime viewers of Eyes on the Sky have seen
the same thing of me here, as I dress up and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.480
become someone – or something – else for
a while.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.530
I've been a vampire, "Welcome to Eyes on the
Sky" another vampire "I'm the noted skywatcher

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.460
Vlad Tepes" a frightened person who sees things
"I see dead stars" and lots of other fun characters

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.739
such as Cepheus the King.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.610
But we've not spent much time in Cepheus,
so let's do that this week.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.969
Right now, Cepheus is also near the meridian
at a reasonable time of night as well, so

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.390
it will be at culmination allowing for the
best views then.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.390
Despite being a King, Cepheus looks much like
a house – or at this time of year, closer

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.650
to an upside down house.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.320
But look towards the foundation, or up towards
overhead.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.530
The brightest star is Alderamin – a word
which comes from the Arabic ad Dira al Yamin

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.479
which means “the right arm” - that is,
the right arm of the King.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.409
At magnitude 2.5, most anyone can see it.

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.590
But nearly a full magnitude fainter is Zeta
Cephei, here.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.070
Now use binoculars or very small refractor
for this next part – there is a star here

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.799
– just off the line between these two “foundation”
stars.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.940
That's Mu Cephei, a very orange looking M-class
red giant star.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.410
Somewhat variable, it has an irregular period
where it “changes costumes” occasionally

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:53.010
– brighter at magnitude 3.6 sometimes, and
dim down at magnitude 5 at others.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.950
At the moment, it's just past a dip in magnitude,
and should be brighter this week and perhaps

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.070
into next.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.830
Either way, look for the deep orange color,
which is better in smaller telescopes; the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.909
color may be more yellow or yellow orange
in larger instruments.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.290
Dark Sky Fact: Look for changes ahead at Eyes
on the Sky – there will be more videos available

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.540
for stationary objects in the future.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.000
Details in the near future!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.650
Now look towards where the base of the roof
would be – across these two stars, Beta

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.530
and Iota Cephei.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.970
The every so slightly brighter of the two,
Beta, is a blue star that is also variable.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.910
If you have difficulty in locating it, look
about 8 degrees from Alderamin towards Polaris.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.250
Beta varies only a little tiny bit – from
just 3.16 down to 3.27 – hardly perceptible

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.760
naked eye except to the most well-trained
eye.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.240
However, Beta has a companion nearby – look
for a yellowish-orange companion about 14

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.860
arc seconds from the primary.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.739
This is an easy split in most any telescope,
and a colorful duo as well.

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:09.700
It is also the prototype for this type of
variable star, called Beta Cepheids.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.299
Speaking of which, now go diagonally across
the “house” shape to the small triangle

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.989
of stars on the opposite foundation corner
from Alderamin.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.870
Of this small triangle of stars, the one at
the apex of this isosceles triangle is Delta

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.129
Cephei.

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:32.120
This is also a variable star, and a well-known
one too as it is the prototype of Delta Cepheid

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.120
variables.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.879
This one varies enough to be easily perceived
by most observers, ranging from 3.5 down to

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.340
4.4 magnitude over 5.4 days.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.739
This type of variable star is important too,
as they can be used as a “standard candle”

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.409
to help measure distance out to about 20 million
light years, though there is some error that

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:56.770
can occur by up to 15% as well.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.239
Take a look at some of these colorful and
costume-changing variable stars in Cepheus

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.230
over the next several weeks and months.

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:12.760
Along the Ecliptic: Mercury reaches greatest
western elongation in the eastern morning

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.859
sky on November 1-st; see it best about 45
to 60 minutes before the sun rises.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.980
The steep angle of the ecliptic means Mercury
will be nearly 10 degrees up with plenty of

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.060
darkness as twilight takes over – look for
bright Arcturus to the east-northeast first.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.880
Jupiter will be riding high then, well up
towards the south, sitting west of the first

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.610
magnitude star Regulus in Leo the Lion.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.650

Please subscribe, like and or follow, and
thanks for watching...

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.860
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.860
up.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.550
I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and dark
skies.
