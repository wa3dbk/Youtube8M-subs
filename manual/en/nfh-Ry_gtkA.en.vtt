00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.640
My name is Mounir

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.120
I've been breakdancing for 17 years.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.120
I've won nine world champion
titles with Vagabond Crew

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.920
and among them was the title of Red Bull BC One
World Champion in Rio in 2012

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.720
This year, I'll be taking care of the B-Boys who qualified
for the Red Bull BC One France Cypher.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.680
I'm going to their homes,
in their studios,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.400
in their daily lives.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.800
We are going to get ready and work out together.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.120
In France if you need to cross the country
from west to east,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.240
forget about the train,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.520
I'm taking a plane. Direction, The Alps.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.440
I'm meeting Noé,
winner of the BC One in Toulouse.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.920
So naturally he is among the best French
breakdancers to compete for the title in Paris.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.560
His world : his mates and nature.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.920
Noé isn't a man like the others : no TV, no Smartphone,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.600
and his music is vinyl-only.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.200
Noé is an accomplished athlete.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.720
He studies sports at university, it helps.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.120
At 18, he is full of resources.
Well, that's what I'm about to check.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.040
There's a real good "tac tac, boom boom !"

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.720
Yeah at that moment I go straight to the move.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.800
Normally this is when I tell myself
I'm gonna take my time,

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200
and during the battle I get in a rush,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.880
Yeah it's normal to be a little rushed sometimes.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.360
So physically you seem rather developed,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.400
although we see that at the end
you're a little tired.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.720
You went through eight passages
and will need four more on July 5th.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.320
The effort will be a little bigger.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.400
Let's go.
0:01:14.400,1193:02:47.295
Ok let's go !

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.520
That's it, keep on going.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520
The last one, good!

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.680
Good, be relaxed.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.640
When you're at that point,
I want it to strech.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.400
The intensity and the energy
come in the intensity of movement.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.560
Better, much better.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.400
We can really feel the energy.
You're good there !
