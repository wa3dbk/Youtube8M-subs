00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.920
Narrator: NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.690
Environment Explorer or LADEE spacecraft is in

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.360
orbit around the Moon and is ready to start

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.660
collecting data for science operations.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.230
NASA Mission Control: 3...2...1...Zero...Ignition...

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.350
(sound of rocket engines)...and liftoff

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.880
of the Minotaur Five with LADEE...

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.400
Narrator: After a successful launch on September 6th

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.600
at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility,

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.470
the spacecraft began its journey by orbiting the Earth

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.120
with increasingly larger circles called phasing

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.290
loops to propel it towards the Moon.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.210
Thirty days later, LADEE Mission Operations flight

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.070
controllers executed thruster burns and maneuvers

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.490
to slow the spacecraft so it could be caught by

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.600
the Moon's gravity.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.500
Once in orbit around the Moon, LADEE began several

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.260
weeks of diagnostics to prepare the spacecraft

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.940
for science operations.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.880
The LADEE spacecraft carries three science

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.990
instruments on board.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.270
The Neutral Mass Spectrometer will take what are

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.830
called "in situ" or in place measurements of the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.340
atmosphere of the Moon.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.600
The Ultraviolet and Visible Light Spectrometer

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.650
will take remote measurements of both the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.050
atmosphere and dust from a distance.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.820
The third instrument is the Lunar Dust Experiment.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.880
It will directly measure dust particles and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.530
analyze their masses.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.600
During this preliminary phase of the mission,

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.060
a new technology was successfully tested with

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.980
a fourth instrument called the Lunar Laser

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.040
Communications Demonstration.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.390
This is NASA's first high-data-rate laser

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.530
communications system used on a deep space

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.930
mission.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.840
It will enable communications similar to the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.530
capabilities found in high-speed

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.210
fiber optic networks.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.880
Built at NASA Ames Research Center, the spacecraft

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.390
will collect data on the behavior of the extremely

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.360
thin atmosphere, or exosphere, of the Moon.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.050
Butler Hine: The team is very excited about

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.260
the science mission starting.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.140
That's kind of what everything is being done for,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.820
is to get the science data.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810
And so, everybody's excited to see that

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.080
actually start.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.600
Narrator: LADEE is ready to begin gathering

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.820
data to help scientists understand the fragile

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.830
lunar exosphere and its behavior before robotic

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.640
and astronaut activity returns on the surface at

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.890
some point in the future.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:26.220

 (Musical Tones)

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.528
