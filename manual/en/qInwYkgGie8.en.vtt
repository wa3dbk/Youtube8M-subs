00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.590
Whether you're celebrating the Fourth of
July, or on a summer trip to a theme park

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.360
fireworks are sure to light up the night
sky.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.020
you'll want to snap photos, but if you're not careful they may not turn out

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.200
quite as vibrant as you remembered.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.620
In this tutorial, I'm going to light up
some fireworks photos with depth and color

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.480
by blending multiple layers.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.020
Your family and friends will be blown away.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.760
Now if you've used layers in PaintShop Pro before,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.160
you'll already be familiar with how to add and manipulate images in this Layers Palette.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.700
If not, check out the tutorial in the link below.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.940
Just a quick refresher: if you don't see this palette,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.140
launch it by clicking the F8 key on your keyboard.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.800
Once you see this layers palette, we're ready to add a whole new color dimension

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.390
to our fireworks photos.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.309
Firework photos are dynamic, but if
you've shot fireworks from the ground

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:02.440
you simply don't have the time to do anything fancy.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.040
Usually I would use the HDR feature on the camera if I wanted to make my photos pop,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.480
but fireworks change in a fraction of a second,
and that's just not enough time to use this feature.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.300
So what I'm going to do instead of creating an HDR image by combining

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.980
the best attributes of multiple exposures,

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.180
is use one photo with added layers.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.500
Each layer will add depth and color, and we'll merge them into one spectacular result.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.900
So let's get started! We want to make our fireworks pop.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.820
The first thing you're going to need to do

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.720
is get open the original image that you took at the fireworks display.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.700
Next, what I'm going to do is go to my layers palette here,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.660
right click on the background, and select duplicate.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.600
rename this layer to multiply, and I'll set the blend mode to

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.840
well, you guessed it, Multiply.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.180
Naming your layers isn't necessary, but it does help keep things organized.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.700
Next, I'm going to quickly duplicate the
background again,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.520
drag it to the top of the layers, and I'll call this one Vibrant Blur.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.600
The vibrant in the name explains it for this layer.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.040
You'll want to really increase the photo's color and vibrancy.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.400
So go to the Adjust menu, and use Hue
Saturation or Vibrancy,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.760
from the Hue/Saturation menu.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.000
you don't need to be shy, I'm going to use both to give this a real burst of color.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.540
Now I'll go to Adjust, Blur, and Gaussian
Blur.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.780
The amount of blur needed is really going to depend on the size of the photo,

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.280
So there's no real right or wrong number
here.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.440
Just drag the slider until the image looks about like this.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.080
So now we have an additional two layers
on top of our background. Why not three?

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.620
I'll duplicate one more copy of the
background,

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.580
name this one Soft Light,

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.680
and drag it to the very top of the layers palette.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.320
i'm going to soften the differences between the three layers with this blend mode called Soft Light,

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.140
To really show off that amazing contrast
of light against the black background.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.880
And if you find that the image is a little too blurry,

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.080
you can always go back to that layer

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.840
and change the opacity.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.380
Do this by dragging the gauge over to the left.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.760
and in this case, it looks like seventy-five percent is about the magic number.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.440
When you have the image the way that you would like it, you can right click on any one of these layers

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.280
and select Merge, and then Merge All Flattened.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.640
Now that the images are combined into a single layer, you can save the image in jpg format.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.300
And it's just that easy to make your firework photos pop.
