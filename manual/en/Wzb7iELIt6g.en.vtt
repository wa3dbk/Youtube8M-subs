We are at "road restaurant" Sohawa-Chakwal turn on GT Road. Normally the busy hour starts at 14.00. We arrived a little early.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.720
[kidding with his nephews] I was in the mood for some fried fish. But my nephew warned me that he  does not have any money.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.700
Then I though well lets just have kebab to fill our stomach.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.300
The view is fantastic here. Here you can see the famous GT Road.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:56.500
Sir can you sprinkle some water on my nephew to awaken him. He seems lost. Don't worry dude now that you have to pay today.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.400
You hardly ever treat me. But today you cannot escape. [teasing him].

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.520
You are just standing there and filming. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.940
Why don't you ask the man some questions.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.820
Greetings sir. Where do you get your fish from?

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.540
From Mangla dam and other dams that are nearby.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.020
What ingredients do you use?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:43.500
Dhannia (coriander), Zeera (cumin seed), Ajwain (carom seed), red pepper. After that I use gram flour.
