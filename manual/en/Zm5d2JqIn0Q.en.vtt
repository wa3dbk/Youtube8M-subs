My name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.250
to make Hungarian Meatball Stew. All right,
so it's been about three minutes. Let's go

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.880
ahead and pull that back. Watch out, there
will be lots of steam. We're just going to

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.640
give everything a nice stir, and what we've
done is softened up all our vegetables, got

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:31.329
a little color into them, which is good. Whoops,
I'm making a mess. Our next step is we're

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:40.390
going to add our paprika, and coat everything
nice and evenly. This should be about everything;

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:53.531
good old handy spatula. What we're looking
for here is a nice even coating with the paprika.

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:59.850
We don't want clumps, we don't want uneven
color. Also, what we're going to do here is

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.400
the paprika will help dry it up a little bit,
and what that that will do is pick up a lot

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.440
of that oil. We don't want to lose all of
it, because we're going to use some of it

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.140
for our rue here in a second. We're going
to make it in the pan. As the paprika comes

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.400
in contact with the pan, it will start giving
it a roasted flavor. We're looking pretty

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:30.621
even here now. Once we're pretty much done
with the paprika stage, then we add our flour.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:35.800
When you add the flour, it's really, really
important that you don't get any clumps, so

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:47.640
I'm going to add it in waves; two little stages
should be about right.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.850
What should happen here is that as you add
it, you wait until you can't really see any

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.520
more flour, then you add more. So you keep
stirring it until you can't see it any more,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:04.840
then you add the rest; I think probably two
little times should be enough here. I'm just

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.691
going to keep stirring this until I can't
see the flour any more, and we'll let this

00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:19.630
cook for about a minute, once I get to where
I can't see the flour any more, just to really

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.750
help get the flour to bind to the moisture
that's coming out of the ingredients. That

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.980
tells me my noodles are done, so what we'll
do right now is while this is cooking for

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:43.280
a minute, put the lid back on it, let it go
for a minute, and then we're going to take

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.830
our noodles and go dump the water out.
