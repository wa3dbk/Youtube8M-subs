00:00:00.331 --> 00:00:00.994
- Hey, guys.

00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:04.037
I am back this week with
another real-time recipe for ya,

00:00:04.037 --> 00:00:06.564
and this week we're
making eggs for dinner.

00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:08.154
I love having eggs for dinner.

00:00:08.154 --> 00:00:10.849
It is my go-to fast food.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.895
And the reason I like them
is because they're quick,

00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:14.936
they're nutritious and cheap.

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.125
So for the amount of time
that you would probably spend

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.528
microwaving one of those
little microwaveable meals,

00:00:19.528 --> 00:00:21.246
they take anywhere from
five to seven minutes,

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:22.582
you can make this meal instead,

00:00:22.582 --> 00:00:23.928
and you will be so much happier.

00:00:23.928 --> 00:00:24.927
I promise (laughs).

00:00:24.927 --> 00:00:26.494
Okay, so we're gonna start.

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:30.450
First thing we're gonna do
is get our pan heated up,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.641
medium-low flame,

00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:33.626
and we're gonna melt some butter.

00:00:33.626 --> 00:00:36.654
I really like to use butter
whenever I cook with eggs,

00:00:36.654 --> 00:00:39.837
only because eggs and oil just
never really work that well.

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.009
It's just gonna taste better, too,

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:43.171
so you have a lot of flavor.

00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:44.995
If you're trying to cut back on calories,

00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:46.051
just don't use as much.

00:00:46.051 --> 00:00:47.764
See, I'm not gonna even
use this whole thing.

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:48.582
I'm just gonna make sure

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.461
that I have everything well-greased.

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:54.056
And you'll see why when I show
you my technique in a minute.

00:00:54.056 --> 00:00:56.159
And then we'll just scoop
out what we don't need.

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:57.402
There, okay.

00:00:57.402 --> 00:00:59.219
Then we are going to scramble our eggs.

00:01:00.115 --> 00:01:02.267
This time around, I
decided to have the eggs

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:03.323
all ready to go.

00:01:03.323 --> 00:01:04.485
Just because I didn't want you guys

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:06.146
to have to wait while I crack the eggs

00:01:06.146 --> 00:01:07.945
and then go wash my hands.

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:09.026
When you're thinking about how long

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:10.271
this recipe's gonna take,

00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:12.374
just add another 30 to 40 seconds on top.

00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:14.827
So we're gonna scramble those up.

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:19.557
And then we are gonna
pour them into our pan.

00:01:19.557 --> 00:01:22.306
When it comes to pans, I am a big believer

00:01:22.306 --> 00:01:24.579
in the smaller omelette pan works better.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.759
This one is about an 8 1/2 inch pan.

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.037
And the reason why it works better

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:33.745
is you really can control
the eggs a lot more,

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:36.068
and you'll end up with sort
of a more fluffier omelette

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:37.026
as you'll see in a minute.

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.136
What we want to do is we just want to

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:42.916
get those eggs to set a little bit.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:44.101
The reason we want them to set

00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:45.422
is because then we are gonna start

00:01:45.422 --> 00:01:47.357
pulling the eggs in towards us

00:01:47.357 --> 00:01:49.459
and cooking the eggs as it swirls.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.757
There are lots of videos here on YouTube

00:01:51.757 --> 00:01:53.558
about how to cook an omelette.

00:01:53.558 --> 00:01:54.521
And some of my favorite ones

00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.065
are the ones with Julia Child.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.341
If you just search "Julia
Child makes an omelette"

00:01:58.341 --> 00:01:59.120
you can find it,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.582
and she was really a master.

00:02:00.582 --> 00:02:01.639
She would crack those eggs,

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:03.845
and then she would start shaking that pan

00:02:03.845 --> 00:02:04.927
this way and that way,

00:02:04.927 --> 00:02:06.378
and that's how she would make an omelette.

00:02:06.378 --> 00:02:08.098
Sometimes I do like to
do it that way, too,

00:02:08.098 --> 00:02:10.223
but I also to do it this way,

00:02:10.223 --> 00:02:12.524
because it ends up being
a prettier omelette.

00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:13.801
If you know anything about me,

00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:15.659
you know that I like
things to look pretty.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:16.746
That's why I like this technique.

00:02:18.273 --> 00:02:18.881
This is good to go.

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:22.179
See how you're starting to
see the eggs are cooking?

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.236
You want to keep that at a low flame.

00:02:23.236 --> 00:02:24.652
You don't want it to go too high,

00:02:24.652 --> 00:02:25.952
or you're gonna end up with one of those

00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:27.196
real browned omelettes.

00:02:27.196 --> 00:02:29.368
Then we're gonna start
pushing the eggs in,

00:02:29.368 --> 00:02:30.715
and see how the eggs

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:33.350
start to fill in the gaps
where it's not cooked?

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.557
That's what you want,

00:02:34.557 --> 00:02:37.546
and what we're doing is
creating these sort of curds

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.594
in the center which is gonna create

00:02:39.594 --> 00:02:42.160
for a really nice, fluffy omelette.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.526
Just keep doing that.

00:02:45.238 --> 00:02:46.678
You just want to fill in

00:02:46.678 --> 00:02:49.443
and just go all the way around.

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:52.078
Now it really depends on
how you like your omelette.

00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:55.469
If you ask my husband, he
likes a runny omelette.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:56.862
What he calls baveuse,

00:02:56.862 --> 00:02:59.023
which really means drooly in French.

00:02:59.023 --> 00:03:00.386
It's sort of a funny word.

00:03:00.386 --> 00:03:01.861
But I really like my omelette cooked.

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.742
I like a nice dry omelette.

00:03:03.742 --> 00:03:05.418
I'm gonna let that cook up a little bit.

00:03:07.502 --> 00:03:09.069
We're gonna add a little bit of cheese.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.346
I like a cheese omelette
because they're so easy.

00:03:11.346 --> 00:03:13.094
There's no cutting or chopping involved.

00:03:13.094 --> 00:03:15.509
All you have to do is just add the cheese.

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:17.413
If you wanted to add a
little something more

00:03:17.413 --> 00:03:18.736
to make it more consistent,

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.373
you could add some spinach.

00:03:20.373 --> 00:03:21.407
You just put the spinach on top,

00:03:21.407 --> 00:03:22.950
and it'll wilt as it cooks.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.265
That's an easy thing to do.

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:25.867
You could add sliced tomatoes.

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:27.121
You could add mushroom.

00:03:27.121 --> 00:03:28.189
Really whatever you like.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.070
The cheese is so easy because

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.906
when people are starving
and they're cranky,

00:03:31.906 --> 00:03:33.683
it comes together really quickly.

00:03:33.683 --> 00:03:36.801
All right, this is almost ready.

00:03:38.142 --> 00:03:39.963
The final step is just to add a little

00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:41.524
freshly cracked pepper.

00:03:42.902 --> 00:03:44.083
And a little bit of salt.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.563
I love that Maldon sea salt,

00:03:46.563 --> 00:03:48.456
because they get that
big chunks of flakes,

00:03:48.456 --> 00:03:50.464
and it's really good with eggs.

00:03:50.464 --> 00:03:51.683
Then we're gonna take another spatula.

00:03:51.683 --> 00:03:53.266
One that is clean and is flat,

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.936
because that's gonna
help us loosen our eggs.

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.587
We're gonna want to loosen
that all around the sides.

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.540
And now here comes the
big moment of truth.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.385
If you did not butter your pan well,

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:07.825
this is where it all falls apart.

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.289
But hopefully I did and we'll see.

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:11.546
You just want to shimmy it half way,

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:14.052
half, half, half, and then flip.

00:04:14.052 --> 00:04:15.002
And voila.

00:04:15.002 --> 00:04:16.035
Perfect omelette.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:18.989
Then to go with the omelette,

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.482
we're gonna take a little bit of arugula.

00:04:21.482 --> 00:04:24.390
You guys in some parts of the
world will call this rocket.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.959
We know it as arugula, so either one.

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.619
I like it because the cheese omelette

00:04:28.619 --> 00:04:30.082
is a very mellow flavor,

00:04:30.082 --> 00:04:32.345
and the arugula has a nice bite to it.

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:35.377
It's the combination of the
mellow cheese and the egg

00:04:35.377 --> 00:04:37.560
and the bite of the
arugula that's so good.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.362
Then we're just gonna dress it

00:04:38.362 --> 00:04:39.713
with a little bit of olive oil,

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:44.851
and some freshly cut lemon.

00:04:44.851 --> 00:04:46.148
The lemon can be overpowering,

00:04:46.148 --> 00:04:48.449
so you just want a few drops.

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.028
1-2-3, that's all you need.

00:04:50.028 --> 00:04:52.091
You can save this for your water bottle

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.765
when you go off to work or school.

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:55.031
Then we're gonna add a little bit of salt,

00:04:55.916 --> 00:04:56.995
and a little bit of pepper.

00:04:58.062 --> 00:04:58.616
(bell dings)

00:04:58.616 --> 00:04:59.484
There you have it, my friends.

00:04:59.484 --> 00:05:01.608
Dinner in probably less than six minutes.

00:05:01.608 --> 00:05:03.060
The next time you're really starving,

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.862
and you need something to cook up fast,

00:05:04.862 --> 00:05:06.678
don't turn to that microwaveable meal.

00:05:06.678 --> 00:05:07.966
Think of an omelette instead.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:09.010
All right, I'll see you again soon.

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.661
Bye.

00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:11.537
(upbeat music)
