00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.260
[Music]

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:14.350
[MITT ROMNEY]: The President will not be able
continue to mischaracterize my pathway.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.770
He is trying to fool people into thinking
that I think things that I don’t.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.770
[Music]

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.789
[MITT ROMNEY]: I think they are inaccurate
when he says that I was in favor of liquidating

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:29.369
the automobile industry.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.230
Nothing could be further from the truth.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.629
[MITT ROMNEY]: Yeah that’s exactly what
I said.

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:36.949
The headline you read was correct.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.030
Let Detroit go bankrupt.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.780
[MITT ROMNEY]: The President was wrong in
the way he managed this process.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.170
The bailouts were a mistake.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.350
[MITT ROMNEY]: He says that I am in favor
of lowering taxes on wealthy people.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.760
No, I am not.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.500
[MITT ROMNEY]: We are going to cut taxes on
everyone across the country by 20% including

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.160
the top 1%.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.469
[Music]

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.300
[VOICEOVER]: Romney proposal “would provide
large tax cuts to high-income households,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.120
and increase the tax burdens on middle and/or
lower-income taxpayers.”

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.120
[Music]

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.600
[MITT ROMNEY]: He says I am opposed to abortion,
even in case of rape, incest and the life

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.600
of the mother.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
That’s just wrong.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.170
[MITT ROMNEY]: I would welcome circumstance
where there was such a consensus that we will

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.030
not have abortion in this country at all period.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.230
That would be wonderful.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.610
[Music]

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.500
[HUCKABEE]: Would you have supported a constitutional
amendment that would’ve establish the definition

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.500
of life at contraception?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.500
[MITT ROMNEY]: Yes, absolutely

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.180
