00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:14.000
It's 38-37, Kansas State over Oklahoma State. It's the 4th quarter with 5:03 left on the clock. It's first and ten.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's been a back-and-forth game all night. Weeden's in the shotgun. Takes the snap, fires over the middle to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Justin Blackmon. He's at the 20, the 10, the 5, he's in the end zone, pistols firing.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Oh my Heather that's incredible because this is the first time OSU has been behind in the second half. They've been open

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in the middle all game. It looked like they were playing man-to-man defense on Justin Blackmon, which never works.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It doesn't. You can't cover Blackmon. Look behind us, here's a real sportscaster. Dave Hunziker, who's the voice of the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
cowboys and a sports media instructor. Well that was pretty good.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
This is another edition of Inside OSU and we're not just talking about sports, but we're talking about sports media.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Heather Geller is a student in sports media and Dave is an instructor. Tell us about the sports media program.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's very exciting. We're one of the first university's in the nation to offer a degree in sports media. It's a very 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
exciting time. We offer the opportunity for students to learn about play-by-play, television anchoring, public relations,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
sports reporting from a print standpoint. It's really an innovative program. We are a leader in this? We are one of the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.000
very first programs to have a sports media major? Yes we are. It allows students to emphasize the sports piece, because it

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is unique and it's so repetition based. For example the play-by-play, the more you do it the better you become.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So we offer those real life experiences for the students so when they leave OSU, they have a chance to get a good job.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Heather where are you from? I am from Visalia, CA. And that's in central California? Yes. How did you end up at OSU?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I transferred here because of the sports media program. I didn't see that in any other schools I was looking at.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.500
Great and you're a senior? Yes, I'll be graduating in May. And what do you hope to do in sports media?

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.000
My dream job would be to take Erin Andrews' job. Be a sideline reporter. So she better watch out come May.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Tell us about some of the curriculum. In my course, we do television anchoring, radio sportscasts, and play-by-play of OSU

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.500
football games. They do 2 of those per year. They do a couple women's basketball games per year. It's very intensive in

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.000
terms of teaching and hands on. And then when, for example, ESPN or ABC comes to town to broadcast an event, they use our

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
students in a variety of support roles to help with the broadcast, giving them exposure to the highest level of television

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
production in America. Have you done any of that Heather? I haven't but I do his play-by-play in class, which is really

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:18.000
exciting. What does he tell you to work on because I thought you were great? There's little things here and there, but it's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
repetition based. Every time I've gone out there and done it I've gotten better.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Well we're lucky to have somebody with Dave's talent that's available to teach our students. You do a wonderful job.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Our graduates are getting jobs? Yes. In fact this past spring we had a graduate land at ESPN in Charlotte. We had another

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We had another recent grad land as a sports reporter at an affiliate in Wichita and they're doing very well. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Others have moved more into the production side of things where they are also doing very well. So yes it's working. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
We're drawing high caliber students here. They're excelling. It's really been fun watch this thing take off.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
With the explosion of video, YouTube, internet streaming and everything, there's just going to be more and more demand

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:14.000
for this kind of thing. Oh yes. OSU will be very involved in it, both as a content creator as well as a distributer. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So I think you're getting in a lively and robust field and I congratulate you on that. Thank you. And Dave thank you 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
everything you do for OSU.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That's another edition of Inside OSU. And I think we should close it with your signature phrase. Well I'd be happy to.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.149
Pistols firing, touchdown cowboys!
