hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.630
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.029
I'm going to use the best of drumstick
that is both the drumsticks and its

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.080
leaves you know this is a very tasty dish especially you know in south of India

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
lot of people have drumstick plant in the backyard so when they have the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.730
drumstick they use the leaves also to
make curry when the drumsticks are not

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.620
there they just use the leaves to make
the dal or anything so for making this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.920
we're going to take some oil here once the oil is hot

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:48.000
we're just going to add some onions and add little bit of salt and we're

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.449
going to let it saute and you don't want the onions to be brown or

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.800
anything you just want them transparent
so once they're transparent add some

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.010
green chilly, ginger garlic paste and
just let the ginger garlic paste cook

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.909
till the raw flavor is gone in this add
turmeric and also add drumstick to this

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.210
okay and once you add the drumstick
we're going to let this cook for few

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.189
minutes if you want you can also add
little water to this and let the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.479
drumstick boil

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.090
ok the drumstick will take around seven
minutes to soften up after the drumstick

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.060
cooking for few minutes we're going to add chili powder and coriander powder

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.310
also but there is good enough moisture
in this we're going to cover it and let

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.369
it cook for another 2 - 3 minutes now look
at this

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.090
the chili powder everything is nicely
cooked

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.590
even the drumstick is nice soft and
tender in this we're going to add the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.070
drumstick leaf usually you plug the
tender drumstick leaf and make all these

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.270
kinds of curry and the reason why I
cooked the drumstick beforehand because

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.209
you want that to be cooked once you add
the green leaf

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.420
you don't have to put the lid if you put
the lid on the color

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.550
will discolor and it won't be green
anymore so you're going to let this cook

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.520
for you know another 2 - 3 minutes kind of you're sauteeing the drumstick leaf till

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.260
it is cooked that is the drumstick leaf
which is you know kind of spluttering and

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.230
let this cook for 2 minutes till the
leaf is nice and soft after you know 2 - 3

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.390
minutes the leaf is nicely cooked and if
you look into Ayurveda they're two leafs

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.739
that are considered to be having lot of medicinal value one is the curry leaf

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.920
and other one is this drumstick leaf and also you know drumstick leaf is used

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.239
especially to enhance and the flavor of
ghee and also the leaf itself as a very

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.030
nice aroma now after this is done we're
going to add some tomatoes and we're

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.860
just going to let the tomatoes slightly
softened that's when the dish is all ready

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.370
i'm going to reduce the flame and let it
cook for another minute or so now switch

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.049
of the flame this is all ready and you
have to try this to understand why this

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.320
has so much of aroma and flavor think
about it

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.660
drumstick are added to sambar everything to enhance the flavor, the

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.280
leaves of the drumstick are added to
enhance the flavor of ghee so you can

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.959
imagine the power of both of them
together in one dish you should try to

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.140
see how tasty this can be this kind of
curry is best eaten with the you know

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:55.440
rice haha you know wow very nice you
know you feel as if you're made this

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.690
in lot of ghee but wow

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:10.870
just fantastic and give a very nice
taste and also health wise it's good

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.140
hmm when you eat the drumstick  you have to eat it with the hand to enjoy it the most

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:28.120
