00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.210
So what, exactly, is the difference between
the expression of happy and ecstatic? Well

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.570
compared to whether or not you got a paycheck,
an extra paycheck, versus winning the lottery.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.780
So one would be happy, the other one would
be ecstatic. And that's exactly the expression

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.810
we're going to try to draw next. Draw in our
eye shape, here. I'm going to make the eye

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.820
shape a little taller and a little narrower
than normal, here. It's going to help with

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.539
our ecstatic, ecstatic expression. No eyelids,
you're ecstatic, you're eyes are wide open.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.730
Pupils right in the middle, with little squiggle
marks along the side. Nose, in the same position.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:45.420
Eyebrows way above the top of the eyes. They're
lifting clear up your forehead. Think of ecstatic

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.559
as a cross between happy and scared. So, you're
going to have huge like, almost like a face

00:00:50.559 --> 00:01:02.899
splitting smile going on, here. You can see,
and you're going to have big wrinkles on the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.299
side. The face is the, the smile is just about
to split your face in two. Your hair is almost

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.179
going to be standing up on end. Not quite!
But unlike sad, it's going to be almost lifting

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:22.759
off of the side of your face. Got to get your
ears in there. Sides are going to be bunched

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.609
up because you're so happy. Going to bring
it along down on the jaw line. Your chin is

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.090
going to be more shallow because all the skin
is going to be stretching along here with

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.759
how exactly happy you are. Now some other
effects you can add in and around your body,

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:48.869
your face is, of course, having some lines
shooting out. You know, like big points of

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.661
light even, almost shooting out here. Like
fire crackers going off off the top of your

00:01:52.661 --> 00:01:56.419
head. Oh my goodness, you're going, you're
going to a whole lot of fun places. You've

00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:01.889
had an unbelievable day! Another thing to
do is to have the, have your shoulders flaying

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:07.490
out outwards expansively as if you've conquered
the world. Of course you can have just more,

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.349
like lines, lots of lines shooting out, here.
All the way around the head. Because your

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:20.430
cartoon expression is one of complete and
total happiness, crossed with insane excitement.
