00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:10.960
This video shows how to install an HP Jetdirect
2800w NFC/Wireless Direct Accessory. This

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.960
accessory enables both wireless direct and
NFC (Near Field Communication) printing.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.320
To complete this installation you will need
the HP Jetdirect 2800w and a small flathead

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.130
screwdriver.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.270
There are two similar installation procedures
depending on your printer model. We will show

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.270
both methods using two example printers. The
Jetdirect 2800w ships with the hardware needed

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.120
for either installation.
In the first step, you will remove the cover

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.490
from the Hardware Integration Pocket, or HIP.
This step is the same for all printers.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:00.490
First, press the power button to turn off
your printer.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.580
Locate the HIP near the control panel of your
printer.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.030
Use the flathead screwdriver along the short
edges of the rectangular cover to gently pry

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.479
the cover off.
Do not pry along the long edges of the rectangular

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.479
cover. Doing so will cause damage to the cover.
Remove the cover completely and set it aside.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.200
You will want to store it in a safe place
for later.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.869
Now you are ready to install the Jetdirect
2800w. This step will vary depending on the

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.979
type of connector in your printer's HIP.
Locate the USB connector in the HIP. There

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.399
are two types of connectors. It is important
to note which connector your printer has.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.030
The most common connector is embedded in the
HIP. This connector is called the USB Mini

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.170
B receptacle.
However, some printer models have a USB Mini

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.810
B plug in the HIP. In this case, there will
be an external cable in the HIP.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.999
If your printer has an external connector,
you will install the Jetdirect USB cable with

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.850
the wrapped end into the HIP.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.690
If your connector is embedded, you will install
the Jetdirect USB cable with the exposed metal

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.780
on the end of the connector into the HIP.
Now that you have determined which cable you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.070
need, you are ready to connect it to the Jetdirect
2800w.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.970
Next, you will attach the power and grounding
ends of your cable to the receiver.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.930
The power cord has a white four-point connector
that corresponds to a four-point receiver

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.610
on the underside of the Jetdirect 2800w. Attach
the four-point connector to the receiving

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.670
end, with the contacts facing the PC board.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.410
Now you will attach the grounding connector
to the grounding tab on the underside of the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.090
Jetdirect 2800w.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.890
Slide the metal ground connector over the
grounding tab.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.660
Pick up the accessory and plug the USB cable
into the connector in the HIP.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.550
If you have a receptacle cable, you will plug
the end into the embedded connector in the

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.060
HIP.
If you have a plug cable, then you will plug

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:28.620
the end into the external cable in the HIP.
Now you are ready to insert the Jetdirect

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.840
2800w into the HIP. This step is the same
for all printers.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.760
First, locate the hook-shaped clips along
one of the long edges of your HP Jetdirect

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.060
2800w. Then locate the corresponding tabs
on one of the long edges of your printer's

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.540
HIP.
Insert the hook-shaped clips into the tabs.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.860
Make sure the cable is inside the HIP.
Then gently push the Jetdirect into the HIP

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.700
until it snaps into place.
In this step, you will make sure the accessory

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:09.700
was properly installed.
Press the power button to turn on the printer.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.070
You will know the installation is successful
if the NFC LED indicator light on the Jetdirect

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:24.360
cover is on, the Wi-Fi icon indicator is on
your printer's control panel, and the accessory

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.110
is listed on the configuration pages.
To print a configuration page, first make

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.150
sure you have paper loaded.
On the printer's control panel, scroll to

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.090
Administration.
Touch Administration.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.740
Touch Reports.
Touch Configuration/Status pages.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.939
Touch the box to the left of Configuration
Page. A check mark will appear in the box.

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:58.199
Touch Print to print the configuration pages.
The configuration pages will indicate if the

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:05.199
Jetdirect 2800w is installed. In the General
Information section on the page titled Wireless,

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:12.389
J8029A will be listed as the Model Number
and the Connection Type will be Wireless Direct.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:18.529
Your printer is now ready for wireless direct
and NFC printing.

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:25.529
