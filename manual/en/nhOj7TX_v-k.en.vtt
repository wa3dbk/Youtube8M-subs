00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:09.690
I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace Lawns. We want
to talk about making compost tea. Now, commercially

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.910
we have nice machines that we can pour things
in, and mixes it and run it, and does that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:26.039
for us. However you can make the same compost
tea yourself by using a five gallon bucket,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.199
an aerator from a fish aquarium will work
just fine. Place that in the bottom of that

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:50.300
five gallon bucket. Always remember to plug
it in so you have power. Then, fill your bucket

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:05.729
up with five gallons of water.
After the bucket is full, you want to turn

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.930
the aerator on, you need to run that aerator
in that water for twenty four hours. That's

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.071
going to help purify that water, get out the
chlorine and the things that are put in there,

00:01:19.071 --> 00:01:26.829
and get it a more pure water state, gets the
salts and all the things out. Once that twenty

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:37.840
four hour period is up, you bring your compost
and put it in there as well. Now, compost

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:46.009
can be turkey compost, dairy cattle compost,
beef cattle compost, or any of the different

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:53.219
styles of compost that are on the market today.
You may even mix one or two of the composts

00:01:53.219 --> 00:02:00.689
together for a better more complete compost
tea. Worm castings is also a good compost

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:08.369
to use. Basically, you'll put that compost
in an old pair of pantyhose or something of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:23.250
that nature, you will suspend it

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:35.040
down in the water, so that the water will
engulf it. Then you will mix two tablespoons

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:47.120
of fish emulsion, one and a half tablespoons
of humate, four ounces of molasses the horticulture

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:58.980
variety, the amount of compost that you put
in your pantyhose will be two pounds, mix

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:07.250
that together, run that for another twenty
four hours. At that point, take your compost

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:19.240
out, squeeze it, get all the draining out
of it that you can, run it for about another

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:27.620
thirty minutes, and then you're ready to go.
That is the simple version of making compost

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.840
tea.
