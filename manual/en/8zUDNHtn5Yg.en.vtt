00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.920
bjbjqPqP m going to demonstrate the half-double
crochet stitch. Which is a height half way

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.970
between a single crochet and a double crochet.
And you see it come up in patterns quite a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:27.469
bit. s go ahead and take a look. Here is a
sample of half double crochet worked. It is

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:32.450
taller than a single crochet, like I said,
but also it just looks really different. s

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.570
a more compact looking stitch, with kind of,
the stitches look like fans almost and less

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.760
like a post, like this double crochet, these
are posts. And this is more like a little

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.510
fan shape. I think it s a pretty stitch. Okay,
to get started, we re going to start with

00:00:49.510 --> 00:01:08.830
a slip knot. And chain a few stitches. Okay.
Remember oh, I m going to crochet a couple

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.560
of extra here. Remember, we never count the
hook the loop that s on the hook. And for

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.830
half-double crochet, we re going to skip the
first V, skip the second V, and go into the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.670
third V. The Vs looking like a cast on or
bind off row, being a bunch of Vs. And we

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.850
re going to stab under the left leg of the
1, 2, third V. We want to yarn over first,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.131
and then stab into that. Stab into the foundation
chain. Grab the yarn and pull up a loop, and

00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:47.560
then grab the yarn and pull through all three
loops. Leaving you with just one. And you

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.320
can see here, that s what gives us this fan
shape. Because it pulled through all three

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.060
loops at one time. So yarn over, stab into
the work and pull up a loop, and remember.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.689
Always slide that loop to the fullest part
of the hook to make it easier to pull the

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:13.730
hook through all three. Yarn over, and pull
through all three. Yarn over, stab into the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:51.849
work, grab the yarn and pull up a loop, grab
the yarn and pull through all three. Ha, having

00:02:51.849 --> 00:03:01.291
a hard time getting that bit done. There we
go. Okay, the hardest row is finished! For

00:03:01.291 --> 00:03:08.010
half double crochet, I m going to chain two
before I turn my work, and yarn over and stab

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:39.010
into the first stitch in the work. Whoops.
And there you have it, that s half-double

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.690
crochet. [music] Staci Perry Normal Staci
