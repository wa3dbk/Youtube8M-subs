00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.900
You’re playing Barcelona U19s.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.400
They’re very very impressed with that they’ve seen.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.400
So they’ll be cuing their guys up and saying “you’re in a game today”

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
This is not one they’ll be taking lightly.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
We need you to be a strong team today,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
then the individuals within that will perform.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
We play with our heads at all times

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.900
because the game is about showing what we’ve learnt.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Close the gap! Close the gap! Squeeze.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.500
Played.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Go on then, now you’ve got it. Go on.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Yes Ben, yes Ben!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.500
Unlucky.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.500
They’re in, they’re in.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That can’t happen Abou, too easy Abou.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:06.200
Penalty.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.900
Probably if you’re watching up in the stand, it’s a little bit of a game of chess.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Maybe they’ve had possession, but they haven’t had penetration because our organisation is good.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.900
Ok, maintain the level of concentration.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.500
It’s hard work mentally and physically but stick at it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.900
Abou, you are much better than that, right.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You are that reliable player, give us the strength in there. We need that player.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Now you’ve realised that you can beat them.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.500
We knew. Hopefully some of you knew as well.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.900
I can see now on your faces like **** me, this is happening.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.900
Now you have to go there and finish off the job.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.000
Well done, Abou!

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
Good boy…time Abou.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Patience now.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Now we go!

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.000
Good. Go on, go on, you’ll do it. Well done!

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.000
There’s your man, find your man.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.900
We’ve had some good results. That’s the best one because I think you showed a real good understanding

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.900
of how to press, how to attack, and how to stick to a game plan.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
During the first half, I wasn’t at the top of my form

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.900
and Edu told me that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.900
but I already knew it.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.400
At half time I got my thoughts back in place

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
and we did everything we needed to win in the second half.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I think that the best way to develop a player

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.900
is simply to play against the best opposition.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.066
We knew that they’d press us no matter what.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.100
But we coped with it very well.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.900
This whole trip has been an educational process for our players.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.900
To come here and learn about Barcelona football club:

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.900
their philosophies, how they work, how they develop individuals, how they collectively work as a team.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.000
The game is always a reflection of their learning

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.000
and there’s nothing that reinforces a good team more than success on the pitch.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Yes Sean, yes Sean.
