Hi, my name is Karl James owner of Creolesoul
Catering located in Round Rock, TX and I'm

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.719
Taylor Glover and on behalf of Expert Village
we are here to show you a chicken and sausage

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.800
jambalaya. Let's take a look at our ingredients
that we are going to need for our chicken

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.651
and sausage jambalaya. Well of course we are
going to need chicken, we're going to use

00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:28.960
a couple of boneless and skinless chicken
breasts for this. For our sausage we chose

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:37.250
to use was some creole or casian style andouille
sausage, it is a smoky spicy kind of sausage.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.790
If you can't find andouille use any smoke
sausage that you choose it will be just fine.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.829
We're also going to use a little chicken broth,
a little bit of tomato sauce, we're going

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:02.720
to use our veggies, use some bell pepper (both
green and red) green onion, celery, onions

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.130
now that makes up our holy trinity. Which
is a staple in creole cooking some parsley,

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:19.689
Serrano peppers, garlic, tomatoes this bowl
belongs to my chef here. She'll take care

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.280
of all this, and then we're going to add a
little bonus at the end we're going to add

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.850
a little shrimp to this. So we're going to
look at and also use in our basic spices we

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.330
are going to use some black pepper, kosher
salt, garlic powder, creole seasonings (which

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.859
you can buy already mixed) a little ole bay
seasoning, bay leaves. Then we're going to

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:52.969
use a little dry thyme today what we like
to use most of the time are some fresh thyme

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:57.259
but when we went to the store this morning
they were all out. So we're going to add a

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.429
little dry thyme to the that. So these are
the ingredients that we are going to use,

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:02.039
let's get started.
