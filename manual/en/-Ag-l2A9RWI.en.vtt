Hi this is Gerard Mainardi and we're talking
today about how to organize your documents

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.060
in Microsoft Windows XP. Remember Microsoft
Windows XP is trademark of Microsoft Corporation

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.880
and I am not affiliated with Microsoft Corporation.
OK. Now we just got finished talking about

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.120
ways to search for different files. The most
important thing to know is what kind of file

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.120
you are searching for. Let's say you want
to find all of a certain type of image on

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.280
your computer. Well you don't know how to
do that unless you know exactly what that

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.160
type of image is. Let's take a look. Open
your my documents here as usual. Go to start,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:40.570
go to my documents. Here is mine. Get right
here. Now let's say we're looking for all

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.480
of your mp3's. Well now you know these are
called mp3's for a reason. That's because

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.780
their file name extension is .mp3. Well how
would you know this if you didn't know that

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.500
in the first place? Let's go into my music
here. Pull down the Skra folder. Here are

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.610
all the songs. Now remember we did this in
the beginning, but let's go over it again.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.780
On this bar right here, this is where you
can view all the various file attributes that

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.390
you have. Right click on it and make sure
that type is checked off. If it's not, it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.150
won't be there. Turn it back on. There it
is. That tells you exactly what it is. You

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.409
can see here mp3 audio file. Mp3 in parenthesis
there. That tells you exactly what you're

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:26.590
searching for. Now some very common extensions
that you might see. Mp3 or mpg which is mpegs

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.950
for music and video files. Something like
.bmp, .gif or .jpg. These are various types

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.670
of image files that you might see, things
you take on your digital camera. And then

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.470
again if you're using something like Microsoft
Word or Notepad to keep track of things, it'll

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.590
be .doc or .text. Now this is useful because
when you're searching and you use that asterisk

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.790
wild card which you make by hitting shift
8, so you can search for let's say all of

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.160
the, if your camera takes things in jpegs,
do a search for * .jpg. You can check your

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.270
files, know it's a jpg file, that way you
can go and know exactly what you're searching

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.850
for every time.
