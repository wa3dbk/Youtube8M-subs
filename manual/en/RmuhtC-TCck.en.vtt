Hey! How you doing? This is Jonathan Escotto,
also known as B-boy Xcel, on behalf of Expert

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.040
Village, and today we're showing breaking
tips. Right now we're going to talk a little

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.250
bit about power moves. It's very important,
especially when you're first starting, that

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.910
your footwork and your power moves go in the
same direction. That would either be clockwise

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.060
or counterclockwise. The way you can tell
this is by the way your freeze. If you freeze

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.420
on your right hand, your basic most freeze
is on your right hand, your footwork and your

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.230
power move should be clockwise. If you freeze
on your left, obviously, it's counterclockwise.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.410
Keep that in mind because it's very important.
Basically, we're going to talk about the swipe.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.700
Now the swipe is one of the most basic foundational
power moves. It looks something like this.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:59.680
This is what a swipe looks like.
Now, that's an air swipe, also known as a

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.780
swipe. A good drill to be able to get a swipe.
I really don't have a name for it, just going

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.620
to show you the drill. It looks something
like this. Now, that looks like a pretty funny

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.310
move. It looks like a weird caterpillar or
something, but it's a good drill in order

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.400
to get the swipe. I'm going to show you what
I did here. Start the stance with my legs

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:34.460
a little separate. My power moves go clockwise.
What I do is I take my left hand and I put

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:46.200
it down first, just as I'm bending over. Here.
Now, I lift my right leg up, take my right

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:58.479
leg and repeat the motion. Step, step, step.
1, 2, step, 1, 2, step. The repetitive motion

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.630
of that gives you the swing and the momentum
that's needed when doing an air swipe. The

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.090
second part to dong an air swipe would be
this. It's very important to get your hand

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.510
positioning correct. We're going to start
off sitting on our bums. Take your right hand,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.150
you're going to lift up so you're sitting
up like this. You want to be on your heels.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.830
What we're going to do from here, is we're
going to switch it to your left hand sort

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.940
of like this. Hop. Now, from here you're going
to take your right hand, place it down, and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:50.900
repeat the motion. So we went 1, 2, 3, 1,
2, 3. Now that combined with the first hop

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.860
pretty much gets you a swipe.
