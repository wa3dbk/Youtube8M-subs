00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Not many armored vehicles can surprise you on the battlefield like the 180-ton steel giant known as the “Maus” German heavy tank.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
After the "Lowe" project was completed, development of this tank lasted from March 1942 until June 1944.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The “Krupp” company planned to create 141 of these tanks, but the regular bombing by British Air Forces disrupted this plan and in 1943, during the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
“Ruhr Pocket” operation, the “Krupp” military plant suffered extremely serious damage.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
As a result, manufacturing of the “Maus” was impossible for nearly eight months.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
By the time the installation was restored, the order was reduced; "Krupp" was to produce two tanks and one turret instead of 141 vehicles.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If the British Air Force hadn’t bombed the German military plants repeatedly, putting their work to standstill, there's a possibility that additional "Maus" 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
tanks could have been adopted for service and used on the battlefields of World War II.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
However, that didn’t happen.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
In World of Tanks, the "Maus" is a top tier vehicle in the German heavy tank branch.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We're going to rate the combat characteristics of this vehicle in comparison with other tier 10 heavy tanks.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We’ll use a scale of 1 to 10 to evaluate these characteristics. 1 being the lowest and 10 the highest.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The movement and mobility characteristics are worse than its tier mates.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hull traverse speed is 15 degrees per second, turret traverse speed is 14 degrees per second.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Its maximum speed is 20 km/h.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The firing characteristics aren't the strongest feature of this tank either.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Aiming time is 2.9 seconds.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Accuracy of the gun is 0.38 m at a distance of 100 meters.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Alpha damage averages 490.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The average penetration of an armor piercing shell is 246 millimeters.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This tank is one of the best-armored in the game.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The higher glacis is 200 mm thick and situated at an angle of 52 degrees, which means it can resist shots from the most powerful guns in the game.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Its side armor is 185 mm, but its slope angle is 0 degrees, which decreases its effectiveness.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The frontal armor of its turret is 240mm and it is convex-shaped.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Side armor of the turret is 210 mm and situated at an angle of 30 degrees. This armor can be a hard nut to crack for the majority of tanks.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This tank has 3,000 hit points, the highest rate in the game.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
As other heavy tanks of this tier, except the British, it has view range of 400 meters.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Let’s sum up:

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The disadvantages of the Maus are its low acceleration and mediocre fire potential.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
In addition, its giant silhouette makes the tank an excellent target for artillery.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The main advantages of this vehicle are its huge amount of HP and solid armoring.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The weak spots are the sides of its turret, the lower glacis, and the poor-armored parts of its hull that can be penetrated by shooting at its tracks at an angle.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Let’s talk about the battle tactics.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The Maus is THE vehicle for the front line. It can take a lot of damage and shield allies from enemy fire.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Traditionally, city maps are considered to be the ideal place for heavy tanks to fight in.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
You can hold position or push the flanks.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And the chances of being shot by artillery are really low.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You shouldn't forget about your weak spots: hide the lower glacis, and turn your turret so enemies have no opportunity to aim at its sides.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It’s really important to understand what you're going to do during each stage of a battle.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You shouldn’t rush forward during the first minutes just because you don't see anyone ahead of you.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
An enemy can be waiting for you around the corner.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
If you're sure there's only a few tanks ahead of you, gather your teammates, and then push forward.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Support of your teammates is really important -- if a Maus is left alone, it becomes an easy target for enemies since it can't fight on two fronts.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Let’s use “Ruinberg” as an example.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We're only going to talk about the city parts of the map because we highly recommend you avoid its open territories.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
At the start of the battle, you should move to section G3 and use the destroyed building as cover.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
From there you can shoot through the embrasure.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
If enemies are rushing through the third line or using defensive tactics, you'll be able to inflict damage on them while remaining protected.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
From this square you'll be able to take the following steps:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
If there are a lot of enemy tanks, move to section F2 and shoot them from behind the corner.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Push the third line or even move to section J2 if enemies break through the small town.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Generally, on every map, you should perform several actions that may provide your team with some advantages over your enemies.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The Maus is not able to move fast from one flank to another. That's why you should predict the flank where you will meet the main enemy forces, so 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you can perform your role there.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:05.000
On open maps such as “Malinovka”, “Prokhorovka”, “El Halluf”, “Sand River” and “Steppes” you won’t fulfill the potential of this tank.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The Maus is slow, so it's really hard to change position or find cover quickly.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Its giant size lets enemies scout it quickly and artillery will shoot as soon as possible.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And its mediocre penetration, as well as poor accuracy, makes it impossible for you to shoot enemies at a long distance.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
On “Malinovka”, the best decision is to stay near the monastery or barns.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
On “El Halluf”, you can hide behind the mountains.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
On “Sand River”, get to the city and try to hide from enemy fire.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
On “Steppes”, you may use stones as cover and fire on other heavy tanks from there.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
“Prokhorovka” is one of the most unfavorable maps for the Maus because you can be scouted and destroyed before you even get into position.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
That’s why you should move carefully and use existing buildings in the village for cover.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Any other actions will lead to certain death.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The effectiveness of the Maus is heavily dependent on the map.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
That's a significant problem of playing this vehicle.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
In valleys or other locations where you can hide from artillery it can really do a lot, but as soon as the Maus appears on an open map or when it's left 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
alone, it becomes very vulnerable.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It’d be a surprise if you’re able to successfully finish the battle.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We should also mention another weak point of the Maus: when you position your tank at an angle, an enemy can shoot your track.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
A shell will penetrate it and hit the armor, which is only 80 millimeters thick.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.000
At long range you shouldn’t be afraid of it, but in close combat you should position your tank to increase the chances of a ricochet when an enemy is aiming at you.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
During a facehug against almost any tank, you can use your weight to your advantage.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Ramming damage is not high, but it can come in handy.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
To increase the efficiency of your tank in battle, you should buy the following equipment:

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The Tank Gun Rammer, the Gun Stabilizer and the Enhanced Gun Laying Drive will help your tank in close combat, improving your aim, and helping 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
you shoot faster.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
As for the skills of your crew, the most effective combination is the following:

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
That’s all for now. Good luck on the battlefield!
