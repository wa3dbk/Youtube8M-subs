00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.790
The victim had looked ill for days - off color,
wilted, almost wasting away.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.570
Food, water, medicine - nothing seemed to
help.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.660
Everything got worse and worse until finally,
the victim died.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.279
It was clear that a crime had been committed,
but the perpetrator is unknown.

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.859
Time to call Sherrie Smith, plant detective.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:33.670
Sherrie is what you might call a crime scene
investigator into the field.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.320
She is the state plant pathologist for the
Plant Health Clinic at the University of Arkansas.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.129
Do your soybeans have spots?

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.379
Is your wisteria withering?

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:47.990
Do you have holes in your hostas?

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:49.461
Then it could be time to contact Sherrie.

00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:56.010
Sherrie Smith: We look at fungal diseases,
bacterial diseases, and viruses.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.030
Often we get plants that have insect infestations
due to the fact the plant is stressed.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.990
Because stressed plants send out signals that
actually draw insects to them.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.670
Kind of like fish thrashing around in the
water draw sharks.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.909
When the Plant Health Clinic receives a case,
it first taken to the "plant morgue," where

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.540
it is laid out on a table.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:23.200
The plant body is examined and checked for
obvious wounds - brown or mutilated leaves,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.840
colorful spots or lumps on the roots.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.729
After that, Sherrie heads to the microscope
to help make a diagnosis.

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:49.090
Sherrie Smith: This is important because Arkansas'
economy depends heavily on agriculture.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.860
I will diagnose a disease and make a recommendation
on how to control the disease.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.659
Every year, Sherrie receives thousands of
victimes from all over the state and beyond.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.929
Many samples come from commercial crops grown
by farmers around the state, or plants in

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.990
greenhouses for commercial sale.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.790
Sometimes, however, an unusual case will pop
up.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:20.540
Like humans, plants are vulnerable to numerous
assaults: malnutrition, viruses, fungus, bacteria,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.010
insects, drought and poisons.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.830
It's up to Sherrie to determine the real culprit.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.570
Sherrie Smith: The best part of my job is
talking to people everyday and helping them

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.689
with their plant problems.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.920
There is always something exciting going on,
it's like a puzzle or a mystery and every

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.670
day you solve a mystery.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.010
Some of them are easy to solve and some of
them aren't but I really like that aspect

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.450
of my job.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.819
Once she has completed her investigation,
Sherrie will file a report with the appropriate

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.090
authorities - usually the people who have
sent her the victim's body.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.519
She will name the culprit, and the plant owners
can take steps towards putting the criminal

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.809
behind bars.
