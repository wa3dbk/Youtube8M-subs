00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:03.033
The President:
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.400
As you know, I just met with
leaders of both parties to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.834
discuss a way forward in light
of the severe budget cuts that

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:13.000
start to take effect today.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I told them these cuts
will hurt our economy.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.700
They will cost us jobs.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.100
And to set it right, both
sides need to be willing

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.700
to compromise.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.033
The good news is the American
people are strong and

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.233
they're resilient.

00:00:26.233 --> 00:00:30.900
They fought hard to recover from
the worst economic crisis since

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.934
the Great Depression, and we
will get through this as well.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:38.233
Even with these cuts in place,
folks all across this country

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:42.834
will work hard to make sure that
we keep the recovery going.

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:46.233
But Washington sure
isn't making it easy.

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.667
At a time when our businesses
have finally begun to get some

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:53.433
traction -- hiring new workers, bringing jobs back to America --

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:55.567
we shouldn't be making
a series of dumb,

00:00:55.567 --> 00:01:00.400
arbitrary cuts to things that
businesses depend on and workers

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.834
depend on, like
education, and research,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.834
and infrastructure and defense.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.367
It's unnecessary.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:10.533
And at a time when too many
Americans are still looking for

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.734
work, it's inexcusable.

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:17.600
Now, what's important to
understand is that not everyone

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.633
will feel the pain of
these cuts right away.

00:01:21.633 --> 00:01:23.800
The pain, though, will be real.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.033
Beginning this week, many
middle-class families will have

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:30.700
their lives disrupted
in significant ways.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Businesses that work
with the military,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.433
like the Virginia shipbuilder
that I visited on Tuesday,

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.700
may have to lay folks off.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.533
Communities near military bases
will take a serious blow.

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:45.000
Hundreds of thousands of
Americans who serve their

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.567
country -- Border Patrol
agents, FBI agents,

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.667
civilians who work
at the Pentagon --

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:56.700
all will suffer significant
pay cuts and furloughs.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.066
All of this will cause a ripple
effect throughout our economy.

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.233
Layoffs and pay cuts means that
people have less money in their

00:02:04.233 --> 00:02:07.000
pockets, and that means that
they have less money to spend at

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.467
local businesses.

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.200
That means lower profits.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.467
That means fewer hires.

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:14.433
The longer these
cuts remain in place,

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:17.100
the greater the damage
to our economy --

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.934
a slow grind that will intensify
with each passing day.

00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:24.533
So economists are estimating
that as a consequence of this

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:27.467
sequester, that we could
see growth cut by over

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.700
one-half of 1%.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.633
It will cost about 750,000 jobs
at a time when we should be

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.367
growing jobs more quickly.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:41.867
So every time that we get
a piece of economic news,

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:45.800
over the next month, next
two months, next six months,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.300
as long as the
sequester is in place,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300
we'll know that that economic
news could have been better if

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.367
Congress had not failed to act.

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:55.633
And let's be clear.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.066
None of this is necessary.

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:00.934
It's happening because of a
choice that Republicans in

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:03.867
Congress have made.

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:07.600
They've allowed these cuts to
happen because they refuse to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.767
budge on closing a single
wasteful loophole to help reduce

00:03:12.767 --> 00:03:14.633
the deficit.

00:03:14.633 --> 00:03:17.867
As recently as yesterday, they
decided to protect special

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:22.333
interest tax breaks for the
well-off and well-connected,

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.700
and they think that that's
apparently more important than

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.567
protecting our military or
middle-class families from the

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:30.266
pain of these cuts.

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:34.533
I do believe that we can and
must replace these cuts with a

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:39.133
more balanced approach that asks
something from everybody: Smart

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:42.367
spending cuts;
entitlement reform;

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:45.934
tax reform that makes the tax
code more fair for families and

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:49.266
businesses without
raising tax rates --

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:53.367
all so that we can responsibly
lower the deficit without laying

00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:57.066
off workers, or forcing parents
to scramble for childcare,

00:03:57.066 --> 00:04:00.467
or slashing financial
aid for college students.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:01.934
I don't think that's
too much to ask.

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.800
I don't think that is partisan.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.033
It's the kind of approach that
I've proposed for two years.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.800
It's what I ran on last year.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.300
And the majority of the American
people agree with me in this

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.734
approach, including, by the
way, a majority of Republicans.

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:19.000
We just need Republicans in
Congress to catch up with their

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.400
own party and their
country on this.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.100
And if they did so, we could
make a lot of progress.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.834
I do know that there are
Republicans in Congress who

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.000
privately, at least, say that
they would rather close tax

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.133
loopholes than let
these cuts go through.

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:37.834
I know that there are Democrats
who'd rather do smart

00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:41.367
entitlement reform than
let these cuts go through.

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:45.300
So there is a caucus of common
sense up on Capitol Hill.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.467
It's just -- it's a silent group right now, and we want to make

00:04:50.467 --> 00:04:52.533
sure that their voices
start getting heard.

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:54.533
In the coming days and in the
coming weeks I'm going to keep

00:04:54.533 --> 00:05:00.934
on reaching out to them, both
individually and as groups of

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:04.133
senators or members of the
House, and say to them,

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:07.667
let's fix this -- not just
for a month or two, but for

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:08.934
years to come.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:12.100
Because the greatest nation
on Earth does not conduct its

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.567
business in month-to-month
increments,

00:05:15.567 --> 00:05:17.767
or by careening from
crisis to crisis.

00:05:17.767 --> 00:05:20.467
And America has got a
lot more work to do.

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:25.233
In the meantime, we can't let
political gridlock around the

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.734
budget stand in the way of
other areas where we can

00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:29.100
make progress.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.800
I was pleased to see that the
House passed the Violence

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.533
Against Women Act yesterday.

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:40.033
That is a big win for not just
women but for families and for

00:05:40.033 --> 00:05:41.500
the American people.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.400
It's a law that's going to save
lives and help more Americans

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.000
live free from fear.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.400
It's something that we've been
pushing on for a long time.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.100
I was glad to see that done.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.834
And it's an example of how we
can still get some important

00:05:54.834 --> 00:05:58.500
bipartisan legislation through
this Congress even though there

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.600
is still these fiscal
arguments taking place.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.800
And I think there are other
areas where we can make progress

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.867
even with the
sequester unresolved.

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.900
I will continue to push
for those initiatives.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.200
I'm going to keep pushing for
high-quality preschool for every

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.400
family that wants it.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.233
I'm going to keep pushing to
make sure that we raise the

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:17.767
minimum wage so that it's one
that families can live on.

00:06:17.767 --> 00:06:20.800
I'm going to keep on pushing
for immigration reform,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.433
and reform our voting system,
and improvements on our

00:06:24.433 --> 00:06:26.300
transportation sector.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.333
And I'm going to keep pushing
for sensible gun reforms because

00:06:30.333 --> 00:06:32.834
I still think they
deserve a vote.

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:36.100
This is the agenda that the
American people voted for.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.100
These are America's priorities.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.133
They are too important
to go unaddressed.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:43.033
And I'm going to keep
pushing to make sure that we

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:43.734
see them through.
