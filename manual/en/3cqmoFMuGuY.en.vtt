00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.060
Hi, and welcome to a special
Valentine’s Day edition of ValveTime Top 5,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.690
which will also be known as “Episode 7”
on every other day of the year.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.290
As we all know, Valentine’s Day is a very special day

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.810
which we humans use to show admiration for a loved one by

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.210
buying expensive commercial goods
and falling for cheap discounts.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.390
Most importantly though, it’s about
relationships! (And spending money.)

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.470
To mark the yearly celebration of love,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.770
we thought now would be the perfect time to take
a look at some of Valve’s greatest relationships.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.970
But, since Valve doesn’t really have
all that many lovey-dovey relationships,

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.220
we thought we would express our bitterness
as a bunch of single male nerds

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.550
by expanding the term to also include friendships and rivalries,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.320
which Valve games definitely have in excess.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.440
Now, this intro has gone on long enough,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.500
so let’s stop making fun of an annual
holiday and get on with the show.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.120
As usual, this episode will feature multiple
spoilers for several of Valve’s series.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.460
Let’s get started!

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.690
Number 5

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.060
Our fifth choice for this list might surprise a lot of you,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.630
given the extremely limited exposure provided during Half-Life 2.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.630
“What could it be?!” I hear you ponder.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.260
Well, our number 5 slot goes to
none other than the decades-old rivalry

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.830
displayed by Eli Vance and Wallace Breen.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.050
Given Breen’s demise during the conclusion of Half-Life 2,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.720
this relationship is only really touched upon
at several, rather minor intervals,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.550
including during Breen’s Overwatch speech at Nova Prospekt

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.270
and during a direct confrontation atop the Combine Citadel.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.330
Their rivalry is shown to be longstanding and bitter,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.850
as the pair intellectually square off
against one another in an attempt

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.210
to sway the other’s strong juxtaposing beliefs
regarding the Combine’s dominance over Earth.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.930
With Eli having stood as one of Black Mesa’s
top scientists and Breen as its administrator,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.600
the pair clearly have a long and varied history together.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.940
But that doesn’t stop Breen from celebrating
Eli’s capture at Black Mesa East

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.690
and his near death at the hands of a Combine Portal.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.180
Anyway, as interesting and insightful as the pair’s bickering is,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.390
the limited exposure we have to their rivalry as players
really is the largest problem with this relationship,

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.640
preventing us from putting it any higher on our list...

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.440
...or lower, depending how you look at it.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.200
Number 4

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.050
A similar tale could be told for our fourth choice,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.080
which is also only really shown or
established in brief circumstances.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.690
However, this time we’re talking about a
loving relationship, rather than a bitter rivalry.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.170
That’s right; we’re talking about the growing close
relationship between Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
which begins late in Half-Life 2 and continues
to grow throughout Episodes One and Two

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.320
as the pair support each other through
thick, thin, life, and death... literally.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.580
The relationship develops relatively quickly
over the period of a few hectic days

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.820
after Alyx seemingly falls for Gordon
after her rescue inside Breen’s office.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.710
Not that Gordon actually had all that much to do
with the rescue, now we really think about it.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.020
Anyway, their bond continues to subtly strengthen
throughout Episodes One and Two

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.580
before eventually receiving an unmistakable
wink of approval from Eli at White Forest.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:08.790
However, while we’d like to sit here commentating
on all of the innuendos and... physical contact...

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.060
we still feel the relationship is a little
too one-dimensional for our liking.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.910
Don’t get us wrong; keeping Gordon as a
silent protagonist throughout the series

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.780
is and was absolutely the way to go...

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.650
it just isn’t a very good way of developing
what should be a two-way relationship.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.910
Better luck next time, Gordon.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.770
Number 3

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.330
Our next choice might weird out a few people,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.740
but don’t forget we said we were also
allowed to talk about friendships, rivalries,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.290
and that includes "platonic" relationships.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.020
Yes, we’re going to talk about everyone’s
favorite class-on-class friendship displayed

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.520
between the Heavy Weapons Guy
and the Medic from Team Fortress 2.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.300
While the close relationship between Alyx and Gordon
was entirely scripted and established by Valve

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.820
as a primarily pillar within the main narrative,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.590
the Heavy and Medic’s relationship was almost
entirely developed by the community

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.840
after noticing how much both classes rely and depend
on each other in regular matches of TF2.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.740
What started with minor jokes, art work,
machinima, and even fan fiction

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.250
eventually became the accepted norm
to the point where even Valve themselves

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.580
have officially recognized their bromance as canon,

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.970
going so far as to focus an entire
“Meet the Team” video around the subject

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.250
while providing some interesting insight into how it all began.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.070
Number 2

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.870
Now, we’ve already mentioned bitter rivalries,
close relationships, and even bromances,

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.850
so what’s the next logical step?

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.160
Well, one subject we haven’t quite
touched on just yet is family relationships,

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.330
and, more specifically, the close bonds a dire
situation present in the likes of Half-Life 2

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.180
can bring a father-daughter duo like Eli Vance and Alyx Vance.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.210
Valve paid special attention to this relationship
throughout Half-Life 2 and the sequel episodes,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.310
allowing the player to immediately identify and relate
to the strong, close family connection present,

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.200
even if the duo are only really seen together a handful of times.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.090
Both Eli and Alyx clearly care for one another,

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.620
a bond which is enhanced once you take
a closer look at the history of the Vance family.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.600
With the death of Alyx’s mother Azian at Black Mesa,

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.610
the importance of Eli’s role as a parental figure
was most likely significantly intensified,

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.630
especially given the harsh childhood
Alyx must have had to endure

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.030
during the Combine’s early reign over Earth.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.040
This strong, relatable, and eventually heartbreaking bond

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.830
is what brings the father-daughter relationship between
Eli and Alyx all the way up to number 2 on our list.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.360
[Alyx]
Don’t!

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.410
[Advisor screams]

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.770
[Alyx]
Dad, look out!

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.970
[Alyx]
No! Dad, dad!

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.770
[Alyx]
Goddammit, let go of him!

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.570
Number 1

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.130
Now, what could possibly beat Eli and Alyx?

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.770
Well, how about what we feel is the most
interesting and complex entry on this list?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.490
The three-way rivalry and part-time partnership
between Chell, Wheatley, and GLaDOS

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.240
from Portal and Portal 2 is so important and effective,

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.110
it quite literally stands as the main pillar for the entire series.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.920
It can easily be argued the majority of the serious
incidents and subsequent consequences

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.640
from both Portal and Portal 2 happen as the
explosive result of GLaDOS’ overly controlling nature,

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.600
Wheatley’s idiocy and incompetence,
or Chell’s stubborn tenacity.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.540
While we might have penalized the relationship
between Alyx Vance and Gordon Freeman

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.410
as being largely one-sided and
therefore slightly underdeveloped,

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.410
the same cannot really be said
of Chell, Wheatley, and GLaDOS,

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:25.490
despite the Portal series using the same silent protagonist
technique as its older brother Half-Life.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.370
In Portal 2 at least, Chell actually stands as
both a middleman and the vital third wheel

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.490
within the world’s strangest and potentially
most dangerous love/hate triangle.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.830
While Portal showed it’s definitely possible for the relationship
to survive with only two of the three components,

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.390
it’s hard to deny the character relations within the series were

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:46.040
dramatically enhanced with Portal 2
after the welcome arrival of Wheatley,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.530
who successfully manages to mix up the
pre-established rivalry between GLaDOS and Chell

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.910
just enough to totally flip things on their heads.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.540
The complex and unpredictable nature
of this three-way rivalry managed

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.530
to keep us extremely interested and entertained
for the entire length of Portal 2,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.790
bringing it all the way to number one on our list.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.390
[Wheatley]
How about now?!

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.980
[Wheatley]
Now who’s a moron?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:12.890
[Wheatley]
Could a moron punch... you... into... this... pit?!

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.870
[Wheatley]
Huh?! Could a moron do that?!

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:17.440
[Wheatley]
Uh-oh...

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:24.790
