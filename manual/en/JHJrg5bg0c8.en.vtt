00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.260
Moving on to the Fuzzy Drive.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.300
This is made by E.W.S.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.620
This pedal is a real extreme Fuzz.
Kind of a Fuzz Face pedal.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.620
This is with...

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.940
I think this is with the
gain all the way up.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.100
You get that Fuzz Face quality
to it, but it is a little different.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.680
It's not as bass heavy as a
Fuzz Face. 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.430
It's got a little less of that.
I really like it.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.580
If you roll the volume down a bit,
you get kind of a real nice...

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.730
It can be kind of versatile.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.770
All the way up, it's pretty heavy.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.270
But turn down it halfway and
you get a really nice overdrive.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.480
And... it cleans up real nice.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.290
Just rolling the volume down and
you get these nice different tones.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.560
You get the full-on distortion and
when you roll it back a little bit...

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.300
...and you have kind of...
that nice Hendrix-ey quality.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.510
Now we're on to the Brute Drive.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.320
The difference between these
two pedals, to my ears...

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.750
...is that one is a Fuzz,
meaning it's got fuzzy distortion.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.980
And this one is less of that.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.330
It's more of a mid-rangey distortion.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.480
But it's much thicker
than the AC Booster.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.570
This one sounds like this.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.080
It's very thick. It's got kind of
Marshall sound to it.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.000
It's a nice, big overdrive.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.080
You click this and
 it goes into boost mode.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.980
Without it, you have this.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.150
With it...

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.980
Pretty huge distortion.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.980
If you're wondering what the
differences are...

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.410
...I'll just show you real quick.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.050
Here's the Fuzzy Drive again,
with the same pickup too.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.000
I'll use the treble pickup.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:14.480
Now here's the Brute Drive.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.480
So it's a huge difference.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.590
There's more mids in the
Brute Drive than the Fuzzy Drive.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:22.430
The Fuzzy Drive is supposed to be
kind of a Fuzz Face.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.580
It's got that quality to it but
like I said, you can mess with it.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.980
You can turn the gain down too.
I have it all the way up.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.980
With any of these pedals...

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.170
It's obviously the guitar player's
taste as to what they want.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.980
They're very versatile.
You can do a lot with them.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.520
And with this Fuzzy Drive...
here's about 12 o'clock.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.230
Very dynamic, too.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.170
The more you put into it,
the more you get out of it.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.180
You can play real dynamic
with this pedal.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:48.310
Same thing with the Brute Drive.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.590
With this pedal, it does
react to your touch.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.010
But it's got a little bit of
compression going on.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:58.980
So, you don't get as much reaction...

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.230
...like out of this one. (Fuzzy Drive)

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:15.130
You go over to the Brute Drive...

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.730
Now, I wasn't halfway on this one,
so let's go halfway on this pedal...

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.350
...and see what happens.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.740
Full on it sounds amazing,
it sounds huge.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:44.980
Then you go halfway and
you get this nice...

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.480
 Kind of a punchier distortion
when you turn it down a bit.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.980
