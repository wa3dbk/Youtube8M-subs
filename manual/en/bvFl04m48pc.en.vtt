Alright, what I’ve got here, this is a Trigger
X Slop Hopper. And I’ve got this rigged

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.300
on a 3/16 oz VMC keel weighted hook. You get
back here in the spawn and the waters clean,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.290
a lot of times it’s a really good bait to
throw. It’s a really good bait to throw

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.200
to kind of cover water with. But the really
neat thing about it is you can skip it. I

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.200
can skip it way back underneath the bushes,
I can throw it in places that I absolutely

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:10.810
can’t throw a spinnerbait. Like I see a
little white spot back there and I can throw

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.069
it and it will come through the weeds real
well. Like I said, I’ve been keeping it

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:21.049
up where I can see it and it’s a really
good bait to throw. A swim bait or a swim

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.060
style bait is always a good bait to throw
anytime of the year. Right around the spawn

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.729
it’s a good bait too especially it gives
the fish a different look, something they

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.609
haven’t seen. Everybody gets to throwing
swim jigs and spinnerbaits; it kind of gives

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:42.609
you a little bit different. But you can kind
of stop this thing, kill it, and like I said

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.709
you can throw it in lots of places that you
can’t throw a swim jig, a spinnerbait,

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:54.459
or things of that nature.
I really like it, and my number one thing

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:57.859
about it is it works good in all different
varieties of water color. This water’s got

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.950
a little stain but if the water was real clear,
it would give me another option too and I

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.790
can skip it back into really hard to reach
places.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:17.790
There’s one! And my hand slipped off the
reel handle.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.670
But I skipped that bait way way way way back
up under there in the shade. Just as soon

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.390
as I started to reel….. he just really he
tanked it. I mean hit it really, really hard.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.640
Try that again and see if I can skip it in
that hole right there.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:07.610
Are ya done? That’s just amazing how many
of those size fish are in this lake. And I

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.390
hate it when I see those big green streaks
that come up and hit it……horrible. It’s

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.840
addicting ya know, it’s addicting!
