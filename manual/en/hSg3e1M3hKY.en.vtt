00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.366
Now that we've finished our game we
need to present it to our players.

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:07.866
One of the greatest things about
Unity is that once we have created

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.033
our game we can deploy it to many
of the current platforms.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.233
For more detailed information on

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:16.366
building and build targets, please
see the lesson linked below.

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.100
Before we build our game,
we should save our Scene.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.266
To build our game, we must first
open the Build Settings window.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.733
We can do this by selecting
File &gt; Build Settings,

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:34.600
or by using the key combination of
Shift + Command, or CTRL + B.

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:38.100
This brings up the
Build Settings window.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.500
Our current build target is
indicated by the Unity logo.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The blue highlight indicates our focus,
and shows us on the right-hand side

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:49.033
the build options for the
currently-selected platform.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.800
We want to build a
standalone application.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.433
This is our current build target:

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.500
PC, Mac and Linux Standalone.

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:02.666
We do not need to
change our build target.

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:06.566
If we did want to change our
build target, we can select the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.433
desired platform from the list, and
click the Switch Platforms button

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.866
at the bottom of the window.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.166
Let's now return our build target
to the standalone player.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:23.566
Once we have selected our new build
target, we need to add the Scenes

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.966
we want to build to the Build Settings window.

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.966
We can add the current Scene by
clicking the Add Current button,

00:01:30.466 --> 00:01:34.433
or we can drag and drop any Scene
from our Project view into the field

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.300
at the top of the Build Settings window.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:42.166
It's worth noting that we don't need
to include every Scene in our project.

00:01:42.666 --> 00:01:45.333
We only need to include the
Scenes we we want in our game.

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.800
It is also possible to perform
a build with no Scenes

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.300
in the Build Settings window.

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:54.866
If we do this, Unity will simply build
our game using the current Scene

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600
we have open for editing.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.233
Now we are ready to build our game.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.733
Let's return to the Build Settings
window, and click the Build button.

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:07.733
This will bring up a dialogue box
asking us to choose a build location.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:12.233
I like to associate my build location
with my project, so I will create

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.699
a new folder inside
my project called Builds.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.566
This folder must be placed only on
the root of our project alongside

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.500
the assets and library folders.

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:28.133
With the build folder
selected let's name the build

00:02:30.966 --> 00:02:33.200
and then click Save.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.466
Unity will now build the application
and save it to our Builds folder.

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:42.966
When building for the Mac, Unity
builds a .app bundle, which contains

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.366
all of the relevant data and files.

00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:54.299
When building for Windows, Unity
builds a .exe file and a data folder

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.699
which contains all of the
necessary resources.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.466
To run the game, simply run
the executable application.

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:07.200
And now we are running our game.

00:03:11.566 --> 00:03:12.500
Andâ€¦

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.000
We win!

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.100
So in these assignments
we have learned how to

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.066
create new GameObjects,
how to position them in the Scene,

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:28.666
add new components to them,
write our own custom behaviors

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.166
for them using simple scripting.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.666
We've seen how to use lights, cameras,
Colliders, Triggers, Rigidbodies.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.100
We can collect and count objects.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.500
Though this is a very simple example,
it covers a large set

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:44.266
of basic subjects important to
understanding how to use Unity.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:48.200
