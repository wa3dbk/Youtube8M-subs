00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.319
What I am going to show you a little bit now
is the safety because safety is the number

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.370
one thing that you need to understand aside
the mind set when doing parkour. There are

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.769
different types of landing and rolls that
you want to do. You want to learn it on the

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:22.009
grass, gravel, cement, whatever you can do
and you want to try and do it as sufficiently

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:31.800
as possible. Another thing is the flow. With
parkour, it's not about doing one simple movement.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.260
It was invented to try and overcome different
kinds of obstacles to try to get to an injured

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.260
person originally or to save someone or yourself
the fight or flight method and what I am going

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.990
to show you now is the roll. This is really
important. There are different techniques

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.210
but I will show you my technique here today.
What you are going to do to practice your

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.440
roll is you are going to crouch down to one
knee and then you are going to use your hands

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.140
and you can even roll right on the side of
your arm. The most important thing of the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.440
roll is you are going to roll from one shoulder
to the opposite hip so that you cannot connect

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.690
any part of the spine because this will cause
problems on cement, on grass and other things

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.740
like that and you do not want to injure your
spine. So first of all you want to when you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.750
are coming into a roll, you are going to put
your hands down, put them behind you or wherever

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.090
you want but generally you are going to just
put it down and roll and you are going to

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.740
come up just about like this to get up; just
like that. When actually doing the roll, you

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.120
do not want to put your knee down in any time
of the roll so you are going to use your hands

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.180
just to brace a little bit and you don't want
to collapse into your roll. You want to stay

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.960
strong in your roll, strong in your roll just
enough to take a little bit of the pressure

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.440
off of a jump a gap, anything you might be
doing. It is going to be quick and efficient;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.470
just like that.
