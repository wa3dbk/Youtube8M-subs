00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:05.975
- It's fantastic,
it's phenomenal, look at this.

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:08.935
First of all,
do you need any convincing

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:12.975
that your eye is actually
an extension of brain tissue?

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:14.268
I mean doesn't

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:17.685
it look like it is a little
brain with eyeballs on it?

00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:20.852
That would be a really
cool dissection.

00:00:20.876 --> 00:00:26.935
So light information stimulates
receptors in the retina.

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.975
They through the magic
of all five layers

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.975
of retina cells are
going to send the message

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:38.975
through cranial
nerve number two,

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:40.477
the optic nerve.

00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.975
Now there's all sorts
of really cool

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.351
and fascinating physiological
consequences of the fact

00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:54.393
that the optic nerves actually
cross at the optic chiasm.

00:00:54.417 --> 00:00:58.975
And you can see that information
from the right side,

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:00.268
I don't know is that's the,

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:02.810
that guy's right,
or is that his left?

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:07.643
Whatever, I think that's
his left, am I correct?

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:13.393
Whatever, really
whatever keep going.

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:17.560
Okay that,
those that information splits

00:01:17.584 --> 00:01:19.727
and goes to both sides
of the brain,

00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:21.975
so does the information
from the other eyeball,

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.810
it goes to both sides
of the brain.

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:25.975
So you actually have a place

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:31.685
where you are receiving
binocular vision.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.975
Both of your eyes and that site
information is being processed

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:39.975
on both sides of your brain.

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.976
Where are you going
to expect it to go?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.226
This is such a lovely image

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.975
because you're going
to have a stop right

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:52.852
here at the thalamus.
No surprise,

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:56.018
we don't consciously
process every single piece

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:59.477
of light information
that enters our eyeball.

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:02.602
We just don't think
about all of it.

00:02:02.626 --> 00:02:07.393
But look at what happens.
The fibers actually branch,

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:10.643
we have some of them,
the same stimulus,

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:14.477
the light from my wall is going
into my eye,

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:16.975
and it's activating
all my retinal cells,

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.768
and they're all sending
the message

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:21.685
that there is something up there
that we're looking at,

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.643
splits and goes to both sides
of the brain,

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:26.351
and some of those fibers go
to the thalamus

00:02:26.375 --> 00:02:31.810
where you would expect and
some of those fibers go where,

00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:35.727
to the superior colliculus.

00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:38.975
This is different
than the ear remember

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:42.685
in that pathway we went
to the inferior colliculus

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.310
first and then we went
to the thalamus.

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:47.059
This is different,
this is,

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:48.935
we're dividing and conquering.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.894
Let's send that information
both places at the same time.

00:02:52.918 --> 00:02:57.143
The thalamus will decide should
we make this conscious or not,

00:02:57.167 --> 00:03:00.101
the superior colliculus
will pay attention

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:03.602
for the spider dropping
out of the ceiling

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:07.685
and scaring the crap out of you.

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.975
From the superior colliculus
if it is activated,

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.975
then the reflex occurs and
all that motor stuff happens.

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.975
There are no motor pathways
on this image right now,

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.518
so who, I mean,

00:03:20.542 --> 00:03:23.975
from the thalamus there could be
motor things that are happening.

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:27.059
But if the thalamus
decides worthy,

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:32.975
let's send it to the occipital
lobe back here where okay,

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.976
let's think
about what we're seeing.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.727
Let's think about how great
this lecture on the sight is,

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.560
on the sight, whatever.

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:44.518
Is there anything
else you need to know?

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:48.810
I don't think so.
Does that fill in a whole bunch

00:03:48.834 --> 00:03:51.727
of really interesting
blanks for you?

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:54.975
It totally
does for me All right,

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:59.143
so that is, we're done.

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:02.643
And now you can get really
excited about doing,

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.185
mapping pathways,

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.935
all sorts of stimuli,
all sorts of responses.

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.018
Let's see what happens with
them, but that's not tonight,

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.209
that's the next lecture.
Bye-bye.
