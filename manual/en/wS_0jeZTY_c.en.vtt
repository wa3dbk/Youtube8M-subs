00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.620
That’s right, six.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:18.530
I could’ve done five, but then I’d feel
bad about leaving one out, and it’s not

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.650
the time of the year to feel bad!

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.651
It’s the time of the year to reflect and
appreciate another orbit about the sun, and

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:35.559
what effect this had on video games.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:42.120
Or I’m just going to yammer about a half-dozen
titles that stuck with me, in my mind and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.679
in my various gaming platforms.

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.140
That reminds me of a particularly long-winded
anecdote…

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.550
… Awright, awright, I’ll go right into
the games!

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.780
Coming in at… wait.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.069
There should be a title here.

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.679
No, a REAL title.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.160
Much better.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.290
Kicking off the list is Phoenix Wright Ace
Attorney Dual Destinies, the glorious return

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.540
of everyone’s favorite legal eagle, his
squawking sidekick, and this new chick.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.580
It’d been five years and change since our
last proper appointment with the Wright Anything

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.420
Agency, and folks like me were chomping at
the bit.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.210
While the game itself is only available as
a download, it’s not for lack of effort

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.590
or quality; the courtroom antics make full
use of the 3DS’s capabilities with dynamic

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.970
animations and an upgrade to what was already
a fantastic musical score.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.470
Five cases in total tell the tale of this
newcomer, Athena, and her weird super-hearing/emotion

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.200
detection abilities, which seems weird until
you consider that the established standard

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.410
for this series is using a spiritually-attuned
piece of jewelry to see spectral chains about

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.410
a witness’ psyche.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.410
I’ve no objections.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.140
And if that wasn’t enough, you can tack
on DLC cases, feeding your craving for jurisprudence

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.140
bit by bit.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.470
Oh, and spiffy costumes.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:03.200
Speaking of spiffy costumes…

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.420
Ten years ago, this game doesn’t make it
to the states.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420
Heck, five or three years ago, it doesn’t.

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.040
But Sega asked the fans if the support was
there for an honest-to-Yamaha Western release

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.129
of Hatsune Miku: Project Diva capital-F. (As
opposed to the lowercase-f version for the

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.999
Vita that was apparently a bridge too far.)

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.099
Looking back on it, it barely makes sense.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.470
Japanese music games have been over in this
country for some time; heck, domestic music

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.470
games have even taken a nose-dive, with Rock
Band Blitz being one of the lone attempts

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.480
to revive the segment.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.110
And then this brightly-colored, auto-tuned,
dress-up monstrosity made landfall, packing

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.840
a tracklist no one but the true twin-tail
diehards could recognize… and proceeded

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.129
to kick the asses of any doubters down one
side of the street and up the other.

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.120
To paraphrase the dude from Ghostbusters,
I’ve played every rhythm-and-music game

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.389
known to man, but this beats me.

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.230
It’s part Elite Beat agents, part Gitaroo
Man, part scripting language, and mostly a

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.700
task to convince your friends that it needs
to be taken seriously.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.400
Honestly, this might be the hardest music
game I’ve ever played.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.440
And then they’ll point to the strange Diva
Room mode where you give gifts to, and poke,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.760
and generally harass the vocaloid of your
choice.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.709
Yeah, that part’s a bit creepy, but I don’t
even notice it anymore because my eyes are

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.180
bleeding from the thrashing Extreme difficulty
gave me.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.469
Speaking of bleeding…

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:30.569
I’d use more footage from The Typing of…
oh, ****. THE TYPING OF THE DEAD: OVERKILL

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.950
if I wasn’t scared I’d have to go in and
clean up the footage so as to avoid offending

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.180
the delicate sensibilities of the interwebs.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.519
Typing of the Dead don’t give a ****. Typing
of the Dead is here to improve your touch-typing

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.150
by offering negative reinforcement.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.760
Specifically, that if you can’t pound out
these words quickly enough, you’re going

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.340
to be mauled, mangled, and eaten alive by
hordes of shambling undead.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.340
Delicious.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.930
It’s all presented as a series of gritty
grindhouse flicks, complete with film scratches

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.109
and dust and loading screens presented as
“intermission” reels - like a Quentin

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.079
Tarantino wet dream, really.

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.419
Just with… typing.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:10.110
It’s never actually explained, or even depicted
in any way like the Dreamcast original did

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.950
with the strange backpacks and oversized Duracells.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.129
It’s a little disappointing, but I don’t
care.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.160
It’s new Typing of the Dead, complete with
multiplayer modes and… heh.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.980
Kinda lost my train of thought there.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.090
Anyway, I’m gonna go… over there… and
I’ll be back later with the top three of

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.270
2013, as voted on by me, myself, and… heh…

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:40.979
I’m gonna go now.
