00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.940
Now I'm going to discuss the materials you'll
need to create your Japanese Boxwood planting.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:15.230
First of all, you're going to need the Boxwood,
itself. The Boxwood comes in one gallon, five

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:23.169
gallon or fifteen gallon containers. You choose
the size Boxwood you're going to need, whether

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:32.900
you're going to create a diminutive hedge,
the partier or if you're going to create topiaries.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.940
You're going to want to select the mulch you
use very carefully. It's going to create a

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.989
decorative cover which really offsets and
highlights your Boxwood and it will also accent

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:53.980
your landscaping. I like to use wood bark.
Here we have a smaller wood bark, or they

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.660
have larger size wood bark, but another great
choice is decorative rocks. You can get pea

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:11.050
gravel, or a larger smooth polish river rocks,
or you can use a multi-color, like decorative

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.720
gravel. You're also going to need to purchase
some garden soil from your home improvement

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:27.420
center. You can use top soil or garden soil,
or here we have a soil amendment. You want

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.370
to really examine the soil that you're starting
out with in your garden and use the soil that

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:41.820
you plant the boxwood into as a really, like
a wonderful thing that the boxwood is going

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.520
to grow in and flourish, until the roots spread
out. When the roots spread out, they will

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.380
penetrate into the soil that you already have
and the soil will serve to anchor the plant

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.400
into your landscaping. So, these are all the
materials you're going to need to grow Japanese

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.420
Boxwood.
