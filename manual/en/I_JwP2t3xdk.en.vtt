00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.505
- [Voiceover] Assembly of the
transducer shield is simple

00:00:34.505 --> 00:00:36.905 position:63%
but requires care to avoid contamination

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.655
of the sterile field.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.655
The sterile practitioner
then removes the sterile kit

00:00:56.655 --> 00:01:00.271
from the pouch and places
it on the sterile field.

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:03.938
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:01:04.903 --> 00:01:06.842 position:61%
The assistant applies a pea-size volume

00:01:06.842 --> 00:01:10.259 position:64%
of ultrasound gel to the transducer face.

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:32.889 position:63%
Visually confirm that the protective cap

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:35.927
is properly positioned
over the needle guide.

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:37.959
The assistant lowers the transducer

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.287
into the bottom half of
the transducer shield

00:01:40.287 --> 00:01:42.759
until it is fully seated.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.625 position:63%
Care must be used to avoid contaminating

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:47.375
the practitioner's sterile gloves.

00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:50.449
The protective cap is removed
by the non-sterile assistant

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:55.118
using care to avoid touching
the sterile bottom shield.

00:01:55.118 --> 00:01:57.155 position:64%
The practitioner then slides the top half

00:01:57.155 --> 00:01:59.705
of the sterile shield
down over the transducer

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:02.289 position:56%
and snaps it in place simultaneously

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.482 position:56%
in the front and rear of the shield.

00:02:05.482 --> 00:02:06.881
There should be audible clicks

00:02:06.881 --> 00:02:09.201
from both the front and
the rear snap closures

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:12.252
when the two halves lock together.

00:02:12.252 --> 00:02:14.604
The snap closures at the
front and rear of the shield

00:02:14.604 --> 00:02:16.681 position:58%
should be checked visually to confirm

00:02:16.681 --> 00:02:21.118
complete shield closure
around the transducer.

00:02:21.118 --> 00:02:23.876
To install the cable
sleeve, the assistant holds

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:26.367 position:64%
the transducer by the cable and lowers it

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:29.158
into the cable sleeve being
held by the practitioner

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:33.169
until it reaches the
distal end of the sleeve.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.836
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.112 position:61%
At this point, the sterile practitioner

00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:56.456
grasps the transducer and
secures the sterile sleeve

00:02:56.456 --> 00:02:59.542
to the shield with an elastic band.

00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:03.209
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:13.555
Gently pull on the sleeve
until the elastic band

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:15.257
is snug against the flange

00:03:15.257 --> 00:03:17.875
of the transducer shield assembly.

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:20.269
Insertion of the needle
into the needle guide

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.436
is facilitated by resting the
magnet on the magnet rail.

00:03:25.335 --> 00:03:26.806 position:63%
Place the magnet against the magnet rail

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:29.685
to stabilize the needle assembly.

00:03:29.685 --> 00:03:32.174
Align the needle tip with
the needle guide orifice

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:35.225 position:59%
and advance the needle into the guide.

00:03:35.225 --> 00:03:38.892
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:47.998
As a final check before
use, the practitioner passes

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:49.713
the needle through the needle guide

00:03:49.713 --> 00:03:52.513
and observes when the needle
tip starts to protrude

00:03:52.513 --> 00:03:55.617 position:64%
from the bottom of the transducer shield.

00:03:55.617 --> 00:03:57.851
At this point, the image
of the virtual needle

00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.103 position:64%
should be seen just entering the very top

00:04:00.103 --> 00:04:02.449
of the ultrasound field.

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:06.127 position:66%
This step confirms calibration is correct.

00:04:06.127 --> 00:04:07.702
Depending upon which hand is used

00:04:07.702 --> 00:04:09.990
to advance the needle
during the procedure,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.094
it may be necessary to toggle
the left right orientation

00:04:13.094 --> 00:04:15.830
of the ultrasound image.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.151
If the needle is advanced
with the left hand,

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.662 position:56%
the virtual needle should enter from

00:04:19.662 --> 00:04:22.846 position:59%
the left side of the ultrasound image.

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:25.030
If the needle is advanced
from the right hand,

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.673
the virtual needle should enter

00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:30.340
from the right side of
the ultrasound image.

00:04:37.987 --> 00:04:39.999
Finally, the practitioner
slides the needle

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.695
slowly forward and backward
through the needle guide

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:46.807
and observes the virtual
needle on the sonogram.

00:04:46.807 --> 00:04:48.888
The motion of the virtual
needle should mirror

00:04:48.888 --> 00:04:51.734
the motion of the actual needle.

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:53.863
The needle is then withdrawn
after these tracking

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:56.886
verifications and placed
in the sterile field

00:04:56.886 --> 00:05:00.386 position:66%
until utilized in the following procedure.

00:05:03.292 --> 00:05:06.292 position:56%
If any of these system checks fails.
