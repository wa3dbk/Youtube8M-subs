[♪techno music playing♪]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[gun firing]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is the Army Today.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Military Police test their limits during a 3-day exercise.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Sergeant Monique Sapp was there.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
[soldier grunting]

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a 200-pound tire. The inmates have barricaded a door,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
something you need to breach, and you need to use your physical strength and stamina

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to push those items out of the way.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We give them the scenario that this field scenario is a facility riot.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let's go!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Low crawls, which would simulate visibility issues.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You might have prisoners that set fires where you might need to get low,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but we still have to secure those prisoners--custody and control of those inmates.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay.  You're moving him through an obstacle within a confinement facility,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
replicating a riot control situation, all right?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
One of the obstacles we have set up is a camouflage netting,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and it's kind of low where they actually have to come up with some kind of plan

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to get that casualty through that obstacle without further damaging that casualty.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This station is called the ORDR, which is Observation Report, Disciplinary Report.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What they do is they watch a video of a simulated situation that we created inside the jail,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and they have to decide what happened and write down specifically on the paperwork--

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
make it accurately and what they feel happens,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and that simulates stuff we do on an everyday basis.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Stop.  Put your pencils down.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[whistle blowing]

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We've got young sergeants, we've got senior specialists that are soon to be sergeants,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and these are the guys that are going to be the future of the Army,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we're trying to push them and open up a little bit of parameters

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and let them make their decisions now

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because how I feel is it's better to sweat out here on the courses than to bleed in the battle.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[♪techno music playing♪] That's the Army Today from Soldiers Radio and Television, Washington.
