00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.290
Let’s talk about water.  Water is something you cannot live without.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:13.430
When you’re out in the wilderness, any surface water that you can find you 
 have to consider that as a water source but you cannot just go drinking surface water. 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.610
All surface water must be purified.  And there’s three techniques that you could use.  

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.550
You could either boil, iodine tablets, or some type of filtration device.  Okay?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.020
What we’re going to do right now is use iodine tablets. 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:36.920
Now, to make all this work, you’re going to have to have a bottle of iodine 
 tablets and some type of a water bottle that you can put your water in.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.890
For this source of water – clear water – I would only use one tablet per quart.  

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.750
For cloudy water I would use two tablets.  So I went ahead and dropped out two tablets.  Okay?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.680
There’s my iodine.  I’m going to secure them right here for now. 
 And I’m going to use some type of a cloth when I get ready to fill this canteen up. 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.630
Now, basically, if you can find a fast-moving source of water that would be better. 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.990
There’s less sediment, less floaties in there, but if you’re going to fall in and get wet, use this source. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.930
Right now, we’re going to keep the floaties out of our canteen. 
 That’s any type of bug larvae or anything like that.  

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:37.270
You just go ahead and put this cloth on the top, keep it as tight as you can, 
 and reach off – this is far as I can get – reach off into this source here and let it fill up.  

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:47.350
All right.  Now I’m going to secure my two iodine tablets.  

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.690
A day like today it’ll require about 30 minutes for these tablets to purify this water.  

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.170
Freezing cold day - take an entire hour, okay, using iodine.  

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.630
Just going to give it a little wakeup shake.  

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.550
Now, something to consider once that time has elapsed is dipping 
 this canteen into this source contaminated the threads.  Okay? 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.470
So, when you put your mouth on there, you could still possibly get sick.  All right? 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.970
So I’m going to show you a technique how to decontaminate the threads of your canteen.  

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:29.920
And all that’s required, once the time is passed for this, you 
 just loosen this up, just kind of loosely hold it over the top and shake it, 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.890
and allow that iodine-flavored water to get all over the threads of that canteen.  

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.500
And then just screw that top back down, wait for possibly 
 another five minutes, and then you’ll have safe water to drink.
