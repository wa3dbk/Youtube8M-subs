00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:20.199
in the late 19th century and early 20th century
many santa parades and thanksgiving parades

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.169
were sponsored by department stores

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:26.779
Macy's thanksgiving day parade ring any bells?

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.130
Department stores would use these parades
for big advertising on christmas sales.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.480
it became an unwritten rule that christmas
sale advertising was that day and forward.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.460
in other words, the day after thanksgiving
became the first official holiday shopping

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.460
day

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.320
this actually made some department stores
mad. in 1939 retail shops wanted to have their

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.190
advertising done before thanksgiving.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.930
This led president Franklin D. Roosevelt to
change thanksgiving day to a week earlier.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.580
Some refused this change, resulting thanksgiving
being celebrated on two separate days.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.310
Some referred to the change as Franksgiving.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.471
The term "black friday" goes back to 1966
when it was used by Philadelphia police department

00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:21.560
to describe the huge crowds and the massive
traffic jams.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.980
Quite a headache for them.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.680
It had a negative meaning until the early
1980's.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.420
Throughout the year, retailers traditionally
operated at a financial loss. and made their

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.880
profit during the holiday season, starting
on Black Friday.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.660
On the financial records, red ink meant a
loss.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.830
and black ink, meant a profit.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.700
Black friday under this theory would mean,
more black ink, more profit.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.520
In 2006 a man at best buy was recording assaulting
another shopper.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.880
In 2008 a crowd of 2000 shoppers in new york
outside of walmart broke the doors down and

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.200
killed an employee

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.560
In 2010 in Madison wicsonsin, a woman was
arrested outside of toys r' us for cutting

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.840
in line and threatening to shoot other shoppers
who objected.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:20.190
in 2011 at porter ranch california, walmart,
a woman used pepper spray causing minor injuries

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.599
to ten different people to get an advantage
in line for an xbox 360.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.900
In 2012, Tallahassee, Florida.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.080
two people were shot outside of walmart over
a dispute for a parking spot.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.739
I suggest shopping online to avoid injury.
