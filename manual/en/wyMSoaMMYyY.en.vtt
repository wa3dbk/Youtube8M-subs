00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.990
Hey guys, here's a little update video...  

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.860
...um, to show you what we've been working on since our first trailer release... 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.180
...which was a couple weeks ago, now. 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.970
Uh, first of all, thanks for all the comments on the game. 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.180
Um, we're glad you're all excited for it, 'cause we are too. 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.990
Um, so, since then, we've moved on from Sweet Apple Acres... 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.920
...and we're hard at work on our next track in the game, which is Whitetail Woods. 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.770
Since Sweet Apple Acres was our first track in the game, it was a pretty big learning experience for us. 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.850
Um... so we've learned a lot now about we've done wrong, and how to improve it for next time. 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.590
So for starters, Whitetail Woods will be a lot longer, and it will have a lot more interesting features... 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.910
...um, such as sharp turns, jumps and they'll be more spread out throughout the tracks, so they don't take you by surprise. 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.540
There'll also be a big mountain in the middle of the track, which will help block off most of the track so you don't have any situations where we're trying to render the whole track at... 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.750
...any one time which is a problem we have on Sweet Apple Acres and it causes a lot of performance issues. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.620
As you'll have seen from the last few pictures, our concept artists have also been busy making ideas for the track. 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:03.070
While we do use the show itself as a reference, of course, we do have to bend things a bit to make them suitable for racing and forming in 3D. 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:10.920
Once the track design is finalized, we'll begin modelling it, but until then our modellers haven't had much to do, so they've been working on some other things as well. 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.360
Some of them have been working on simple props for Whitetail Woods, which we'll be able to use, but most of them aren't finished yet, but here's some pictures of them anyway. 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.780
One thing we have been spending time on is background ponies. 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.350
Since people will be asking if their favorite background pony waifu is in the game, and since background ponies seem to show up for every little event in Ponyville...  

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.610
...it would only make sense that they'd want to watch the races. 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.510
Because so many of them are recolors, it's also pretty easy to mass produce them as we need. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.310
We'll keep adding more hairstyles over time too, so we can do more characters. 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.700
At the moment, they can only do a few different things, so, here's a little animation of them standing around. 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.600
As you can see, they have a couple little animations they go through. 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.840
Here's some of them sitting on... sitting on a stand. 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.070
And, finally, here's some pegasus flying around. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.210
As you can see from this little demonstration, too, they will, uh, look at the kart as well, which is pretty cool. 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.390
See, they follow it quite nicely. 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.870
They'll do a lot more interesting things later when we're finished with them too. 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.020
We've been doing a bit more work on Sweet Apple Acres too, to make it a look a bit more interesting. 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.710
So, here you can see we have a nice little waving flag here. 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.430
We've also been adding some more sounds to the game, too, so we have a nice kart sound, now.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.370
As well as some really nice, uh, ambient sound effects for things like rivers and birds. 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.860
So, that's about it for now. 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.440
Don't forget to, uh, keep an eye on our website which is ponykart.net for any future updates. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.290
We'll try and do these fairly regularly for you guys to try and let you know what's going on.
