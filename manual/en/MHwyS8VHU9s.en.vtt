Hi, Joe Glavin with Philadelphia Floor Store.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.500
Philadelphia Floor teamed with Rubio Monocoat 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.480
for an information and training session

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.220
on the Rubio Monocoat system.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:27.413
Alan Nery, the East coast representative for Rubio Monocoat,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.018
was present to answer questions and demonstrate the product.

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:35.615
More than 40 wood professionals attended the free event

00:00:35.764 --> 00:00:38.884
at our Conshohocken, Pennsylvania showroom.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.280
Attendees worked directly with Alan Nery to apply the designer European finish.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.720
Contractors got to see first-hand 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.046
how the all-natural penetrating oil-based system protects and colors the wood

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:54.966
in a single coat.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.680
From pretreatment applications like Rubio Smoke and Rubio Fume

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.800
along with colored oil like cotton white:

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.280
a single coat application of a hardening oil.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.000
Attendees were also shown the two-part pure oil

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
and its application on maple.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.560
Applications of Rubio Monocoat's stain system

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.197
under their colored oil line

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:43.040
shows how easy it is to apply to a northern hard maple floor.

00:01:47.572 --> 00:01:50.852
Ease of application and an uncomplicated system

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:55.379
makes Rubio Monocoat a great addition to the Philadelphia Floor Store line

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.699
of European hardening oils,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.840
making jobsite duplication of designer floors a reality.

00:02:07.142 --> 00:02:10.982
