Hi this is Dara O’Rourke from GoodGuide.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.140
It is officially spring which means it is
time to think about spring cleaning.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.740
Which for us means figuring out what’s inside
these chemicals that we bring inside our house

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.570
everyday, which can contribute unfortunately
to indoor air pollution and some of which

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.290
can be poisonous and can be unhealthful for
you and even your pets.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.140
So we want to know what’s in some of these
chemicals that we are bringing in, using,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.820
spraying around our house, and how they rate
and how they perform.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.260
So we want to find out today how some green
cleaners actually perform, so we looked at

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.550
three green cleaners to see the ratings and
their performance.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.040
Lets start with Seventh Generation which is
one of our top-rated cleaners on GoodGuide

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.430
which gets a 7.9 out of 10, with a health
score of 8.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.290
Has done a really good job on ingredient disclosure
and on getting the worst chemicals out of

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.290
their products.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.130
So, we’ve got a little spill here, we just
finished lunch at GoodGuide.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.140
Let’s do it, clean it up.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.330
This is a free and clear, no scent.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.870
So we still have the scent of our Tabasco,
but it did a good job of cleaning it right

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.870
up.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.450
The second is Safeway’s entry into the green
cleaning space, called Bright Green.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.170
This one unfortunately has a score of5.3 out
of 10 with a health score of 4.0.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.970
This product doesn’t disclose it’s real
ingredient list.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.040
We give what we call a PG-13 list, basically
generic terms like surfactants, organic acids,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.590
essential oils, rather than telling us the
actual chemicals that make up the actual product.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.020
Let’s see how it does, though.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.680
So, spray it on here.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.920
Seems like it did an OK job of cleaning, not
as good as the Seventh Gen.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.689
But a nice Lemony smell.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.510
The problem is with the smell, we don’t
know the chemical giving it the smell except

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:46.670
saying essential oils.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.550
So that’s our Bright Green.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.700
The third is Clorox’s entry into this green
cleaning space, Greenworks, they’ve made

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.100
a big investment in green cleaning products.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.240
This one actually scores a 7.5 total, out
of 10 with a 10 on health.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.960
Primarily because they’ve disclosed all
ingredients, they’ve been certified by the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.910
US EPA’s Design For Environment program
and they’ve done a great job of getting

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.580
high quality natural ingredients in their
products.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.959
This one also did a nice job cleaning, no
scent really for that product.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.070
So we see all three did a pretty good job
our spill here, with a range of levels of

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.070
chemicals.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.950
So when you go to pick your products this
season, first of all you should think about

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.069
making sure you know what’s in them make
sure you see the ingredients either on the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.819
package or on the website, bring your GoodGuide
iPhone app.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.870
Scan these products and see how they do.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.330
You can also obviously make your own cleaners,
simple products around your house, I just

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.470
unclogged my drain with baking soda and vinegar.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.530
Really cool science experiment.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.640
Cleaning the drain without any toxic chemicals.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:59.670
So there are lots of ways to clean up messes
like we saw today, without using toxic chemicals

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.110
and kind of solving your cleaning problems
in a green healthy safe way.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.629
So have a good spring cleaning and check out
