Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Oreo
Cookie Pop Tutorial where I'll be showing

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:16.590
you how to make these really cute and very
effective and very easy Oreo cookie pops.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.790
You can personalize this to suit any occasion
with just the use of a bit of fondant and

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.410
a shaped cookie cutter.
Tools and equipment that we will be using

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.360
today:
I have a piece of polystyrene which I used

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.090
to stick all of the pops into while I'm working
on them and when they're finished. If you

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.260
don't have polystyrene, you can also get some
flower foam from your local florist.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.550
I have a sharp knife.
I have just a paintbrush from an art supply

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.079
store, quite a fine tip on it. But we're just
going to use this for a little bit of a white

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.239
chocolate works. So if you don't have a paintbrush,
you can use a cocktail stick or a skewer.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.230
I have a fondant roller which I'm going to
roll out some fondant.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:00.930
I have fondant in just two different colors.
Obviously you can choose which colors you

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.609
would like depending on your theme and your
design.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.970
I have a spoon.
Some lollipop sticks.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.890
I have my trustee cornflour shaker which is
just a cappuccino chocolate shaker filled

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.229
with cornflour. That's for my fondant so that
it doesn't stick to the mat as I'm rolling

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.360
it.
I have a few Oreo cookies.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.390
I have some melted white chocolate. You don't
need very much melted white chocolate. I've

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.320
got, maybe, 10 white chocolate melts in there,
not a lot at all.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.659
And I've just a couple of cookie cutters.
Today I've decided to go with a star and a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.799
butterfly. But as I mentioned, you can use
any cookie cutters that you have around the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.020
house or you can purchase to suit your theme.
Let's get started.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.500
First of all, we're going to split our Oreo
cookie. Now when you split the Oreo cookie

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.280
-- this is what your sharp knife is for -- bear
in mind that you want to be quite gentle with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.719
it because it does have a tendency to snap
one side. So when I split the cookie, I take

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.820
the knife and instead of putting it on one
side or the other of the cream inside the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.750
cookie, I put it directly in the center of
the cream. So I'm actually cutting into the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.261
cream, and then I support the cookie with
my hand, being very careful. You can see there,

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:16.230
it just slid of the top. So you can see my
knife is actually in the cream rather than

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.890
on top of the cream. I've just found for me
this works a little bit better and I don't

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.720
have so any instances of a snap cookie. Make
sure that you do have a few spare Oreo cookies

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.390
and you're not relying on the exact number
that you've got because I can almost guarantee

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.450
you will break one or two.
I'm going to do 2 different cookies today

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.580
so we'll sit out another one that I've pre-cut.
Now, first things first is we're going to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.069
out our lollipop sticks into the Oreos and
let them set. So I'm going to take my lollipop

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.069
stick and I'm just going to push it gently
into that cream. You can see there I've just

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.280
pushed it... Don't push too hard because once
again, you don't want to crack the cookie

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.950
on the underside. You just want to sit it
in there a little bit. Once again...here we

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.950
go.
Alright, now to make sure that really sticks

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.250
in there nicely and doesn't fall off, we're
going to take a little bit of our melted white

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.230
chocolate, just about that much on a teaspoon,
and I'm just going to put a blob in the center

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.830
there. Don't put too much because, bear in
mind, when you stick the other cookie on top,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.400
it is going to squish that white chocolate
out. And we don't actually want the white

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.069
chocolate to pump over the outside of the
cookie. We want it to stay inside so it still

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.330
looks like a nice perfect Oreo.
So I'm just going to take my other side of

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:42.470
my Oreo cookie and place it on top. And then
again with this one.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:50.260
So you can see there, as I squeeze it on,
you can see that chocolate spreading out a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.770
little bit in there. But that's actually going
to set nice and hard so that lollipop stick

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.551
is not going to go anywhere. We'll pop those
over here to set.

00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.200
I'll be working on our little fondant shapes.
Now with the fondant, as I've mentioned, I've

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.379
got my cornflour shaker. So I'm just going
to shake out just a little bit of cornflour,

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.159
just enough to provide a little bit of, I
suppose, a sprinkle on the board which we'll

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.680
provide a non-stick surface.
I'm going to start with just a little bit

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.889
of yellow fondant. And I'm just going to...
actually, no. I'm going to start with the

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:32.550
green.
I'm going to start with just a little bit

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:41.190
of green fondant. And I'm just going to roll
that out...with my cornflour. Now with fondant,

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.669
if you don't have a fondant roller, you can
use a standard roller. But a fondant roller

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.530
will just be a little bit easier to roll with
and it's not as likely to stick with the fondant.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.490
It's not an exact thickness for this. It doesn't
really matter.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:05.050
I'll hold mine up. About that thick is good.
So for this one, I'm going to do the butterfly.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.310
I'm going to take my butterfly cutter. I'm
going to place it into the fondant. Now before

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.220
I take it out of the fondant, I'm just going
to run it back and forth. And then before

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.720
I take it out of the cutter, I just want to
neaten up those ages because we really want

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:32.120
a nice neat finish for our cookie pops.
Do that again. And once again, neaten up our

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.880
edges. Beautiful! And then pop that butterfly
out.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.360
Okay, now for our cookie pops, we're going
to take our fondant. We're going to take to

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.620
the backside of the fondant, so the rough
side. This is where my paintbrush comes in.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.320
I'm going to take my paintbrush and just dip
it in to this bit of white chocolate. The

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.840
white chocolate is essentially going to act
as a glue for us here. So I don't want to

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.770
put too much on again because, once again,
we don't want that white chocolate coming

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.960
out to the sides of your fondant decoration
and making a mess on the outside of your cookie.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.530
So you see I've just put a few little dabs
on the edges, I supposed, of the fondant piece.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.780
And now, I'm just going to stick that on to
the Oreo cookie. Beautiful.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:26.890
Turn that over in the palm of your hand. This
is where it gets a little bit crowder on the

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:33.270
hand. And we'll do that again with our other
fondant piece. You can rest your Oreo cookie

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.850
down on the bench but just make sure you've
got a really clean bench because your fondant

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:44.020
will pick up any Oreo crumbs or anything else,
and you do risk dirty-ing your beautiful butterfly.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:51.300
Lovely.
So there you have a gorgeous butterfly Oreo

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.069
cookie pop. You can make that in any color
with any cookie cutter for absolutely any

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:01.139
event or occasion you like. We've some love
heart ones. We've got some little duck ones,

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.379
little [friends] for baby showers. These are
great if you're doing lollie buffets or if

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:09.741
you want to theme a party or also fantastic
if you want to give a bonbonniere or some

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:14.610
treats to go with your party.
