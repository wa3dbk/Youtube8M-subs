00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:08.550
Now we're going to go through the steps involved
printing our block. Making sure that we move

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.040
away from the slab, we don't want any extra
ink on our paper. What we need to do is line

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:24.060
our paper up to the block, and this is relatively
easy. Placing one edge, we can say that this

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.400
is about the halfway point here. Again, the
smooth side is the side that we want to print

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.929
on. So there's a halfway point, and here's
a halfway point. And I've made these references,

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:48.359
and just gently set the paper down. Once I've
set the paper down on the block, I never want

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:55.120
to let go. So, I always want to have one hand
on the surface at all times, because we don't

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:05.280
want this to move. Then, taking a wooden spoon,
working much like we did with the brayer across

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.071
the surface, starting at one corner and working
our way around, and rubbing over the surface

00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:21.941
of the paper, applying equal pressure and
not a whole lot of force, to rip the surface

00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:29.170
of the paper, but enough that you can actually
see the ink coming off the block through the

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:39.180
paper itself. And again, I'm working left
to right, making sure I go over the entire

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:53.680
surface, and never letting go. Applying equal
pressure the best I can.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:06.260
You may also want to go to the edges and define
those edges, so you can see the entire wood

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:24.389
block. And then continue across the surface.
If your arm is getting tired, you're doing

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:43.480
this right. I'm almost through with the whole
surface. I essentially never let go, and I've

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:51.319
always kept the spoon moving across the surface
of the paper. I can actually see my image,

00:02:51.319 --> 00:03:04.480
as well. So, once I have the whole thing printed,
what I like to do is go ahead and rotate it,

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.280
and then double back, by going all the way
over the whole surface a little bit faster

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:36.959
than I did before. This will guarantee a nice,
even print. So now we're ready to remove the

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:51.680
paper. Very carefully, lifting the paper,
preferably grabbing two corners to not drag

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:05.719
it across the surface, we then lift it off.
And here we have our proof. We can see the

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:10.709
surface of the wood. We can see those curvy,
linear lines. We can also see the hatching

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.299
and the other marks that we've made on the
surface with the screwdriver.
