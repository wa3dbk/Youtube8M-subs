Hi, I am Chitropola Mukherjee speaking on
behalf of Expert Village, and I am from India.

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:14.769
I am today going to show you some other aspects
of clay sculpture. It's various uses for doing

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:21.760
things in the garden. Here I have a pillar.
A pillar made with different tiles which have

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:28.970
been put together and then with marble, we
have done the corners. And then we have little

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:38.370
bits and pieces so that it fits in very well
in the environment of the garden. And it looks

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.260
very nice because of the natural plants coming
down from top. It looks like it belongs, like

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.989
a tree or a flowers and trees that we have
around here. It seems almost like if is another

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:04.519
tree. Now here we have another much more simple,
a simpler pillar in the garden also. We have

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.640
these pots different size pots, which were
there. And in between we have these other

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.710
smallest...small pots to give them a height.
We've used green and earth color which completely

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.560
blends with the surroundings. And these little
bits and pieces that we have added to it are

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:39.219
also very decorative and nice and makes it
a a very gay kind of piece. And then we also

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:47.560
have here the same method of using natural
plants to grow on the soil. We put these plants

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.099
and they're growing and some more will be
put here. It looks like an organic sculpture

00:01:53.099 --> 00:02:00.069
and not as an intrusion. But as very much
a part of the garden. Thank You
