Hi! My name is Paige and you can visit my
website at www.porchproductions.net. Today,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.080
we’re discussing different elements with
mini DV camcorder. Right now, we’re going

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.900
to talk about sound, which is a huge issue.
In general, you’re doing a point and shoot

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.490
sound when you just buy a mini DV camcorder
and are using it professionally. The best

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.179
thing I can say to tell you about capturing
the sound is to get as close to the subject

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.590
to who is talking as possible. I shoot with
a Panasonic DV X100. Well this is Panasonic

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.580
DV X100 and it has a left and right surround
sound, so like a left speaker and a right

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.480
speaker. You can hear in your left ear and
your right ear. In this model, it’s not

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.500
great sound. If you’re spending for about
under $1200 a camcorder, you’re not going

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.780
to have wonderful sound, but it’s okay.
I want to get as close to my subject as possible

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.950
to hear it. Now, in order to hear what my
subject is talking about and what the camcorder

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.329
hears, you want to get a pair of really good
headphones. You can have small headphones

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.869
but you want to be able to block out your
other sound that’s going round, and be able

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.009
to concentrate on your DV. This the best way
to direct sound, is to actually put on a pair

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.880
of headphones so that you can hear what your
camcorder is hearing and then direct your

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.710
camcorder in a way that will create better
sound. So, here in the back, and it’s different

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.539
for different camcorders. Mine is back here.
It simply says phones and that’s where I

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:53.499
plug in my headphones. On the Sony and I believe
on the Canon as well, it’s here around this

00:01:53.499 --> 00:02:02.520
area above your XLR input so your mini input
for your sound if you were using a microphone.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.690
So, I’m going to plug in my phones right
here, put on my headphones, and I can hear

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.760
what’s going on. Make sure your camera is
on camera, or else it’s going to be in VCR

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.430
mode. When your camera is in VCR mode, it
acts as a VCR and not at all like a camera.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.190
So, you want to make sure it’s on camera.
I can hear myself right now. If the levels

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:38.210
are actually too loud or too quiet, I can
adjust the level of what I hear. This is not

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.330
adjusting what the camcorder hears, but what
I hear. So, if I want to hear myself better

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.100
I can turn up these channel 1 and channel
2 audio.
