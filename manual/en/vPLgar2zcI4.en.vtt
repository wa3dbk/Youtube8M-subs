Hey, guys.

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.670
So yesterday was Thanksgiving, and the day before that, I went to the market to go buy a turkey because I like market turkeys better

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.729
than homemade anyway and partially also because I was too lazy to cook, oh, and also, I don't know how to cook.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.100
But anyway, as I was at the checkout counter checking out my turkey...

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.480
Wow, really? No one this time? All right.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.469
That's what she said!

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.420
Really?

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.449
She said it. So you know...

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:31.619
Anyway, as I was checking out, minding my own business, this old lady comes up behind me and feels the need to preach to me.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.619
And your total is 21.50.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:34.510
Oh.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.860
Having a Thanksgiving dinner?

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.080
Oh yeah, it's for tomorrow. How about you?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.100
I'm vegan, so...

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.169
Yeah, I just don't really believe in the whole slaughtering animals thing. I mean, really, you should think about it.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.200
There are a lot of documentaries online that you can watch, and it is just disgusting.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.660
I mean, what gives a person the right to decide whether an animal's life...

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.649
And at that exact moment, right then, right there...

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.180
That's when I realized this cashier did not even have my back. He didn't say one word.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.329
Thanksgiving is just sick, immoral, and wrong.

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.548
Yeah, no, I-- yeah, no, I'm probably still gonna get this turkey, so...

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.109
Okay, so maybe I didn't say that last part to her, but I think vegans are awesome.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.739
They don't eat anything that has to do with animals, which actually saves a lot of animals...

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.559
For the rest of us. Even though I can't stand when people try to force their beliefs unto other people, that old vegan lady

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.860
kind of had a point, and it's kind of messed up to say out loud, but when I think about it,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.439
I actually don't value an animal's life as much as a human.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.739
I mean, I love my dog, but if there was a r-- stop! Not anymore!

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.159
I mean, I love my dog so much, but if there was a car

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.029
that's about to hit a person and a dog, I'd probably push the person out of the way instead.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.449
But if I did that, I'd probably get hit by the car too, and that would suck.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.200
I mean,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.899
I'd probably just do the logical thing, and as the car drives by, I

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.390
jump into the moving car's window, force the driver's foot down on the brake till it comes to a complete stop, grab the cell phone

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.390
he's texting on, toss it outside, shift it into reverse,

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.159
run the phone over, pull out my arsenic, inject him in the neck, shove the body outside of the car, put it back into drive,

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.578
and steer it away from the man and just hit the dog so that I could save his life.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.718
And then I'd probably have to run him over as well because he just witnessed me kill a guy and run over a dog just

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.290
to save his life.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.609
But the point is I would save the man's life over the dog and then have to kill him.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.848
As I was saying, I always saw myself as like an animal lover,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.289
but I guess I never realized how little society actually values their lives compared to ours. Think about it. If a human kills another human, he

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.110
ends up in jail. If an animal were to even harm a human, it wouldn't go to jail.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.909
We'd probably kill it. In fact, most of our pets that we love the most are pretty much already in jail. Take dogs for example.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:29.079
We lock them up so they don't run away. They only eat when we tell them to. And if you have two dogs,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.250
I mean, they might not be in a shower.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.809
But there's always that one dog that likes to hump the other one. Even people who love animals the most like

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.149
zookeepers, if you think about it in an animal's perspective, they're pretty much just a warden of a big jail that profits off of their prisoners.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.849
So overall, I guess what I'm really trying to say is I

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.229
get it now. And to the vegan lady standing behind me in the market, thank you.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.399
Thank you for helping me open my eyes and realize that animals really are

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.549
a lot less important than I thought.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.660
