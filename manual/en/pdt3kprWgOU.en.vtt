00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.340
37-year-old Anton Chris all ski

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.220
is a Russian TV host that came out live
on air

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.440
he said quote on gay and I'm just the
same person as you mind your audience

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.519
as President Putin as prime minister
Medvedev and the deputies OVR do Mar

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.490
and in russia this is absolutely

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.279
unheard of I mean the government just
passed this absurd

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.019
anti-gay law just flat-out bans being
pro-gay

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.720
you can write about you can talk about
it you can't protest for it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.200
anything and 75 percent the Russian
population

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.780
doesn't approve of gay people so this is
an incredibly hostile environment

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.120
and when Anton did this he was
immediately fired

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.129
and the Russian TV channel scrub the
segment

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.570
from a their website and also from other
parts of the internet as well

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.210
well now Anton is finally speaking out

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.710

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
why why would you do that come outside
openly

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.020
in Russia on television is some
conclusions some biggest

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.220
biggest somebody should visit because
somebody should do it in

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.600

after that I was fired read this

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.560
ride the nights I was fired by

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.380
SMS CNN and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.600
any evidence over what you did well as

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.950
entirely deleted from the internet
apparently right

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.750
I correct in saying that as if it never
have for of course

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.189
we did not do you think that a kremlin
direction

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.689
arm

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.119
know perhaps maybe yeah I think he's a
hero

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.579
ask yourself the question would you

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.280
lose your livelihood possibly your
friends

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.310
risk physical injury there's a lot of
violence

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.379
against gays in russia to do that

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.250
I don't know if I could and I'm not
proud to say that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.739
but I mean that takes that takes

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.640
a whole lot of 42 that say some a strong
personality

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.260
and a strong will and however many years

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.700
down the road if slash when Russia
finally advances on the issue of gay

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.300
rights

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.379
this guy right here he deserves a
mention in the history books

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.569
it takes a lot to stand up to a
government and a country

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:45.849
that he is your very existence
