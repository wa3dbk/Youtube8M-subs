00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.900
We've jointed, planed, marked the profiles,
cut them out, and sanded them.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.280
Now for putting it together.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.929
We'll start off with fitting out one stretcher
and leg.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.429
Pilot drill and counter sink.

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.730
Set your screws so that the tips are just
protruding through the stretcher.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.700
It just ensures that you get your pilot holes
lined up right on target.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:42.820
Apply the glue
And then drive your screws home.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:54.960
There's no need to clamp it up as the screws
will hold it together while the glue is drying.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.670
Having cleaned off the squeeze out we'll clamp
the legs together.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.299
Because the legs create a roughly four inch
space between the stretchers we need to pack

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:21.020
out the rare end of the stretchers before
we clamp them together in order to keep them

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.920
square.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.159
Checking for square.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:02:34.760
Looking good.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.080
We'll clamp some stock to hold the leg assemblies
in place while we fit the front seat brace.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:48.480
That's 
the top pilot hole.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.480
Drive the screw home and repeat for the other
side.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.230
Now that the piece is lined up we can add
the countersink.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:10.220
And we'll just have the screw protrude slightly
to make refitting the piece easier once the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:45.530
glue's applied.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:04:50.590
Now we'll clamp and square up the arm brackets
ready for pilot drilling.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.500
Now for the seat slats.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:06.790
We'll use a piece of scrap lumber for the
spacing here.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:20.630
We'll just put them in with one screw now,
because we'll have to remove them again later.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:35.390
We use the expanding clamp to square up the
seat base.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.430
To finish off we use the spacer, a seat slat,
then the lower seat back brace.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.880
We'll mark the position of the lower seat
back brace.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.660
Then we'll fit it on one screw.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:06:03.960
Now to remove the rearmost three seat slats.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.390
Finally we'll set the arms on a single screw
ready to set the back angle.

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.740
And that will leave us ready for the final
assembly
