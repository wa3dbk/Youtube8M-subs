For Expert Village, I'm EJ John Erickson with
Vital Flame Productions and thank you for

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.160
joining us on our sessions focusing on the
baritone saxophone. Okay, on this session,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.950
we're going to actually start to move our
fingers around since we know where to place

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.840
them. And just a quick, I mean this is definitely
a quick start, I do recommend going out and

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.480
getting yourself a fingering chart, getting
yourself a beginner's book. That's where you

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.269
start, there's several on the market, go ahead
and research one those to get some music going.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.500
It'll walk you through what I'm going to give
you in an encapsulated cell here. So, if you

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.949
can think about it from when you used to play
recorder in elementary school, where you had

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.219
your three fingers on top and your three on
the bottom, that's essentially the same configuration

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.789
that you're going to have with your Bari.
It's the same three and three. So we're going

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.769
to start simply, with everything open, that's
a C-sharp on a baritone sax, and we're going

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:59.499
to just start doing long tones. This is what
you're going to do for your warm ups. I'll

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:03.309
stop now, but you'll want to keep going for
as long as you possibly can and then put your

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.130
first finger down for a B and do the same
thing, long tones. Big breath, big air, long

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:20.869
tone. And so on, which is an A, two fingers
down is an A. G. So there's your first four

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:28.560
notes. Now you can start making music out
of those four notes if you wanted to. Do that

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.939
whole song with two fingers. Okay, now the
next thing you want to do for warm ups is

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.719
octaves. This is critical. And what you're
doing is you're taking, we'll start on a B

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.850
which is the first finger, and all we're doing
is adding the octave key. And if you can think

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.090
of your air stream as blowing louder to the
octave, again long notes, but loud to the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:02:06.539
octave. So. And you'll just want to keep doing
octaves. And again, take a long time. I was

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.709
doing those rather quickly, but take a long
time to focus your embouchure, focus your

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:17.909
air and think into those octaves. And that's
how you get warmed up. That's with your breath

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.480
and with the horn. Now we can talk about fingers,
how to warm them up.
