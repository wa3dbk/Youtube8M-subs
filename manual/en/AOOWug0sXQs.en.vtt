00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:18.619
For the 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.520
most part, games don’t really die.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.990
There are always ROM images somewhere, fighting
the decay of optical media.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.870
Outside of some of the earlier examples of
broadcast gaming - think the SatellaView and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:32.130
the Sega Channel - the memories of your past
are still around.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.610
You might just have to dig harder for them.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.739
(Or lay out a pile of money on a rare tactical
RPG and a Saturn to play it on, BUT I’M

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:39.739
FINE WITH THAT.)

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.020
So it might not be that much of a shock to
say that “Intellivision Lives!,” because

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.900
it never really stopped living.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.600
The difference today is that it lives on the
DS, perhaps the one system most capable of

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.239
emulating that iconic number-pad controller
paddle... thing.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:04.720
Well, aside from the Jaguar, but the less
time spent talking about that thing, the better.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.760
Intellivision Lives! - well, this version
of Intellivision Lives!, released 11 years

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.940
after the first PC compilation - brings together
60-ish games from the venerable beast, though

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.760
a number of these are multiplayer-only offerings.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.520
Fortunately, this DS version supports single-cart
multiplayer through the DS Download service.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.220
The navigation menus discard all of the pizza-parlor
antics of previous incarnations: you’ve

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.460
just got a controller, and you use that to
choose a game.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.460
Simple.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420
Once in the game, the second screen turns
into whatever overlay you’d stick on the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.640
number-pad portion of the paddle, and is used
in tandem with some assortment of the D-pad

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
and buttons.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.770
I say “Some assortment” because you can’t
really tell without consulting the manual,

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.390
which is rather distractingly broken up between
the top and bottom screens in a font that

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.360
does no one any favors.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.890
I realize the DS wouldn’t be able to handle,
say, scans from the original game manuals

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.520
as were offered in Activision Anthology for
the PS2, but this is kind of a pain.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.110
Especially if you’re trying to figure out
the eleven thousand different steps you need

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.740
to manage Bowling effectively.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.050
Oh well.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.720
Astrosmash is, was, and always will be the
same.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.870
So we’ll stick to that for now.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.733
You’re going to get the bigger names in
the Intellivision catalog, you’re going

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:23.390
to get some also-rans, and you’re going
to get some strange outliers like previously-unreleased

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.990
titles (developed in 1990, for crying out
loud) and some of the voice-synthesizer games

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.002
that blew minds back then.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:32.730
But unless you’ve got some deep-seeded memories
that need scratching...

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.781
I don’t think you’ll be too gripped to
put this one down.

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:39.750
The Intellivision was an interesting and unique
beast, but outside of a nostalgia trip, you’re

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.730
probably not going to sink the kind of hours
and days into it like you did in the 80’s.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.460
It’s tough to hold this up to, say, Metroid
Prime Pinball in terms of killing time.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.840
But if you’re of the kind who just absolutely
has to have a shot of Vectron or Space Spartans

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.630
in the morning to function... then this is
the best you’ll be able to do shy of getting

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.190
your hands on the original hardware.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:07.400
I, myself, prefer coffee.
