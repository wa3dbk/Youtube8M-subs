00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.540
lawyers uh... wrote an article about how
the different presidents that george

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.899
bush is compared himself to

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.539
uh... linkedin

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:10.689
truman

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.909
and rake it

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.199
perfectly ready

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.609
really

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:18.499
but the fact that

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:22.849
artifact notified broken bones onto
roosevelt

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:29.189
no no truman if there is any compares
himself to at truman is because

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.140
truman was also had very low popularity
an ever gave up

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.970
and but then history vindicated truman
and george bush in of it lately that has

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.970
been his go tuesday i may be just like
truman and by the rotors got this not

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.970
going to make it up thta quotes of
george bush saying unlike harry truman

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.160
omg huge i my bill by bill and i hope
that uh... where people get all of the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.160
is actually you know it's kinda funny
obviously but at the same time

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.100
i think it's a very significant

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.880
because it really gives you the frame of
mind if reminders very dangerous in this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.900
way

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.700
if you're a person as he says in the
truman quote and therefore leading to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.140
some degree as well races all we're not
really give may be able to tell how that

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.620
my presidency as he says

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.090
untold generations later maybe hundreds
of years ladies like answering george

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.080
washington

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.780
you know there's a re-evaluating his
presidency

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.140
do if you're not george washington okay
then

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.840
and believe me people ready close the
book and record cold glass of water

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.820
you're done okay

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.710
so but the biggest part of that is he
thinks

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.060
it doesn't matter under twenty percent
of library and go to ten percent i go to

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.000
three percent it doesn't matter because
like at couple a hundred years from now

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.130
just see what his genius i've been

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.630
so that means i don't give a damn what
people think i'll give a damn what the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.960
conventional wisdom is or what all that
with the electra says with other

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.490
senators say with the democrats explain
what the republicans say

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.590
one day in and distant does the time in
a distant galaxy they'll see what a

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.540
genius i was and as a dangerous guy
kazakh as a guy who lives in a bubble

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.850
and thinks unabridged you know i i i
don't care what anybody says ahmed you

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.940
what appears to be wrong to everybody
else that you do that do some chance of

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.119
what appears like everybody else

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.599
withdrawal
