00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.417
(regal orchestral music)

00:00:06.157 --> 00:00:08.755
- Hi, I'm Lauren, and this is Brain Stuff.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:09.810
Today's question,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.208
why do most engagement
rings feature diamonds?

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:15.383
Why not emeralds, or pyrite,
or beef jerky nuggets?

00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:17.462
Turns out, you can trace this precious

00:00:17.462 --> 00:00:20.139
tradition back to an ad campaign.

00:00:20.139 --> 00:00:23.758
Before the 1940s, opals,
rubies, sapphires, and turquoise

00:00:23.758 --> 00:00:27.053
were way more popular than
diamonds as engagement stones.

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:31.943
In 1939, only some 10% of US
engagement rings bore diamonds,

00:00:31.943 --> 00:00:33.605
and the jewels being used were smaller

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:36.615
and of much poorer quality
than stones common today.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:38.290
Enter an ad campaign.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.240
In the 1930s, the world's leading

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.880
diamond mining and
trading company, De Beers,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.750
found itself in a tight spot.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.995
De Beers had been in the
business in one form or another

00:00:46.995 --> 00:00:49.968
since just after the discovery, in 1870,

00:00:49.968 --> 00:00:52.938
of huge deposits of
diamonds in South Africa.

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:55.374
Before then, diamonds were truly scarce.

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:58.094
They had to be panned
individually from rivers.

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:00.777
With this new supply
though, De Beers flourished.

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:02.939
Well, it was really the supply

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:06.314
plus careful corporate
consolidation and market control,

00:01:06.314 --> 00:01:08.306
but yes, they flourished.

00:01:08.306 --> 00:01:11.819
That is, until the Great War,
the ensuing Great Depression,

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.370
and the looming promise
of a second world war

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.096
sent the demand for
diamonds into free fall.

00:01:17.096 --> 00:01:20.108
So, in 1938, De Beers hired ad agency

00:01:20.108 --> 00:01:22.138
N. W. Ayer to research the market

00:01:22.138 --> 00:01:24.777
and produce a comprehensive
US ad campaign,

00:01:24.777 --> 00:01:27.380
print, radio, and celebrity publicity.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.493
Print adds compared diamonds to paintings

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:32.665
by Picasso and Dali, unique and precious.

00:01:32.665 --> 00:01:34.574
They commissioned
portraits of famous couples

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:37.866
who had recently gotten
engaged, all sporting diamonds.

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:40.471
In 1947, they launched the famous slogan,

00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:42.171
a diamond is forever.

00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.487
By that time, the number
of diamonds being purchased

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:47.253
for engagement rings in
the US had already tripled.

00:01:47.253 --> 00:01:52.022
It was, and is, a brilliant
campaign, pun intended for once.

00:01:52.022 --> 00:01:54.343
It set up diamonds as a near-indispensable

00:01:54.343 --> 00:01:55.888
part of engagement traditions,

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:58.127
and as heirlooms to be cherished and kept,

00:01:58.127 --> 00:02:00.519
not to be resold back into the market.

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.100
Meaning more diamonds would be bought,

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.055
and almost all of them new.

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:06.540
In the 1960s, De Beers and N. W. Ayers

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.133
began educating the public
about the quality of diamonds,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:11.693
encouraging the purchase
of more expensive jewels,

00:02:11.693 --> 00:02:14.095
and their product placement
continues to this day

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:15.890
as they loan out extravagant pieces

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.935
to Hollywood stars for films
and the red carpet alike.

00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:20.158
Do you own a diamond?

00:02:20.158 --> 00:02:21.496
Maybe a family heirloom?

00:02:21.496 --> 00:02:23.001
Tell me the story in the comments.
