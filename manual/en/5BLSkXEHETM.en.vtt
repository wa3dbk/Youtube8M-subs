00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.021
This is a story about a boy named Billy who
lives on a farm with his father, mother, and

00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:07.200
three sisters in the mountains of northeastern
Oklahoma.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.449
Billy's dream is to own hunting dogs and so
he saves up money for a couple of years.

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:15.099
After saving enough money, he buys the dogs
from a breeder, but has to pick them up in

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.340
a neighboring town.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.689
So he walks through the mountains by himself
to pick up his dogs.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.689
When arriving in the town, Billy is mocked
by the townspeople for being a hillbilly,

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.850
but tries to ignore them, picking up his dogs
and returning home.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.330
Billy names the male dog Old Dan and the female
dog Little Ann.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.280
He trains them to hunt coons and, together,
both dogs make an efficient hunting team.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.820
Old Dan has tenacity and Little Ann has intelligence.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.149
Billy and his hounds begin to make a name
for themselves in the community as talented

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.190
coon hunters.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.290
Two brothers from another farm challenge Billy
and his hounds to try and catch an old coon

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.269
that has tricked every dog who has tried to
catch him.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.170
However, during the chase, one of the two
brothers trips and is killed by an axe.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.839
Later, Billy's Grandpa tells Billy about a
regional coon hunting contest and Billy is

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:02.070
excited to go.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.270
When they get there, Billy sees all types
of hunting dogs.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.830
After Little Ann wins a silver cup for Best
Looking Dog, the coon competition begins.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.520
Billy and his hounds win, even after battling
a harsh winter storm.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.570
When Billy returns home, his family is excited
to see him.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.830
He gives his mother the prize money and shares
the trophies with his sisters.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
One day, however, Old Dan and Little Ann find
a mountain lion.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.460
The mountain lion is aggressive and attacks
the two dogs and Billy.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.880
Eventually, Billy uses his axe to kill the
mountain lion, but his two dogs are hurt.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.170
Old Dan dies from his wounds and Little Ann
gives up the will to live without Old Dan.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.960
In the end, after both of the dogs are buried
near the house, Billy and his family move

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.550
into town and a red fern tree sprouts between
the two dogs' graves.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.880
Although not necessarily a religious story,
Where the Red Fern Grows does at least acknowledge

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.030
the involvement of a Higher Power.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.770
Billy often prays for things to happen and
his prayers are seemingly answered.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.840
However, what is so admirable is that Billy
does not wait idly by.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.500
He is diligent in making things happen for
himself.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.860
And as to why the dogs "had" to die at the
end, as Billy notes, it was all a part of

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.659
a larger plan to keep his family together,
as the family was thinking about leaving Billy

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.270
behind with his dogs and Grandpa while they
moved into the town.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.030
So what does the red fern symbolize?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.879
In the story, the red fern sprouts in between
the two graves of Billy's dogs.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.810
His parents explain that the red fern represents
a sacred placed.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.640
However, this representation goes beyond just
the sacredness of the physical land and comes

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.700
to mark the sacred relationship not only between
each dog, but between Billy and his dogs.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.310
This story explores the dynamics of human
and animal relationships, particularly as

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.310
it relate to pets.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.700
But the dynamic of this relationship is first
expressed through the narration.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.870
The story is told through the human perspective
of an aged Billy, yet readers are still able

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.900
to get into the minds of both Old Dan and
Little Ann.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.890
Through this narration, we come to an understanding
of both dogs and their personalities.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.490
Furthermore, Billy, as the narrator reflects
on whether the human-dog relationship is driven

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.670
by loyalty or love, only to come to the conclusion
that it is love.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.239
The relationship is not built upon a master-servant
model, where one party wields power, like

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.069
food and shelter, over another.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.329
It is a relationship where both parties share
mutual respect for one another.

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.129
And of course, this brings to question, "Why
can't more humans have that type of relationship

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:18.719
with each other?"
