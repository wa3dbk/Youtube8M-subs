00:00:07.118 --> 00:00:10.118
Sound ExChange is a new student run orchestra at Eastman 

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:15.816
and we started this orchestra to make a positive change in the presence of classical music in society.

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:22.268
One problem at traditional classical orchestra concerts, 

00:00:22.268 --> 00:00:25.268
we felt that sometimes there’s a barrier between the audience and the musicians

00:00:33.618 --> 00:00:39.079
For musicians, one of the greatest feelings is actually sitting in the orchestra.

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.079
We love the music we play but there’s a certain energy

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:45.836
that comes along with playing in a group that’s the size of an orchestra 

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.836
so we decided to have the audience sit in the orchestra

00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:52.017
right next to the musicians.

00:00:53.913 --> 00:00:57.260
I think it’s really exciting to have the audience sit in with us

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.429
because if there’s a really loud entrance, we’re going to see their reaction the second that it happens.

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:07.792
they’re seeing us in our bodies that we get tense before solo, 

00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:10.380
they’re seeing our interaction with the conductor.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.550
They’re seeing the work that we do that goes into our art 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
as opposed to just seeing this beautiful picture on the stage, 

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:18.412
which I think makes it more accessible.

00:01:22.116 --> 00:01:23.651
From a musician’s perspective,

00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:28.589
having been in an audience listening to classical music concerts for years

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:30.491
and having sat in a brass section, 

00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:33.491
I know that the energy that comes out a horn bell is something 

00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:35.689
you cannot experience unless you’re right next to it. 

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:41.835
I think something conductors have come to accept

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:46.473
is that what we’re doing looks to many outsiders kind of absurd.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:50.244
The level of emotion and histrionics 

00:01:50.244 --> 00:01:52.849
and yet the control one has to possess

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:03.600
the conductor operates on a couple different levels. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.600
The first is a logistical level

00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:08.964
and for the audience sitting there watching the conductor 

00:02:08.964 --> 00:02:13.399
going through the motions of  bringing people in at the right time and so forth,

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.059
they get a sense of that, but they also get a sense of the intensity 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:20.458
the sort of intangible expression 

00:02:20.458 --> 00:02:23.458
that a conductor can bring to how something is played.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.622
Our hope for these concerts is that audience members 

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:37.826
will hear what we’re playing and it will spark a curiosity

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:40.194
in them to go explore more of the music that we play

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:44.498
the humanities and arts are just a reflection of human thought and emotion 

00:02:44.498 --> 00:02:48.948
and so it’s not that classical music is this elite art form

00:02:48.948 --> 00:02:51.948
that people can’t relate to. I think it can be extremely accessible 

00:02:52.373 --> 00:02:55.357
to everyone and our goal is to present it in a way 

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:58.357
that enables everyone to connect to it.
