Hello? Is this the herb shop? Herb? You in here, buddy?

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.060
Oh Rusty. What are you doing here?

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.960
Professor Tree? I didn't know you are a fan of herb.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.360
Yeah, Uh, my friend Nugget runs this place. We're watching a Pokémon nature documentary in the back.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.240
Ooh can I watch? I haven't seen TV in a while because I sleep in the woods.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.380
I don't know... We only have enough snacks for the 2 of us.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.640
I have 9 Pringles.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.100
This is Rusty. He brought Pringles.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.780
Whatssup Pringles? It's startin' bro.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.960
Pokémon. They're all around us, and yet we know so little about them.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.960
Very little. Mostly just what they look like.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.540
This one, for instance, looks like a human, but it isn't.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.720
Eh! That ain't no human! Get him!

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.260
(Punching)

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.140
Whoa!

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.380
Here we see a rare courtship display between 2 Pokémon.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.400
We'll give the lovers some privacy.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.680
These Pokémon are just birds. What's up with that?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.840
Yeah, what is up with that?

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.040
Here are some Pokémon that were scientifically proven...

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.260
To look dumb.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.140
Wow! I'm learning a lot I think.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.740
We interrupt this program to bring you a special report. Police are currently surrounding the Viridian City gym.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.320
Citizens are advised to avoid the area at all costs.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.280
Oh, Denghis Khan. A gym, that's where badges live. Rusty loves badges! Second badge, here I come!

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.740
He's right in there.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.880
No!

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.820
Not the Pringles!
