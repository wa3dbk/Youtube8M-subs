00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.339
Tanzi: In your brain, there are billions of
nerve cells. And they are making trillions,

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.030
perhaps even in some people a quadrillion
connections. If you then ask, based on how

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.580
many possible connections you can make in
your brain, that number is greater than the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.580
total number of particles in the universe.
That's how amazing your brain is.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.700
Chopra: So Rudy, of course you are an expert
in memory; Alzheimer's disease is a loss of

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:49.320
memory or ability to at least remember things
in the past. I remember you had a conference

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.969
of over 150 neuroscientists, and I called
you on the phone, and I said can you ask your

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.969
scientific colleagues - where is memory stored
at the cellular level or how is memory stored?

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410
And what happened when you asked them that?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.440
Tanzi: It's funny. When I ask neuroscientists
"Where are memories stored?" There's always

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.880
the same response. There's some hand waving.
Say "you know, in your brain." Say "well

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.350
where? Where exactly?" "Well, in the neural
network." "Where?" "In the synapse."

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.930
Wait wait, synapse are two connecting pieces
of a nerve cell. It's protoplasm connected.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.930
As Cajal called it, the "protoplasmic kiss".
Where is the memory? Well it's in there. And

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.880
I say wait, you know that's not an answer
for a scientist, 'it's in there.' I'm asking,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.280
what's the thumb drive in the brain? I mean
we know where we store jpegs and videos from

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.980
our computer; it's on a thumb drive. Where's
the thumb drive in the brain? We know how

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.530
the brain makes connections and synapses to
recall a memory, to call up a memory, to call

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.450
up the image of your mother's face or the
color of a rose. But do we know where that

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.959
image of your mom or the rose was stored?
Where was the thumb drive? And any neuroscientist

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.680
has to admit we don't know. It's conjured
up in the brain but we physically don't know

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.930
where.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.670
Chopra: So this is a very important point.
It's conjured up in the brain but we don't

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.230
know where it is stored at a cellular level.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.620
Tanzi: There's truly no good answer.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.359
Chopra: But all the neuroscientists still
believe that memories in the brain. That it's

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.379
somewhere in the brain. We don't know exactly
where. They believe that it's somewhere in

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.140
the brain, right?

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.439
Tanzi: They believe that memory is imprinted
in the brain the way you imprint a visual

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:36.379
on a computer.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.819
Chopra: But we cannot explain how or where.

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:39.579
Tanzi: No we cannot.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.090
Chopra: Okay so here I'm going to introduce
you to a radically different idea, which comes

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.530
from the east wisdom traditions of Vedanta,
that your memories aren't actually in your

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.280
brain, they're in your soul. They exist
as possibilities. And so just like a particle

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.849
is a wave and a wave is a probability or a
possibility, until you actualize the memory,

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.079
it's just a potential. And you know there's
a Sanskrit word for it, it's called Sanskara.

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:11.810
So where is your vocabulary stored right now?
(You know you have a vocabulary of several

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.950
thousand words. You and I are now downloading
our vocabulary in order to make sense of this

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.999
conversation. Not only we're downloading it,
we're doing it totally effortlessly, and through

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:29.579
intention, and we are sequentially unfolding
ideas. Syntax -- grammar -- so it makes sense

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.749
hopefully. And Vedanta would say that your
entire vocabulary, your entire experience

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:42.749
of life, exists as potential in your soul—and
we can talk where that is—and intention

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.060
activates it. In other words, all the words
that you know as your vocabulary, they exist

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.060
right now in superposition as possibilities
in consciousness. And that you will never

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.169
find memory in the brain because it's not
there.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:04.980
Tanzi: Well I would have to agree that your
brain allows you to recall words, recall pictures,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.980
process them, view them in your mind. But
where those words were stored, where those

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:19.249
visions that you can recall are stored, physically
in the brain, where in the cell—fat, lipid,

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.849
protein—we don't know.
