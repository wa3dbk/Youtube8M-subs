Hi.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.349
My name's Dr. John Fritz, and today I'm going
to talk to you a little bit about fungal toenails.

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.400
Fungal toenails are also called onychomycosis.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.740
Fungal toenails account for one-third of all
the skin infections that occur.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.210
Fungal toenails are responsible for at least
half of nail disease.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.970
It's caused when a fungus infects the nail
matrix, the nail bed, and the nail itself.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.800
It's very difficult to get rid of and can
cause a significant amount of pain.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.650
You may suspect you have a toenail fungus
if you have a yellow nail, a discolored nail,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.930
a nail that has debris underneath it, a nail
that's lifting off or constantly flaking.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.860
The nail itself is quite painful to the touch,
especially when they get thickened, and it's

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.850
quite difficult to cut.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.620
Fungal toenails are typically caused by trauma
to the nail and nail matrix.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.340
A trauma occurs, and the fungus is able to
penetrate the nail and your skin and starts

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.340
to grow.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
Once the fungus is in there, it's very difficult
to eradicate.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.560
Some causes of nail trauma, it's very common
with runners.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.210
It's very common with women who go get pedicures.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.020
Even shoe gear, fungus loves to live in a
warm, moist environment, and there is no more

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.850
perfect place than your shoe.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.690
Wearing shoe gear on a daily basis, especially
tight shoe gear where it pushes on your toenails,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.200
can give you an increased incidence of fungus.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.560
Fungus is more common in women than in men,
and it is also more common as we get older.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.560
The elderly population has a high incidence
of fungus.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.030
Patients with systemic diseases, such as diabetes
and peripheral vascular disease, can also

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.530
get fungus.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.340
Toenails in these patients can be dangerous,
because it's quite difficult to cut.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.150
If a injury occurs, diabetic patients and
people with impaired circulation can have

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.220
problems with healing, and this can lead to
serious complications.
