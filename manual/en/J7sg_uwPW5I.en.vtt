00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.900
Fly fishing is very popular
in Missouri

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.800
but what’s really amazing is how many
of the anglers tie their own flies.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.700
It really is an art.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800
So today,
we’re going to give it a try.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.400
Mark is going to show me how
to tie my very first fly,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
something called a wooly worm.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.900
It’s best to start out getting some
guidance from a book or videotape,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.400
or best of all,
an experienced instructor.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
You’ll also need black thread,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.200
black chenille,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.900
a grizzly saddle hackle,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.900
a red yarn tag,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.900
a hook,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.900
a fly-tying vise,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
a fly-tying thread bobbin,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.500
a half-hitch tool,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.400
and very sharp
and fine-pointed scissors.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.800
Secure the hook into a vise
and apply thread to the hook shank.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Start the wrap just behind the eye
and work towards the bend of the hook.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Loop the thread over
the loose end to secure it

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.600
then work the thread up and over
at a 45-degree angle

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.200
until the shank is covered.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.200
Stop when the thread and bobbin
are directly over the point of the hook. 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.900
All materials will be tied in
at the exact spot

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
on the hook shank that
your last wrap was made.  

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.900
First, tie in a piece
of red yarn for the tail.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Then tie in the grizzly hackle
by the tip

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.200
so that the bulk
of the material

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.100
extends out from
the back of the hook.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.000
Strip the end of the chenille
for about a quarter-inch

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
then tie in that core thread.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.200
Once they are secure with at least
four or five wraps of thread, 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.300
you can cut off the excess. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.900
Now trim the red yarn,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.300
leaving only a quarter-inch of red
yard extending out to form the tail. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.800
Advance the thread toward
the front of the hook

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.700
stopping one hook eye length
behind the hook eye.  

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800
Keep pressure on the thread so
nothing has a chance to loosen.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
Take the loose end
of the chenille

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and begin to make wraps
around the hook shank 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.900
advancing toward the hook eye
until you reach the thread.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.900
Switch hands.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.200
Hold the chenille in place and make two wraps behind the chenille.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.000
Switch hands again and make two
in front right next to the chenille.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.500
Repeat this procedure
with the hackle,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.600
but leave spaces
between each wrap.  

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.200
This is called “palmering.”  

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.800
When you reach the thread,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.900
secure the hackle just
as you did the chenille.  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Make a few extra wrap
in front of the hackle 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.800
behind the eye of the hook

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.500
and use scissors to trim off
excess hackle and chenille.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.900
Use a half-hitch tool
or an old ink pen

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.400
to make at least five half-hitch knots
behind the eye of the hook

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.700
then cut off the excess thread.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.900
Coat the thread behind the hook
eye with fly-tying head cement

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
or clear fingernail polish to keep
the knots from unraveling.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.500
And there you have it,
my first tied fly.  

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.000
Doesn’t look too bad,
does it?

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.300
Just wait ‘til you see me
trying to use a fly rod!
