00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.639
Behind every great meal,

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.329
there's a story.

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.410
And behind every great recipe,

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.569
there is a journey.

00:00:19.569 --> 00:00:26.569
Behind the Recipe.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.840
My grandmother, in the
depression,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.090
had five children, and not a lot
of income, so she had to get

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.870
up very early in the morning
and make loaves of bread,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.850
and rolls, to sell, so she could
supplement the income.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.210
and keep the family going.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.680
There are four girls in the family, so they
would switch off, although my mother was

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.140
the youngest, and the other girls
would have been a little older at the time.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.650
So, probably most of the ownness
fell on my mom. I just know it wasn't easy.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.740
I totally remember growing up
that my mother would make

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.820
huge batches of bread
a couple times in the winter,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.800
and we had put away jam
during the summer.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.020
And so she would make 10 or 12 loaves
of bread, and we'd deliver them to

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.030
 the neighbors, with, you know, hot.
They were still hot out of the oven,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.229
with a jar of jam. And that was, kind of,
one of my fondest childhood memories.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.750
I learned by watching my mother.
Baking bread in our family was an

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.979
all day affair.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.100
Uh... she would start it early in the
morning, in the afternoon, you know,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.420
she would form it and put it into
the pans, and put it in the oven.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.950
So, basically we have this
wonderful yeasty smell

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.620
in your home for the whole day.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.659
She'd always make clover leaf rolls.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.380
So there was like three little rolls,
within a roll.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.089
I never had anything but
clover leaf rolls.

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.379
I love bread. I love both to make bread,
I love to watch it grow, I think it's alive.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.850
I think it's, you know, this wonderful thing
that you can't really see in any other

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.990
baked good. Or, anything else you cook,
for that matter. You can actually, you know,

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.039
watch this product be alive, and grow.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.859
Which is, you know, fascinating to me.

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.979
I've got people asking me recently,
you know, what would be the one thing

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:31.919
you couldn't get along without,
as far as food goes,

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:35.749
and I think bread is probably it.
Bread is necessary, and it did

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.209
help my family at a time when
they needed help,

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.620
and it certainly gone full circle
with me.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.020
I make my living making bread.
