00:00:29.422 --> 00:00:33.319
We want to say that this dog's right, and the rights of many animals in Egypt

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:46.213
Need the implementation of laws and article 45, meaning that when a parliament discusses a law it is implemented not shelved

00:00:48.148 --> 00:01:00.101
The animal rights law has existed for so long, it penalises people with fines and jail, but nothing is ever implemented

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:07.687
I don't want people to tell me that this is not happening even with humans, this too has to be the case

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:18.426
In my opinion, there should be police to protect animal rights

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:23.255
Even the British used to do that when they were colonising Egypt

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:28.705
We wish that Max's right doesn't go in vain, because we know that the laws that will be implemented are not strong

00:01:28.843 --> 00:01:37.708
6 months jail and a trivial fine is nonsense, This is a soul that was tortured before it was killed

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.705
After i saw this accident, the video was very strong i felt i had to do something

00:01:49.084 --> 00:01:51.266
At least to come here and say 'Enough with blood'

00:01:52.136 --> 00:02:03.348
I think the law needs to be strict, if you only give a three or four months sentence it is no big deal

00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:06.272
If the law is strict everyone would abide by it

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.432
There is a very important point, this dog didn't die only because it was a dog that attacked a butcher and in response he killed him

00:02:14.911 --> 00:02:19.255
It could have been a kid that threw a rock at that butcher and he would have killed him too, like those who threw kids from rooftops

00:02:19.385 --> 00:02:23.531
The principle of overtly killing itself in such manner has created a disfigured young generation

00:02:24.202 --> 00:02:30.916
It's now very easy for any kid to hold a knife and kill his friend's dog or his friend's brother

00:02:32.076 --> 00:02:39.044
The sight of blood is no longer shocking, all of us including children have become familiar with it

00:02:39.468 --> 00:02:51.162
There needs to be a strict law to make it clear that if you kill a soul, whether it is a dog or a man, it won't pass by a month in jail

00:02:51.573 --> 00:02:59.608
What happened with Max wasn't easy, it will continue to happen if we remain silent

00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:09.190
It's unjust to happen to a dog that did nothing but protect its owner, who eventually betrayed it

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:18.577
There is no healthy balanced society without having rights for both man and animals

00:03:19.257 --> 00:03:26.873
We need the implementation and the improvement of the laws
