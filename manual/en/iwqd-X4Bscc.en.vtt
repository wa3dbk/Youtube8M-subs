00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.490
you're supposed to try m

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.029
i don't understand and still get it as i don't
see how this is and an entertaining and just

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.100
think it's stupid well first of all q washer
pretty going out because i don't

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.660
know the answers

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.680
amnesty for that we try to go advocates computer
you know it's going to win

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.190
want

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.650
the computer did get some stuff wrong and
it sent a lot of funny things when i got several

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.270
you would get stuff like crazy wrong sometimes
like you know

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.980
but he would say like you know

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.630
you know if you like it up with a popular
web show hosted by j q her and uh... computer

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.170
would answer it if it's a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.060
what he is wednesday

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.850
inoperative bigger would get that totally
goofy wrong uh...

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.650
but it did win and it answer really quickly
like size you get the feeling the guys two

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.470
down compete gested buzzing about ice-t_ i
think it's not fair well they had a system

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.920
where actually had to hit the button had to
be hit

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.960
but it was going to quickly so

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.050
and that's it so i think it was unfair

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.190
bob because they clearly you somebody answers
uh... but the ideal was what can we it was

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.400
the idea wasn't that we've just been decided
just to win on jeopardy

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.720
apparently designed it

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.670
to show what computers can do what kind of
information we can give these computers

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.560
and how we can change the way

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.229
they think

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.940
i look at might mean for the future but that
might mean for progress not but that might

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.490
mean for game shows

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.070
i think i guess and comfortable with computers
came to start

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.720

i live now by an elf reflected back at the
fed endowed experiments that mca

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.190
pretty screwed by the way the computer wasn't
that thing in the middle

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.550
that was sort of standard for the computer
risk our lives of the rule legitimate lesterr

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.629
