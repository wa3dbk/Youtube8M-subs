Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:11.808
We have already made potato chips
by frying them immediately,

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.662
this time let's prepare them by
frying after drying in the sun.

00:00:16.008 --> 00:00:20.620
Ingredients required:

00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:23.925
Potato - 5

One piece phitkari (alum) as big as a chickpes grain. powder it.

00:00:29.824 --> 00:00:36.110
First we will peel and cut them into chips.

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:43.113
We have already readied the potatoes by washing and drying them.

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:59.172
If you are making lots of chips then we will put chips into water as if kept in open might turn dark in color.

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:11.141
The potatoes are peeled now, let's cut them into chips.

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:17.663
You can use chips cutter or food preocessor for slicing the chips.

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:20.578
We are using food processor for cutting the potatoes.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:37.752
The chips are cut into chips, now lets put them into water.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:42.552
We must take enough water to immerse the chips completely.

00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:49.440
We will add powdered phitkari (alum) into the water.

00:01:55.086 --> 00:01:59.586
By additon of phitkari potato chips remain white in color.

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.101
Let's add the chips to the water.

00:02:12.263 --> 00:02:17.485
Well keep the chips in this water for water around 2 hours.

00:02:26.896 --> 00:02:34.272
We have cooked the chips in the phitklari water for 2-3 hours, now we will wash them.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:41.718
take the chips out of the water and wash them with fresh water.

00:03:05.707 --> 00:03:07.691
Now we will boil them.

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:12.433
Take enough water to immerse the chips completely.

00:03:12.794 --> 00:03:13.794
Turn on the flame.

00:03:18.705 --> 00:03:27.852
Keep the chips aside in wateruntil water on the flame starts to boil.

00:03:31.786 --> 00:03:34.794
Put the chips in boiling water.

00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.753
Cover the chips and let them boil.

00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:42.622
Lets check the chips.

00:03:43.148 --> 00:03:54.893
We will try pressing them a littlem if they get pressed then th echips are boiled.

00:03:55.336 --> 00:03:57.852
It took 8 minutes for the chips to boil.

00:03:58.267 --> 00:04:00.744
Now take the chips out of the water.

00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:19.332
Put little oil on a plate and grease it.

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.387
Put chips on th eplate one by one.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.705
Dry them in sulight for 1-2 days.

00:05:06.878 --> 00:05:13.596
The dried chips are ready, now we can fry them in hot oil.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:35.190
To fry chips oil should neither be too hot or too cold, just hot enough to boil them.

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:45.842
If the chips become reddish in color after frying, its due the variety of potatoes choosen.

00:05:46.133 --> 00:05:48.927
The chips made from sweet potato ofetn turn red.

00:05:52.299 --> 00:06:01.931
Put little salt in the chips, and if you want them spicy put some red chilly powder.

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:04.730
The chips are ready to eat.

00:06:07.735 --> 00:06:16.130
Fry them and eat them any time you want.

00:06:24.896 --> 00:06:34.672
You can store potato chips in container for a year after they are dried completely.
