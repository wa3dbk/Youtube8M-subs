Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.330
[pause]

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.950
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.950
Regardless of your age, there are three essential
skincare products that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.980
everybody should use every day: a sunscreen,
an exfoliant, and an

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.179
antioxidants. But your skin also has different
needs in terms of care

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.899
depending on your age, and in this series
of DermTV episodes, I’ll discuss

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.349
specific decades related issues relevant to
healthier, more beautiful and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.100
younger looking skin. So in your twenties,
the issues that are most

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
important to you are first, prevention of
premature photoaging from sun

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.129
damage… Second, exfoliation to help control
and prevent breakouts, and to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.980
keep your skin looking bright and lustrous…
And third, starting a

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.030
preemptive defense against fine lines and
wrinkles which are coming in your

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.570
mid to late thirties. Preventing premature
photoaging and damage is easy

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.140
and by now should just be part of your basic
daily skincare routine: you

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.820
should be using sunscreen every day, rain
or shine, and a topical

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.000
antioxidant product every night. Your sunscreen
obviously protects from

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.030
direct ultraviolet damage, and your antioxidant
helps protect against

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.560
damage from both naturally occurring free
radicals inside your skin cells,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.159
and also the ones that come from the sun’s
direct ultraviolet rays… which

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.530
somehow just got passed or around your sunscreen.
Next, your glycolic

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.590
exfoliant will help to prevent and if needed,
control acne breakouts… It

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.740
also helps prevent the accumulation of excess
dead cells with extra pigment

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.880
which create brown-spots… And of course,
glycolics help keep your

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.979
complexion bright and radiant. And last, the
best way to prevent the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.759
emergence of fine lines in your 30’s, besides
preventing more damage by

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.299
regularly using sunscreens and antioxidants,
is by starting to use peptide

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.619
products. They rev up your fibroblasts, which
are your cells that make your

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.950
collagen. So as collagen depletion starts
to occur in your next decade,

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.679
you’ll have your collagen building cells
already online producing

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.300
additional replacement collagen so it’s
there when you need it. Using

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.450
peptide-containing products every night will
help ensure timely collagen

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.830
building in your skin. And if your cheeks
are dry or feel tight, there is

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.940
no harm is using a water-based moisturizer
in your 20’s to help hydrate and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.190
even the texture of your skin. So there you
have it for skin care in your

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.130
twenties.And in the next episode on Skincare
by the Decades, I’ll tell you

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:48.730
about your specifics skincare needs of your
30’s.
