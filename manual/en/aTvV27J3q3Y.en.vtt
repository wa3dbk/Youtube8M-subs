00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:03.767
- WELCOME TO A LESSON ON THE 
NUMBER OF ROUTES AND CIRCUITS

00:00:03.767 --> 00:00:06.267
OF A COMPLETE GRAPH.

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:07.600
A COMPLETE GRAPH IS A GRAPH

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.733
IN WHICH EVERY VERTEX IS 
CONNECTED TO EVERY OTHER VERTEX.

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:14.767
HERE'S AN EXAMPLE 
OF SEVERAL COMPLETE GRAPHS.

00:00:14.767 --> 00:00:16.200
LOOKING AT THE NOTATION,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.767
THE SUB SCRIPTS REPRESENT 
THE NUMBER OF VERTICES

00:00:19.767 --> 00:00:24.933
AND THE NUMBER AFTER THE COLON 
REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF EDGES.

00:00:24.933 --> 00:00:27.933
SUPPOSE WE HAD A COMPLETE GRAPH 
OF FIVE VERTICES

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.033
LIKE THE AIR TRAVEL GRAPH BELOW

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.100
WHICH WE SAW 
IN A PREVIOUS LESSON.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.233
HOW MANY ROUTES 
VISIT EACH CITY ONCE?

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.900
WELL IF WE START AT HOME 
WHICH IS SEATTLE,

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.367
NOTICE HOW THERE ARE 
FOUR CHOICES OR FOUR CITIES

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:42.267
WE CAN VISIT.

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:46.500
L.A., CHICAGO, ATLANTA 
AND DALLAS.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.600
SO WHEN DETERMINING 
THE NUMBER OF ROUTES,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.100
WE'RE GOING TO FIND A PRODUCT

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.233
WHERE THE FIRST FACTOR 
IN THIS CASE WOULD BE FOUR.

00:00:54.233 --> 00:01:00.140
NOTICE ONCE WE MAKE A SELECTION, 
AS AN EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY L.A.,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.573
NOTICE HOW NOW THERE ARE 
THREE CHOICES.

00:01:02.573 --> 00:01:06.540
IN THIS CASE, CHICAGO, ATLANTA 
OR DALLAS.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.740
BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE CHOICES,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.073
THE NEXT FACTOR IS GOING TO BE 
THREE.

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:13.173
AND NOW LET'S JUST SAY 
AS AN EXAMPLE WE SELECT CHICAGO

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.607
WHICH WOULD MAKE THAT 
SECOND SELECTION.

00:01:15.607 --> 00:01:17.440
NOTICE HOW NOW THERE ARE 
TWO CHOICES,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.307
IN THIS CASE ATLANTA OR DALLAS

00:01:20.307 --> 00:01:23.540
WHICH GIVES US 
THIS FACTOR OF TWO.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.073
AFTER WE MAKE OUR THIRD CHOICE,

00:01:25.073 --> 00:01:28.240
THIS WILL SAY ATLANTA 
AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.773
NOTICE HOW THERE'S 
ONE REMAINING CHOICE,

00:01:30.773 --> 00:01:32.373
IN THIS CASE DALLAS

00:01:32.373 --> 00:01:35.173
WHICH GIVES US 
THIS LAST FACTOR OF ONE.

00:01:35.173 --> 00:01:41.040
SO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ROUTES 
IS EQUAL TO 4 x 3 x 2 x 1

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.107
OR 24 ROUTES.

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:46.907
ANOTHER WAY TO EXPRESS THIS 
PRODUCT IS FOUR FACTORIAL

00:01:46.907 --> 00:01:50.507
WHICH AGAIN MEANS 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:57.907
FOR EXAMPLE FIVE FACTORIAL 
WOULD BE 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.

00:01:57.907 --> 00:02:00.413
NOW IF WE WANTED TO LIST ALL 
THE ROUTES TO VISIT EACH CITY

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:03.580
WE COULD MAKE A TREE DIAGRAM 
PICTURE HERE.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.213
THE NICE THING ABOUT DOING THIS 
IS WE CAN SEE ALL 24 ROUTES.

00:02:07.213 --> 00:02:09.247
THE ONE ROUTE THAT WE USE 
AS AN EXAMPLE

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:11.613
WAS IF WE START AT SEATTLE,

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:15.447
NOTICE HOW WE HAVE FOUR CHOICES.

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:18.013
SO IF WE SELECT FOR EXAMPLE 
L.A.,

00:02:18.013 --> 00:02:21.713
NOTICE HOW FROM L.A. 
THERE ARE THREE CHOICES.

00:02:21.713 --> 00:02:24.680
SO IF WE SELECT CHICAGO,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.580
NOTICE HOW THERE ARE TWO 
REMAINING CHOICES

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.813
AND IF WE SELECT ATLANTA,

00:02:29.813 --> 00:02:35.180
NOTICE HOW THERE'S ONLY 
ONE CHOICE LEFT WHICH IS DALLAS.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.513
SO AGAIN AS A TREE 
WE CAN SEE ALL 24 ROUTES.

00:02:38.513 --> 00:02:40.747
BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE 
CONCERNED ABOUT CIRCUITS

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:42.213
SO TO FORM CIRCUITS,

00:02:42.213 --> 00:02:46.180
WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO RETURN BACK 
TO THE HOME CITY OF SEATTLE.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.347
WHEN WE CONVERT ROUTES TO 
CIRCUITS, WE DO HAVE REPETITION.

00:02:50.347 --> 00:02:53.947
HALF OF THE CIRCUITS WILL BE 
DUPLICATES IN THE REVERSE ORDER.

00:02:53.947 --> 00:02:56.647
SO WE'LL HAVE TO DIVIDE 
THE NUMBER OF ROUTES BY 2

00:02:56.647 --> 00:03:00.387
TO DETERMINE THE NUMBER 
OF CIRCUITS IN A COMPLETE GRAPH.

00:03:00.387 --> 00:03:03.487
SO IF WE HAVE -- VERTICES 
IN A COMPLETE GRAPH,

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:08.220
THERE WILL BE N - 1 FACTORIAL 
ROUTES

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.453
BUT WHEN FORMING CIRCUITS

00:03:09.453 --> 00:03:12.153
HALF OF THESE ARE DUPLICATES 
IN REVERSE ORDER

00:03:12.153 --> 00:03:14.687
SO THEY'LL BE N - 1 FACTORIAL

00:03:14.687 --> 00:03:18.653
DIVIDED BY 2 UNIQUE 
HAMILTONIAN CIRCUITS.

00:03:18.653 --> 00:03:22.453
FOR EXAMPLE, THE CIRCUIT 
"A," B, C, D, E, "A"

00:03:22.453 --> 00:03:26.387
WOULD BE THE SAME CIRCUIT 
IN REVERSE ORDER

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:30.153
AS "A," E, D, C, B, "A."

00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:33.320
AND AGAIN JUST TO REVIEW THIS 
EXCLAMATION SYMBOL,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.487
IS RED FACTORIAL AND IN -- FOR 
THE PRODUCTS SEEN HERE BELOW.

00:03:39.487 --> 00:03:41.720
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT AN EXAMPLE.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.487
HOW MANY ROUTES IN HAMILTONIAN 
CIRCUITS WITH A COMPLETE GRAPH

00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:49.887
WITH SEVEN VERTICES HAVE.

00:03:49.887 --> 00:03:52.820
NOTICE HOW THE COMPLETE GRAPH 
IS PROVIDED FOR US.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.987
NOTICE HOW AS THE NUMBER 
OF VERTICES INCREASES,

00:03:55.987 --> 00:04:00.493
TO COUNT THEM ONE AT A TIME 
WOULD BE VERY TIME CONSUMING.

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:05.527
SO THE NUMBER OF ROUTES WOULD BE 
N - 1 FACTORIAL

00:04:05.527 --> 00:04:08.627
OR IN THIS CASE, N = 7.

00:04:08.627 --> 00:04:11.227
WELL 7 - 1 = 6.

00:04:11.227 --> 00:04:15.060
SO THE NUMBER OF ROUTES WOULD BE 
SIX FACTORIAL

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.393
WHICH WOULD BE 
6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1.

00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:32.527
SO BY HAND 6 x 5 IS 30, x 4 IS 
120 x 3 IS 360 x 2 WOULD BE 720.

00:04:32.527 --> 00:04:37.960
SO THERE ARE 720 POSSIBLE ROUTES 
VISITING ALL THE VERTICES.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.027
ON THE CALCULATOR 
WE CAN JUST ENTER 6

00:04:41.027 --> 00:04:44.693
AND THEN MATH ARROW OVER 
TO PROBABILITY,

00:04:44.693 --> 00:04:47.027
ONE, TWO THREE RIGHT ARROWS.

00:04:47.027 --> 00:04:53.193
OPTION FOUR IS THE FACTORIAL 
OPTION AND ENTER.

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:58.193
AND THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF 
CIRCUITS OR HAMILTONIAN CIRCUITS

00:04:58.193 --> 00:05:01.800
WOULD BE N - 1 FACTORIAL 
DIVIDED BY 2

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.533
OR 6 FACTORIAL DIVIDED BY 2

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:11.267
WHICH WOULD BE 720 DIVIDED BY 2 
OR 360.

00:05:11.267 --> 00:05:13.100
AND IN OUR STUDY 
OF GRAPH THEORY,

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.100
WE'RE GOING TO BE MORE CONCERNED 
ABOUT HAMILTONIAN CIRCUITS

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.800
RATHER THAN ROUTES.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.700
AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THIS TABLE,

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.267
NUMBER OF CIRCUITS IS GROWING 
EXTREMELY QUICKLY

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:25.433
AS THE NUMBER OF CITIES 
OR VERTICES INCREASE.

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:28.600
IF THE COMPUTER LOOKED AT 
ONE BILLION CIRCUITS A SECOND,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.067
IT WOULD TAKE ALMOST TWO YEARS

00:05:30.067 --> 00:05:34.567
TO EXAMINE ALL THE POSSIBLE 
CIRCUITS WITH ONLY 20 CITIES.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.600
CERTAINLY THE BRUTE FORCE 
ALGORITHM

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.900
FOR LISTING ALL THE POSSIBLE 
CIRCUITS OUT

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.100
IS NOT AN EFFICIENT ALGORITHM.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.733
I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
