All right guys!! This is Guido, from FTO, and today I'm gonna teach you to do the next panna.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.520
All right. We need to do the next for this trick here: put the body to the opponent this way, as inother videos,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:39.440
and move the ball away to get it shielded up. We need to hide the ball up of him. He's trying to look at the ball.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.400
He may be able to have a look of the ball at some moments, but may not at some others. We need to try

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.920
he doesn't know where the ball is in most of the times. Hide up the ball with your body and move hopping

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.740
backward as roll the ball. You can notice he will follow me on with his legs open. We need to check his legs

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.360
to look for the right moment for the panna. It's very important the ball is hidden all the time, behind your

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.580
you non-dominant foot. At hopping, the ball must be away and behind the leg, so the opponent doesn't have

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.860
eye contact with.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.740
The thing here is lifting the non-dominant foot when you're gonna do the panna. So the ball goes from

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.140
being hidden, to roll out quicly, and the opponent barelly get known of this. So, what we have to do for the panna,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.920
hopping, to create some space in so the ball can go between his legs. This way here: hopping and rolling.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.620
All right. Hope you all had liked, this trick. Try to apply it on the field. This is a panna trick I never miss.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.020
Tell me if you could do every other panna. See you all in the next tricks.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.020
