00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.101
TO YOU BY TIM HORTONS.

00:00:05.504 --> 00:00:06.973
&gt;&gt; HERE COMES ALFREDSSON...

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.976
GIVES IT TO KUBA, KUBA MOVES
IT BACK TO THE HIGH SLOT,

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:13.480
ALFREDSSON SENDS IT ACROSS,
SCORES, MIKE FISHER!

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:22.755
&gt;&gt; THIS SEASON, MIKE FISHER
GOT OFF TO A SLOW START,

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.525
FAILING TO SCORE A GOAL
IN HIS FIRST NINE GAMES.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.826
FAILING TO SCORE A GOAL
IN HIS FIRST NINE GA

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:27.593
THE VETERAN CENTRE WAS JUGGLED
AROUND VARIOUS LINES

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.962
EARLY IN THE SEASON.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.731
EARLY IN THE SEASON.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:38.905
AT ONE POINT HE FOUND A HOME
WITH DANIEL ALFREDSSON
AND JESSE WINCHESTER.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:43.009 align:start size:97% position:3%

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:50.149 line:76%
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME,
SOMETIMES THAT CAN AFFECT,

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.885
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE ON A LINE
WHERE YOU THINK YOU SHOULD

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:54.354
 BE UP THE LINE, OR WHATEVER,
HOWEVER IT GOES,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.791
SOMETIMES THAT CAN AFFECT YOUR
OWN PERFORMANCE AND YOU START

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:01.861
BLAMING OTHER THINGS BUT YOU'RE
NOT LOOKING AT THE REAL--

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:04.297
YOU KNOW IF THERE IS PROBLEMS,
THE REAL ISSUES

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.299
 AND YOUR OWN GAME.

00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:09.969
SO, I TRY TO FOCUS IN ON MY OWN
GAME AND DO THINGS

00:01:10.035 --> 00:01:13.006
REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU'RE PLAYING
WITH THROUGHOUT THE SEASON,

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.742
YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH
DIFFERENT LINEMATES,

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:19.479
DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND OBVIOUSLY
SOME ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:26.453
YOU CAN'T LET THAT AFFECT YOU,
YOU HAVE TO REGARDLESS,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.622
WITH OUR TEAM AND THE DEPTH AND
THE AMOUNT OF SKILL

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.759
WITH OUR TEAM AND THE DEPTH AND
THE AMOUNT OF SKILL

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:34.727
WITH OUR TEAM AND THE DEPTH AND
THE AMOUNT OF SKILL

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:34.860
 THAT WE'VE GOT, YOU'RE GOING TO
BE PLAYING WITH SOME GOOD
PLAYERS.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.797
&gt;&gt; FISHER KEEPS A POSITIVE
ATTITUDE ABOUT HIS LINEMATES,

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:40.133
JUST AS HE DOES ABOUT
HIS GAME OVERALL.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:44.037
HE'S BEEN HAMPERED BY INJURIES
THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER,

00:01:44.103 --> 00:01:46.739
INCLUDING MISSING THE
POST-SEASON LAST YEAR

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.408
WITH A LEFT KNEE INJURY.

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:51.578
HE'S SUFFERED AN INJURY TO HIS
OTHER KNEE ALREADY THIS SEASON

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:53.213
IN A GAME AGAINST
THE NEW YORK RANGERS.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.282
DESPITE MISSING SO MANY GAMES
OVER THE YEARS, FISHER SAYS

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.885
 THAT STAYING POSITIVE IS AN
IMPORTANT ASPECT TO SUCCESS.

00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:01.821
&gt;&gt; INJURIES ARE GOING TO HAPPEN,
THAT'S PART OF THE GAME.

00:02:01.887 --> 00:02:03.890
YOU CAN'T REALLY
ALWAYS CONTROL THAT.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:08.728
WHEN I AM HEALTHY I TRY TO HAVE
AS MUCH FUN AS I CAN

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:11.898
 AND NOT TAKE FOR GRANTED MY
HEALTH AND KNOWING THAT

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:13.833
 THE GAME CAN COME AND GO.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.972
HAVE FUN AND I LOVE
PLAYING AND COMPETING

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:22.709
 AND BEING AROUND THE GUYS AND
THE COMPETITIVENESS.

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:26.813
JUST ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS
POSSIBLE AND TRY AND LEARN FROM

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.215
THE DOWN TIMES
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

00:02:29.281 --> 00:02:32.986
&gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY
THAT FISHER WAS A YOUNG PROSPECT

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:35.221
TRYING TO MAKE HIS MARK
IN THE NHL.

00:02:35.287 --> 00:02:38.091
BUT, HE WAS DRAFTED TEN YEARS
AGO AND HE'S NOW CONSIDERED

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:40.660
 A VETERAN AND A LEADER
IN THE DRESSING ROOM.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:43.897 align:start position:0%
AND THAT MEANS TAKING CARE OF
THE YOUNGER PLAYERS ON THE TEAM.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:46.132
&gt;&gt; WE'VE GOT GREAT YOUNG GUYS.

00:02:46.198 --> 00:02:48.668
NICK FOLIGNO HAS
HAD A GREAT START.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.171
HE HAD A GREAT ATTITUDE
COMING IN TO CAMP

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.273
 AND HE'S
PLAYING REALLY WELL.

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.911
OBVIOUSLY WINCHESTER IS AN OLDER
ROOKIE, BUT STILL A YOUNG GUY.

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.146
I GOT THE CHANCE TO PLAY
WITH HIM A BIT.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:03.950
I'M JUST TRYING TO ENCOURAGE
HIM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:08.755
AND JUST, WHETHER IT BE LITTLE
PLAYS OR TRYING TO HELP THEM OUT

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.591
JUST TRYING TO STAY
POSITIVE WITH THEM.

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:18.164
SOMETIMES IT'S DIFFICULT COMING
IN WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.334
AND MAYBE NOT GETTING RESULTS
RIGHT AWAY OR WHATEVER.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.571
I'VE GONE THROUGH IT,
SO I JUST TRY TO ENCOURAGE THEM

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:27.807
 AS MUCH AS I CAN AND A LOT
OF OUR GUYS ARE GOOD KIDS

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:30.877
 AND THEY WORK HARD AND THEY
WANT TO LEARN

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:33.880
AND THEY'RE REALLY
RECEPTIVE TO TEACHING.

00:03:35.514 --> 00:03:38.418
&gt;&gt; FISHER IS THE PERFECT ROLE
MODEL FOR THE YOUNGER PLAYERS

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:41.287
ON THIS TEAM SINCE HE IS
SO ACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITY.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:44.724
THE CENTRE RARELY TURNS DOWN AN
OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE HIS TIME

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.060
WITH THOSE IN NEED
IN THE CAPITAL REGION.

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:52.332
&gt;&gt; I FEEL VERY FORTUNATE AND
BLESSED TO BE ABLE

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.301
 TO DO WHAT I DO,
OBVIOUSLY IN THE SPOT LIGHT.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:58.438
I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE
BACK AS MUCH AS I CAN

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.106
AND HELP OTHERS.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:06.613
THE ORGANIZATION WHEN I GOT HERE
NINE OR TEN YEARS AGO

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.182
STRESSED GETTING INVOLVED
IN THE COMMUNITY

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.620
AND HAD A LOT OF
GOOD LEADERS THAT WAY.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:18.024
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I ENJOY
DOING AND THERE'S NOTHING BETTER

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.059
WHEN YOU CAN
HELP OUT A LITTLE KID

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.662
 OR SEE THE DIFFERENCE
YOU CAN MAKE.

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:31.104
I LOVE DOING IT WHENEVER I CAN
AND THERE'S SO MANY GOOD EVENTS

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.273
THAT WE DO DURING THE SEASON.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:37.343
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD LUNCHEONS
AND I THINK ONE OF MY FAVOURITES

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.646
IS THE CHEO VISIT AT CHRISTMAS.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.951
IT'S A WHOLE TEAM THING AND
THAT'S A LOT OF FUN...

00:04:45.017 --> 00:04:47.186
AND HARD TOO,
AT THE SAME TIME.
