SLEEVES (PART 1)

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.680
This is a sleeve.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.000
We make sleeves like this.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
We put an iron-on swatch here,

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.680
that is, a small cloth
that allows me to make a buttonhole.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.480
This is an iron-on swatch.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.920
You take the interfacing,

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.800
it's placed so the fold at the bottom
is a centimetre and a half

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
and it's basted like this.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400
Basting is something

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.800
which must be done standing,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.920
then you sit

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.920
to do the finishings,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.520
for the over-stitching.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600
Many people, to do this work,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.600
instead of doing it by hand,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.600
with an interfacing
of light-weight camel hair...

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.480
I like the bottom of a sleeve to be

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.480
rather solid,

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.320
a bit full, not weak,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.920
so, instead of putting...

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.360
Years ago, they'd use something

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560
that had a French name,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.760
"changeant".

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200
In that period,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.800
there were fabrics

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.640
which weighed

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.840
500 grams,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.440
today, unfortunately, there are
very light-weight fabrics,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.320
so that...

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.120
an interfacing like this
would be unnecessary.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.960
This is the bottom of the sleeve.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.600
It's folded up like this, by hand,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.800
and you try especially

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.600
to make sure the upper part

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.600
is a little looser

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.000
than the inner part.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.080
Why is this done ?

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.360
Because, if not, the sleeve,

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.960
where the buttonholes are,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.560
flips outward

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.960
and it's not nice to see

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.360
a sleeve when it turns outward,
like this.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.600
Instead, doing it by hand,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.000
putting that iron-on swatch inside

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.480
and with an interfacing
that's rather sustained,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.960
you avoid all those defects

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.760
that are so unwanted.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.560
Basically,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.160
a sleeve should be
like the lid on a box.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.080
If the box is big,
the lid will be bigger.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.880
In this case,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.320
the armhole is rather small,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.720
so, in tailoring, there's a tendency

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.120
to make the sleeve a bit looser

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.000
and distribute this looseness,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.600
so that it makes a bit of a gather.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.600
In fact, I've had customers ask:

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.000
"Why does this gather happen ?"

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.600
But I do it purposely,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800
I create this gathering,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.400
because, to avoid it,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400
all you do is add reinforcement,
a small roll underneath,

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.440
which raises the sleeve.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.240
Instead, I'd rather have the sleeve

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.040
adhere

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.640
to the seam of the shirt

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.440
and be a single piece
with the shoulder.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.840
It's a matter of viewpoint,
it depends on the tailor.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.040
After this is done,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.440
the buttonholes are made
with a buttonholer,

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.600
it's then sewed
and the sleeve is lined.
