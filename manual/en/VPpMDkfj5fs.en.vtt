00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:06.319
In this clip we'll be learning how to do numbers
and punctuation in the italic, cursive calligraphy

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.379
hand. The numbers are drawn to the cap line,
just like a capital letter. So you're going

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:29.880
to come up here to the cap line; one, and
two goes just slightly below.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:38.450
Numbers are pretty good sized. Four comes
all the way down to the body line. Five has

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:58.630
a kind of quick turn. And again, there's that
curve line that's used a lot. Seven. Always

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:21.359
at the 45 degree angle still the numbers are
created just how we created the letters.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:52.469
Also, we're going to show you some punctuation.
That's one way. The ampersand,

00:01:52.469 --> 00:02:09.990
and you can create this either way. You can
also use just the diamond as a period or punctuation

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.660
for an "I" or "J".
