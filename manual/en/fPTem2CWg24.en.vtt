00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.680
Hi I'm James with JNC Home Repair. Today I'm
going to show you how to give your kitchen

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.360
an uplift on a limited budget. One of the
first things you can do is you can update

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.379
your cabinets. What we've got here today is
this is a finished product but before we started

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.660
this was an older stain grade type cabinets
since this house was actually built in 1982.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.210
It had older oak type cabinets. The cabinets
are still exactly the same, we just refinished

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.570
them. They were just a standard golden oak
grade and what we did was just refinished

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.870
them with a nice oil base, bright white, enamel
on the outside then on the inside gives it

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:48.280
a lot more up to date look. They're real durable.
They're easy to clean, that is basically what

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.600
you can do to update your kitchen. Another
way is you may want to update your counter

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.800
tops. Since you are going ahead and refinishing
the cabinets you might as well go on with

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.700
some new counter tops. If you are looking
at these new counter tops now these these

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:06.509
actually look like a natural stone, believe
it or not this is actually just a laminate.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.619
It's a make believe stone, it's just a laminate.
A lot of older homes have the square edge

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.369
counter tops and we've got the bull nosed
counter tops actually. They actually look

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.259
like real stone and we've got the cabinets
in here for less than $100 so that's you know

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:29.990
a considerable increase in value for just
a very limited amount of funds. Another thing

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.899
you might want to do is you may want to update
your light figures. That's just another simple

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:40.709
way to give it an update modern look. I think
we paid $35 for this light fixture. There

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:48.459
used to be a real gaudy florescent light fixture
in here that's pretty typical in older homes.

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.930
You may want to get rid of that. You may have
to do some drywall repairs but just go ahead

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.350
and update your light fixtures and maybe an
extra coat of paint, your cabinets and your

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.739
counter tops and you will have a nice budget
face lift on your kitchen.
