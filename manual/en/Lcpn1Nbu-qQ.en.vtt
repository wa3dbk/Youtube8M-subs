TOM SMITH: Hi. My name is Tom, this is for
ExpertVillage.com, and we're talking about

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.309
how to play keyboards in a worship team at
a church. Holding patterns is something you

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.550
maybe called to play while somebody's praying
or speaking or talking between choruses. You

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.630
can play a phrase out of the chorus you've
just done. Another thing to do is to look

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.020
at the fundamentals of a scale, like you've
got your root note. In this case, with "Enough",

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:40.940
is a G and then I've got my perfect fourth
and fifth. So, the I, IV and V in this key

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:54.230
is G, C, D and then I've got a minor third
which is the E minor and then the minor sixth

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.560
which in this case is A minor. So, basically,
you've got five chords that you can play in

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.480
a holding pattern that will always sound good.
Whatever key you're in, you know that you've

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:14.110
got one, the fourth, the fifth, the minor
third and the minor sixth chord that you can

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.970
put in some kind of pattern that will fit
as a holding pattern. So, for "Enough", I

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:29.400
might play something like this which is the
one, down to the minor third and then maybe

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:42.780
I go down to the minor sixth, up to the fourth
and then up to the fifth. And notice too,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.750
I'm using some of the approaches we talked
about earlier. I'm basically playing an open

00:01:47.750 --> 00:02:10.090
octave on the G for that, so an arpeggio with
just three notes, G, D and a high G. So, use

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.290
those different--those five chords in any
key your doing to give you a holding pattern

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.989
to play during prayer or when somebody's speaking
if you want a little bit of music behind it.
