00:00:00.816 --> 00:00:02.536
&gt;&gt; Hi, my name is Jaydeep

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:04.966
and I'm a fourth year bio
major at CC Stanislaus.

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:08.066
And many of the bio classes
we take, a major portion

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:10.046
of the course takes place
in one of the labs just

00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:11.206
like those down the hallway.

00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:13.396
And because the lab
component of these classes is

00:00:13.486 --> 00:00:16.406
so significant we need to take
time each semester to think

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:18.346
about and review lab
safety information.

00:00:18.426 --> 00:00:21.206
Even if you've taken numerous
lab courses in the past,

00:00:21.326 --> 00:00:23.256
it's still your responsibility
to demonstrate

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:26.206
that you know important
policies and procedures related

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:28.106
to lab safety every time
you walk in the door.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.146
Lab safety is a cooperative
effort.

00:00:30.336 --> 00:00:33.006
Our actions in lab don't just
affect one or two people.

00:00:33.306 --> 00:00:35.476
They have the potential to
affect everyone in the room.

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.746
So, do your part
and know your stuff.

00:00:38.326 --> 00:00:41.476
This video and the accompanying
tutorials are the cornerstone

00:00:41.476 --> 00:00:42.776
or our lab safety education.

00:00:43.116 --> 00:00:45.066
And completing them is
a requirement in order

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.856
to stay enrolled in your class.

00:00:47.946 --> 00:00:50.086
I'll be your guide as you
learn about lab policies

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:51.476
and procedures from two angles.

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:53.066
In the first part we'll talk

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:54.566
about some general
safety information

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:56.316
and the policies
required by the university

00:00:56.316 --> 00:00:57.436
and the biology department.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.526
In the second part we'll get
some specific safety equipment

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.756
in each lab that
you need to know

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:02.946
about in case of an emergency.

00:01:04.196 --> 00:01:05.816
Throughout the module
are quiz questions

00:01:05.816 --> 00:01:07.356
that will help you
measure your comprehension

00:01:07.356 --> 00:01:08.556
of the material being presented.

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.336
You must score 100 percent
in all the questions

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.116
to satisfy the requirements
of safety training.

00:01:13.516 --> 00:01:15.346
But, don't worry, you
can always go back

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:17.806
and retake anything you did not
get right for the first time.

00:01:18.156 --> 00:01:20.046
The goals have everyone
in the class ready

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.586
to share the safety
responsibility.

00:01:21.966 --> 00:01:22.336
You ready?

00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:22.976
Let's get started.

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:31.576
[ Silence ]

00:01:32.076 --> 00:01:34.246
&gt;&gt; The most basic part of
lab safety is having access

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:35.976
to information about
your surroundings.

00:01:36.436 --> 00:01:37.996
In the lab, we have
a right to know

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:39.916
about all chemicals
we'll be exposed to.

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.286
This means all containers need
to be labeled with the full name

00:01:43.286 --> 00:01:46.356
of their materials and any
hazard condition they possess,

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:50.046
such as flammable,
corrosive, oxidizer and so on.

00:01:50.496 --> 00:01:53.036
If something needs a proper
label, take the initiative

00:01:53.036 --> 00:01:54.496
to make sure it gets
taken care of.

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:55.836
We consider the material

00:01:55.836 --> 00:01:58.746
to be unattended once the
class has left the area.

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:01.406
The flip side of the right

00:02:01.406 --> 00:02:03.696
to know is the responsibility
to know.

00:02:04.216 --> 00:02:06.166
And as a student in the
lab, you are expected

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:08.966
to read the labels carefully
and take responsibility

00:02:08.966 --> 00:02:10.976
for knowing what it is you're
working with at all times.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:18.546
[ Silence ]

00:02:19.046 --> 00:02:20.316
&gt;&gt; Additional information
about chemicals

00:02:20.316 --> 00:02:22.176
and other lab products
is available in the form

00:02:22.176 --> 00:02:23.376
of safety data sheets.

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:28.366
You can ask the biology
department safety coordinator

00:02:28.366 --> 00:02:30.656
to see any safety data
sheet and they are required

00:02:30.656 --> 00:02:33.236
to honor your request.

00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:36.646
Unfortunately, safety data
sheets are not available online

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:36.976
at this time.

00:02:37.516 --> 00:02:43.576
[ Silence ]

00:02:44.076 --> 00:02:46.326
&gt;&gt; Once inside the lab, there
are a lot of little things

00:02:46.326 --> 00:02:48.166
to know and most of
them are common sense.

00:02:48.286 --> 00:02:51.696
First, no eating or open
drinks are allowed in the lab.

00:02:51.936 --> 00:02:53.246
So don't try to finish
your lunch

00:02:53.246 --> 00:02:56.316
at the lab bench,
right before class.

00:02:56.816 --> 00:02:58.096
If you bring a personal
water bottle

00:02:58.096 --> 00:02:59.836
with you it must be kept closed

00:02:59.836 --> 00:03:02.076
and secured inside your
backpack during lab.

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:05.076
Obviously, no smoking
is allowed in the lab

00:03:05.076 --> 00:03:07.106
since that is prohibited
in every campus building.

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:09.506
Lastly, do not apply any makeup

00:03:09.506 --> 00:03:11.366
or install contact
lenses in any lab.

00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:14.396
The general idea with all of
these is to prevent the lab

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:15.406
from being exposed

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:17.076
to potentially hazardous
combinations

00:03:17.076 --> 00:03:17.966
of chemicals or spills.

00:03:18.516 --> 00:03:23.546
[ Silence ]

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.446
&gt;&gt; So you've left the rest
of your lunch at home.

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:28.506
Extinguish your cigarette in an
appropriate container and put

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:30.066
on your makeup before
coming to class.

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:31.486
You're all set for lab right?

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:33.296
Well, not exactly.

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:35.656
You now need to make
sure you dress the part.

00:03:37.086 --> 00:03:39.826
First is the goggle
policy, not to be confused

00:03:39.826 --> 00:03:42.316
to the Google policy,
which requires all cheating

00:03:42.316 --> 00:03:43.306
to be done using Google.

00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:44.686
No, not really.

00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:48.066
Everyone must wear
chemical splash goggles

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:49.976
with indirect vents
as soon as anyone

00:03:49.976 --> 00:03:52.236
in the class starts working
with a hazardous material.

00:03:52.576 --> 00:03:54.166
Goggles can be purchased
from the bookstore.

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:58.086
If you wear glasses or contacts
you must still wear goggles

00:03:58.086 --> 00:04:00.446
over them because your glasses
don't provide enough protection

00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:01.646
for your eyes by themselves.

00:04:02.086 --> 00:04:04.176
Wear goggles anytime
you're working with anything

00:04:04.176 --> 00:04:06.636
that can injury your eyes
including flying particles,

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:09.646
laser light, UV light
or electrical arcs.

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:12.146
If you are caught without
your goggles while hazardous

00:04:12.146 --> 00:04:14.786
materials are being used,
you'll be told to leave the lab.

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:16.956
Don't make everyone
stare and snicker at you

00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:17.976
as you're forced to
walk out of class.

00:04:18.516 --> 00:04:25.546
[ Silence ]

00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:27.616
&gt;&gt; In addition to goggles
everyone must wear lab

00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:28.546
appropriate clothing.

00:04:28.906 --> 00:04:31.116
Again, your common sense
should prevail here.

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:33.736
Do not wear open-toed
shoes such as sandals.

00:04:34.126 --> 00:04:36.556
Closed-toe shoes are
mandatory to protect your feet

00:04:36.556 --> 00:04:38.116
from spills and other hazards.

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:40.586
Also, everyone must
wear a lab coat

00:04:40.586 --> 00:04:43.126
or apron whenever hazardous
materials are being handled.

00:04:43.806 --> 00:04:45.596
Don't think you're too
sexy for a white lab coat.

00:04:45.956 --> 00:04:47.426
Instead get your geek sheik on.

00:04:48.886 --> 00:04:49.986
While long sleeve shirts

00:04:49.986 --> 00:04:53.226
and long pants are not always
mandatory your instructor might

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.216
require them on a
case by case basis.

00:04:55.606 --> 00:04:58.366
If they are required you
must abide by that in order

00:04:58.366 --> 00:04:59.396
to be allowed in the lab.

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:06.566
[ Silence ]

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.106
&gt;&gt; Despite our best
efforts accidents

00:05:08.106 --> 00:05:08.896
and spills will happen.

00:05:09.186 --> 00:05:10.686
The best way to minimize them is

00:05:10.686 --> 00:05:12.956
to keep your lab area
clean and uncluttered.

00:05:13.436 --> 00:05:15.626
If something does spill
tell your instructor

00:05:15.776 --> 00:05:17.146
and then clean it
up immediately.

00:05:17.846 --> 00:05:20.516
Clean up water spills
immediately to prevent any slip

00:05:20.516 --> 00:05:23.286
or fall injuries as well as
damage to adjoining rooms.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.966
We don't the room underneath
us to have a rainy day.

00:05:26.456 --> 00:05:29.246
If you need a mop
you'll find one in N-235.

00:05:30.386 --> 00:05:31.856
If the spill is too
large for you

00:05:31.856 --> 00:05:34.946
to handle notify your instructor
to call building facilities.

00:05:36.416 --> 00:05:39.646
In the case of chemical spills
dispose of left over chemicals

00:05:39.646 --> 00:05:42.156
or contaminated paper towels
in the appropriate containers

00:05:42.156 --> 00:05:44.356
for liquid and solid
hazardous waste.

00:05:44.736 --> 00:05:46.606
These containers can
be found in each lab.

00:05:47.876 --> 00:05:50.606
Never dispose of hazardous
materials in the trash

00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:52.246
or pour chemicals
down a sink drain.

00:05:53.846 --> 00:05:54.866
What about broken glass?

00:05:55.206 --> 00:05:57.256
Simple, put broken glass shards

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:59.986
into the tall broken glass
box located in each lab.

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:03.906

on a standard incident
report form,

even if its not life
threatening.

00:06:25.606 --> 00:06:27.546
Students who are
injured in lab should go
