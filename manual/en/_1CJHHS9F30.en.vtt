Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns (www.AsWoodTurns.com)
Here in the Pacific Northwest, it’s time

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.860
to prune the trees out in the yard before
springtime hits. I cut a major limb off of

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.960
a fig tree. And, thought, Can I turn something
from this fig tree.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.790
Well, at the same time, Carl Jacobson and
Brendon have this informal challenge going

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.829
for a winged tea light holder. Well, let’s
combine the two things into one and let’s

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.680
do a winged tea light.
This is an LED tea light. I would never use

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.000
a wax tea light in a wooden vessel unless
I was planning to start a fire.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.579
So let’s make a winged tea light. For this
project, I’ll use a gouge and a skew for

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.980
the most part.
This limb is only about 2.5 inches in diameter.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.920
I’ll saw off a length that I can envision
as a tea light plus about12 inch more on each

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.999
end for mounting.
Now at the lathe, I’m mounting the limb

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:24.189
deliberately off center and off-axis. I want
to keep the bark on the top for a natural

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:31.310
edge but then curve back to a flat on the
bottom. Now even though this is technically

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.420
an eccentric turning, I’ll keep it simple.
I’ll use a gouge to cut away one side then

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.549
clean it up with a scraper. After that, I
plan to round over both ends. With the wood

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.539
this fresh and wet, turning is quick and easy.
I don’t know how hard fig would be when

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:57.170
dry. In summertime, fig sap is quite milky
and sticky but there’s very little sap in

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:09.140
this wood due to wintertime harvesting. I’ll
do very little sanding.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.849
Now to create a flat on the bottom. I first
sanded it on a disc sander to get a flat but

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:22.031
had a hard time getting it even. So, with
a little flat, I resorted to a jointer. For

00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:27.300
safety with this small piece, I’m anchoring
my hand on the back fence.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:35.330
Next, I’m drilling the recess for the LED
tea light on the drill press. A 1 ¾ inch

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.260
Forstner bit does the trick. I put a clamp
on the piece to give me enough leverage to

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:54.180
avoid it spinning out of control.
Finally, I’ll sand the ends just a little

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.230
bit with a sanding disk mounted in the drill
press. A quick dunk in walnut oil and my winged

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.420
tea light is finished – a quick and easy
project. I don’t know how fig will react

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.980
as it dries – It may crack but that’s
ok. I’ll have to oil it again after it dries

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.870
– the high moisture content right now prevented
it from absorbing very much walnut oil.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.040
So this is my answer to the winged tea light
challenge and using cheap wood from my yard.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.070
Urban forestry works for me.
That’s all for now until next week for another

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:40.260
project. Please subscribe to both my website
and YouTube channel. Do yourself a favor and

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.850
always wear your face shield – you can thank
yourself later. You can take all the credit.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.260
Until next time, this is Alan Stratton from
