00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.520
I need Ashley.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.080
This week's feast: Minecraft Cake

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.580
Let's play Minecraft.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.820
Obviously, the ingredients in the game can't make a real cake.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.260
So we decided to treat you all to a modified version.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.580
4 layers of delicious red velvetiness.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.240
To make this cake, you will need: 2 and a half cups of all-purpose flour,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.680
3 teaspoons of Cocoa Powder, red food coloring, 1 teaspoon of baking soda,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.180
1 and 1/2 cups of sugar, 2 eggs, 1 stick of melted butter, 1 cup of buttermilk.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.940
1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and finally, a few tubs of cream cheese frosting.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.520
Compliments of Betty Crocker. (Curse you Batterwitch! We will foil your buttery plans someday)

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.280
Combine the flour, baking soda and sugar in a bowl and mix together in.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.120
In a separate bowl, combine the cocoa powder and red food coloring. Whisk until you achieve a paste-like consistency.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.240
Pour the flour and sugar mixture and melted butter into a large mixing bowl. Beat on medium to high until combined

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.999
Next, add in the eggs then the buttermilk vanilla extract, and the red Cocoa Powder paste.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.019
Add in as much as you want until your batter is just the right amount of red.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.289
For this cake

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.749
We got 2 8x8 inch square pans.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.280
To make sure the cake isn't stick, add in a little bit of oil and coat the sides with a napkin.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.780
Then, pour a little bit of flour and spread it around evenly. No pickaxe necessary but helpful nonetheless.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.440
Pour the cake batter in and even it out.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.400
Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and bake the cakes for 30 minutes.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.960
You can test to see if they're done by using a toothpick. If the toothpick comes out clean, then you're ready to mine.....craft.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.880
Minecraft!

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.520
To maximize the height of the cake, you should cut them in half with a cake leveler.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340
Oh my gosh. This is...

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.800
That was easily the most satisfying thing I ever have done in my life.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.840
Next, coat each level with a thick layer of frosting. The best tool to use for this is a spatula.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.300
When you get to the top make sure all the sides of the cake are covered, too.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.720
Now we're ready to decorate. Yay!

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.820
You'll need: A box of fondant, gel food coloring in Crisco or shortening.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.380
First things first, cover the surface of your workspace and your hands with Crisco.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.440
So the fondant doesn't stick. Begin kneading the fondant until it's soft.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.440
*Chuckling*

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.160
What? For real?

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.920
For this cake, we need it colored brown and red.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.020
Add the gel coloring to get your desired shade and keep kneading it until it's evenly spread.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.280
Repeat for each color.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.300
If there's too much chatter and not enough work in the kitchen? Don't worry, saran wraps got your back.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
A baton as well.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.379
Yeah

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.390
Guys....

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:06.392
Cooking is fun.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.340
Very fun

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.200
Okay

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.180
Roll out the fondant to about the size of the cake, leaving a few inches on all sides.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.300
To ensure the fondant makes it safely to the cake, wrap it back up on the rolling pins so you don't rip it

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.240
Next, cover the cake with the fondant and delicately flatten the sides.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.840
Cut off the excess with a pizza cutter.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.340
From here on out, it's all about decoration.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.480
Carefully cut out the white edges in using dabs of water glue it around the sides.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.060
Then, top it off with a big white square piece

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.100
Cut out a bunch of various sized red squares and decorate to your heart's desire.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.220
Feel free to finish it off with a border of icing. It'll help hide any imperfections

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.020
Voila, you've created your very own 4 layer Red Velvet Minecraft Cake.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.320
Be sure to cut it into six and fill up on those hearts.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.040
There's a bit of fate ....of fiction.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:17.080
