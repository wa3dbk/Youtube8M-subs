00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:10.390
We're just nearby Giuseppe's place.

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:13.429
Giuseppe is sort of a veteran thief.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.924
He has a shop with various things to sell,

00:00:17.924 --> 00:00:21.572
falsifies documents and sells lock picks.

00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:25.972
He has something for us and we're here to pick it up.

00:00:27.873 --> 00:00:32.538
Again, without any loading we enter...

00:00:38.594 --> 00:00:40.725
Be careful with that, Radim.

00:00:42.128 --> 00:00:44.450
Somebody could die.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.778
Here we can see how sub-quests are integrated into the main storyline.

00:01:26.778 --> 00:01:33.650
Because we want to see it, Radim will accept this quest.

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:51.836
*Can't understand, sorry*

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:06.491
So, we picked up the papers.

00:02:06.491 --> 00:02:09.844
And while we're here we'll equip ourselves a bit.

00:02:09.844 --> 00:02:13.322
Maybe take a few mototovs.

00:02:13.322 --> 00:02:17.327
Lock picks.

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:20.501
A gun and some ammo.

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:25.793
As Steve said our task is to get to Millville.

00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:29.435
There's a garage there, somebody is doing some car business there.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:36.368
So we'll head there and we'll destroy the cars to teach them a lesson.

00:02:37.413 --> 00:02:40.381
A little job.

00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:47.412
We're all ready and we can go.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.297
Oh, crap.

00:03:14.348 --> 00:03:18.582
Well, we scared the robbers off, but a policeman appeared.

00:03:18.582 --> 00:03:23.250
We have a problem, he wants to see a gun permit, we don't have one.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.351
We won't bribe him so Radim, run.

00:03:31.308 --> 00:03:40.575
Unfortunately he had a radio, he just transmitted our description.

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:44.685
You can see a 'wanted' icon has appeared there on top of the screen.

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:49.646
That means then whenever a policeman sees us, he'll recognize us

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:53.459
and once he does he'll want to arrest us.

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.997
So, we'll get away from these two, well, one, others will join him.

00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:18.381
Careful. That's it.

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:26.614
Well, we got rid of the police, now we just have to get rid of the wanted status.

00:04:26.614 --> 00:04:28.690
They are looking for us.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.524
Here is a great opportunity - an apparel shop.

00:04:36.204 --> 00:04:40.007
We'll buy some nice threads.

00:04:48.492 --> 00:04:50.614
So, show yourself.

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:58.230
As you can see the icon has disappeared, the cops won't recognize us anymore.

00:05:02.714 --> 00:05:09.631
So, we got rid of the cops, that's great. Now we just need a car.

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:16.448
Well, we have lock picks, how about the white one back there, Radim?

00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:21.309
We have several ways to get a car.

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:25.138
There were some cops here just now so let's try the quiet one.

00:05:25.138 --> 00:05:27.961
Lock pick.

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:34.912
The advantage is, it's rather quiet, but it takes some time.

00:05:34.912 --> 00:05:36.636
Oh, come on, come on...

00:05:41.058 --> 00:05:43.802
You'll get to enjoy that later, don't worry.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.998
Well, we can go.

00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:49.649
You can hear authentic music.

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:52.842
A little interesting fact,

00:05:52.842 --> 00:05:59.153
2K really depends... cares about this game, so they...

00:05:59.153 --> 00:06:05.131
...they purchased a huge soundtrack of authentic music.

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:10.926
You'll be able to enjoy the frequent trips around the town.

00:06:30.518 --> 00:06:33.713
You can go a bit faster, alright, Radim?

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:37.234
The town might be nice but...

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:44.642
We're now heading to the town district Millville.

00:06:44.642 --> 00:06:49.732
What we're showing you now, in this presentation,

00:06:49.732 --> 00:06:53.443
are the side missions, sub-quests as we call them.

00:06:53.443 --> 00:07:01.309
What we are particular about is that the game still has the flow.

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:08.792
It's not interrupted, as you could see the sub-quest just fluently tied on to the main story.

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:13.755
We're playing it now and it's just a refreshment to the main storyline.

00:07:22.974 --> 00:07:25.980
We nearby, in Millville.

00:07:34.484 --> 00:07:40.069
OK, careful now. You can see the place on the radar.

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:46.125
We could get there many ways, we'll try sneaking.

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:49.894
We use stealth mechanics in the game too.
