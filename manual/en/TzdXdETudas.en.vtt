00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.140
I am wearing the Patagonia Ascensionist 25
liter pack.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.350
This is your ultimate fast and light pack
for day adventures.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.770
It has got a lot of different options for
climbing equipment, hik-ing equipment, anything

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.199
you throw at it.

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.780
This pack is going to be able to handle it.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.720
It is super light weight, so it can pack down
to be pretty small, but it has got, like I

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.660
said, a lot of carry options, a lot of different
variety where you can lash a lot of gear to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.789
this pack.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.029
This is definitely a climb centered pack.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.620
So it is designed to have some really easy
to use climbing features.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.609
And just starting at the bottom you have some
tool loops here with some stretchy cord, you

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.690
know, to attach any kind of, you know, ice
axe, that sort of thing.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.769
This is actually adjustable.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.039
So, you know, a daisy chain on either side
and you are able to attach whatever gear on

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.250
there you like.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.489
I don't have the pack packed out completely,
so you have more adjustability in the size

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.719
of the pack so you have got more room in the
bottom.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.310
But this webbing strap right here is a great
feature, because you can really cinch down

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.700
the pack if you don't have it packed out like
I do.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.280
And if you need more space this floating lid
kind of will come up and you are able to use

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280
more of the pack.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.979
So you have got a small pocket up here in
the top of the lid, but other than that, it

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.049
is just one big pocket in here.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:33.159
A really nice feature about the top portion
of this pack is if you do have a climbing

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.930
helmet or just extra gear that you need to
drape over the top, this whole section will

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.060
expand out.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.320
So you can see you have a nice big area here
to use and this webbing strap right here that

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:58.170
we mentioned actually can adjust to go up
to this loop right her.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.310
So you can even take this, bring it up to
here and then have extra adjustability in

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.329
there.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.149
The way that you cinch down the top of the
pack is really easy.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.150
You can do it one hand-ed, which is really
nice, and then just cinch that down.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.540
And then to open it back up all you have to
do is pull.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.900
So, you know, that is a really great feature.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.910
It lets you get hands on gear when you need
it.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.730
Going over to the side and just the back of
the pack to show you the shoulder straps.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.560
You have a nice long daisy chain right here
and on the other side.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.510
And then just really light weight straps here.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.760
So they are contoured straps, really good
quality, what you would expect from Patagonia.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:49.110
You have got an adjustable sternum strap right
there where you can also change the sizing

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.110
of that.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.940
You can remove it if you need.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.790
And there is also a small waist belt.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.170
So that is also removable.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.819
So if you want to have a little bit more sup-port
there, you can use the waist belt.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.099
But all in all just a really clean, solid,
easy to use pack.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.080
With all the different carry options, all
the light weight features and just the stream

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.860
lined design of this pack, it is you perfect,
fast and light pack for any day adventure.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.050
It is the Patagonia Ascensionist 25.
