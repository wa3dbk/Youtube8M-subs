00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.300
This video shows how to extend the battery
life of your tablet by adjusting power settings.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.700
Note. Screens may appear differently on some devices.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.700
Tablet power usage varies depending on the
applications running in the background,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.100
network reception, screen brightness, and other factors.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.100
Several of these factors can be managed from
the Quick Settings menu.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Drag down from the upper right corner to open
the Quick Settings menu.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.000
From here you can reduce battery usage by
turning down screen brightness.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.600
Tap the brightness icon, and then drag the
slider bar to lower the brightness of the screen,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.620
or tap Auto to allow the tablet to automatically
adjust brightness.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.900
Another way to reduce battery consumption
from Quick Settings is by disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.200
These wireless features can use up power while searching for a signal.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.230
Press and hold, then release the Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth icons to deactivate them.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.700
You can also disable both at once by tapping
Airplane mode.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.740
With Airplane mode activated, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
are both disabled,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.960
and an airplane mode icon displays in the
notification bar at the top of the screen.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.220
Tap Airplane mode again to disable it, allowing
your wireless features to reconnect.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.869
For more power saving options, open the Settings
menu.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.310
Touch Battery to see which apps and features
are using battery power.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.909
The graph shows an overview of battery usage
of the tablet, and the items listed are the

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.000
processes that are using the most battery
power.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.300
Touch a feature or function for more details
and options for that item.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.310
Power saving is another feature in Settings
that can help conserve battery power.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.600
In the Power saving menu, touch Processor
to adjust performance presets.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.200
Drag the slider over to Save Battery. This
will restrict your tablet's processing power

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.000
and reduce power usage.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.230
