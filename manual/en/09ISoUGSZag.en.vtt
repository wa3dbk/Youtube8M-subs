00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.680
This video shows how to replace a cartridge
in your HP Printer.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.360
To begin, turn the printer on by pressing
the Power button.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.380
Next, slide out the input tray.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.480
Align a stack of paper by tapping it on a
flat surface.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.890
Load paper into the input tray until it stops.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.280
Slide the paper width guides inward until
they stop at the edge of the paper.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.700
Do not push the guides in so tightly that
they start to bend the paper.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.050
Slide in the input tray.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.020
Open the cartridge access door.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.560
To do this, locate the cutouts on the sides
of the printer.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.940
Use these cutouts to lift the cartridge access door.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.200
The carriage will move into the access area.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060
Allow the carriage to stop moving.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.300
Then, find the cartridge you want to replace
and lift the cartridge cover to release it.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.820
Pull the cartridge out of the slot and set
it aside for recycling.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.700
For information about recycling your used HP cartridges, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.260
visit www.hp.com/recycle.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.020
Now, take the new cartridge out of its package.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.100
Pull the tab from the new cartridge to remove the tape.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.740
It is very important that you use the pull
tab to remove the tape.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.940
When handling the cartridge, be aware of the
electrical contacts and ink nozzles.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.880
Be careful not to touch the contacts or nozzles
because touching these can cause clogs,

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.760
ink failures, and poor electrical connections.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.280
Make sure you install the replacement cartridge
in its correct slot.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.380
Tri-color on the left, and Black on the right.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.780
Hold the cartridge with the ink nozzles toward the printer     

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.360
and slide it directly into the open slot.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.860
Lower the cartridge cover and push down until
it latches into place.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.740
When the cartridge is installed, close the
cartridge access door.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.420
A message will appear on the printer's control panel

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.200
indicating that a new genuine HP cartridge has been installed.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.020
Touch Continue.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.800
The next screen will remind you to load paper into the printer.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.820
Touch OK.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400
Touch OK again

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400
to print an alignment page.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.900
Once the alignment page prints, lift the scanner lid.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.560
Use the engraved guide next to the scanner
glass to properly place the alignment page

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.940
with the print side down on the right-front
corner of the scanner glass.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.340
Close the scanner lid.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.460
Touch OK on the control panel.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.690
The printer aligns the cartridges.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.020
An alignment successful message will appear on the control panel. 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.740
Touch OK again.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.580
The printer is now ready for regular use.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.860
