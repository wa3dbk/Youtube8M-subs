00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.650
This is Mr. Potato Head on ToysReviewToys.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.080
I'm going to show you my favorite candy today,
and how to make it out of Play Doh.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.550
Alright, let's hit me up with some candy.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.969
This is a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, which
is one of my favorite things.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.760
Let's see what it says on the package.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.380
Let's see here.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
Can't see a thing.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.369
All I see are black squiggly lines.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.740
Somebody needs to get me my glasses.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.090
Alright, that's better.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.730
Looks like there's a lot of sugar in these.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.739
But that's okay, cuz Mr. Potato Head likes
his candy.

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.000
Now it's time to hit me up with some Play
Doh.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.989
Okay, as you see here we're gonna need some
brown Play Doh, some yellow Play Doh, and

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.399
some orange Play Doh to make the Reese's Peanut
Butter Cup.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:56.170
Now for Mr. Potato Head's favorite part, let's
open up the package.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.440
Oh, gotta love the smell of that chocolate
and peanut butter.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.830
Okay, in order to form the cup you're gonna
need one of these.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.680
This is a mold from the Play Doh Sweet Shop
Double Desserts set.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
Now we're gonna take some brown Play Doh.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.510
We first drop it, then we stomp.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.500
Then we take a safe Play Doh plastic knife
and cut out the center to input the delicious

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.820
peanut butter.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.670
Now we add the delicious peanut butter filling.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.050
But Mr. Potato Head was mistaken.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.130
We use the light brown Play Doh instead of
the orange Play Doh.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.830
Just insert the filling into the peanut butter
cup, and then place some brown Play Doh on

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.860
top of the filling.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.740
And there it is.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.990
The Play Doh one next to a real one.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.640
Just in case you can't tell, here's the Play
Doh one, and here's the real one.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.500
Make sure you don't get these two confused.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.240
Now if you'll excuse me, Mr. Potato Head's
going to eat some peanut butter cups.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:13.410
(slurping sounds)
Wait a minute, that's the Play Doh butter

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.420
cup!

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.950
