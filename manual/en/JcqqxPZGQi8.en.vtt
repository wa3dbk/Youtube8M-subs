Welcome to twominuteenglish.com. Teaching you English through two-minute lessons.

00:00:07.166 --> 00:00:11.487
In this lesson, we will learn phrases you may 
 use to talk about the weather conditions.

00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:22.853
Oh, my! It's really hot these days! I've never 
 seen such scorching weather in my life!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.578
Tell me about it! I think the whole world 
 is facing the consequences of global warming.

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:35.403
Seriously. It’s becoming difficult to survive in such weather.This 
 scorching heat has started to affect my breathing.

00:00:37.164 --> 00:00:40.763
True. It’s really hard to breathe in this weather, man. And the humidity!

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:45.121
Yeah! That’s what kills me! Well, I just hope it cools down soon.

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:50.241
I hope so, too. But, there’s nothing we can do about it.

00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.644
Hey Sam, why do you look like a drowned mouse?

00:00:59.723 --> 00:01:03.689
I got caught in the rain, Judy. Can you get me a towel, please?

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.125
Sure. Didn’t you take your raincoat today?

00:01:08.444 --> 00:01:10.682
No, I forgot my bag at home.

00:01:11.841 --> 00:01:16.764
You know, it’s autumn and it can rain anytime. You 
 should always carry a raincoat or an umbrella.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:22.004
I knew it would rain. But, I didn't 
 realize it would rain cats and dogs.

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:26.708
I think you should take a hot shower, or you’ll catch a cold.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.565
I know. I really don’t want to get sick, especially during my exams.

00:01:39.243 --> 00:01:40.740
It hasn't’ rained a drop in months.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:45.680
Yeah, you are right. I think it’s the worst drought we’ve seen in years.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.130
I think you are absolutely right. It’s been 
 almost 2 months since the last rain.

00:01:51.604 --> 00:01:57.640
Yeah. Even the news channels have been highlighting the fact 
 that rain levels are much lower than usual.

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:00.920
It hasn't rained even half of the monthly average.

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:08.400
That’s really bad. I’m very concerned about my crops. The pastures 
 have browned out even before the arrival of summer.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.570
That’s serious. If it doesn't rain soon, the situation is going to get critical.

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:25.490
Oh, it’s too hot in here. Why haven't 
 you switched on the air conditioner, Ethan?

00:02:26.817 --> 00:02:28.760
I’m sorry, Sam. I have bad news for you

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.170
Oh, no! Don’t tell me…What is it?

00:02:33.328 --> 00:02:34.630
The air conditioner is broken.

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:42.320
What are you talking about, Ethan? In this heat?! Have 
 you called the A.C. technician to fix it up?

00:02:43.566 --> 00:02:47.600
Yes, I have. He has a lot of complaints 
 to tackle before he gets to ours.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:52.410
His other customers must be facing the same problem.

00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:57.400
Anyway, you can use the fan for awhile. It will give you some relief.

00:03:01.087 --> 00:03:02.890
I've never seen such scorching weather in my life!

00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:11.760
I think the whole world is facing the consequences of global warming.

00:03:16.363 --> 00:03:21.080
You know, it’s autumn and it can rain anytime. You 
 should always carry a raincoat or an umbrella.

00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.680
I think it’s the worst drought we’ve seen in years.

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.920
It’s been almost 2 months since the last rain.

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:48.490
Even the news channels have been highlighting the fact 
 that rain levels are much lower than usual.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.080
It hasn't rained even half of the monthly average.
