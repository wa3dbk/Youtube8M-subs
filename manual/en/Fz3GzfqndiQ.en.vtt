Hi, my name is Laura Fitzgerald and on behalf
of Expert Village, I would like to talk to

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.110
you about the care and maintenance of your
pet rat. Today I am going to tell you about

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.849
rats and other pets in your home. I just would
like to tell you that rats are very intelligent

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:23.949
animals and that they react very well with
other pets in your house. This is my dog Luke

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.710
and my rat, Tar, and this is Lucy. Tar, Luke,
and Lucy have grown up together since they

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.200
were little. Tar is about eighteen months
old and Lucy is about ten months old, and

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.400
Luke here, he is my old boy, he is about ten
years old. He has no problem interacting with

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.600
the rat, they can crawl all over him and kiss
him and take food right out of his mouth and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.310
he does not have a problem. Now I highly recommend
not leaving your rats unsupervised with any

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.820
of your pets in the house because you never
know when accidents happen, in which the rat

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.040
can get trapped some where or the rats can
chew on electrical wire. But normally rats,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.390
if they grow up with other pets in the house,
like Luke, they have no fear of him. He has

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.851
never hurt them or upset them and they can
groom him, cuddle up next to him, and play

00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:21.750
with him, and there is usually never any problem.
I had Luke around them since they were teeny

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:33.690
tiny little babies, they use to sleep on him,
and he never has had a problem with them.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.210
Rats also enjoy being in colonies together,
so it is good to have more than one rat together,

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.619
so two rats or more are much happier and well
adjusted than one rat, unless you have other

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:58.710
pets that they can play with. I would like
to show how my rats interact with my cat.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:07.869
I would also like to show you how my little
kitty reacts with the rats. She has also grown

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.110
up with them and usually does not have any
problem with them. So I got her when she was

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.730
a teeny tiny kitty out of the dumpster, and
the rats socialize with her and never have

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.972
a problem, they don't bite and she has never
hurt them. But then she tolerates having them

00:02:21.972 --> 00:02:30.430
groom her and licking her. They chase each
other around the house. Whoops, she has had

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:37.780
enough of the rats. I highly do not recommend
leaving them unsupervised but as friends while

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.720
you are supervising them and playing with
them, they should have no problem together,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.640
playing with your other pets in the house.
