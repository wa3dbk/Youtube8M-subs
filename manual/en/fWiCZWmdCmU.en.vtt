00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.040
Congratulations.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.040
You are still alive.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.860
But before you go...

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.100
I want to play another game.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.320
Another game?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.400
I want to play.. monopoly.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.660
What?!

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.330
No!

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.170
What about Scrabble?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.170
Or Boggle? Do you like Boggle?

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.830
I wanna go home!

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.960
Forget Boggle. What about some Hungry,
Hungry Hippos?

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.460
Let me out of here!

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.080
Okay, okay fine.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.660
But let me ask you something else...

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.340
How do you feel about sequels?

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.080
Lots and lots of sequels...

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.820
How Saw Should Have Ended

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.730
Whoa whoa whoa. What are you doing?

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.730
This is crazy!

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.930
I'm sorry...

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.800
I have to shoot you to save my family.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.500
No you don't!

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.489
M-- Maybe something's changed!

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.820
Maybe your wife broke free and is trying to call
you on the phone right now.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.240
Broke free?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.120
Phone?

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.070
Yes! Remember the phone?!

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.130
The phone you made
very little effort to reach before you cut your own foot off!

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.920
Oh, that's right.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.880
Where is the phone?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.220
It's not even there anymore.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.740
It just
disappeared

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.930
It makes no sense at all!

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.670
What happened to the phone?? (gun shot)

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.760
Ohh... Ahh... Hoo Haaa!

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.380
How is this happening?

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.980
I have no idea!

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.100
This entire scenario is completely implausible.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.010
I know!

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.410
I was asleep underwater earlier!!

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.150
How have I not passed out from shock?

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.590
Who is responsible for all of this??!?!?!

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.240
He's not dead, he's not dead!

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.680
You're not dead!

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.420
You're not dead!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.720
Game over.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.069
Well now he's dead.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.840
Hey.. that, that guy's my cancer patient.
