Hi.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.510
I’m Lorie Marrero, creator of the Clutter
Diet book and on-line program and today we’re

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.110
going to talk about what we call a communication
station.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.970
This is the area in your home where you share
lots of information with the other members

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.970
of your family.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.390
This can be in the kitchen or a mud room,
wherever the rest of the family commonly is

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.130
[POP] coming and going.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.050
This is our kitchen right here that we are
using.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.760
This is a modular system that I purchased
from the Pottery Barn a while back.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.420
They have all these different components that
fit on to these railings.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.050
So they have this corkboard and the chalkboard
and they have lots of different cubbies and

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.660
different things that you can get [POP] for
these various components.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.920
Whatever works for your family.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.610
This is what fits in this space and works
for the needs that we have.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.760
So we have mostly – because we have teenage
boys – a lot of things that have to do with

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.160
food in our communication station.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.950
Here’s our grocery list.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.910
I have an entire other video about methods
for making shopping lists.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.870
[POP] This is what we call our quadrant method.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.750
You can see that on the other video.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.431
We also sometimes use these preprinted shopping
lists that you can get in our store and this

00:01:18.431 --> 00:01:23.070
is just another really easy way to circle
what you need very quickly.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.940
Another thing that we do a lot here is the
menu planning.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.110
This is a list of what we’re having for
dinner for the rest of the week so everybody

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.110
will know.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.690
[POP] I can plan that and then correspondingly
put whatever I need to put on the grocery

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.720
list as well.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.320
Here we can put whatever messages we need
to, to communicate to each other.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.650
And then this is probably going to make you
laugh if you have teenage boys, but the boys

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.570
kept saying this summer that we didn’t have
any food in the house.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.900
So I just made a list of all the food we have
in the refrigerator and freezer so that they

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.650
could actually see that we really do have
food for them to eat.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.180
So things like that you can just put randomly
on whatever makes sense for you and your family.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.149
Here I’ve got a list of chores that need
to be done around the house.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.400
Up here we have extra scratch paper that we
can use for additional notes.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.489
I do use the paper [POP] from the office that’s
printed on one side and just flip that over

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.470
and cut it and use that for scratch paper.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.709
Another thing that we have nearby this communication
station is the family binder, which we’ve

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.040
done other videos about, you can see the link
on the screen here.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.420
The family binder is the place to put that
quick reference information about school policies

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.890
and frequently used numbers, other things
that your family all might need to reference.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.150
We have things like our neighborhood directory
that’s printed, all that stuff is nearby

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.450
and the family all knows that it’s here
for them to access whenever necessary.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.450
So if you would like some help with your project
of putting together your communication station,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.569
we can help you with that in our Quick Start
Program.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.749
Anybody can join our program as a member for
free for 14 days.

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.660
You can find out more about that at http://www.clutterdiet.com/quickstart.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.639
See you next time, and may you always be happy
and grateful for having more than enough.
