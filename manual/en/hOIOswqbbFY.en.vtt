00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.840
Step 1.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.489
Make an Amish Friendship Bread starter, or
get one from another baker.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.679
Step 2.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.180
Knead the bag of starter once a day on the
second, third, fourth, and fifth days after

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.840
you make or get it.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.180
On the sixth day, open the bag and add 1 cup
each of the flour, sugar, and milk.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.910
Then reseal the bag and knead it to mix everything
together.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.270
Step 3.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.829
Knead the mixture in the bag twice a day on
the seventh, eighth, and ninth days.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.170
On the 10th day, transfer the mixture to a
ceramic, wooden, or plastic bowl and add another

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.140
cup each of flour, sugar, and milk.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.140
Mix it up with a non-metal utensil and divide
it into three equal batches, sealing two in

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.409
separate plastic bags to give to friends.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.590
Step 4.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.049
Preheat your oven to 330 degrees Fahrenheit
and add the oil, eggs, the remaining 1/2 cup

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.760
milk, and vanilla extract to the bowl.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.220
Mix it thoroughly and set the bowl aside.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.540
Instead of 1 cup oil, you can use 1/2 cup
oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.970
Step 5.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.909
Mix the remaining flour, 1 cup of sugar, the
baking powder, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.850
salt, baking soda, pudding, and nuts in a
separate, non-metallic bowl.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.410
Add the mixture to the starter, stir it until
everything is combined, and then divide it

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.800
between the two loaf pans.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.350
You can substitute almonds for walnuts.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.820
Step 6.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.350
Mix the remaining sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle
it evenly over the batter.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.630
Transfer the pans to the oven and bake the
bread for one hour.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.971
Let the loaves cool for 15 minutes, remove
them from the pans, and enjoy your Amish friendship

00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:34.971
bread.

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:40.160
