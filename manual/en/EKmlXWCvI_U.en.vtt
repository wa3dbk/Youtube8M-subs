00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.330
So I get to work the other day, I take off
the metal diving suit required for the commute

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.380
and when I exit the decontamination chamber,
I bump into Mark.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.820
And Mark hands me a game with this goofy smile
on his face and he says, ìHey Derek, I reviewed

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.830
this game, and I think youíll like it.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.950
So I brought it here for you.î

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.290
Youíd think Iíd know by now not to trust
him...when he has that goofy smile.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.400
Itís the same smile he had when he proposed
building our office under the sea.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.290
His reasons seem valid enough at firstóìBut
Derek, underwater bases have to be built under

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.530
the water,î he saysóbut that reasoning always
predicates results like this.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.190
This doesnít even look convincing.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.400
So yeah, obviously, the jokeís on me.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.650
Derek likes running around in circles at Anthrax
shows, this game has a name that looks like

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.070
ìmoshing monsters mosh pit,î real cute.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.240
Itís Moshi Monsters Moshling Zoo for the
Nintendo DS.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.850
I donít know why my Mark impression sounds
like Shatner.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.450
So this is a game based on Moshi Monsters,
which is a social networking game for children

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.610
between the ages of seven and twelve.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.960
Social networking for kids that age is **** ridiculous,
but itís become a pretty big deal.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.079
More than 50 million kids play the thing,
which meansóso divide by two, carry the thingóat

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.280
least 50 million kids have awful parents.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.450
But in Moshling Zoo, you donít actually get
to play with the Moshi Monsters.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.900
Youíre managing their pets, instead.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.340
You have to explore the Moshiís world, find
the animals minding their own business in

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.200
the wild and incarcerate them for the purposes
of your own amusement.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.370
Still less ridiculous than the idea of a Facebook
for kids.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.450
You know what my Facebook was when I was eight?

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.410
It was called playing with other children.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.120
Geez, weíre raising an entire generation
of socially inept Internet nerds.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.440
Then again, at least they know how to tame
a Moshi.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.720
You feed it marmalade.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.480
The game is kind of cute, though.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.260
You have to find the creatures in the wild,
but you canít have them in the zoo without

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.590
first earning their trust...trust you will
betray within moments of receiving it.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.480
Generally, you have to solve their problems,
so you may be repairing their umbrella or

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.450
feeding them their favorite food or finding
their books.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.880
And once you fulfill those needs, they end
up in your concentration camp.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.580
There are more than 50 of these little things
to locate and persuade, but of course, thereís

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.010
more to running a zoo than just finding attractions.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.170
Thereís upkeep.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.470
So your animals need to be fed, they need
to be bathed...and to do these things, you

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:09.480
get a minigame to play.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.770
There are also minigames that pit you against
other moshlings, strangely enough.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.970
The better you do, the more money you earn.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.970
That way, you can purchase food and items
that help you capture even more innocent moshlings.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.630
Despite the gameís lack of mosh pits, it
plays just fine.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.069
Itís actually nice to see a kids game this
polished and well-made.

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.020
The sprites are nice, the backgrounds are
vibrant and colorful...this is a really good

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.660
game for its intended audience, and it gives
them plenty of content to mess around with

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.110
and keep them busy.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.659
Plus, no friend requests required.

00:03:47.659 --> 00:04:01.529
Itís Moshi Monsters Moshling Zoo.
