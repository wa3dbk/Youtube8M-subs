00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.900
Room 428,
located in ohio university in Athens ohio.

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.549
The university is said to be one of the most
haunted places in the world.

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:22.500
Students have reported sighting of ghost teachers,
doors opening and closing on their own and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.949
several poltergeist activities.
Room 428 is located in Wilson hall 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.159
Wilson hall is believed to be
haunted by a ghost of a person that died there in

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:38.089
a mysterious way in room 428 during the 1970’s.
Since then, students living in room 428 have

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.489
reported strange sounds such as growls and
scratching they have also heard hearing loud

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.239
footsteps in the dead of night and have also
seen objects move by themselves and even fly

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.390
across the room.
A female student that stayed in the room tried

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.080
to contact the dead on several occasions
she died in the room in a very violent way

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.949
students that knew her said that she was performing
a satanic ritual and during it she was trying

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.229
to perform astral projection
this is a out of body experience where people

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.500
believe the human spirit travels on its own
after separating from the body.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.970
Since these occurrences the room has been
closed off and has been made unavailable to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.920
the students.
The officials at the university say that the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.120
events have made the room uninhabitable.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.960
Vatican secret archives, located in Vatican city the archives are not off limits to the
public but the room that the archives are

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.810
in is.
it is estimated to contain 52 miles of shelving

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.799
filled with documents.
the oldest surviving documents in the archives

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.539
dates back to the 8th century,
the archives hold such documentation as henry

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.420
the 8th marriage annulment,
and letters written by Michelangelo.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.420
Hardly anybody besides the pope is allowed
in the room, to be able to obtain documents

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.569
from there you must be a qualified scholar
from the institutions of higher education

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.950
that is conducting scientific research who
also has a etiquette knowledge of archival

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.049
so yeah its pretty hard to get your hands
on the documents.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.060
there are several conspiracy theories about
the archives some claim that there are documents

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.869
related to jesus’ bloodline which proves
he did or didn’t exist

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.530
other theories are that there is documentation
about extraterrestrial life and the exact

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.690
date that the world is going to end and also
dark truths that would expose the church.

the stones in which the ten commandments was
inscribed on and also contains Aarons rod

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.190
a jar of mana and the first torah scroll written
by moses.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.370
due to the relevance and holiness of the ark,
only a specially chose monk has the privilege

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.420
of
entering the church, no one else is allowed

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.000
to lay their eyes on the church or get close
to it.

hollowed out coins to conceal documents and
maps disguised as decks of cards.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.850
they also have a collect of tiny pistols.
only a few Chinese nationals are allowed to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.930
enter the museum due to the sensitive spy
information it contains and no photography

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.010
is allowed.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.980

party building in north korea.

illegal activities such as counterfeiting

money, producing drugs such as meth and heroin
and international insurance fraud.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.050
due to the seclusion of north korea it is
difficult to confirm this information.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:07.090
but most people believe that room 39 is critical
to kim jong un’s continued power

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.240
as it enables him to buy political support
and help fund north Koreas nuclear program.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.840
