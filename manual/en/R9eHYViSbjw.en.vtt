My name is Olivia Lee and I am from Fort
Wayne, Indiana. As a freshman I was

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.530
interested in psychology and history and
English and anthropology and political

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.259
science. I chose American Studies because I've

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.480
been able to take all of those, while also
studying issues of race and gender,

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.529
religion, politics. American Studies looks
deeper and says what are the power

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.060
structures that work to display culture? What are the forces at work?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.900
What's being hidden? What's being shown? Why is American culture how it is?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.980
What does it mean to be an American? One of the most challenging things is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.629
questioning what we've always assumed
and being able to look and think deeper

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.489
about what you see all around you.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.160
Faculty are great in American Studies.
Right now I am in Professor William

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.449
Careers American Film class. We've been
watching one or two films a week and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.379
then we'll talk about different theories
that apply to the films and then he will

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.370
take us scene-by-scene through films.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
He really makes it so that all students feel comfortable to participate.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.610
After my junior year I got a grant through the Kellogg Institute to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.020
go to India and work with the Foundation
for Sustainable Development and the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.350
Guide of Human Welfare Society. I
spoke with over a hundred women about

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
their needs and how the organization
could best help them. When you go abroad

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.759
and then experience a different culture,
I think, often that's when you realize

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.970
the most what American culture is like.
My senior thesis is titled "Creating and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.200
Contesting the Cult of Girlhood." I
analyzed nine different magazine titles

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.240
that were targeted towards girls ages
eight to twelve and I wanted to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.500
contextualize my critical analysis of
the magazines. So I worked at the Boys &amp;

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.939
Girls Club in South Bend and had about
30 girls who I worked with to make

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.119
little scenes. They could write about 
what they thought about being a girl and

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.530
what was important to them in their
lives. Next year I'm gonna be working in

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.210
business management consulting. I'm
really excited about applying my

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.610
critical thinking skills and creative
thinking skills to a new field.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm so glad I made it in American
Studies. I think differently about

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.840
everything now. I can't imagine majoring
in anything else!
