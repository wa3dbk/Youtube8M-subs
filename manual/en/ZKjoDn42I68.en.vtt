00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.900
after showing your the car body and prize cup

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.180
the important thing is the chassis

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.620
a unique character and style

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.380
I just share you

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:28.843
this is Timmy's first drift car

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:37.800
it's a Yokomo SD type C model

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.880
its design is different from the first won race

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.780
now is designated for a spare car

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:01.300
it special only for testing, like to test a new parts, or requested by manufactures's test a new product 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.380
we will then use this chassis

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.060
you can see there is a "variable suspension"

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.940
dual servo design

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.480
a single carbon chassis

00:01:22.853 --> 00:01:24.853
in fact, we haven't much play on this chassis

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.540
we don't have much time on this chassis

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:37.399
but just sharing this to you today, and in future we might doing more test on it and what can be done more.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.380
this one is the winning chassis

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.880
this one is Yokomo DIB model

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:05.440
you can see that it's a motor-front design

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:12.460
all variable suspension are individual 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.740
we just modify with toe-in / toe-out adjustment,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.100
 which we duplicate from type C design

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.280
we will use this chassis for Yokomo Special Round 2014 later this year

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.160
we will re-assemble the car parts once again next month

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:59.100
it is because some parts are worn out, e.g. bearings, motor, belt

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.140
we will prepare well before go to the special round

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:14.376
the third car: what is it ?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.020
a popular over Japan, South-East Asia

00:03:21.396 --> 00:03:25.136
2RWD drift car

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.320
powerless at front

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.220
I didn't intend to build this car for Timmy at first

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:44.840
so I brought a cheaper model: Yokomo Type B, a series of SD

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.760
you see it is simple

00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:57.323
just randomly pick up any metal for counter-weight at the rear for balance 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.400
I don't need to explain more, you can see general layout

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.060
the only different is used by a dual servo

00:04:10.494 --> 00:04:12.614
and dual gyro

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.980
it is only special of this car

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.460
all parts are brought from Yokomo

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.860
you can see many lead metal put here

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.240
to make the weight balance

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.220
Timmy is happy with this chassis

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.680
2RWD drift popular nowadays 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.320
he plays a lots recently
