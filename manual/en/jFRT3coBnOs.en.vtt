00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:02.515
Here is how we tie the oriental knot.

00:00:02.515 --> 00:00:14.435
You want to start with your collar flipped up, you want to take your tie, and there is a seam on the back side of your tie, you want to make sure that seam is facing outwards when you put the tie around your neck.

00:00:14.435 --> 00:00:21.595
 This is the exact opposite of how you would normally set up your tie so make sure you do it this way with the seam on the outside.

00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:34.835
Um, we are going to take the narrow end which is on this side and we are going to put over top of our wide end which is here, to make a simple X, just like this.

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:41.155
Now we are going to take two fingers and we are going to place them over top of the narrow end.

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:46.175
Then we are going to take our thumb and pinch the back side of the X just like this.

00:00:46.175 --> 00:00:57.915
Its important we have a good hold of it because we are going to be lifting the X away from our shirt collar, and we are going to be putting the tie fabric up and through this gap which I will show you in a moment.

00:00:57.915 --> 00:01:01.315
Okay so you should be set up like this.

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:08.895
We are going to take the wide end of our tie and we are going to cross it over top of our two fingers, just like so.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:20.935
After you are set up like that you will want to reach your hand around underneath, and grab the wide end of your tie, and we’re going to push it up through that gap.

00:01:20.935 --> 00:01:24.935
So pull it away from your collar a little bit, and push it up through that gap, just like so.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:46.140
After it’s through that gap we’re going to take the end of our tie and we’re going to give it to our two fingers that are right here, so we give it to our two fingers, and then we are going to take this hand and we are going to pinch that little circle and we’re going to hold it, and pull our two fingers down with the tie, with the wide end.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
Just like so. And there is our knot!

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.400
Now we’re going to cinch it up a little bit to make it tighter, and we do that by tugging on the wide end of the tie.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.880
And then we’re going to slide the knot up to our collar.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:17.240
And how we do that is we are going to grab on to the narrow end, and hold it firmly, then we are going to put a finger on either side of the wide end of the knot, and we’re going to slide it straight up until it is up against our button.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.220
You can put a nice little dimple in it.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:30.780
Now we are going to flip our collar down, okay, there is the oriental knot.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.380
You may need to dress it just a little to make it look perfect, but there you are.
