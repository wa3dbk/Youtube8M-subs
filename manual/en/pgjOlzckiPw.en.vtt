Erik: How has social media culture shifted
your view on relationships?

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.780
Simon: There was a time not long ago, you
know, where relationships meant something

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.891
different than they mean now. There was a
time where – for example – you know, that

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:22.980
a desktop meant something horizontal, and
today a desktop means something vertical,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.970
right? I mean, that’s how technology has
changed the definition of language. Um, when

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.520
you say desktop, people think computer. You
know, they don’t think a desktop, with a

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.670
blotter and folders and things, that we actually
now have on computers as well. Technology

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.660
has also changed the definitions of human
relationships. A friend is not somebody who

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:48.429
you check their status, you know, your network
is not on LinkedIn, a conversation doesn’t

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:50.960
happen on Twitter and a dialogue doesn’t
happen on your blog, you know? There’s a

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.199
human experience, you know this, is an conversation,
you know, this – it has reactions and advancing

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.219
ideas, and it’s not just people taking turns
to speak, which is what happens online. The

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.280
Internet is incredibly, fantastic and valuable
for three things. One, for connecting people.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:16.310
Amazing, amazing, right? Connecting people
… for access to information, brilliant,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:24.930
right? And sharing information – access
and sharing information, and for speeding

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.430
transactions, to increase the speed of transactions.
And it’s the Internet that has allowed people

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.630
to build small business, because you can increase
the span of transactions, you can connect

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.799
to more people, etcetera. Find people from
your child hood, whatever, Wikipedia - all

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.039
this stuff, wonderful, wonderful. But the
Internet is not great at developing real deep

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.479
human bonds, where deep, deep, mutual trust
exists. And one of the reasons is simple,

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.630
is human bonds are human, and they require
this, human physical interaction. You have

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.189
to be able to look someone in the eye before
you’re willing to trust them, right? This

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.219
is why the videoconference will never replace
the business trip. Because you can’t get

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.960
a good read on somebody over videoconference.
And even the blogosphere, you know, who, who,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.429
talks about that the Internet solves all problems,
every year they descend on Vegas for Blogworld.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.480
Why couldn’t they just have their convention
online? Why couldn’t they just all turn

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.390
on their webcams and have a convention? They
can do that, you know? No, it’s because

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.130
nothing beats human interaction. And the amount
you learn and the connections you make and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.200
the relationships you build, physically, are
not only more efficient but deeper. And the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.920
Internet has yet to find a way that can reproduce
them. You know, if others can say that it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.850
can, I’m open to it, but human relationships
are in fact human. Um, and so, you know let

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.220
us use the Internet for all that it gives
us, and all its value, but let us not believe

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.340
that it can replace things that, that are
hard to replace.
