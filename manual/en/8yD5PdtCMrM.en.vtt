00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.041
In addition to
having environmental

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:09.709
and economic benefits,

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.012
natural gas is also a fuel
that is as safe for use

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:16.249
in vehicles as
gasoline or diesel.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.483
There are key differences

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:20.219
that contribute to
the safety of natural gas.

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.888
Unlike gasoline
and diesel,

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:23.689
which are harmful
to human health,

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.559
natural gas is non-toxic.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:29.796
Also, in the event of a
vehicle crash or fuel spill,

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:32.899
gasoline can form highly
flammable liquid pools

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.335
on the ground if a tank holding
the fuel ruptures and leaks.

00:00:36.335 --> 00:00:40.440
However, natural gas is less
likely to ignite than gasoline.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.642
Instead, it will
rise and dissipate,

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.677
as it is lighter than air.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.481
NGVs have a safety record
similar to other vehicles

00:00:48.481 --> 00:00:52.485
powered by other fuels,
such as gasoline and diesel.

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:56.522
Some NGVs, such as trucks
covering long distances,

00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:00.193
use Liquefied
Natural Gas, or "LNG".

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:03.729
LNG tanks are insulated
to keep the fuel cold

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:06.899
at minus 260 degrees
Fahrenheit.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:11.337
Other NGVs use compressed
natural gas, or "CNG".

00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:14.874
CNG fuel tanks, or cylinders,
feature robust designs

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.578
that are engineered to provide
years of reliable service.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.181
The cylinders are mounted
in protected areas,

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.917
such as behind the
rear seat in a sedan

00:01:24.917 --> 00:01:28.354
or behind shielding
in larger vehicles.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.857
Natural gas cylinder
designs are subjected

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:33.659
to 14 separate
qualification tests,

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.095
which include
dropping, bonfire,

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.131
penetration and more.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:41.167
Each cylinder is also
subjected to a pressure test

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.769
before being shipped
to the customer.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:46.572
Though CNG cylinders
are inherently safe,

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:48.007
they have
a limited lifespan

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.276
and like most vehicle
mechanical parts,

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.778
they must be
maintained properly.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.148
The most important
aspect of this care

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.049
is periodic inspection.

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.086
Federal standards
require that CNG cylinders

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:04.123
be visually inspected after a
motor vehicle accident or fire

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:08.094 line:0%
and at least every
36 months or 36,000 miles,

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:12.031 line:0%
whichever comes first,
for damage and deterioration.

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:16.169
A CNG cylinder typically
expires after 15 or 20 years.

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.071
At that point, it must be
removed from the vehicle

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:21.774
and disposed of
properly and safely.

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.911
Proper maintenance
of NGVs and cylinders

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:27.780
is critical to their
continued safe operation.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.049
There is an established
nationwide network

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.753
of inspectors certified to
perform safety inspections.

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:35.121
Some can also provide

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:38.558
proper disposal of
expired CNG cylinders.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:42.295 line:0%
If your organization operates
a large fleet of NGVs,

00:02:42.295 --> 00:02:45.598 line:0%
training your own technicians
to perform cylinder inspections

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:47.733 line:0%
may be an option to consider.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.936
Community colleges
and other locations

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:53.206
offer training classes in
cylinder safety and inspection

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:55.741
for garage technicians.

00:02:55.741 --> 00:02:59.278

safety classes near you,

and search for

00:03:02.548 --> 00:03:05.184
"Personnel
Certification Programs".

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:08.754
In conclusion, the NGV
industry's manufacturing

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:09.922
and safety procedures

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.791
have made
natural gas vehicles

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.594
as safe as other
vehicles on the road.

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:16.629 line:0%
Natural gas
for vehicles ...

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.532 line:0%
it's CLEAN,
ABUNDANT, AFFORDABLE

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.434 line:0%
and AMERICAN.
