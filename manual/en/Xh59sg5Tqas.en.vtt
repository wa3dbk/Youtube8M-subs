How to Paint with Acrylic Paint: Sponge Painting

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.050
Hi, I'm Linda.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.050
I created a company called Paint Along.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.450
Check us out at paintalongnyc.com.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.230
We have really fun painting workshops in Nashville
and New York.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.830
I'm going to teach you some techniques using
a sponge today.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.259
This is a basic natural sponge.

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:21.519
They come out of the sea.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:25.510
They're usually bigger when you get them at
the store so you might have to cut them with

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.970
some scissors and use the one that you like
the best.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.759
We're going to do two different techniques.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.230
One of them we've already prepared the canvas.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.390
This is a dry red that we've just put on the
canvas and we'll be sponging on top of this

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.390
particular color.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.489
I'm going to start out with my sponge.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.850
Put him in the water and squeeze him out so
that he is pliable.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.199
Sometimes these sponges can be very hard so
you want to make sure that they're pliable

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.960
and you can work with them.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.899
So squeeze the water out really good and find
the favorite spot which is right there.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.080
I like that spot so that's what I'm going
to use.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.879
I'm going to start with this medium green
color and I'm just going to dab all over this

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.480
half of the canvas.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.280
And I'm using quite a lot of paint.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.650
I just keep going back to my pallet, picking
up more painting and pressing it into the

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.650
canvas.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.810
The next thing I want to do is take a different
color.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.040
I'd like to put some blue in with this one.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.590
So I'm going to use my blue which is right
here.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.490
So I'm just pressing this blue right into
the wet green paint and I'm just moving around

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.920
the canvas trying to fill all the white spots.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.110
You may also want to twist your sponge around
a little bit as you go around the canvas just

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.240
because you don't want it to look like a stamped
object that's got the repetitive stamping

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.300
on it.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.430
So that is a simple two color sponge technique.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.480
Let's put this little guy aside and I'm going
to grab another one of my little sponges.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.070
Make sure he's wet.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.790
Squeeze him out really good.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.030
Let's just mix a little bit of red with white
so that it's more of a pink tone.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.230
I want it to sort of be a medium pink.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.480
So I'm going to take the sponge that's loaded
up and again we're just going to press it

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.480
onto this dry paint.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.410
And I'm going to move around, twisting my
sponge.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.120
You can kind of see that there's different
colors.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.740
There's pink and then there's also a little
bit of white in there that gives it some added

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.220
interest.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.550
And that's how we do two sponge techniques
on a background.
