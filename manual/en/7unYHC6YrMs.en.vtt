00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.700
Sometime between 1938 and 1941 Walker Evans

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.500
went down into the New York City subway with his camera.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.100
He hid it between the folds of his winter coat, and he sat opposite his fellow passengers

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.734
and made pictures. He photographed

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:30.200
people as they were. They are not aware that Evans is making

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.567
their picture. Most of us are

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:37.600
uncomfortable when we know someone is photographing us.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.967
These subjects, they’re unposed and they’re lost in their own thoughts. They’re just

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:47.300
living their life. Evans believed that the subway

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.700
experience was part of the poetry of modern urban living. It reveals how

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.867
close we are to our fellow man and how, even if two people are not together, once the photograph is

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:05.467
made, they’re forever bound. When he got done, he edited the series

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:09.100
down to about ninety pictures. When they finally were released

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.533
in the 1960s, he called them, “Many Are Called.” It’s taken from the Bible. The full quote is,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:19.400
“Many are called, but few are chosen.” And

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.200
photography’s deep language is about

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.433
selectivity. The photographer harvested

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:29.133
all of these passengers, these fellow citizens:

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.900
those who are sleeping and those who wear hats,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.667
and those who look at each other and look at him. Evans wrote about

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.100
these subway pictures, “Stare.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.334
It is the way to educate your eye and more.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:44.567
Stare, pry, listen, eavesdrop.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:48.533
Die knowing something. You are not here long.”

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:51.500
And I think it is one of the first conceptual art projects that

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.266
I’m aware of. Evans taught me that seeing is a creative act.

00:01:55.266 --> 00:02:00.233
You have to be an unapologetic voyeur. These pictures

00:02:00.233 --> 00:02:03.400
have really stained my

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.334
consciousness. I don’t see them nostalgically,

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.834
I don’t say, “Oh, I wish I was in the time where people

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:13.200
wore fedoras or they brushed their hair a certain way.” I don’t feel that way at all.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.834
It enlivens

00:02:15.834 --> 00:02:17.100
my own attention to

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.367
my time.

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:23.500
The idea that the pictures are right out there on the street. I think it’s an

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.834
unbelievable gift to those of us who live in cities and

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.600
who take pleasure in our fellow man.
