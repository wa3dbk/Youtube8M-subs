00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.460
Okay so now we're frothing, what we do is
keep the tip well below the surface of the

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.249
milk, if it gets near the surface it'll blast
big hunks of air and that'll make a mess with

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:09.709
big bubbles and you'll never get rid of them.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.730
Hi, I'm Morgan from Whole Latte Love, I'm
here with Todd.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.789
Todd's gonna show us how to froth using the
Pannarello wand, also known as the turbo frother.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.480
Now Todd, we get a lot of questions from customers
on how to get a quality froth using the Pannarello

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.480
wand.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.599
Why don't you tell us some of the questions
that we get.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.169
Okay well, we get questions, people will mention
that they have a problem getting a creamy

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:30.169
froth.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.260
They say they're getting too much air on the
froth and they don't like that.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.430
So the top of the froth is cold while the
milk underneath may be hot.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.420
But, they want to get more of a creamy texture.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.670
Some people call it micro froth which is important
to get a good creamy froth because that's

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.610
the way the froth mixes with the espresso
and you get a really creamy drink.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.080
The taste is fantastic.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.270
So that's kind of what our goal is today,
to show you how to do that.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.730
Okay, so what do customers need to know on
how to froth?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.610
Okay, it's all about an air hole that is on
the side of the Pannarello wand.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.030
It's all a matter of, what you do is you want
to inject just the right amount of air, but

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.270
not too much.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.750
So at first you want to froth your milk, when
you get enough froth you take your milk and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.720
you actually cover up the air hole and there's
no longer sucking air in so it's not frothing

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.060
it's just heating.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.150
So it's all about timing, making sure you
know when to cover the air hole up.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.110
There's two kinds of Pannarello wands we're
going to look at today, but there are many

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.540
other styles on lots of different machines.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.960
You see it's all about the, the air intake
hole on this one is right here, you see that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.960
little groove?

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm gonna take it off, take a little better
look at it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.950
Right there, then there's a little groove
cut into there where that milk is.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.570
That's how it sucks air around this o-ring.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.570
So as soon as the milk covers that, it'll
stop frothing.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.520
Here's the other type of Pannarello wand,
uh, Morgan why don't you point out the hole

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.380
so they don't have to look at my fingernails
okay?

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.150
Right here about a quarter inch down.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.840
Now Todd why don't you demonstrate for us.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.310
Sure, okay first, always want to use cold
milk.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.200
Cold milk always froths best, always do your
frothing, which is air injecting when the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.560
milk is at its coldest.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.880
And you also want to be careful how much milk
you put in the pitcher, if you over fill it,

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.240
it'll overflow the pitcher or we won't be
able to get it hot enough.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.260
So we'll get about a third full, which is,
which would be right around, right about to

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.260
there.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.429
And you also want to know that pitcher size
is important also.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.629
If you're doing a larger one obviously you
want a bigger pitcher, a smaller or one drink,

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.120
you use a smaller pitcher.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.730
Now what if you don't put enough milk in the
pitcher, is that going to cause problems as

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.730
well?

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.930
If you don't put enough milk, it won't cover
the air hole soon enough maybe and you might

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.370
get too much air in the froth.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:26.370
Okay.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.569
So you do want to be a little bit careful
about that.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.069
Okay, like with all machines, you always want
to purge any water out of the wand that's

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.500
in there.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.569
All have a little different technique.

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.769
I filled this pitcher a third full of milk.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.040
Put the tip well below the surface.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.040
Open the steam knob and it'll start frothing.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.999
Todd, how hot do you want to make the milk?

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:53.730
Well, never over 160 degrees, after that it's
gonna lose all its flavor and it's not going

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.730
to be good.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.159
Um, I like it about 140, that's a good temperature.

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.001
Okay, see the milk's expanding and uh, I'm
going to feel the bottom of the pitcher, get

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.939
the temperature here, it's starting to get
warm.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.879
See the roll that it's got going in there
it's pretty nice.

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:15.870
Okay, now, I have all the froth I want, cover
the hole, now it's not going to froth anymore.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.530
The hole was right there.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.650
Now it's just going to heat the milk.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.269
Now if you put your hand on the bottom of
the pitcher you feel it, when it gets real

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.249
hot with the palm of your hand you know you're
about at 160, but I'm a little less than that,

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.480
cause I like it less than that, but you can
see the froth there.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.480
Looks great.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.559
It is nice, now, I'm just going to swoosh
it up a little bit, I always like to swoosh

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:38.779
it up a little bit like this before I pour
it.

00:03:38.779 --> 00:03:44.790
Now that's a nice froth, look at that, and
it's very easy to do.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.650
So Todd, let's pour a latte.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.650
Sure.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.749
Okay, just brewed a nice espresso here, and,
milk's been sitting for a couple minutes here

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.859
while we brewed the espresso so let's just
swish it up like this to keep it nice and

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.669
creamy and then we'll just show you how nice
it comes out.

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:00.669
Wow.

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:02.829
There we go.

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:03.829
Looks great.

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.349
Yeah, the way that is, the milk will mix with
the espresso just right and it'll give a great

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:09.810
flavor.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.420
Thank you so much for showing us how to froth
using the Pannarello wand.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.420
Glad to help.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:26.169
I'm Morgan, and this is Todd form Whole Latte
Love.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.180
Thanks for watching.
