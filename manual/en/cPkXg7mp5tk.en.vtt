00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
Our aim is to get the best out of the grapes, the sunshine, the rain…

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:31.300
What we’ve seen ever since our childhood mainly on this farm is that  we harvested the grapes, pressed them, took it down to the cellar.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.400
Then we put it into the barrels, it bubbled, we racked it twice, and we had wine.  And it was apparently drinkable.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.800
And it wasn’t bad. So no other way occurred to us. We were either to do it  in the way we had seen earlier or we weren’t to do it at all.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:50.100
One of the unique characters of Szekszárd is that it’s very heterogeneous,  every valley has a bit of a different climate. There is also diversity in the soils.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.200
Over there, that’s start of the 7 hectare vineyard which doesn’t have  much in common with the other end of the vineyard.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.300
Our place of growth differs slightly from the rest in that  almost all our plantations are on the top of the hill.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.800
The great advantage of it is that wind always blows here,  and gets the sunshine from both sides.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.200
So the climate is slightly more balanced  than in the valleys opposite which can overheat.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.500
Our soil is mostly loess with some clay spots with iron-oxide and lime.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:48.400
The more we restrict the grapes and the wines with technological steps,  additives or any other way while trying to play it safe by locking it away from nature,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.900
the more we’re going to lose from its character.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:00.700
One can follow the school books, we couldn’t. So we skipped this step.
