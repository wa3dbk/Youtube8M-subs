00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.450
Right now we are talking about the fact that
God often

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.190
calls us to do the impossible.
That's one of the characteristics of God's

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.369
will and Noah
and his impossible project, the Ark, are a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.699
prime
example of this.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.210
But Noah is by no means alone.
There are many, many others in the scripture.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.529
Abraham was given an impossible promise.
God told Abraham he would have as many

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.470
descendants as the stars of the sky and the
sands of

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
the sea.
But he and his wife Sarah were very, very

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.230
old and it was
impossible biologically for that to happen.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.539
Yet Abraham believed in his heart that God
was faithful

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.969
and able to fulfill His promise.
And Abraham did become the father of many

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.230
nations
just as the Lord said even though from a purely

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.989
natural biological standpoint it was impossible.
Moses is another example.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.239
Moses undertook an impossible passage.
Remember how God instructed Moses to lead

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.570
about
two million people out of Egypt and take them

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.880
to a land
that he had promised Abraham more than seven

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
hundred years earlier.
Moses had plenty of reasons to believe that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.110
it was
impossible and that he was unfit for the job.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.190
He was too old.
He wasn't a gifted speaker.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.320
He was extremely shy,
Nobody would listen to him.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.620
Pharaoh would probably kill him.
And even if he could organize the people and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.390
even if
Pharaoh would let them go how on earth could

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.530
he lead
and care for two million people in a hot desert

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.800
without
food or water?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.780
Yet despite all of these enormous obstacles
Moses

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.210
simply, even though reluctantly submitted
to the will of

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.010
God.
He obeyed to the best of his ability and you

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.580
know the
rest of the story.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.190
The miracles that Moses experienced are still
some of

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.950
the most remarkable ones in all of history.
Mary is another example.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.430
Mary had an impossible pregnancy.
As a young girl she was visited by the Angel

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.020
Gabriel
and was told that she had found favor with

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.890
God and had
been chosen to give birth to the Messiah of

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.490
Israel.
But she was just a young girl.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.300
She was a virgin and at first she wondered
how this

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.269
could happen.
But she simply submitted to the will of God.

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.860
Even though she didn't fully understand it.
And as a result she did fulfill her destiny

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.750
by giving birth
to and raising Jesus Christ.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.880
The list of people in the Bible that God called
and

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.550
instructed to do impossible things could go
on and on.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.070
Throughout history God has always chosen very
ordinary people to do very extraordinary things.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.500
Some were men, some were women.
Some were young, some were old.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.100
Some were highly educated, others were almost
illiterate but they all had one thing in common.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.560
They had all been called by God to be a part
of

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.569
something much bigger than their own lives.
Because of their willingness to simply trust

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.690
God and do
what He told them to do He used them in phenomenal

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.760
ways.
Somebody once said it this way:

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.630
It isn't silver vessels that God is looking
for.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.319
It isn't golden vessels that He needs.
He just needs yielded vessels.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.990
It seems that one of the common characteristics
of

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.209
God's will is that he very often calls us
to do things that

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.280
are impossible for us to do in our own strength.
But as we yield our lives to Him he causes

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.910
His divine
plans and dreams to become a reality in our

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.410
lives.
I want you to know something.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.069
God actually takes great pleasure in doing
things in

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.349
your life that are impossible for you to do.
Because in the end He will be the one that

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.420
receives all
the glory, all the honor and all the praise.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.140
Amen.
