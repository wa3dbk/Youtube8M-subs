00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
Hi, and here’s another update from me, because...

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.000
...that’s all you really wanted, isn’t it?

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360
So, there’s one thing I should probably
have told you before,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.160
and I didn’t, I’m sorry, it slipped my mind:

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.120
but the interview I had with The English Programme
a few weeks ago

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.120
led to me getting a regular spot on the show.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.600
I’m not going to go into detail about
how that happened.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.840
Well, except that the producer e-mailed me
and said: “Would you like a regular spot?”

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.480
So I said:

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.400
“Okay.”

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.640
It’s no big deal, it’s a little
community radio station,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.240
they have zero budget, so they’re
not actually paying me or anything like that.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.560
But... it’s there, it’s at this web address,

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.760
you can go there and click on “Listen Live”

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.960
and you can listen to it... live

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.120
on the first and third Saturday of every month;

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.080
and I’ll be there with my regular spot
I hope most weeks. And...

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.600
Yes, it will interesting to see where that leads,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.040
and if anyone has an English language radio station

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.880
and they want to pay me to appear on it,
I’m all up for that as well.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:23.920
I’ve got a request from somebody whose name
I’m not even going to attempt to pronounce,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.480
and who asks me to comment on Heino.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.000
Yeah, okay. Heino.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.680
What can I say about Heino?
Heino is a German singer.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.560
A German singer who sings in a particular
style known as “Schlager”.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.920
The only problem with commenting on him

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.920
is that I haven’t been able to find any of his
music, or any German Schlager music at all

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.320
in the public domain or under a
Creative Commons licence that I can use

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.600
without getting dinged for copyright infringement.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.000
So, I’m afraid that...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.840
...I’m going to have to listen to it
on your behalf...

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.040
...and...

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.840
...I’ll let you know.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.240
No! No! Make it stop! Make it stop!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.440
So... that’s... an interesting...

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.640
...cultural phenomen... phenomenon.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.040
And... uh, yeah, I mean...

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.920
...it’s very popular in Germany
among certain parts of the population,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.560
and, uh, Heino is... a professional.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.560
Yeah.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.320
So, Kevin MacLeod, if you’re watching this video,

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.840
I think German Schlager would be
an interesting avenue for you to explore:

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.760
I don’t think you’ve got any of that
on your site at the moment.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.160
Just one thing:

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.520
could you please, please, please give us
all plenty of warning

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.960
before you inflict it
on the rest of the human race?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.640
That would be much appreciated. Thank you.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.280
So, that’s it for now.
Until next time, good bye.
