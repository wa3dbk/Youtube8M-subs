00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.330
Shower Chairs - 7 Things to Look for Before
You Buy.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.960
Shower chairs come in many models, styles,
sizes, and uses to meet almost any need or

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.340
disability. They are available in a wide range
from those for temporary disabilities or mobility

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.660
problems to those for wheelchair dependent
persons. Before purchasing a shower aid it's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.660
important to consider several things. Below
are seven things to consider before you buy.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.470
1. Type of Disability.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.739
Before you choose the shower chair or shower
stool that will work best for you or your

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.640
loved one, you should consider the severity
of the disability. Different models are available

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.999
for a wide range of disabilities, from the
elderly who are unstable standing for long

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.769
periods to those dependent on others for all
needs.

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:51.530
2. Reason for Need.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.989
Is the shower chair for independent use or
to aid a caregiver in bathing another person?

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.179
Many are designed for both freedom of movement
for those who will be independently bathing

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.750
and to keep the person in it secure so that
a caregiver can properly clean the disabled

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.730
person.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.420
3. Weight Capacity.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.119
All shower chairs and stools have a maximum
weight capacity and you want to ensure that

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.660
it is sufficient for the person using the
chair. Putting too much weight in the chair

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:27.140
is unsafe and will eventually wear it out
causing it to collapse.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.320
4. Cost.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.210
Generally speaking, you want as many features
as you can reasonably afford for added safety

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.960
and stability. Shower stools are inexpensive
while some benches intended for those who

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.439
cannot independently bathe are more expensive.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.030
5. Ease of Use.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.729
Will the model being considered be difficult
for those using it or simple? If the shower

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.119
chair is too burdensome it's likely that it
will sit unused. You want to choose a type

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.909
that is lightweight and which a caregiver
or the person using it can securely place

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.549
in the tub or shower.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.340
6. Features.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.330
Shower chairs have several different features
available on different models. All come in

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.660
water resistant materials, usually with plastic
seats and aluminum legs. You should ensure

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.800
that the chair you purchase has the features
you desire. Some features include height adjustable

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.550
legs, arm rests, chair handles, contoured
seat, and seatbelts. Seatbelts are generally

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.750
removable by the user, but if available it
is recommended that they be used for a more

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.360
secure and stable shower.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.690
7. Additional Options.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.270
Options which may make the shower chair easier
to use include wheels, commode design with

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.840
bucket, and cushion seats and back. If necessary,
shower chairs can be purchased with locking

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.040
wheels for rolling in and out. Also, chairs
shaped like a commode seat with a removable

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.180
bucket for use in the shower can be bought.
Cushion seats and backs are generally just

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.400
for luxury and not a health concern.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.620
Once you've considered all the above things
you will be in a better position to shop for

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.950
the shower chair that will best meet the needs
of the person for whom it is being bought.
