Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this segment
we are going to talk about how to repel negative

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.090
energy. Now there's lots of different forms
of negative energy and a lot of different

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.289
definitions. But in my life I have found that
negative energy is anything that brings you

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.270
down. So if you are having a good day and
you get a phone call and someone is not being

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.720
that nice to you, that's negative energy.
And it's, tries to turn you around. And your

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.829
whole world revolves around your attitude.
And especially with your kids. I notice if

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.620
you are having a great day and the kids start
acting up and you get upset, then all of sudden

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.350
the kids act badly. So I like to keep my garden
very positive and I figure I can use as much

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.729
help as I can get. And first off I like to
have little gargoyles in my garden. Gargoyles

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.060
are wonderful for warding off negative energy.
Because they have a history, they are around

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.139
churches because they ward off evil. Because
the whole thought is if a gargoyle looks scary

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:03.269
then the negative energy will leave. And I
don't know if it works or not but it's kind

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.500
of entertaining and fun to have different
types of positive energy in your garden. I

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.390
have a wonderful Hindu goddess in my garden
as well. And she has a little parrot on her

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.539
shoulder and I always think if you've got
different types of statues in your garden

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.460
that you can also repel negative energy just
because they are very positive and they can

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.560
protect you. So it seems silly but even in
my entry way I have either a Buddha or a Hindu

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.221
or a gargoyle watching from every corner to
repel the negative energy. So it's up to you

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:40.630
whether you let the negative energy get to
you and it's just like a psycho ex boyfriend

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.850
or a psycho ex girlfriend if you keep seeing
them the energy will stay there. If you set

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.290
boundaries and you don't allow the negative
energy to get to you, the negative energy

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.840
can't. And whenever you seem down and out
and things feel real negative just surround

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.850
yourself with white light. I just like to
pretend that I have a big aura of white light

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.330
around me and I even ask someone from the
other side to help me here and there. Whether

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:10.379
you have a grandpa or a grandma or a friend
that's on the other side, negative energy

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.459
will always go away with positive energy.
So by keeping positive and refusing to let

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.760
anybody get you down you can repel any negative
energy there is.
