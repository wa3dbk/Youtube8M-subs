00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:05.850
Now of course the slab roller is the easier
way to go, but not everybody owns that piece

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.380
of equipment, so I'm going to show you how
to make a nice slab of clay with just a rolling

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.770
pin and your table. Now my table here is covered
in canvas, that way when I'm throwing the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.350
clay, it's not sticking, it gives it a nice
surface to absorb a little bit of the water

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.680
as well, if you're letting your clay set up.
So in order to make a nice big slab with the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.830
rolling pin, I'm going to stretch this out
a little bit more. I probably want to get

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.440
it to be in the end a little bit more than
a quarter of inch thick. That's a good thickness

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:47.210
to be sturdy enough to use and thick, you
know thick enough to hold up. So I've got

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.550
it a little bit thicker than that right now.
I'm going to take my really big rolling pin

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:02.070
here and I'm just going to kind of stretch
that out a little bit more

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:11.030
and make it nice and smooth. Having a really
wide rolling pin helps because then you're

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.510
more likely to have the same thickness all
the way across. If you have a really thin

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.780
rolling pin you're going to have to do it
in a couple of different places and you might

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.640
end up with ridges in the middle. So once
you've got it rolled out to about the thickness

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:36.330
that you want you want to take some kind of
drywall knife and smooth the surface. Helps

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:43.060
to, to clean off your knife first. And you're
just compressing the clay and smoothing the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.700
surface. You did get some compression with
that rolling pin, but this gives you just

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:58.270
a little bit more. And if you have a few ridges,
that's okay because we're probably going to

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.979
end up wiping those out in the next steps
of the process. So now we have a nice slab

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:03.250
of clay.
