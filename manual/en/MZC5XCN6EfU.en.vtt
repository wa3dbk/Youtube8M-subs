00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.280
Hey guys! Welcome to the last day of the Sanja Festival!

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.340
I'm here with the Komagata Team

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.540
and I will be filming some pretty cool stuff today

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.260
It's the last day so the 3 big mikoshi are out

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.861
So I'm excited to see those

00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:20.744
I was here yesterday as well but I only got to see the small shrines

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:22.024
So, fun!

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.400
Sanja Matsuri is the biggest festival in Tokyo and is known for getting pretty rowdy!

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860
Neighbourhoods around the temple are separated into teams called "choukai"

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.600
with each having their own mikoshi

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.740
Shinto followers believe that mikoshi serve as a vehicle to transport deities between shrines

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.440
So everyone fights to try to get in to carry the mikoshi

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.460
This is why Sanja Matsuri can get a little intense!

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.500
How many years have you been doing the Sanja festival?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.880
I did Sanja for the first time in 2007

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.060
What was your most memorable Sanja experience?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.520
It was probably my first year

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.620
I was just sitting, watching and some guy just picked me up and took off his hanten

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.660
He put it on me, and pushed me in and I've kinda been in love with it ever since

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.980
Why is today considered the climax of the festival?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.180
Sunday is like everything

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.900
The day where they bring out the 3 main mikoshi

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.260
the three main mikoshi get passed around the areas

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.580
Everyone like jumps in, fights to be a part of it

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.260
So much passion, so much excitement

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.140
and the day just ends with everyone drinking, it's a great time

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.340
Yakuza used to be one of the biggest parts of Sanja matsuri, and this would have been a common sight

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.580
But because of recent tightening of rules you won't be seeing many people proudly displaying tattoos anymore

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.720
I got the chance to carry one of the three larger main mikoshi

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.680
Some of the mikoshi weigh nearly 1000 pounds

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.020
Sanja matsuri attracts around 2 million visitors each year.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.260
Definitely an event I would recommend checking out!

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.660
How was it?

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.100
Awesome! Good work out

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.820
It was cool

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.920
Today was your first time participating in the Sanja Matsuri! How was it?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.460
So much fun! I've never done anything like this, even in my hometown

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.880
so it's a really exciting first experience for me!

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.860
What did you enjoy the most?

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.260
Carrying the mikoshi was the best!

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.280
It was scary! It's not that hard, but

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.140
you're being pulled in a thousand directions

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.100
and getting pushed around, but it's really fun!

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.020
Alright guys, now for the after Sanja meal of dojou or loaches

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.440
I think I like the sound of them better in Japanese

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.440
They are small fish!

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.990
We're going to take some and put them on our dish

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:00.140
and add some green onions and some sanshou or "Japanese pepper"

00:05:01.186 --> 00:05:02.706
Let's give them a shot!

00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:14.868
Ooo I love gobou (burdock root)

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The name of this shop is Komagata Dozeu

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
This shop has been around for 200 years! In this exact same spot

00:05:35.053 --> 00:05:37.133
and I'm pretty excited to try it

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:45.180
Do you like sanshou?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.680
I love sanshou!

00:05:46.964 --> 00:05:49.124
Alright, I'll try a little piece

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.320
Mmmm loachesâ™¡

00:05:57.596 --> 00:06:00.276
They're really good, the name sounds horrible but they're yummy!

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:05.306
Really subtle flavour, I thought they were gonna be super fishy. But not at all!

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.440
The festival is finished off with a chant called "kiyari"

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.320
Alright I hope you guys enjoyed that!
