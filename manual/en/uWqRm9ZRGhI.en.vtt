00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.500
in tomorrow's debate about the moderator
will be candy crowley

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.250
and uh... it's a town hall format where

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.760
members of the audience to ask the
question and candy crowley wood pellet

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.159
basically had the mike to the audience
back to ask the question

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:16.589
neck and he has recently been on
television and video blogs that she

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:21.279
wants to follow up questions and you
know if found the phones never ask this

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.309
question and you know she would say once
an opportunity for me to follow up and

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:28.340
said hey what up acts were out why would
a z

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.329
anyway i let's go to the tape and show
explained why she envisions her role to

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.130
be in the sex today

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.389
try not about me

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:36.770
and that's why keep

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.020
when this is an are you about this or
not that i think it's not about yours on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.880
the is what these two guys you can go
and thinking you will definitely do the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.690
s_ and he was like parenting

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.300
you know if you decide that you're never
ever had to do something and then you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.079
find yourself doing after also think it
helps when they see past the rockingham

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:54.659
here up in a big lecture

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.099
right here in our yard while an f_y_i_
thing which really is william looked

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:02.159
like i was in the room what was that the
dillard obeyed him he was another when

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:02.809
was the

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.490
mile wide but he's kind of downsizing
that

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.910
it doesn't that kind of thing does
matter things are gonna slip past you

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.970
and then what i think they have accepted
that like that all is this something

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.820
and i bet you do this to there's never a
show that goes by there's never a piece

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.550
that i write that i don't look back at
what happened in bishara don that she's

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.130
gonna start asking follow-up questions
this causes a big problem with the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.870
campaigns and i guess so what happened
is ah... the commission for presence of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.700
the dates which is actually

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.850
is not a non-partisan commission

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.220
this people think it is right actually
had bipartisan commission gap

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.830
the whole point of the commission is to
make both sides looked good yes and they

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.020
don't once a month some journalists
rolling off he still has a full-size

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.549
came out i think about what

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.539
with vigorous complaints about the our
candy crowley's comments and they want

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.279
in your car and make sure she doesn't
ask follow-up questions

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:53.709
they want her to basically be the growth
microphone go from person to person

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:54.629
handed over

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.540
i don't quite know what the purpose of
that is

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.189
but they don't want any follow-ups

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.469
they wont they wanted the bait to
basically be an opportunity for them

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.870
started talking points

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.170
and this is come from doesn't obama as
well as mit romney i think this from the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.960
right

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.260
and when i see this from from the left
and i must say i'm very disappointed

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.450
right well the single people don't
understand is the way they used to do

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.319
the bates

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.319
was the now league of women voters will
organize a debates and they would invite

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.680
the candidates and they were the ones
who pretty much

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.060
ran the whole show well as soon as they
figured out that we're gonna have to do

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.450
a debate every time there's an
electrical until election they decided

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.680
to take it over a meaning they the
politicians for the democrats

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.970
in the republicans and got rid of the
league of women voters debates

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.010
and they decided to have their
overbought body which is not not

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.930
participate in bipartisan which is not
the same thing

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.330
it so they decided he was the easiest
way what's a format that makes us look

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.700
the best that will cause is the most
harmful to lisa munna harmony picked it

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.489
and then they get to pick the moderator

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.280
and the fact is on this story

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.599
uh... candy crowley comes out and says
that she is gonna ask follow-up

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.690
questions

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.980
they both the campaigns get wind of it

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.810
and they don't know if she's not
reporting that we have an agreement so

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.790
they don't have a great with candy
crowley there have been agree with

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.520
c_n_n_ they have an agreement with each
other so they're going to make raheem

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.090
brock obama's campaigns have agreed
what's gonna happen and they didn't even

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.889
bother asked the news person that's how
much this piece of news

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:20.599
this is emblematic of the problem that
we have in america today

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.329
our political process and has been
completely hijacked is not about having

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.379
an honest debate of ideas it's all about
who has a better better uh... aesthetics

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.450
better visuals better but our optics as
they would say

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.720
so you have a uni so you need to have a
paul candidate you can have that they

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.769
can't be short they need to uh... you
know looked like a president

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:42.969
it's all about

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.219
uh... in a style over substance and
rather than having a vigorous debate

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:50.849
where we can understand her ideas we
just here they're talking points and

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.859
that's did and i can't believe both
sides are happy with that and the fact

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.419
that they want they

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.999
a docile media that never ask any
questions no follow ups on the east a

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:05.279
cancer in the news move on that's what
they want and that's what they they're

00:04:05.279 --> 00:04:06.899
getting to work getting

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:10.599
i mean we never see on the east in the
anyone go after

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.219
uh... the candidates

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.369
it's very very rarely do and when they
do is

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.370
is so strong

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.659
you talking about the news media fold on
the job not ask rumpled

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:22.940
politicians' feet to the fires i guess i
better

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.159
well and i said it before the show the
problem is that good news media

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.559
uh... the way our system is set up is
that the news media is like a check on

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:31.380
power

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.559
not only political power but also
corporate power right

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:36.960
so what happened was these news people

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.790
cap investigating politicians in
investigating corporations

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.330
and the corporations act i'm so sick and
tired of them i'm gonna go by those

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.180
newspeople

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.530
so they bought the newspeople and then
they bought the government so now it's

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.680
all being run by one big corporate

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.190
uh... it's a good one big corporate
monopoly that runs everything rain so

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.020
that's why

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.659
you get every whatever there is any
journalism that happens it's rare

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:00.860
it almost never happens which is why

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.770
uh... we have a system that we have so
that this is what the stress the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.900
problems of the problem is that the
people who was

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.020
but don't the watchdog we have the
what's the old saying we have the fox

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.619
guarding the hen house

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:13.889
and that's with the proper so the people
who should be being investigated

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.909
actually on the investigators

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.289
and that's what we give people like
uh...

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:22.169
david gregory and john stossel up
against and uh...

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.819
and and candy crowley you know i mean i
don't know much about caning so i want

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.889
to disparage ertl she does a bad job

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:29.659
but it's that

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.979
but i'm i'm guessing she will what does
this uh... this is one of the other

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.830
minds i think it's been going for it i
want you guys think about this guy i

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.309
wasn't sure

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.069
uh... they were saying they waited for
of keno moderator to come along before

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:42.809
they jump but them

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.229
with this kind of uh... you know i guess
is line of attack previous to them doing

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:48.860
that the debate saying

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.949
would automatically fall courses source
of those other female

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.529
journalist x moderators ever say hope
she steps up its like a women's rights

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:59.979
thing but they wouldn't do this to a
male moderator and say before and you're

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:01.039
going to

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.219
do it this way because we need you to
dissuade you dennis

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:06.160
at standard on sir

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.840
i count on the split is to remain we
we'd we just we just had a martha rest

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.139
of the last one incredible one side it
was attacked her before and xia

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.300
if you have is that the rats actually
did her job i think she actually asked

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.479
kind of such a good follow-up questions

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.619
and now they're coming after candy
crowley ended the suggestion is that

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:26.569
maybe it's that they would do this to a
male they wouldn't have and um... i'm

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.919
not sure about about that i mean opinion
whether they were due to a man or woman

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:30.789
but

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.740
clearly what they're doing is

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.719
behaving themselves crowley told paula
martha routed yes we did like that at

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:39.300
all yes if you want to go back to being
jim lehrer yes
