00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.730
So this morning I came out and guess what
I found?

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.730
Blankets all over my garden.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.730
Nah, I am just kidding.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.730
I did not grow blankets over night.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.830
What I did do, however, is at 8:00 last night
I heard it was going to frost.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.619
Imminent disaster but I solved it.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.040
I came out and covered up all the babies and
they are doing great.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.539
So right now I am going to uncover everything
and get started with the second day of gardening.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.380
So here is some of the plants that we are
planting.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.509
This is thyme.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.640
It is a Bonnie plant and this one happens
to be an organic plant that they promote.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.960
And I really – it is in wonderful shape.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.110
And if you could just smell it – oooh, it
smells wonderful.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.850
And we are also planting sage.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.500
This is just common sage.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.750
And basil right here.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.649
Now here we have lavender which is already
planted in the ground.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.350
And we have – this is Greek oregano.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.130
And then over here we have rosemary.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.990
Rosemary is extremely sensitive and is not
hardy in the Chicago land area.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:19.649
So for it, you read the Rosemary here it says
it is very cold-tolerant but that still does

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:21.109
not count winter.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.520
It will not winter over.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.329
So I am going to plant this in a large pot.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.390
So now we are going to dig a hole.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.390
Look down here.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.499
And we are planting one of our thyme plants.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:52.789
I like to plant the thymes right along the
path because as you brush by it, it smells

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.619
incredible.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.539
What we are going to do is plant it.

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.539
This is a plant-able pot.

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:02.539
You can plant the whole thing.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.539
I take the plastic off the top.

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.539
And you plant it right in the ground.

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:06.099
And what we are doing is we are planting right
up to the top of the pot and we are covering

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:12.620
it with all this good, black soil from our
garden.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.020
All right and there you go.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.020
Done planting.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.200
I am going to build a little path that leads
up here and over to where these plants are

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200
being planted.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.200
This is a zucchini.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200
You see three zucchini plants.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.590
They are going to be huge.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.120
Those are beans.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.340
And this is cucumber.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.100
Now, you note that they are all planted in
a circle, or they will be planted in a few

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.100
minutes.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.100
See the circle?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.610
And this one only three because these are
ginormous when they get big.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.730
And what I am going to do is plant towers
that are tomato stakes.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.190
They are special tomato stakes around each
of these.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.870
And then what will happen is the vines will
grow right up them.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.350
The path will allow me to go right in there
so that I can pick vegetables.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.260
And it gets sun most of the day.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.180
But why this is a real experiment is because
these guys are planted really close to my

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.180
water source.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.440
This is a rain barrel and it is right up next
to the house so it get more shade.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.830
So I am not sure how the zucchinis are going
to turn out.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.320
It is an experiment.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.030
We are going to have fun and check it out.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.030
Ok, we finished planting the path.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.960
You can see it allows me access to the water.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.460
Here you see we planted basil.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.980
And the rest of the herb garden.
