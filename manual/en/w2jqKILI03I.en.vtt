up there

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.380

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.390
a while when I was living in Peru so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.650
I know the place it's one of my favorite
season the entire world it's a beautiful

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.030
architecture and then you've got these
massive volcanoes

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.239
in the background and everything is just
absolutely stunning

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.600
were there for a day uh little bit over
day

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.700
and then we're into the Colca Canyon which
is the second

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.140
deepest Canyon on the entire planet and
not only is it a huge Canyon absolutely

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.780
beautiful

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.820
but it's also home to the largest flying
bird in the world

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.500
the South America or the Andeans condors and we get up close and personal

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.540
with them hopefully

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.840
I've been to the Colca Canyon eight times in
there's never been a time they've gone

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.930
that I haven't seen them

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.280
on some locations you get really close
to the light sometimes this week

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.290
really near you other times you see them
off in the distance but

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.170
I hope will see that there's never a
guarantee we will do our best to spot

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.550
some

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.240
and will definitely see it see some
other things in the Colca canyons

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.620

earlier so really interesting people

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.950

is the world's

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.690
highest navigable lake it is high I'll

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.610
off the top of my head I think it's 3910 meters

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.580
and we're gonna do home stay out on Amantani

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.260

view it

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.560
awesome opportunity to use a portrait

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.590
interesting subject and the island
itself is beautiful out there

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.850
so if you weren't a landscape

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.080
out there on from there we had to
Cusco, which obviously is the center

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.610
of South america in so many ways

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.280
it's the center the epicenter of history
culture and all that good stuff

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.770

on the way to Aguas Calientes
which

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.509
