Hi! I'm Drew Finn here for Expert Village.
We are going to talk about standard hand tools

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.231
and how to use them. This is a hammer, a most
common hammer that you would have around the

00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.810
household. It is a claw hammer. It's called
that because it has a claw on the back of

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.380
it. There are other types of hammers but this
is the most common one for nailing wood and

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.540
stuff and the claws for removing nails. This
is a hammer that's got a metal handle with

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.219
a rubber grip on it which is very good if
you are going to be doing a lot of framing.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:45.000
It isolates the vibration better so your hand
does not get as tired. This is a wood one

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.719
which a lot of people prefer the feel of it.
Again, so much personal preference for that

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.490
kind of stuff. Now one of the big differences
between these two particular ones is this

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:06.970
is a much steeper curve to the claw part.
You can get a wood handle with any type of

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.750
claw. Some of them come straight back but
the handle can be on any type of head. It's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.220
just a different type of handle system. So
what the claw is used for is for pulling nails.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.820
You can pull the nail out. Now one thing that
I wanted to point out was when you are pulling

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.740
a nail out, the least force to pull it out
is going to be straight up and down and if

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.880
you start pulling it to the side, how that
can happen is with the claw itself. If you

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.820
have a claw here and you are grabbing the
nail way up here, once you pull it up part

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.890
way it really goes at an angle. So what you
are doing is you are bending the nail and

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.700
pushing it into the wood at the same time.
Ideally you pull it straight up but you don't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.329
get a lever action by pulling it completely
straight up. So the thing to do is when you

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:09.460
are pulling a nail, is you go down when it
is low you pull it up some and see it is starting

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.190
to go sideways. What you want to do is take
a hammer, a piece of wood, stick it underneath

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.940
and grab the nail again. So you are pulling
more straight up with it and that way the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.640
nail will be easier to withdraw from the wood.
