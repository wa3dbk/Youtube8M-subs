00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:06.855
- So let's say a patient's
Heart Failure gets to this point

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.292
where medications and
lifestyle changes help

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:10.980
but really, they just aren't enough.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.548
And the patient's symptomatic
almost all the time.

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:15.201
Well, that's when we start to think about

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.704
medical device implants or surgery.

00:00:18.394 --> 00:00:20.128
So there are actually a few
types of medical devices

00:00:20.128 --> 00:00:21.376
that can be used.

00:00:21.603 --> 00:00:24.836
And the first one we call
the ventricular assist device

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:27.611
or sometimes just the VAD, V-A-D.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.517
This device assists or it
helps the patient's ventricle

00:00:31.517 --> 00:00:32.986
or ventricles.

00:00:33.282 --> 00:00:34.896
Since with Heart Failure
one or both ventricles

00:00:34.896 --> 00:00:36.608
aren't pumping very well,

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.589
these devices actually help out with that

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.589
and essentially take over the
pumping for the ventricle.

00:00:42.163 --> 00:00:43.162
And so how they typically work

00:00:43.162 --> 00:00:45.124
is that there's this small tube

00:00:45.124 --> 00:00:47.830
that attaches to the
ventricle that needs help.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.757
And we'll say that in this case

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.493
the left ventricle needs help.

00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:53.446
And so it's coming from the
bottom of the ventricle, here.

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:55.259
So at this point the blood,

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:56.838
instead of exiting out the artery

00:00:56.838 --> 00:01:00.965
as you'd normally expect it
to, it sort of rerouted, here.

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:06.747
And so it goes through this
tube to this separate pump.

00:01:07.202 --> 00:01:09.422
The VAD then pumps it out
through this next tube

00:01:09.422 --> 00:01:12.551
which connects up with the
artery and then leaves the heart.

00:01:13.602 --> 00:01:15.348
So we're sort of bypassing this whole area

00:01:15.948 --> 00:01:18.547
and letting the VAD shoulder
all the pumping work.

00:01:19.353 --> 00:01:22.151
These VADs are usually connected
to a small control unit

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:24.101
that's actually outside the body.

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:26.951
So a cable goes from the
inside, connected to the VAD,

00:01:27.073 --> 00:01:29.061
through a small hole in the abdomen,

00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:31.007
to a control unit that's outside,

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.209
and it's also connected to some batteries.

00:01:33.412 --> 00:01:35.095
Both of which are usually kind of worn

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.284
with straps over the body.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.040
So I drew it for the left ventricle

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.588
and so usually we call
that a left VAD or an LVAD.

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.943
But you can certainly have one
for the right ventricle too.

00:01:47.192 --> 00:01:49.868
And we call that an RVAD or a right VAD.

00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:53.015
Those usually connect
up to the right atrium,

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:54.487
take blood to the pump,

00:01:54.487 --> 00:01:56.807
and then give it back to the
artery on the right side,

00:01:56.807 --> 00:01:58.680
which heads off to the lungs.

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:00.857
You can even have a BiVAD,

00:02:00.857 --> 00:02:03.405
meaning that there's a
pump for each ventricle.

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:06.754
And depending on the VAD it may pump blood

00:02:06.754 --> 00:02:09.767
just like your heart does,
kind of rhythmically.

00:02:09.854 --> 00:02:12.880
But it could also be a
continuous flow of blood.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.188
So in that case, there's no pumping.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.913
And you might not have a normal pulse

00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:19.821
but your body's still getting
the blood that it needs.

00:02:20.453 --> 00:02:23.019
Implantable VADs are usually
reserved for people who are

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.888
either waiting for a heart transplant

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:26.653
or as a long term solution

00:02:26.653 --> 00:02:29.747
for those that actually
can't have heart transplants.

00:02:33.618 --> 00:02:35.475
So the other type of
medical device implant

00:02:35.475 --> 00:02:38.501
is something called Cardiac
Resynchronization therapy.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.543
This could be a pacemaker only

00:02:40.543 --> 00:02:44.503
or it could be a special dual
pacemaker and defibrillator.

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.888
For the pacemaker you
have this small device

00:02:46.888 --> 00:02:48.577
that's implanted in the chest.

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:50.255
And then these electrical wires are,

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:52.867
sometimes we call them leads,
that go from the device

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:55.787
to both the left and the right ventricles.

00:02:56.094 --> 00:02:57.011
One thing to notice though,

00:02:57.011 --> 00:03:00.169
is that to actually get
to the left ventricle

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.316
they have to go in through
your coronary veins

00:03:02.316 --> 00:03:04.526
and then kind of go around the heart

00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:07.199
to the outside of the left ventricle.

00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:09.190
And that's why I kind
of drew it dotted as it,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.657
as soon as it's going, sort
of around the backside.

00:03:12.173 --> 00:03:13.787
With Heart Failure we
know that both the right

00:03:13.787 --> 00:03:16.175
and the left ventricles can be
affected differently, right?

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:19.854
And so what can happen is that
they beat at different times.

00:03:19.854 --> 00:03:22.640
And this makes the heart
a way less efficient pump.

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:26.476
The pacemaker sends signals
down these wires or these leads

00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:28.554
at the same time to tell both ventricles

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:30.337
to pump at the same time,

00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.023
leading to a much more normal
and efficient pumping action.

00:03:34.951 --> 00:03:36.255
Now this device might also come with

00:03:36.255 --> 00:03:38.138
what's called a defibrillator.

00:03:38.446 --> 00:03:39.472
If the patient's Heart Failure

00:03:39.472 --> 00:03:41.642
leads to life threatening
rapid heart rates,

00:03:41.642 --> 00:03:44.741
and then it's going sort
of uncontrollably fast,

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:46.410
the device can deliver a shock

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.422
that sort of resets the
heart to a normal rhythm.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.212
But besides medical device implants

00:03:53.212 --> 00:03:55.923
a patient can also have
a surgical intervention.

00:03:56.688 --> 00:03:59.493
And so they might be given
stents to help with blood flow

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:01.438
for coronary artery disease.

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:04.091
These are placed over
areas in the arteries

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.658
that have plaque buildup

00:04:05.867 --> 00:04:08.363
which help to widen the
arteries and make it easier

00:04:08.363 --> 00:04:09.982
for blood to flow through them.

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:13.094
And so then it's easier for
the heart to pump through them.

00:04:14.342 --> 00:04:17.796
Another surgery is called
a coronary artery bypass.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.344
This surgical technique bypasses

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.526
or sort of reroutes the blood supply

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:24.741
around a blocked artery instead.

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:27.276
Again, just like a stent
it makes it a lot easier

00:04:27.276 --> 00:04:28.911
to pump through this artery

00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:30.474
that's not blocked anymore, right?

00:04:31.025 --> 00:04:34.229
Usually the doctor connects
or sometimes we say grafts

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.912
a healthy artery from
somewhere else in the body

00:04:35.912 --> 00:04:39.378
where its absence isn't
as much of a big deal.

00:04:40.544 --> 00:04:41.485
Finally, what's considered

00:04:41.485 --> 00:04:43.563
the ultimate surgical intervention

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:45.717
is a complete heart transplantation.

00:04:46.258 --> 00:04:48.837
This is where the patient's
entire heart is removed

00:04:48.847 --> 00:04:51.341
and replaced with a healthy donor heart.

00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:54.142
And this procedure is
really limited to patients

00:04:54.142 --> 00:04:56.791
that are considered at
end stage Heart Failure

00:04:56.791 --> 00:05:00.466
or where other medical treatments
in surgery have failed.
