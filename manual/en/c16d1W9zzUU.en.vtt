00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.790
There are some very specific tips which apply
specifically to the ecommerce websites.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.071
The first one that I would suggest that you
look into is the amount of content that you

00:00:13.071 --> 00:00:14.440
have on your website.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.950
You have to be mindful of a Panda update.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.840
Ever since the update came out, Google is
looking very closely at the type of content

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640
that websites have and websites that have
very thin pages with very little content on

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.860
them, they may get penalized.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.860
Unfortunately, Google is not able to determine
if you have an ecommerce website or a blog

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.960
or are using some kind of a content management
system that basically creates pages with very

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.620
little content on them.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.749
What you have to make sure is that product
pages, the ones that usually have content

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:49.899
that looks template like, for example, you
have a product page which contains description

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.629
made by the manufacturer, or you're using
a product page for a specific product that

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.640
looks like it's been generated by a template.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.449
You have to make sure to either try to add
content on them.

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.730
You can use things like user generated content
reviews, which is very valuable, or what you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:09.549
can also do is write content yourself.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.350
If you are in a position where you know you
have hundreds or even thousands of different

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.140
product pages and you know that yourself you
cannot personally add unique content to these

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.270
pages, which is going to add value and prevent
you from getting penalized by Panda, it may

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.469
be a good idea at this point to basically
de-index those pages from Google.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.689
Or at least to put a no follow on them and
try to concentrate all of your link building

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.799
efforts in sending all of your link juice
towards the category pages, so the pages which

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.439
will list your products, and these pages only.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.429
The second tip I would say that is very important
is to have high quality images on your website.

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:53.659
This is an ecommerce SEO tip, but it also
just doesn't work just for SEO, it also increases

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.390
the conversion rates on your website, because
if someone is visiting your ecommerce site,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.179
the pictures are smaller, pixelated, your
conversion rates are going to suffer.

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.170
Why it can be good for SEO is because you
can get links referrals from people taking

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.910
your picture, posting it on their website
and giving you credit.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.019
Or it may attract referrals and views from
websites like Pinterest that are interested

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.840
in those high quality images.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.180
Another very useful SEO ecommerce tip is when
you're structuring, when you have your website,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.750
make sure that whatever template you're using
or whatever content management system you're

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.519
using on the back end of your ecommerce website,
it creates canonical pages.

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.349
Because when you have an ecommerce website,
sometimes what happens is that one page is

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.030
going to have 10 different URLs.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.450
What that tells Google, it may tell Google,
is that it's duplicate content on your page.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.549
But in reality, it's not.

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.129
What Google came out with is a concept called
"Canonical Page."

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.040
What happens is, if you have 10 different
URLs which are pointing to the same page,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.019
you can have a canonical tag which indicates
to Google that all these other nine pages

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.060
are irrelevant.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.590
They're just copies and the real canonical
page, the one that should be counted is just

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.590
one URL.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.439
Do it, because it may hurt your SEO efforts
if you don't.

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.049
Do content marketing and create link bait.

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.640
It's very important, because when people look
at their analytics and they look at the keywords

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.629
which bring visitors to their website, oftentimes,
what they discover is that, "What is this

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.629
keyword.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.760
I never actually targeted that specific keyword."

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.209
You're going to learn what time that a lot
of visitors that you get to your website,

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:38.140
they're not targeting specific keywords which
are anticipated, it's completely unique terms

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.140
that they're typing in.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.960
As long as you write relevant content, which
is very factual, it's rich in media, for example,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:50.550
images or videos, it's going to attract relevant
visitors, your target demographic to your

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.550
website.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.319
At the same time, it's going to create link
bait.

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.661
If someone sees that you wrote an excellent
article in regards to your niche, they may

00:03:57.661 --> 00:04:02.730
post it on their blog and create a link back
to your website.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.870
Another thing is things like link bait, so
there's a great example by a website called

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.140
ice.com.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.730
What they did is they actually had an app
where a person can take a picture of their

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.280
finger and once they are using this app, they
can see what a ring is going to look like

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.840
on their finger once they buy it.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.660
It basically allows you to try out a ring
in a virtual manner.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.990
You'd best believe that, of course, this is
going to create link bait.

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.460
It's going to create all this talk and mentions
about this specific app that they have, and

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.949
it's going to create link backs back to their
websites.

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:43.860
The fifth SEO ecommerce tip is to create content
for your ecommerce website.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.110
For example, you're selling household goods,
decorative items, what you can do is have

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.979
a contest where a person is going to describe
the best use for your product, for your decorative

00:04:54.979 --> 00:05:00.850
item, in their household, and they can win
$500 by participating in the contest.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.220
The way that they participate is by leaving
a comment on your page, on your contest page.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.380
But to participate, they must do one of the
two things.

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.210
They must either like and share it on Facebook,
or they must tweet it.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.250
That's going to create backlinks and views
to your website.

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.240
Number six is to do personalized gift giveaways.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.410
What you're doing is, you're targeting the
people which are the most active in most of

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.060
your clients, and then you give them personalized
gift giveaways.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.580
Oftentimes, you're going to see what happens
is that those people are going to take pictures

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.410
of the personalized gift that you sent them,
and they're going to post it on their social

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.610
media websites like Pinterest, Facebook, Twitter.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.680
As an example, there was a very large company
that did this personalized gift giveaway and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.330
they analyzed the customers that they have
chose just the ones which are most active.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.310
They got 100 percent of those clients that
got the free gifts, they actually posted those

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:04.389
pictures on their social media profiles, and
it got them thousands upon thousands of visitors

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:05.479
and page readers.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.539
The next thing that you can do for you ecommerce
website is to create deal pages, and then,

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.711
once you have a deal page, for example, for
Black Friday or for some Cyber Monday, you're

00:06:15.711 --> 00:06:20.319
going to contact coupon websites and mommy
bloggers and tell them about this great deal

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.229
that you're having.

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.100
Whenever they mention your website, that's
going to create a backlink back to your website,

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.889
and ultimately, is going to be good for your
SEO optimization for any ecommerce website.

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.260
Another thing that you can do for your ecommerce
website in terms of SEO is to spy on your

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:36.349
competition.

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:40.410
You run a link report on the website that
is beating you in the search engine result

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.539
page, and you see exactly where it is, where
they get their links.

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.330
Then you try to go to those same websites
and also get the links.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.080
One of the things that I've seen with a lot
of websites is that whenever they're doing

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.979
the link report on their competition, they
have a lot of these aha moments.

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:01.129
They're like, I see they're doing this, they're
applying this specific technique to promote

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:05.270
their website, so it's going to give you great
insights into how the competition is doing

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.669
so you can leverage that knowledge to then
SEO optimize your ecommerce website.
