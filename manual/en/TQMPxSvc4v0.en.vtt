00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.090
Hey dudes, I'm Hilah and today on Hilah Cooking,
I have something to say to breakfast.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.350
"Yo breakfast, quit monkeying around!

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.170
Yeah you got some crispy waffles but we're
gonna make 'em brown.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.599
We'll add chocolate chips, and some cocoa
don't hurt.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.389
These waffles are so good you could eat 'em
for dessert.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.949
Waffle rap."

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:30.919
Alright, so I've got some dry ingredients
I'm going to whisk together just really to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.189
get the lumps out.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160
So this is just all-purpose flour.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.510
I'm adding some cocoa powder, some baking
powder with a little bit of salt, and some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.510
brown sugar.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.450
You could totally use white sugar, but I like
the sort of like carameliness that the brown

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.580
sugar adds.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
Just get those little lumps broke up.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.030
So once you get those combined, we're going
to mix up our wet ingredients.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.530
For these, I'm using some banana to replace
some of the butter and the egg.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.299
I happen to have these little cutie tootie
bananas just because, aren't they adorable?

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.689
Isn't it way more fun to eat baby things than
full things?

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.540
We need about half a cup of mashed banana.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.920
I'm guessing it will be two or three of these
little guys, but just one standard sized banana

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920
also is fine.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.880
You want to make sure that they're ripe, so
they're yellow with some little brown spots.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.750
You don't want to use anything too green or
it won't mash up very well.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.549
Get that little penis tip out of there.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.700
I'm going to mash this up and see if I need
to add a third one to get half a cup.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.929
I think I will.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:49.399
If you don't like bananas, there is a little
bit of a banana flavor to these which I enjoy,

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.850
but you could also just use some apple sauce.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.719
Okay.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:01.930
So then once you get that mashed up we'll
add one egg, some melted butter, and some

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.600
milk, and then just combine all that.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.020
Excellente presidente!

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.040
Alright, now we're just going to add the wet
to the dry.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.080
Get all that good stuff in there.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.430
You just want to mix it up.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.680
Be a little bit gentle with it.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.060
You don't want the gluten to form from the
flour and make tough waffles.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.840
So don't over-mix it.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.630
We're just gonna mix it until all the dry
ingredients are moist.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.950
When it's about like that, it's almost completely
mixed up, we can add in some semi-sweet chocolate

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.710
chips and vanilla extract.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.700
Ha!

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.470
Just about a teaspoon.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.030
If you wanted to add cinnamon or something
like that, I think that would probably be

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.000
pretty tasty too.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.540
As soon as all the dry stuff is wet, we are
ready to cook our waffles.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.580
Once your waffle iron is heated up, this one's
got a really nice non-stick grate so I don't

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.450
need to oil it or anything, but just follow
the instructions on yours.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.930
We're going to drop in about half of a cup
of batter.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.540
Spread it out just a little.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.620
Then I've got some just raw pecans here.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.150
I'm going to sprinkle a few of those on top.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.560
This is totally optional, but it adds a nice
little texture, and then the nuts get a little

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.260
bit toasted from that waffle iron as the waffle
cooks.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.790
It's a nice little touch.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.410
It means that you care.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.610
You could use walnuts or whatever, weed, probably
not a very efficient way to ingest marijuana,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.660
but whatever.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.950
So we'll just let this go.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:48.530
It will start steaming.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.819
Once it stops steaming and it opens up easily,
you're good to go and it's waffle time.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:02.490
Oh, oh la la, alright.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.740
So there we go.

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:14.310
Pull this out, it's nice and toasty, chocolate
chips are melty, lovely.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.160
You could serve these with maple syrup like
most regular waffles, but because there's

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.180
chocolate involved I think these are way more
deliciouser if you serve them with some fruit.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.760
Like maybe some more sliced bananas or some
strawberries in this case, some fruits of

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.970
the forest.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.180
And then you can put ice cream on them if
you wanted to serve it for desert, or you

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.530
could do some whipped cream in a can.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.560
I honest to God have never purchased or used
this product before, so I hope it's as easy

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.040
to use and delicious as the packaging looks.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.250
Okay, hoping I can get an awesome smiley face
to happen here.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.770
One, two, oh that makes a great sound.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.480
What a fun sound that makes, guys.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.820
Alright, there you go.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.730
There's a happy chocolate chip waffle face.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.090

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.419
Alright, let's taste this.

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.780
So these are like, man, I don't know if you
can hear that crunchy crunch, but I can hear

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.780
it.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.410
Let's get a big bite, mmm.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.040
Look how pretty that is, how lovely.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.040
Mmm mmm.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.250
Mmm mmm mmm.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.510
Waffle time, waffle time, do you know its
waffle time.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:40.900
See, chocolate chip waffles don't have to
just be raps.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.380
