Hi, I’m Natsumi Kitta. 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.280
Today, I’m going to show you the make up tutorial, which is recommended for group dating.  

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.080
This is natural trendy makeup to be popular in this spring. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.240
First, I’m going to use an eyebrow pencil.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:27.940
Try to avoid too thick or too thin brow shape, because guys wouldn’t prefer. The point is to create natural eyebrow, which suits your face feature. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.400
I’m going to use eyebrow shadow next.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.460
Then, use brow mascara.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
Now, I’m going to do my eye makeup.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.740
Take the eye shadow on the top an put on your entire upper and lower eyelid.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.500
I recommend pearly eye shadow when you go out. Your eyes would reflect beautifully in the sunlight.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.720
Then, apply dark brown on your double eyelid.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.140
Put on eye shadow like an eye line and draw it from your corner tail of lower eyelid to the iris. 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.460
Now, I’m going to use pencil eyeliner.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.260
Use liquid eyeliner to draw only corner tail of the eye.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.460
for the finishing touch, use brown eye shadow to blend the eye line.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.940
Make a favorable impression and create natural makeup, do not draw lower eye line and blend eye line by eye shadow.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.880
Before applying false eye lashes, put on mascara.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.740
In the last, apply false eye lashes.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.780
Put on mascara on your lower eye lashes.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.040
Brush cheek color roundly on your highest point of the cheek.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.240
I’m going to use this lipstick.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.760
Choose elegant pink lipstick color which is favorable with male friends. 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.580
To create plump lips, put on lip gross only your center of the lips.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.580
This is the final look. 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.740
Thank you for watching and hope you enjoyed the show.
