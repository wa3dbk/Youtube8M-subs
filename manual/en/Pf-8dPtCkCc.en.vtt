00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.480
Today we are going to be installing wiring
harness part number 119175 on a 1997 Chrysler

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Concorde.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.820
OK, we are inside the trunk area here, and
as you can see, I have gone ahead and removed

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.860
the rear carpeting to expose the wires that
we are going to be tapping into to wire the

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.860
wiring harness.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.810
We can go ahead and access most of the wires
directly right here in this area.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.510
The first thing we want to do is to go ahead
and probe the wires to determine which function

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.510
each wire carries.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.670
The first thing we want to do is to test for
our left-turn signal.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.050
And it appears to be this light green wire
coming directly out of the harness.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.219
Then we want to find our right-turn signal,
which appears to be the tan wire that is feeding

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.249
over to the passengers side.

00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:39.010
Then we want to find the brake line, which
again appears to be the white wire with the

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.300
tan stripe.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.170
And then the last thing we need to find is
our running lights, and that appears to be

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.499
the black wire with the yellow stripe.

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:48.969
Then on our harness here, we are just going
to go ahead and make our connections to the

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:49.969
wires that we just found.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:54.989
The yellow wire is going to be our left-turn
signal wire.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.840
The white is, again, going to be the ground,
which we want to use that common grounding

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.049
point right over here.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.469
The brown wire was our running-light feed,
the red wire was our brake feed, and our green

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:05.070
wire is our right-turn feed.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.260
So, I am going to take some common quick splices
and place them over the existing wire on the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.360
vehicle and then connect the appropriate wire
on our connector.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.170
And then just get a pair of pliers and we
will crimp down our tab there.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170
And that will make our connection for us.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.780
And we are just going to go ahead and do that
for all the wires.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:31.520
And last, we want to take the white wire with
the ring terminal on it and connect it to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.060
that common ground.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.590
And then we just want to find a suitable mounting
point for our converter box.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.299
As you can see, on the back side here we have
got some double-sided tape.

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.700
And we can just go ahead and press that down
into place.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.460
I am just going to directly mount it right
there that is going to be as good a spot as

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.460
any.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.609
And that will allow our 4-pole to be left
inside the trunk when not in use.

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:54.579
And then when we want to use it, we can just
go ahead and pull it out of the trunk area

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.119
and go ahead and close the trunk on it.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.499
The weather stripping will prevent it from
being pinched, so that will be OK there.

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:04.640
OK, and then lastly we just want to tape up
all of our connections that we have made.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.900
And then we will reassemble the carpet underneath
the trunk area, and then our installation

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.210
will be complete.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.310
And this will conclude the installation of
wiring harness part number 119175 on a 1997

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.470
Chrysler Concorde.
