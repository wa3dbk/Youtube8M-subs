Welcome everyone, my name is Katja Engelhardt
and I will guide you through this course.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.960
(Why do tablets matter?)
In the last few years, tablets have become

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.099
incredibly popular consumer items.
People like their ease of use, mobility and

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.259
speed. Tablets also offer many different applications.
And they are cheaper than other devices.

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.810
Tablets are also moving very quickly into
schools across Europe.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.760
Why?
Essentially for the same reasons for which

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.360
the general user likes them.
With their specific features, tablets offer

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.960
easy access to learning opportunities, information,
organisational systems, communication and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.190
emotional support.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.190
“1:1 is easy to manage but you have
to think about how am I going to do education

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.960
with it? How can I get my children to learn
and get them to know when to use the tablet

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:03.440
and when not to?”

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.890
(What is the course about?)
This is something we would like to explore

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.560
with you during this course.
With this course, we want to help you get

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.850
started with using tablets in an effective
manner.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.870
We will look at questions like:
What rules do I need to set for the use of

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.810
tablets in class?
What outputs can my students produce using

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.230
a tablet?
How can tablets support innovative approaches

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.130
such as personalised and collaborative learning?

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.990
We want to provide you with guidance and new
ideas.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.810
The course will help you to reflect on your
own teaching practise.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.159
It will hopefully inspire you to make concrete,
and sometimes, small changes in your teaching.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.360
Finally, the course will also give you the
opportunity to exchange with other teachers.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.140
(Who can join?)
Any teacher is welcome.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.790
It does not matter if you already use tablets
in your class or are only thinking about doing

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.600
so.
We also welcome other educators, school technology

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.320
coordinators and head teachers who are interested
in the topic.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.570
Anybody who would like to know more about
tablets in schools can join.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.610
(Who is behind this course?)

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.279
My personal journey to discover tablets as
an educational tool started almost 2 years

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:11.299
ago when I started to work for a project with
the name “Creative Classrooms Lab”

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:17.239
In this project, we worked closely together
with 45 teachers from 8 European countries.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.599
During the “Creative Classrooms Lab” project,
these 45 teachers experimented with the use

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.870
of tablets in their own classroom.
It is the result of the work of these

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.049
45 teachers that we want to share with you.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.739
Are you ready to embark with us on journey
to learn more about tablets, and how they

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.849
can foster new teaching and learning?
