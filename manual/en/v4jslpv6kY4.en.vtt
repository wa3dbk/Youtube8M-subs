00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.030
What's up guys, it is Jay here bringing you guys another tutorial on how to find strongholds villages sand temples the witch hunts

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.080
and mushroom on the slime chunks now the fortresses the end portal and vines in Minecraft

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.580
and much more such as ocean monuments because they were just recently added into the program itself

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.020
and miss which is maybe you do to wish now has been like someone changed to another developer called tree

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.620
or so we'll get right in the business right here so basically there are going to be three links the description below

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.030
for the one that you know for mac users because it's not updated all the way yet so that is a big disappointment I'm

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.500
sorry for you guys but like it has updated from one point eight point one for the mac users

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.100
and Linux users so I really don't know what the say as it's currently only at one point seven point four for you guys

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.380
but for Windows users you can get the one point seven point four and one point two point four version

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.910
or you guys can get the newest one which is made by skidoo two and solved which is for one point one

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.310
but that does not show ocean monuments so the one that I recommend for you guys is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.310
and Mr export which is made by tree

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.840
or so you guys can download that for Windows users you will definitely download the X E M I really have all these

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.550
downloadable still down to just ensure that you guys these are not viruses I have virus some totally in the description

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.140
below where they scan it. What you McCall it.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.160
Norton will give you false alarms about if you guys like like if it's a virus

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.980
or not so do not believe what Norton says it's a false thing they say says it every single time

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.900
but like look at me I have it right now yes really think I would go through all that trouble to give you guys a virus

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.660
come on use your head but you know open up and mess export

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.730
and it's going to pop up with those little window right here so evidently if you guys are looking for ocean monuments

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.730
are going to look for a profile that is probably the newest But the thing is that you cannot have an illegal client

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.770
such as you know one that you found on the Internet

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.980
and doesn't have the same settings as my like the original Minecraft so like you got the by.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.440
Real client First off but you're going that to select a profile that does not have any minds

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.420
and that includes opt to find because for some reason what opt to find it messes up to know what it is

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.300
but you meant that the select a button.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.570
Profile you know one that you haven't messed up with any Margit but it's going to pop up with this window

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.070
and now basically what you're going to do is select a file and girl and you will select new you can choose a seed

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.170
or if you already have a world then you can select the world or you can just you know do Russian roulette

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.320
and just do some random seeds funny thing is it starts with control posts are C'mon now perfect so we're going to

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.720
select a random seat ever going to type into Tory Oh I'll tell you the see value and the actual name

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.920
and then you can choose what type of world that you want for default flat large pond amplified so it kind of does

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.520
everything for you and there's going to take it you know like a mini or two

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.670
and then it's going to pop up even shows you where you spawn it like you know what bio so like in the top left corner

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.640
you can see like you know what I clicked on because I will tell you the coordinates for it so you to see that you put

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.180
in the Torah or you can tell you the numerical value of it

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.410
and basically in the top right hand corner it will tell you the bottom it's a

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.050
and what where your mouth is pointing at currently So that's pretty neat more make it bigger

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.070
and then we'll zoom out with or scroll on our mail so he can see a bunch of things like you can see another fortress

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.850
and an eccentric but the thing about another fortresses that chord it shows up

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.420
when negative one sixty three sixty that's the corn it's in the another not like where you actually build the portal so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.770
you get the best accordance you will go to and then the other so don't get yourself by that

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.290
but like he can see there's a Santa bill right here a desert temple whatever you want to call it which is pretty neat

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.380
but the thing is in the bottom right corner you see that little marker thing with like a pencil thing like you know

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.100
it's like a shade or whatever you want to call it

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.810
or you can search for specific bombs that you want you know a lot of people.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.620
You know search for Mesa bombs because they want that hard in clay

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:10.420
but there's like six different types of mace a bomb so boom boom now we had the fourth thing is really close to respond

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.630
points like this looks like a pretty good scene if you were to be interested in Mesa bombs like you can even unselect

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.670
them all at once that way you don't have the trouble

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.100
or maybe you want to suck them on like slowly dislike them at a time

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.720
but probably one of the big things you guys are looking for is the ocean mind you

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.420
and so currently right here you can see the ocean monument right there so I boom so that's where you would go in this

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:43.230
way yes to test it for yourself it's at seven o four and X. Is seven o four and then Z. Is I think it's the Z.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.860
Is negative one two eight zero so that will be a thing that yes can search to verify that this program actually works

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.680
so that's pretty neat

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.050
but one of the big things that years are probably wondering I don't see any no other fortresses

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.140
but that is disabled right away so basically you guys will click on map layers

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.010
and then you guys can select what he has Want to see because that allows you to see slime chunks village icons like if

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.510
you guys like village icons that would disable it or ocean monuments because all those are enabled

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.410
and then you can even see where your players out on your so that's pretty neat

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.210
but like no other fortresses are already disabled so you guys have to click on it and boom it was unable it

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:27.110
and then one other thing what is it I'm yes can search of a specific ordinance

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:34.750
or maybe you guys want to find your player so like that's something that you can do what else.

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.720
Trying to thing I think I think I'm missing a thing like see yes can see the slime junks that's where else you know all

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:47.950
the slimes are going to spawn in it so that's pretty neat like if you got if this guy like you know if this works for

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.490
you then please we actually have some support because that way he goes out to others I mean if you look at my last two

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.820
and evidently it did reach out to many people because the amount of likes I mean the dislike for firm people that you

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.330
know.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:06.190
And that the that the program didn't work for because it didn't update from Mackie so like you know people are stressed

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.330
by that but like if this works for you as in please make sure why comment it down below

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.540
and make sure the share because sharing it will help bring it like you know get get some attention you know sure there

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.350
is that way other people can see it like I'll be for sure trying to allow other users to see this because war why not

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.740
who wouldn't want to find it Ocean minute I mean come on now you know there's only like a few guardians like the older

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.050
guardians in the world so I'm pretty sure you want to be on that game

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.950
and maybe you want to get to the end quicker I don't know maybe you want to cheat your way in

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.070
but like still that's pretty me.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:47.090
I believe that's it for you if you if you guys do enjoy the video then please make sure we will like calm down below

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.570
