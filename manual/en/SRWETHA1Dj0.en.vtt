00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:10.400
Grinnell College Women’s Soccer 2012

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:19.119
Women’s players: “It’s a good mix of
hard soccer and fun soccer.”

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:26.960
“It is super competitive in a really, really
great way.”

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.439
“We’re all very, very close.”

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:43.310
“I chose Grinnell because of the soccer
team.”

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.010
All: “GC Pride!”

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.430
Maggie Mamantov ’16: At Grinnell I really
felt like they wanted to welcome you into

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.580
the community, rather than impress you and
make you feel like their school is the best.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.390
Maddie Gray ’16: I knew that I wanted to
go to a school with a strong soccer program

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.770
and good academics.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:20.840
Halfway through my recruiting trip I just
knew this was where I wanted to go.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.140
Katy Oldach ’16: Grinnell was very unique
to me.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.000
I literally woke up and knew I found the perfect
match.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.630
It’s a college with great academics.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:46.470
I just really enjoyed spending time with the
people I met here.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.540
Amanda Hodo ’14: I love Grinnell.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.281
My favorite thing about the team is how close
we are off the field.

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:54.710
Elle Silverman ’15: It’s really the best
team dynamic there could be.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.210
I’m from Falls Church, Virginia.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.520
I can honestly say that I’ve never been
more close with a team.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.960
Mackenzie Shanahan ’14: I would say the
team is like my family at school.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.800
This team is super close and tries to make
close bonds between everyone.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.510
It’s really nice to have 30 best friends.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.220
Pauline Zheng ’14: We’re not separated
by grade or age.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.650
We all hang out together; we do lots of activities
together.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.620
If I’m having a bad day, I know that they’ll
have my back whether it’s on the field or

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.560
off the field.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:42.350
Nicole Sipfle ’13: One of my favorite parts
about going to Grinnell is how easy it is

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.630
to balance academics and soccer at the same
time.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.240
I’m a Bio-Chem Major and I was still able
to go abroad to Denmark this past semester.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.760
I don’t feel like being in athletics puts
you in any disadvantage in terms of athletics.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.100
Mary Ulseth ’13: I find it easier to balance
academics and athletics when I’m playing

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.100
soccer.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.960
Everyone’s kind of in the same mode, everyone
helps each other out.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.020
It’s a good way to stay together as a team.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.010
Rachel Weistein ’13: It definitely helps
to have a motivated and academically oriented

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.010
team.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.620
I really find I get support both from my professors
and from my coaches.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.400
Sarah Jensen ’15: We are student-athletes,
in that order, so obviously academics does

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.450
come first.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.780
It helps me I think focus better on my academics.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:34.160
Kathryn Vincent ’13: We are pushing each
other and challenging each other on the pitch,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.410
in the classroom.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.530
One of my teammates and I have been coaching
a U-14 girls soccer team, a local team.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.600
Our coach, Heather, is really involved in
the community, so she gets us involved as

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.600
well.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.340
It’s fun to get the opportunity to coach
players and mentor them.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.340
Hannah Safter ’14: I have volunteered at
the Faucner Gallery, which is our art gallery

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.340
we have here.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.480
I meet tons and tons of people, not only in
the Grinnell College community, but I’ve

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.400
met so many people outside of that.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:13.200
I guess that’s what college is about really,
expanding your world.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:24.240
Amanda Hodo ’14: Coming here was definitely
one of the best decisions I have ever made

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.510
in my life.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.850
Elle Silverman ’15: You have a great academic
school, you have a great team.

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.850
Maddie Gray ’16: Everyone’s so welcoming
and accepting.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.900
Nicole Sipfle ’13: It’s kind of like a
family to me, and I’ve really enjoyed playing

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.900
with them the last four years.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.210
Sarah Jensen ’15: When I got to this team
I was like this is why I love this sport.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.570
All: GC Pride!
