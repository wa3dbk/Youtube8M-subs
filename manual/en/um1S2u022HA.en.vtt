00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.770
Android 5.0 runs across
our favorite screens,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.449
from phones to tablets,
wearables, TVs, and even cars.

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.490
I'm Ankur Kotwal, a
developer advocate at Google.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.170
And I'm going to show
you the developer

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.310
highlights of this
tasty new treat.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.160
Let's start with
material design.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.880
Material design
is a new approach

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.080
for designing apps in
today's multi-device world

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.740
that takes a comprehensive
strategy to visual, motion,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.550
and interaction design.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.540
Android 5.0 brings
material design

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.830
to their platform with
a full set of tools

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.010
for implementing
it in your apps.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.270
The system is
incredibly flexible,

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.690
allowing your app to express
its individual character

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.900
and brand with bold colors
and a variety of responsive UI

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.070
patterns and
theme-able elements.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.660
The support library
has also been

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.570
updated to provide
backward-compatible UI widgets,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.710
allowing you to bring the
modern beauty of material design

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.815
to all their devices.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.700
Next, the lock screen lets
you surface content, updates,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.510
and actions to users at
a glance without needing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.530
them to unlock their device.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.600
The notification APIs
provide visibility controls

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.050
to let you declare the
sensitivity of the information

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.090
displayed on your notifications.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.870
This is particularly
important, as users

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.570
can choose to show or hide
sensitive content on their lock

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.550
screen.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.220
Instant messaging apps should
declare their notification

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.680
content to be private,
whilst media playback

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.745
apps should declare
this to be public.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.850
Heads-up notifications
display content and actions

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.790
in a small floating window
managed by the system,

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.620
no matter which app
is in the foreground.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.310
Notifications are
appropriately themed,

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.670
and you can express
your brand further

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.020
through accent colors
and other customizations.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.930
These enable your apps to
prominently notify users

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.250
without pulling them out
of their current activity.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.960
You can get further details
about the new notification

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.620
APIs at the following DevByte.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.300
WebView has been
updated to Chromium M37,

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.350
bringing security enhancements,
stability enhancements, and bug

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.250
fixes.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.890
With this release, WebRTC,
WebAudio, and WebGL

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.800
are included.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.979
But here's some
awesome news-- WebView

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.120
is now unbundled from
the system and can

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.380
be updated through Google Play.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.500
This will provide the latest
web enhancements to users

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.180
and the latest Web
APIs to developers.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.470
How cool is that?

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.450
Another cool initiative
is Project Volta,

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.030
which focuses on
improving battery life

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.040
and has resulted in
power optimizations

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.900
across the platform.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.060
These are new tools to help
your app run efficiently

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.970
and conserve power.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.870
Battery Historian, a
tool included in the SDK,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.470
lets you visualize
power events over time

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.360
and understand how your
app is using power.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.970
The JobScheduler API lets
you minimize battery impact

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.500
by setting the conditions under
which your background tasks

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.520
and others jobs should run,
such as when the device is idle,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.680
connected to an un-metered
network, or to a charger.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.010
The JobScheduler is one
of my favorite new APIs.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.020
Android 5.0 ships with
the Android Runtime

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.420
known as ART as
the system default.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.490
ART offers ahead-of-time
compilation, more efficient

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.380
garbage collection, and improved
development and debugging

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.880
features.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.150
In many cases, it improves
the performance of your app

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.810
without you having
to change your code.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.250
64-bit support has also come
to Android in this release.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.610
It adds 64-bit ABIs, provides
additional address space,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.440
and improved performance
with certain types

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.315
of compute workloads.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.940
Apps written in Java
running on DEX bytecode

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.510
can benefit on
64-bit architectures

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.220
with no code changes.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.970
For apps and games
that use native code,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.460
NDK release 10b
includes 64-bit support

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.720
and is available for download.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.980
Another new feature is
concurrent documents

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.750
in Recents, which lets you
organize your app into tasks

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.660
and present these concurrently
as individual documents

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.430
on the Recent screen.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.070
For example, each
Chrome tab can now

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.410
be a separate
document in Recents.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.670
Users can flip through Recents
to find the specific Chrome

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.610
tab they want and jump straight
to that site with a single tap.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.300
A new set of capabilities is
Android in the Workplace, which

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.540
enables a unified
interaction model

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.190
across both personal
and workplace apps,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.120
making it easier for
employees to have

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.770
a single device for
personal and workplace use.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.950
Framework enhancements
offer a unified view

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.020
of Apps, Notifications,
and Recents

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.780
in a single launcher across both
personal and workplace apps.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.630
For photo lovers,
the Camera2 API

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.360
gives you new APIs for managing
image capture and processing.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.380
On supported devices, your app
can capture uncompressed YUV

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.840
captures in full eight
megapixel resolution

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.610
at 30 frames per second.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.760
The API lets you capture a
raw sense of data and control

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.120
parameters, such as exposure
time, ISO sensitivity,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.960
and frame duration
on a per-frame basis.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.429
You can get further details
about using this API

00:05:03.429 --> 00:05:04.470
at the following DevByte.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.680
There are a boatload of new
features for game developers,

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.860
starting with support
for OpenGL ES 3.1.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.480
This gives you compute
shaders, stencil textures,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.670
and texture gather
for your games.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.450
Android Extension
Pack is a new set

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.990
of extensions to
OpenGL ES that bring

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.500
desktop-class
graphics to Android.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.930
Games will be able to take
advantage of tessellation

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.870
and geometry shaders,
and use ASTC texture

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.210
compression across
multiple GPU technologies.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.270
The sound architecture
has been enhanced,

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.270
resulting in lower input
latency and the addition

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.305
of multichannel mixing.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.810
This DevByte covers
enhancements for game developers

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:43.480
in more detail.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.860
Android 5.0 has new
connectivity features.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.690
Devices can now function in
Bluetooth Low-Energy Peripheral

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.020
Mode, or BLE Peripheral mode.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.260
Apps can use this feature
to broadcast their presence

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.650
to nearby devices.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.900
For example, you
can now build apps

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.930
that let a device function as
a pedometer or health monitor,

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.585
and transmit data to
another BLE device.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.690
Apps can also work
with the system

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.810
to dynamically scan
for available networks

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.300
with specific capabilities,
and then automatically connect.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.670
This is useful for when you want
to manage hand-offs to connect

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.475
to a specialized network, such
as a carrier-billing network.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.076
There are many more
APIs in Android 5.0--

00:06:27.076 --> 00:06:29.250
over 5,000 of them, in fact.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.600
You can get started developing
and testing on Android 5.0

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.720
right away by downloading the
Android 5.0 platform and latest

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.560
support library from
the SDK Manager.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.380
I look forward to seeing your
beautiful material design

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.180
apps on screens everywhere.
