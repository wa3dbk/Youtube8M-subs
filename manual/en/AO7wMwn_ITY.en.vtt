Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village and today we’re going

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.000
to talk about puppies. So now we’re going
to teach this little puppy, how to sit. Now

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.690
the first thing to consider is the treat that
you’re going to use for your dog and if

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.580
you haven’t already check out the video
on motivators to help you choose whether you’re

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.220
going to use a treat or a toy. You want to
use what best motivates your dog. This little

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.749
puppy loves cheese, so that’s what we’re
going to use. When you’re using treats especially

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:34.630
with little puppies be sure to keep the pieces
very, very small. So little Barto here, knows

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:44.910
what’s coming up. So I’m going to have
to lure him back around. Little puppy, good,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.800
good. Now he offered to sit that time. I’m
going to go ahead and mark it with my special

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.289
word and then give him a treat. Okay, come
here, now I’m going to try to do that again

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.570
just getting him to offer the behavior. Good.
This is excellent. I have not worked with

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:14.250
little Barto on this before but his parents
obviously have. Sit, good. So now I start

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:29.180
introducing a word, okay. Little puppy, sit,
good, very nice. Okay, now I’m going to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.500
try without him knowing I have food, sit,
good. Barto obviously has the sit down pretty

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.290
well. So what I want to do is start making
my treat reinforcement random at this point.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:55.020
Okay, okay, little puppy, okay, oh! oh! Barto,
you’re too, you’re too good, good, sit,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.869
good. It’s hard to see when that little
corgi bottom hits the ground, good, all right,

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:10.899
good puppy. Distract him a little, okay, sit,
good, very nice. So that was a really good

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.800
example of how the training progression should
go, now keep in mind this may take a week

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.730
or two. Barto’s sit is very responsive and
it’s also very quick at this point. So,

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.910
why don’t we go on and teach this little
corgi puppy how to lie down.
