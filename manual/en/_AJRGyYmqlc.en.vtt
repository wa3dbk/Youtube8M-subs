00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.159
I'm going to show you how to make your very
own tamales.

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.720
They're really not
as big of a deal as everybody talks about

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.450
they are, especially if you're
not trying to make 200.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.690
I'm just going to make a few today so it's
totally

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.690
manageable.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.510
Let's tamale it up.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:30.480
I've got some dried corn husks and some tamales
masa mix.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.179
These are very
crispy and dried out.

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:39.329
They are actually corn husks from corn that
have been

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.329
dried.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.010
I'm going to reconstitute them in some boiling
water first, so that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.180
they get soft and pliable.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.839
This is what we're going to roll the tamales
in.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.429
Into the boiling water we go.

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.679
I'm just going to poke them down and get them
all wet.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:57.820
That's what he said.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.850
Leave that while I make the masa.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:09.230
This is what you're looking for, 'Masa
instantania de mies para hacer tamales;' it'll

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.230
say to make tamales.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.640
On the
other side it says 'Instant corn masa mix

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.160
for delicious tamales.'

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.550
We'll
see.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.890
Anyway, this is cornmeal, but the corn has
been treated with lye

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.040
first, and it breaks it down in a different
way.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.910
I've seen recipes that
call for just regular cornmeal, which I guess

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.330
you could do that, but it
wouldn't exactly be a tamale.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.900
Let's do it the right way, people.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.660
The first thing I'm going to do is put some
fat in here; I am using coconut

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.670
oil.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.280
You could use lard or shortening.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.060
I like the fact that coconut oil has
no animal fat, so this could be vegetarian.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.820
Also, I like the coconut aroma
that it imparts to the tamales.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.820
Call me un-traditional.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.310
I'm going to just
get that fluffed up a little bit, and then

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.860
I'm going to add my masa.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.189
It
looks like cornmeal, but it's really finely

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:17.790
ground.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.040
Some salt, and I'm
going to add some ancho chili powder.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.439
You could use regular chili powder or
whatever.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:31.549
I'm going to add in some warm water.

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.860
You could use broth if you
like.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:43.209
You will see it transform before your eyes,
into a pasty dough.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.450
I'm going to check it.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.799
This feels really good.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.469
It's like a really soft Play-
Doh and it holds in place when you make a

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:55.469
thing.

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.580
It stays in a ball if you
roll it into a ball, but it's not sticking

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.040
to my fingers.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.249
Perfect, so easy.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:12.440
Let's see if our corn husks are rehydrated
enough.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.440
They're about there.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.349
I'll just let them sit in this hot water for
a couple more minutes.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.400
I already make up some filling; this is a
pork filling.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.459
I'll put the recipe
for this on the website.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.779
I'll also put a sweet potato filling that's
vegan,

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.530
if you want to do that.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.760
This is basically just some roasted pork,
and then

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.040
I shredded it then cooked it down with some
other spices and some water to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.090
get it really, really soft and small enough
pieces to fit in the tamale.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.669
I'm about to start assembling.

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.870
I'm going to go ahead and get my steamer
basket ready.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.010
I have here a Spanish Oaks Golf Club token
that I'm going to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.889
put in the bottom of my pot, and then I'm
going to put my steamer basket on

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.079
top of that and put water in there.

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.349
We're going to steam them in here.

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.029
That
little coin in the bottom will tell me if

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:02.739
it starts to run out of water.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.580
If
it stops jingle-jangling, then I'll know tamales

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.219
are about to burn; add
more water.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.379
That's ready to roll.

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.019
Now we will start rolling tamales.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.799
Let's see.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.360
Those are really hot.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.600
When
you pull these out, you can feel both sides.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.000
They're both ridged, but one
side is definitely smoother than the other

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.330
when you run it . . . when your
fingers are up vertically like this.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.600
You want to put the smooth-side up and
you want to put the smaller end facing you.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:45.620
Then just get a very small
amount of masa, maybe a couple of tablespoons.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.629
I'm actually going to use a
knife to spread it out a little bit.

00:04:53.629 --> 00:05:03.240
It seems like it's not very much, but
the masa swells as it cooks, so it'll be enough

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.010
at the end.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.340
That's all
spreaded out.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.530
Now I'll get maybe just a couple tablespoons
of this; this

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.680
has been cooked and cooled off, too.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.300
Lay it right in the middle.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.240
If you've
ever rolled sushi, this'll be a very familiar

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:32.440
move to you: Just fold it
over, mash it together, and then you have

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.280
a tamale.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.169
Fold that up, roll this
around.

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.009
Some people like to tie it closed with a little
strip of corn husk;

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.110
I'll show you.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.110
I find that it stays by itself just fine.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.770
If you want to do
this, you can do that.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.590
Oh, snap.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.610
Then lay down . . . oh, shit.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.970
This is so
disorganized.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.000
Lay down a couple of these on the bottom,
and then plop that

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.000
little guy in there.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.750
We'll keep rolling tamales.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.030
Final tamale; go ahead and
tie it because it looks cute.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.030
Drop this in.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.290
We're going to cover it with
the rest of our corn husks.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:36.360
I'll put the lid on and we're going to steam
these for about 1 1/2 hours.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.310
All right people, it's time for a tamale party.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:40.891
I'm going to turn this off.

00:06:40.891 --> 00:06:45.289
It's been 1 1/2 hours.

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:48.080
These puppies are done.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:57.000
Oh, my God; they're so steaming
hot.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.389
You don't eat the husk; that's a thing, that's
a trick I'll tell you

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.389
right now.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:03.389
Wow.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.389
Look at that.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.300
It's delicious and moist, and filled with
meat.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.430
I'm going to eat some with some hot sauce.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:15.409
Everybody always gives me
a bunch of crap when I don't put hot sauce

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:17.400
on stuff.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.539
It's super-hot.

00:07:19.539 --> 00:07:42.979
Man,
that is effing good.

00:07:42.979 --> 00:07:44.810
Cool.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:46.400
There's how you make tamales, people.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.699
If you've
never had tamales, I highly recommend them

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:50.300
because they are phenomenal.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.770
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:57.009
Recipes are on the website,
HilahCooking.com.

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.110
I'll put the fillings, recipes, and all that
business on

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:01.110
there.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.110
See you guys later.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.110
Thanks for watching.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.460
Bye.
