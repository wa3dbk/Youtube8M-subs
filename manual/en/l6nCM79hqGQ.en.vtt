YOU'RE CALLING YOUR DAUGHTER.

IS THAT WHAT YOU--

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.166

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:09.066
SHE'S NOT A BLOOD RELATIVE,
BUT MY ADOPTED DAUGHTER.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.000
HER NAME'S CARMELA.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.100
SHE'S VERY SPECIAL.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.333

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:16.333
- SHE'S A FRENCH BULLDOG.

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.333
- OH, YEAH,
THAT'S ME AND HER OVER THERE.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.000

A BUNCH OF TIMES.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.833

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.166
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.666
SHE CAN SIT AND SHE CAN STAY,

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:36.166
AND THEN
IF YOU WALK AROUND THE ROOM

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:38.000
AND EVEN
THROW TREATS ON THE FLOOR,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.066
SHE WON'T MOVE
UNTIL YOU SAY OKAY.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.400

THEIR KIDS, AND THEY'RE LIKE,
