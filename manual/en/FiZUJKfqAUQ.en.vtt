Hello everyone.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:03.460
Michael here once again from the Daily Note
II/3.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.149
This is just a short video to announce the
launch of the official Daily Note II/3 website.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.840
I had an old website that I threw together
that let me quickly share youtube videos,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.939
however it had many problems such as it was
never made for mobile devices and the design

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:19.009
was a bit lacking.

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.390
Also, there was no way to share anything other
than videos.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.319
Well, the new website solves all those problems.

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.999
The look is up to date to today's website
design trends, it is a responsive design that

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:35.290
works for any size screen, works for mobile
devices, and it lets me post written articles

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.329
which I would love to do.

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.719
So anyway, please check out the website if
you want.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.040
I would definitely appreciate some feedback.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.870
And the second announcement that I wanted
to make was that captions for the videos,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.570
are now up to date for all the galaxy note
2 and 3 tips and tricks videos.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.170
It was the request of many subscribers on
this channel who rely on the subtitles for

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.969
various reasons such as watching videos at
work without volume.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.309
My girlfriend helped me caption over 100 videos
but it was grueling work and I knew she would

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.590
one day get too busy to do them.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.080
So I was able to finally power through many
days of captioning videos and I'm proud to

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.230
say that I'm finally caught up.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.549
You may be interested to know that I did this
with the help of my Galaxy Note 3, Google

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:17.829
Now, and some cables.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.390
Maybe I'll do a video on that in the future.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.090
Anyway, I plan to provide captions for all
the videos on this channel from now on.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.030
So I hope you appreciate the changes to this
channel.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.640
These were two big things on my to-do list
and this will definitely give me more time

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.780
to do more videos.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.530
We are about 2/3rds of the way to 100,000
subscribers which is amazing.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:02:00.530
Thank you for being a subscriber on this channel
and as always thank you for watching.
