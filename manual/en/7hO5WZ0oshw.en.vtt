00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.760
We got to really see
the real CDC.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.800
It definitely helped me
decide a little bit

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.460
where I want to go
in the future.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.960
It's a great experience,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.230
and honestly, I think
it would change someone's life.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.260
I applied for
the Disease Detective Camp

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.030
because I was always really
interested in the CDC's work.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.030
I'd read some books
about what they do,

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.730
and I was really interested
in the epidemic side of it,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.560
to learn about outbreaks and
how they're caused and spread.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.500
But then, I got here,
and I realized

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.200
that there are so many
other opportunities available.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.160
Open to upcoming high-school
juniors and seniors,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.160
the CDC Disease Detective Camp
explores...

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.160
careers in public health,
basic epidemiology terms,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.460
infectious and chronic disease
tracking,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.030
public health law,
and outbreak investigations.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.260
The Disease Detective Camp
allows me to bridge that gap

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.460
between an idea
that I knew I liked

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.100
and actually how I could
find a career path

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.700
that would help me do that.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.830
I came here
because I was not sure

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.830
whether I was interested
in the science in medicine

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.400
or the public-policy part,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.000
and I learned
that I could combine the two.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.730
I would say my favorite part of
the camp was the PulseNet labs,

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.100
where we got to see what
the biologists and the chemists

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.560
get to do in the lab,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.400
and they get to work with
real viruses and bacteria

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.230
and figure out which one matches

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.530
to see if it's an outbreak
or not.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.500
My favorite part
was the global health fair.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.630
It's a great opportunity to see
different perspectives

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.860
and, around the world, what you
can do to change people's lives.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.530
Hearing the different speakers,
I thought --

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.830
that was my favorite part,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.300
to hear, like, people that were
actually involved

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.730
with the smallpox eradication --

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.030
I mean, that's just amazing
to be able to hear them

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.300
and to see them,
like, in person.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.160
My favorite part
was actually trying on

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.460
the hazardous-materials suit.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.130
It's actually harder
to get into,

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.030
and moving around makes me
really admire the people.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.500
I was very impressed by how
high-tech everything looked.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.200
There are huge TV screens
everywhere.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.660
And it really made you feel like

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.100
you were in the middle of some
sort of government operation,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.630
trying to figure out, you know,
the next pandemic.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.260
Well, one of my favorite parts

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.300
was the Epidemic Intelligence
Service, when they talked.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.400
They told us what they did,
and it just sounded really nice

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.000
because I would like to travel
when I get older,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.660
and it sounds like
that's something that they do.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.800
Well, my favorite,
if I had to pick,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.130
would be, probably,
the press conference

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.430
because it was
a firsthand experience

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.230
of how the CDC communicates
with the public.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.400
My favorite session was...

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.500
[ Sighs ]

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.660
Hmm.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.630
I don't know.
I really liked all of them.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030
I thought the CDC Camp
was really awesome.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.430
It was really
a great learning experience.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.700
When I heard about it,

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.530
I didn't really know what
epide-- epidemiology was.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.460
I had never really heard of it,
and then I came here,

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.100
and I'm thinking about
majoring in it now.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.630
It sounds really awesome.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.460
If you're looking for something
fun to do over the summer,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.760
come to the CDC Camp

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.030
and don't spend your time
just watching TV at home

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.430
because it's really interesting

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.160
and you'll learn
a lot of fun stuff.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.430
Actually, I'm thinking about
being an epidemiologist now,

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.200
after learning so much about it.
