00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.840
-Hello, Samantha. How are you?
-Good.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.720
-Nice to see you again.
-Thank you.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.720
Where do you want to go?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.640
-To Roland Garros.
-Let's go!

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.800
I heard you're a big fan
of movies, TV series, music...

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.320
-I like some TV series.
-Last TV series?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
I'm watching "Revenge" at the moment.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's getting a little bit silly

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.800
but I have nearly finished season 3
so I'm gonna finish it.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.720
Let's do an interview around "connecting".

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.240
Last thing you did
on your smartphone this morning?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.120
I checked my e-mails. Pretty boring.
I haven't been up for too long, so...

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.360
What's the most useful application?

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.680
Sometimes I use Candy Crush a lot
but that's not very useful!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.680
-Best song?
-I still really like Florence and the Machine.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.320
Talking about song, we're going to pick up
a friend of mine who's a DJ.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.320
-Adriano.
-Hi.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.720
I'm here to record the original soundtrack
of "Road to Roland Garros"

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.400
with the help of the players.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.560
What we're going to record is like...

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.480
Bouncing.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.480
Didn't know tennis strings could sound so good!

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.440
Let's do a little selfie, Guillaume,
before we say goodbye.
