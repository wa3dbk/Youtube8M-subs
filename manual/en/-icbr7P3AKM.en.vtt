00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.580
I am wearing the Berghaus Jorasses Softshell
jacket, a really versatile piece, wind resistant,

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
water resistant.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.910
It makes it great for cool or cold weather
mountaineering, skiing or backpacking.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.980
The jacket is constructed of soft shell fabric.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.150
You have got four way stretch here on the
jacket.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.819
It gives you a really nice range of motion.

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:25.189
It makes this an excellent active piece.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.640
There is some bolstered construction on the
sleeves, the shoulders, the sides.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.860
It gives this greater durability in those
places where you would be looking for some

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.010
abrasion resistance for pack straps, for a
harness, again, just some extra protection.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.990
It makes this piece that much more durable.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.340
It is worth mentioning the Jorasses Softshell
jacket certainly can be worn as a stand alone

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.340
outer wear piece.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.620
There is also a great option as a mid layer,
part of a layering system.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.590
With that in mind, it really is designed to
have a pretty trim fit.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:00.900
I am having a large.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.159
Medium would be a more appropriate fit for
me and you can expect a trim fit from this

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:07.439
jacket.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.319
In terms of adjustability, while you don’t
have an elastic cuff, the four way stretch

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:19.070
does give kind of an elastic feel here at
the cuff and makes that a nice fit.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.630
Enhancing that are the thumb holes that are
integrated into this jacket.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.700
It improves the fit that much more.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.539
Whether you are wearing this as a mid layer
or as an outer wear piece, if you are wearing

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.020
gloves this does away with that gapping that
can happen between a glove and a sleeve and

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.819
really, really bumps up that warmth.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:42.340
I am a huge fan of thumb holes on a layering
piece.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.250
There are dual points of adjustability here
at the hem so that can cinch the jacket in

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.250
there.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.569
It is also a hooded jacket.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:59.140
Rather large helmet compatible hood on this
jacket, but nice points of adjustability here

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.140
at the side.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.560
If you aren’t wearing a helmet you can still
really dial in the fit of the hood.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.179
Lots of pockets on this jacket, which certainly
adds to its versatility.

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.160
You have got seven pockets in all.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.980
There are dual Napoleon style chest pockets,
one on either side.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.070
We also have the dual zippered hand warmer
pockets, nice deep pockets there.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.190
There is a small, zippered, essentials pocket
on the sleeve.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.420
And on the inside of the jacket there are
two rather deep elastic mesh pockets.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.200
They are really ideal for using this as a
skiing piece, any kind of uphill skiing where

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.690
you would be putting skins on the bottom of
the skis and get to the top want to take those

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.690
off.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.780
They fit nicely inside those pockets.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.010
But you can store any number of other accessories
in those interior pockets as well.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.720
The Berghaus Jorasses Softshell jacket.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.790
Again, not water proof, not wind proof, but
highly wind resistant, highly water resistant.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.890
Great fit to this jacket, great versatility,
pocketing features that in my mind make this

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.330
an excellent cool to cold weather do it all
soft shell jacket.
