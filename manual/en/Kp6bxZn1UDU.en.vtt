00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.500
And in this clip we're going to talk about,
this is series 5, we're going to about different

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.509
types of bait that are used in ice fishing.
We're going to start out with the most enjoyable

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.340
variety which is some of the live bait. And
in Rudy's hand he has here some meal worms.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.610
These are live bait. You can see them shifting
around a little bit in his hand there. Rudy

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.700
tell us a little bit about meal worms and
what species you would use these on. Well

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.000
meal worms are good for a couple of different
species. When you're, we generally use these

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.110
for the larger perch and you can even use
them for walleye and some of the more dormant

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.730
fish. When you go to put them on the hook,
as you see me touch their heads, they tend

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.480
to move a little bit more as you give them
a little something to work with. But you put

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.500
a hook through them and they're really lively
on the hook and it drives a lot of attention

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.480
to it. So when you're dropping straight down
and jigging for walleye or big game fish like

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.739
that these work out well. Great. And after
meal worms we're going to take a look at what

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:08.420
we refer to as spikes which is the politically
correct or pleasant term for maggots. This

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.820
is very commonly used on pan fish. Smelt like
to take them. Perch love maggots. Blue gill

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.460
and crappy will even take maggots. Notice
that they're very active. You purchase these

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:31.350
in small vials like you see behind us here,
with sawdust in them. They're typically raised,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.979
there's a lot of them that are raised in Canada
on turkey farms and then they're cultivated

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.650
and shipped down in these vials. So maggots
are very commonly used on some of the pan

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:52.250
fish. Another variation of maggots is what
are called mossies. Now these are simply maggots

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:59.840
with tails. You'll notice that they have some
small tails on them. And those tails will

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.780
move around when they're in the water and
attract fish. Once again these are raised

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.739
in a number of different locations. And again
these are very commonly used on pan fish,

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:19.040
smelt, perch, blue gill and crappy. These
are called mossies.
