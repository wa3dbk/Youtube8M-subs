00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.179
where's the last place on earth you want
to have a flat on the interstate I got

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:18.180
the tire off and I know if you can see
this I had something in there looks like

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.439
a nail or a bolt something with a washer
because it made a circular indentation I

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.849
do have a spare but i also have air
compressor

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:36.910
and I've got a plug-in kit so I'm going
to try to plug this and air avatar

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.850
because my these are aftermarket tires
and they're taller than my spare I don't

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:51.110
want to be running around with three
normal size tires and one so I'm going

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.739
to try to repair this if I can't I'll
just throw my spare on there it's kind

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.910
of a big hole so I got two plugs here
fixing to smear some adhesive on it see

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.160
if I can get them to plug the hole where
I'm ultimately going to end up before

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.690
the day is out this evening there's a
tire shop over there I'm going to see if

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.240
I can get this hat kind of a big hole
though I don't know listen it's kind of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.170
a big hole so I got two plugs here
fixing to smear some adhesive on it see

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.010
if I can get them to plug the hole
where I'm ultimately going to end up

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.840
before the day is out this evening there
is a tire shop over there I'm going to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.820
see if I can get this hat kind of a big
hole though I don't know we'll see all

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.270
right I don't know it's going to hold
but i'll let it sit a few minutes i'm

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:59.660
going to give it about five more minutes
of drying time and put my compressor up

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.210
we'll see you in a minute

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:30.110
I don't see any bubbles maybe it'll hold
probably going to take 15 or 20 minutes

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.550
to the title air compression of putting
off air in here to drive on all right I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.050

down it appears this is going to be all

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.080

thank all the people that did get over

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.590

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.920
