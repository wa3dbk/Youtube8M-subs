Hi my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:13.959
how to make chopped steak with an onion and
garlic jus. Alright so our heat's going. Having

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.480
issues over here. Our heat's going; want to
get our pan really, really hot. All we're

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.290
looking for, right here, is to get a nice
good sear on these things. We want a nice,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.571
brown outside crust on these, because we're
going to throw them in the oven, and we're

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:33.510
going to finish them off in a few minutes.
Now you can skip this if you already did the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.140
jus, but you can't really do the jus without
doing the burgers first. So if you're making

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.930
it for a whole lot of people and you want
to make the jus separately and cook the burgers,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.440
that's fine. I understand, but that's kind
of a weird way of doing it. But who am I to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.370
tell you what you're doing is weird? Right
now, just olive oil. Not the butter. We'll

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.930
put the butter in when we go to do the jus.
And we want to make sure our pan is nice and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.840
hot, otherwise we're just wasting our time.
So I'll come back in here just a few minutes

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.120
when the pan is nice and sizzling hot, and
we can throw these burgers in and get them

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.050
seared on one side. I'm sorry, chopped steak,
not burgers. They're steaks because they're

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.940
not shaped like a burger. You can see, I'm
not sure if you can see it or not, we've got

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.440
just a little bit of smoke coming off our
oil, which means it is super hot. It is ready

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:27.490
to roll. So let's take patty number one, and
just drop it back here. Follow that with patty

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.740
number two right there next to it. Now what's
going to happen is your oil is going to move

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.600
around a little bit, so you've got to move
your burger around with it. So we're going

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.070
to put a lid on this. Let them steam for a
little bit. We're probably going to go for

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.640
about, I'm going to say, off the top of my
head about 45 seconds on each side. Just full

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.890
blast, as hot as you can get it, because we
want to get a nice, crisp sear on there. If

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.780
you open this up it's going to splatter everywhere,
and also keeping this lid on keeps that moisture

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.610
in which is important for our jus. Be back
in a second.
