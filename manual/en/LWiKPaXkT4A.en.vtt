Wes Bunn: Greetings and welcome everyone.

00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:13.440
In this video, we are going to take a look at how we
can publicly expose variables inside our Blueprints

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:15.660
upon spawning them in our level.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.475
Let's  get started. We are using the Blueprint First 
Person Template project with Starter Content enabled.

00:00:22.752 --> 00:00:27.398
 First, we are going to create a brand new Blueprint. 
Go to the Basic tab of the Modes panel.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.168
Left-click + drag an Empty Actor into our scene.

00:00:30.517 --> 00:00:32.871
Let's add some Components to 
the Blueprint in the Details panel.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:34.479
Click the Add Component button.

00:00:34.585 --> 00:00:40.876
Type and select, "Scene Component" . This will allow 
us to manipulate the transform of this Blueprint .

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:48.034
Name this Scene Component "Root". Click +Add Component,
type and select, "Static Mesh Component".

00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:49.867
The default name is fine.

00:00:49.868 --> 00:00:57.225
In the Details panel under Static Mesh, 
click the drop down, type and select "Shape_Sphere".

00:00:57.812 --> 00:01:01.605
With that, let's turn this Component into a 
Blueprint so that we can add some script to it.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:07.340
Click the Blueprint/Add Script button. 
Name this Blueprint "Sphere_Blueprint".

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.679
Click Create Blueprint.

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:12.636
UE4 is going to create a brand new Blueprint in the 
Content Browser and open a new tab for us.

00:01:12.687 --> 00:01:18.103
Click the Sphere_Blueprint tab. We are now
inside the Blueprint Editor Viewport tab.

00:01:18.453 --> 00:01:22.555
First, we are going to create a new variable 
that we can publicly expose on spawn.

00:01:22.606 --> 00:01:24.585
In the My Blueprint panel, click +Variable.

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:29.998
For this example, name this variable "Velocity".

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.274
In a moment, you will see why.

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:37.930
In the Details panel, click the Variable Type 
drop down and select Vector.

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:41.329
Check the Editable checkbox to make
the variable publicly editable,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.033
Check the Expose on Spawn checkbox as well.

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:49.691
Click Compile. Go to the Construction Script.

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:55.841
On the Construction Script, 
hold Ctrl + drag in our StaticMesh.

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:59.912
Actually, there is one more 
thing we need to do before I forget.

00:02:00.217 --> 00:02:06.348
Select the StaticMesh, and check the Simulate Physics
checkbox in the Details panel. Physics are fun.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.729
Now that physics have been enabled, 
drag off Static Mesh,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.701
and type "physics". There are several options in here.

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:22.550
Scroll down and select "Set Physics Linear Velocity".

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.679
Connect the Construction Script 
to Set Physics Linear Velocity.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.615
Select the Velocity variable. The Set Physics 
Linear Velocity node is asking for a vector.

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:35.897
Drag-and-drop Velocity onto the New Vel pin.

00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:40.231
There we go. Our Blueprint is set.
Click Compile and Save.

00:02:41.048 --> 00:02:43.593
Go back to the level.

00:02:43.644 --> 00:02:48.747
We can delete this instance of Sphere_Blueprint 
in the level. Select it and press Delete.

00:02:49.256 --> 00:02:51.520
In the Modes panel, type and select "Target Point".

00:02:53.238 --> 00:02:54.920
 because we are going to use this as a spawn location.

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.412
Left-click + drag in Target Point.

00:02:57.857 --> 00:03:02.116
I am going to drag it up into the world 
because that is going to be cool.

00:03:02.532 --> 00:03:04.669
Go to the Level Blueprint.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.444
At the very top, click the Blueprints button 
and click Open Level Blueprint.

00:03:09.183 --> 00:03:12.350
Make sure you have Target Point is 
still selected, which we do.

00:03:12.401 --> 00:03:17.410
Go back to our Level Blueprint. Right-click, type 
and select "Create a Reference to Target Point".

00:03:17.773 --> 00:03:22.871
Right-click and press "F" for the F key.

00:03:23.713 --> 00:03:26.856
We did this so that we can get a reference 
of where we want to spawn

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.392
our Sphere_Blueprint whenever we press F.

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:36.599
The first thing we need to do is actually spawn it. 
Right-click, type and select "Spawn Actor from Class".

00:03:38.012 --> 00:03:39.579
Connect Pressed to Spawn Actor from Class.

00:03:40.306 --> 00:03:42.200
You see it is asking for a transform, so let's

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.260
provide that. Drag off Target Point, 
type and select "Get Actor Transform".

00:03:51.565 --> 00:03:54.221
 Plug the Return Value into Spawn Transform.

00:03:54.983 --> 00:03:58.659
Click the Select Class drop down menu and select 
Sphere_Blueprint. Watch what happens to the node.

00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:03.332
Sphere_Blueprint.

00:04:03.383 --> 00:04:08.235
Now we can specify a Velocity 
at which to spawn our Blueprint.

00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:23.479
For fun, let's Right-click, type and select 
"Random Unit Vector". That is the one we want.

00:04:24.915 --> 00:04:37.614
Drag off the Return Value, type "*" and select 
Vector * Float. This will allow for a large spawn radius.

00:04:38.128 --> 00:04:40.683
Set B of the Multiply node to 500. 
You can set it to whatever you would like.

00:04:41.057 --> 00:04:43.169
 Let's plug that in to our Velocity like so.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.175
Click Compile and go back to the level.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.890
Now when we click Play and press F,

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:54.577
you can see the sphere is being launched at a velocity

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:57.959
that we specified to occur on spawn.

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:02.406
There you go, you have learned how to expose a variable

00:05:02.482 --> 00:05:06.383
that can be edited on spawn. You can use this
in a number of different ways.

00:05:06.434 --> 00:05:08.589
 We could change the Material on Spawn. We could change

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.377
the actual Static Mesh on Spawn if we wanted.

00:05:11.588 --> 00:05:13.820
It is completely up to you and your gameplay needs.

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.137
I hope you all enjoyed this video 
and we will see you next time.

00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:25.453
