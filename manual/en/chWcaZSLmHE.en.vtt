00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.000
Four people earn $180
for working at an

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.560
after-school program.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.580
If they divide this money up
equally, how much will each

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.520
person receive?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.970
So we want to divide $180 into
four equal groups so that each

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.190
of the four people can
have the same amount.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:26.310
So we want to divide 180 by 4.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.300
We want to take 180
divided by 4.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.044
Now, most of us don't know this
off the top of our heads,

00:00:33.044 --> 00:00:34.493
so we need to solve for it.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:36.290
We need to do a little
bit of division.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.100
So another way of writing this
exact same expression is to

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.430
write 4 divided into 180.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.200
And when you write it like this,
it's easier to do it if

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.350
either of them actually has
more than one digit,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.170
especially if the number we're
dividing into has more than

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.990
one or two or three
or four digits.

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.460
So let's do it.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.320
So the first thing you say is,
well, does 4 go into 1?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.670
Well, no, 4 does
not go into 1.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.940
It's larger than 1.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.300
So you could put a 0 up here,
but instead of doing that,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.150
let's just move on to the right
and say, well, OK, it

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.190
doesn't go into 1.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.540
Does 4 go into 18?

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.380
Well, 4 times 4 is 16,
so that goes into 18

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.350
at least four times.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.110
4 times 5-- let me
write this down.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.920
4 times 4 is equal to 16,
so that goes into 18.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.200
4 times 5 is equal to 20, so
that does not go into 18, so

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.050
this is going to go into
18 four times.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.900
4 times 4 is 16, and
now we subtract.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.850
We essentially find the
remainder here.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.050
18 minus 6 is 2.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.290
Now we want to bring down this
0, because we really said 4

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.440
goes into 180 40 times, because

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.820
it's in the tens place.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.030
40 times 4 is 160.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.040
180 minus 160 is 20.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.310
That's why we bring
down the 0.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.430
But if you just think about
the process, you say, OK,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.440
what's the smallest-- if I just
go with the 1, 4 doesn't

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.700
go into it, so let me move on.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.850
Let me look at the
1 and the 8, 18.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.240
4 goes into that four times.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.800
4 times 4 is 16.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.620
Subtract from 18, you get
a 2, bring down the 0.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.980
Now 4 goes into 20
how many times?

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.120
Well, we just wrote
it over here.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.110
4 times 5 is equal to 20.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.800
So 4 goes into 20 five times.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.130
5 times 4 is 20.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.450
You subtract, and you have
no remainder left over.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.360
So 180 divided by 4
is equal to 45.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.790
So if these four people were
to split the money equally,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.210
they'll each get $45.
