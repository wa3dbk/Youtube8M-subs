Hi I'm Rachel Dayan for Expert Village now
we're going to finish the face to the sheep

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:17.029
we're going to do the ears first we take a
little white clay, a little bit we're going

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.429
to make a little snake not to thin, not to
long. We're going to squeeze it the end of

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:29.389
it not all of it just the end of it with our
finger and the other end we're going just

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:35.980
squeeze it to the other side so it will be
a little bit like a drop, a shape of a drop

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.320
and we're going to put it under the little
curl. We're going to press it a little bit

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.449
very good, we're going to do the other one
the same way we're going to do a little snake,

00:00:52.449 --> 00:01:02.980
press it on the bottom and press it on the
other side on top and stick it under the curl.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:13.930
Now we're going to do the 2 little eyes take
little white ball and you put it on one side

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:23.530
take a little white ball and put it on the
other side, take a smaller portion of clay

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:35.020
any color you want but we decided to use blue.
And you stick it on top of the white part

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:45.710
we're going to make now 2 holes, we can take
a q-tip and make 2 holes for the nose, 2 little

00:01:45.710 --> 00:02:09.110
holes just make 2 little holes in the middle
and a smiley face and our face is ready. You

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:18.700
want to show your sheep make a bigger smile,
cute, very cute, there you go.
