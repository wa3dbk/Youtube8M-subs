00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:06.670
Benefits of clean, soft water and pure drinking
water.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.470
Hi, I’m Dean Johnson, host of the home improvement
television series Hometime along with my co-host,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.470
Miriam Johnson.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.950
In our line of work, we see the effects hard
water has on a home.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.130
Some things are easy to see - like hard water
spots, soap scum and stains.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.410
But there are others you don’t see, like
scale buildup in a home’s pipes and water-using

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.410
appliances.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.190
In fact, there are studies that prove that
hard water can cost more of your hard-earned

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.190
dollars.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.470
For example, water heaters are less energy
efficient and fixtures have a shorter lifespan

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.100
when used with hard water.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.280
With hard water, the battle begins every time
you turn the water on.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.309
Unfortunately, many people just learn to deal
with the effects of hard water.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.670
They use more shampoo and soap to get a lather.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.170
They buy all kinds of cleaning supplies and
fabric softeners.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.879
They wash their clothes with harsh detergents
and constantly scrub and wipe and clean – but

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.390
the fight continues.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.260
Hard water is not only tough on your home,
it’s also tough on you.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.610
It affects everything from your skin, hair,
plumbing, bathtubs, showers and sinks, to

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.660
your clothes and water-using appliances.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.420
Hard water also takes its toll on your dishes,
glasses, silverware and whether you realize

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.770
it or not, your pocketbook.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.450
Even if your water is supplied by your city,
it’s likely you’re suffering from hard

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.690
water problems.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.759
Most of us have hardness in our water no matter
what the source.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.000
Instead of spending your time, energy and
money cleaning up after hard water or replacing

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.720
the damage it’s caused, you could be enjoying
the countless benefits of having soft, clean

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.100
water in your home.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.859
For starters, your appliances will work better
and last longer, your hair and skin will be

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:38.729
smoother and softer.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.170
Your laundry will be cleaner and brighter
and you’ll spend less time cleaning up the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.869
mess hard water makes.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.310
There are so many ways soft water can make
a difference in your life.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.969
And let’s not forget about your drinking
water.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.600
You may not be drinking the recommended eight
glasses of water a day because you don’t

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.310
like the taste or smell of your water, or
you’re unsure of its quality.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.069
And the only way to know if your water is
as clean as it could be is to have it tested.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:06.139
There are so many things that can impact the
quality of water, and we can no longer assume

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:09.520
the water that comes out of our taps is the
best it can be.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.330
Distribution lines, a home’s plumbing and
various other things can have a real impact

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.080
on a home’s water supply.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.580
Additionally, a recent report from the President’s
Cancer Panel states that installing in-home

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.680
water filtration is a recommended action to
reduce exposure to environmental elements

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.010
that increase one’s risk for cancer.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.300
But there are steps you can take to help protect
your family from impurities that may be found

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.530
in tap water.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.830
If you have refreshing, high-quality drinking
water readily available right in your home,

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.909
you may find you drink more water, which will
be better for you.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.420
The drinks you prepare with high quality water
will look and taste better.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.379
Your ice cubes will be clean and clear, and
you’ll have peace of mind knowing you’re

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.190
protecting your family from unwanted substances
that could be in your water.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.610
Even your pets and plants will enjoy drinking
good water too.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.910
We all know that buying bottled water isn’t
the best alternative.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.380
It’s inconvenient, expensive and its quality
may not be better than your tap water.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.540
In fact, it may even be worse.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.080
Plus, the effects of bottled water are killing
our environment.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.480
From the resources used to produce the bottles
and transport them everywhere to the waste

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.280
that’s taking over the landfills, bottled
water is not the ideal choice.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.730
Thankfully, there’s a better way to better
water.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.760

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.200
water in your home.
