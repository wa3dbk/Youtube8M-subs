Hey, Austin Smith here and welcome to Focus
on Species. Let’s talk about the vaquita.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.370
The vaquita, which means “little cow”
in Spanish, is the smallest porpoise in the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.840
world. A porpoise is a type of cetacean, a
group of animals that includes dolphins and

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.989
whales. With only about 100 individuals remaining
today, the vaquita is currently the most endangered

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:28.399
cetacean in the entire world. Vaquitas have
a classic porpoise shape as seen here, but

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.010
they’re much stockier and have dark rings
around their eyes and mouths. They lack the

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.690
elongated beak like dolphins have and also
have distinctively shaped teeth. They reach

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.330
about 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 meters) in length as adults
and weigh about 90 to 120 pounds (41 to 54 kilograms). Vaquitas

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.080
are only found in the very northern portion
of the Gulf of California in Mexico, also

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:57.480
known as the Sea of Cortez. The vaquita inhabits
shallow waters near the coastline, usually

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.780
in water no more than 11 to 50 meters deep.
They feed on benthic fish and squid in these

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.649
areas. Unfortunately, these are the same areas
where many local shrimping and fishing boats

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.060
go to send out nets for their catch. The vaquitas
unintentionally get trapped in their gillnets

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.319
as bycatch and since they are mammals and
must come to the surface for air, many of

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:26.639
the vaquitas drown in the process. The shrimp
industry out of Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, commonly

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.840
known as Rocky Point by Americans, has had
an especially detrimental impact on the vaquita.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.270
There have been efforts by Mexico to protect
the species, such as establishing a nature

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.170
reserve off limits to trawlers, but it’s
difficult for the government to enforce this

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.109
ban when the shrimpers rely on their catch
to support themselves and their families.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.789
The Intercultural Center for the Study of
Deserts and Oceans, or CEDO, in Puerto Peñasco,

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.289
as well as the Marine Discovery Program and
the Marine Awareness Conservation Society,

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.200
or MACS, both out of the University of Arizona
in Tucson, have provided educational programs

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.240
in southern Arizona and northern Sonora for
the past several years. Through their efforts,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.190
awareness on the vaquita’s plight has grown.
The vaquita was not discovered until 1958

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.450
and are shy, elusive, and understudied. With
their population declining from over 500 in

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.450
1997 to just over 100 in 2013, the vaquita’s
struggle for survival is very precarious.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.860
If immediate conservation efforts are not
successful at protecting this species, the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.560
vaquita could be extinct in the very near
future. If you enjoyed this episode, be sure
