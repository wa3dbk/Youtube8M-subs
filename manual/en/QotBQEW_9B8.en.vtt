00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.420
Let’s face it, I tried to look at Ghibli amorously like owners do, but failed.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.660
Partly because the very image of a business sedan equipped with a 3-litre turbodiesel looks fairly prosaic.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.600
I can also see some borrowings, including those of German origin, and they add no poetry as well.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.900
 The famous one hand switch under the steering wheel was inherited from MB E-class together with further developed platform.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.240
Jeep and Chrysler use same engines and multimedia, as well as the engine.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.780
Start/stop button...
Put shortly, I've already seen it all somewhere else.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.660
Freaky language localisation raises a smile when engaging Sport mode...

00:01:05.113 --> 00:01:07.113
...But first you meet the challenge of putting the gear lever into Drive.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.240
Nope.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.494
Uh-uh.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:10.540
Once again...

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.320
There you go!

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.920
Be sure that diesel-powered Ghibli performs splendid dynamics and handling which are, however, common to many cars in the segment.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.280
Besides, most of opponents with comparable price tag are at least equipped with basic features like steering wheel electric adjustment or Bluetooth.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.680
They also have far more space for the back passengers.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.720
I'm 188 cm tall, and I barely fit in behind myself.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.400
Maserati’s key competitive advantage is The Вrand.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:01.120
But still one should get a trident slightly stabbed into his eye to ignore the discordance between Ghibli’s consumer appeal and its price.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.600
However, love is blind, as they say.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.840
The vehicle is well balanced on the run to make you smile over and over again.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.880
But I still believe it has been overpriced.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.560
And the only thing that prevented me from closing the books on Ghibli right after the test...

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.200
...was the bad impression of ride and comfort.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.680
For some reason it differed from my colleagues’ previous experience.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200
The ride of a basic car is not too good putting it mildly.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Suspension is over-sensitive even on small bumps.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.160
Ghibli keeps hopping on rough road, requiring steering inputs.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.000
And things get worse as you speed up.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.200
Although, I came across some articles, praising Maserati’s suspension before.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920
Yet the case was a Skyhook adaptive system.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.240
‘If so, we need such a car,’ I concluded.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.800
And what we got was not just another sedan with electronic dampers.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.200
It was a petrol 400hp Ghibli S version with a Q4 badge pointing at an AWD system available.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.080
Ghibli S has a totally different temper, but what about the ride?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.680
Sadly, I had no chance to compare suspension performance of the two cars with absolute precision.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.800
Ghibli S comes with bigger 19-inch wheels and Dunlop variable-width tires instead of chubby 18-inch Pirellis.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.480
However, the overall impression was – ta-da! – similar.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.640
Ride comfort of Ghibly and Ghibli S is not fundamentally different.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.000
The S model is also road profile sensitive. Unlike diesel car, it even conducts some shimmy to the steering wheel.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.600
At that, the suspension feels stronger and the car is a bit better on potholes and ridges.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.400
There's less body movements in contrast with the diesel, therefore the vehicle is easier to drive.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.760
But can I say these two cars are night and day? No.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.360
Even so, to my mind Ghibli S is more attractive and soulful.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.560
It is more responsive as the engine reacts to the foot action quicker.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.680
The car is almost free from acceleration lags in Drive mode, so typical of the diesel version.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.040
If diesel is more like a grumbler, then the petrol V6 turbo is a lovely sounding musician.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.040
The engine artistically suspires through the by-pass valves when closing the throttle and produces a more intense bellow if you floor the pedal.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.480
The AWD version does corners with same passion, being even more compliant on the entry.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.720
Yet, it won’t let you go sideways on an asphalt road, promptly translating nearly half of the torque to the front axle.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.520
On the other hand, you can feed this beast with snow in winter.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.600
Acceleration is far more striking.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:04.080
You can grab the aluminium gearshift paddles in playful humour and stick the RPM indicator to the red line if you like.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.520
Still, I would like to repeat myself: even basic diesel Ghibli is a genuine sports sedan, no buts about it.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.680
It is small wonder that, according to the distributor, all the versions of Ghibli have similar sales...

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.320
Each model is special.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.080
Ghibli S is more emotive and fashionable, than the diesel model, but still doesn’t blow my mind.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.600
The price tag here is €112,000, while the exchange rate meter, ticking in my head, is particularly loud nowadays.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.040
Somebody, give me a reason to spend my rubles on a Ghibli istead of a CLS 63 AMG S 4MATIC or a Panamera GTS!

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.200
I can see no rationality in choosing a Maserati.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.040
I guess you need to have some childish feelings towards it.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.320
Well, I also played with Maserati scale model cars as early as in the late 70s.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.680
However, my childish affection doesn’t turn up for some reason.
