00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.690
&gt;&gt; My name is Brooke Siler,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.590
I grew up in North Logan Utah and I went to Scavo high school.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.515
I'm a dual major in Economics and Biochemistry, with a minor in Biology.

00:00:09.515 --> 00:00:11.805
In the book Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg,

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:16.630
she describes that your career path should not just be climbing up the corporate ladder,

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.815
but rather traversing through a jungle gym.

00:00:18.815 --> 00:00:22.040
Really, my experience at Utah State exemplifies that.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.800
One of my favorite experiences that I've

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.810
had while traveling abroad with the Huntsman School

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.420
was when we were in Belgium visiting the Huntsman corporation.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.640
We were in this conference room and we were listening to one of the organic chemists tell

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.870
us about the polymers that they made to go into the bottoms of shoes

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.310
that they were manufacturing there for

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.980
different other companies that they were producing materials for.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.750
All of the other Huntsman scholars in the room who were at the visit with me were

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.050
looking around completely confused because they had no idea what was going on.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.580
They would look at me and they would say,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.050
"Do you understand this?"

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.880
I did and I thought that it was a beautiful merge

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.100
of both of my majors, Economics and Biochemistry.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.420
One of the things that surprised me most about my undergraduate education is that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.640
it was completely different than I thought it would be.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.980
I thought that I would be in a classroom and doing homework, and that was it.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.815
But really, what I ended up doing was spending hours in discussions at little cafes,

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:17.240
talking to other students about philosophies of economics and political science,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.010
and things that I really didn't even know about,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.945
but I learned about them because I loved my discussions with them.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:26.420
Rather than just climbing up a path of biochemistry or climbing up the path of economics,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.555
I've explored through that jungle gym.

00:01:28.555 --> 00:01:31.855
I have learned things in international economics,

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:33.675
I've taken finance classes,

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:36.110
I've been involved in the chemistry club,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.450
and I've also done things through College of Natural Resources and in Political Science,

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.280
but that has made the difference.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.460
Undergraduate research for me has been one of the defining moments in my education

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.080
because it's given me the opportunity to open up my eyes and do my own research,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.965
to find out something that has never been known before.

00:01:53.965 --> 00:01:57.635
If I could give one piece of advice to any incoming students,

00:01:57.635 --> 00:01:59.765
I would tell you to not limit yourself.

00:01:59.765 --> 00:02:03.860
Don't put boundaries on what you think you can or cannot do.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.845
Just because you're a Marketing major does not mean that you can

00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:10.210
only be part of the marketing major club and take marketing classes.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.550
You need to go out and find what you're passionate about

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.000
and learn new things because college is a time for exploration.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.220
After graduation, I am joining Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research division.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.770
At first, I was really scared because the background that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.465
is required for this job involves a lot of accounting and a lot of finance,

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:31.350
which my background's in economics and biochemistry,

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.680
but I'm not afraid to dare mighty things

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.080
and to go out on a limb to do what I'm passionate about.
