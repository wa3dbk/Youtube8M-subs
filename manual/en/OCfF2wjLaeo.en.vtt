Hey! how you doing? James here and you know,
I just put a video out on youtube about how

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.090
to make more videos in less time. Video making
process into a video making machine so you

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:18.710
can turn out more video without spend a lot
of time, efforts, money and etc. and I'm actually

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.440
like a day I launch my video actually hanging
out of a friend of mine David Siteman Garland

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.440
for actually down here in ocean side, you
can see the beautiful view we have here, actually

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.190
hanging out with house right now and he got
some really cool strategies simple tricks

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:46.190
on how he's made a houndred of videos even
quicker than I make up my self. Here on a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.690
go pro for hero three making this video as
quick as possible let's go have a talk David

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.390
right now. Hey guys James here with David
Siteman Garland from the TheRisetotheTop.com

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.970
and were talking about how to make video quick
and easy and I think you are at the Pro at

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.970
this and maybe it comes from your lot of initial
desire to learn fucking stuff, (David) Yah!

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.860
Yes, is the you know being a entrepreneur
when I called mediapreneur right? there are

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.070
lot of stuff to worry about you know, building
audience and you know working on product and

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.390
services and doing things I might I just don't
wanna have a complicated setup that took like

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.120
10 hours 7 peoples and 2 dogs to shoot you
know video, so that was wanna keep things

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.680
from me, (James) SO tell me cause I know you
have weekly show how many videos a week come

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.680
out a scene like. (David) Ah well, it list,
it's depends, so it list minimum is two in

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.780
a week so its like a shorter video idea show
tv 3 the evening in coming youtube a type

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.769
video and the 30 to 45 minutes show it list
but then if you guys taking exaggeration you

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:16.639
know videos from like webinars you know video
for sales video, videos for all the things

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:21.620
going in business. so in any given week could
be minimum 2 or could be up to 10 in a week

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.840
something like that. (James) And so let's
say this was making a video was like a race

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.670
ans so the first so you make as a quick as
run, what's that strategy for wenning that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.969
race? (David) yes, so my strategy well quick
as I take like a logitech camera you know

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.680
the specific one I used that's the matter
which one, web cam whatever I would do webcam

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.409
you know in a HD webcam with an extra microphone
like an audio technical one you plug it on

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.889
your computer you know, as your going about
logss and doing all those gonna stuff you

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:54.480
lookin on a camera you talk, you editing it
as mac, screenflow but camtasia or whaterver

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.659
you wanna use you get it up to youtube your
up a racer (James) And I've so some of his

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.889
video belong the way cause the picture quality
is unbelievable, what do you do for lighting?

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:10.150
(David) so I choose I have light, I mean I
have, I'm saying I don't have any video light

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.639
so I wanna do was I want to have it a look,
so two things I do Number 1. is I always like

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.870
to shoot around the window like this window
behind us for facing the wrong way or we are

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.739
facing the other way we can use this window
to give us some light so I like to use windows

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.040
and the Second thing that I do is that there's
acutally a cool app on a mac is called webcam

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.290
setting I believe cause this like an apps
store and if you get webcams settings you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.200
can actually sorf your webcam on your computer
you can adjust the brightness and adjust the

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.329
sharpness and you can kick out a litle bit
of it so that can help your lightning choose

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.809
so let's see you are in a kind of dark area
and in look gonna kind of weird well we can

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:56.219
full out the brightness and less a litle bit
until it choose look good. (James) and you

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.340
can preview your self while your getting ready.
(David) Yup! (James) I'm a go pro I can see

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.799
it. (David) Right, so we dont know, in so
with this one it's like you know you just

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.930
looking yourself and I don't go by any tecnical
details an as go by Feel so I can see it,

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.109
is that good? (James) Yup! (David) Let's have
record. (James) How much the camera? (David)

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:21.109
so i believe the camera like 69 dollars you
know 72 dollars, 69 72 dollars it's a logitech

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:28.130
920 and then we have audio technic microphone
that you plug in your computer, a litle tripod

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.460
that in get in camera so its actually it's
full up the camera it's got litle srew buttons

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.690
for tripod if you want it's limited to exactly
having it you know, hold on unto your webcam

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.420
right? and then that's yet and then i use
screen flow to edit and nothing else is really

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.880
needed to get it done, well i like about the
speed is that you know, sometimes we got to

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.230
script down into videos but I love to have
that continues moments you know, when you

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.880
seeting there your just like, oh men I really
like to tell my audience bout these or you

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.390
wanna try these and I can just in a seconds
just going doo doo doohh, plug, oh that's

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.670
looks good, record, Boomm! and were done.
(James) and a reason I did this a were doing

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.610
video right now its because i'm number one
wanna talk to you just got idea a lot. So

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.880
you've kind to put that on plug it and click.
(David) yah, also yah that's cause I love

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.650
it, yes you are that's a great yes you are
and what happened was i got that camera it's

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.090
all started about it and it's actually very
easy to use so start even that's esue but

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.790
you know my dad when come my dad... come over
he set a camera man we can to get all setup

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:35.340
but sitll takes a while to frame the shoot
get it done to get the white pound do always

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.740
everythings and we were losing some of I'd
like to called gonna be a fenic, I will make

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.740
a video of leaving in my the morer that ready
to go and so I did was I got this, I saw actually

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.520
a story of my friend like Collins right? so
I saw click Colins a hes setup of his video

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.370
in there is no way, there is now way, that
the quality is gonna be close to my several

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.900
thousand dollars DSLR. So as go, I tried,
so I got the webcam, i got the you know houdred

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.580
50 bulks somewhere i added to a dollars, set
up shut up, shut up with DSLR and I want you

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.410
to put it to next each other. DSLR was maybe
2 percent better. (James) and your lookin

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.970
for different quality, I coudn't see that.
(David) yah, like maybe 2 percent, like maybe

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.380
the background was a traine before blur cause
the DSLR length but you lookin at it to the

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.930
coming or coming anyone let lookin at it,
I didn't feel like a total way of a video

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.020
and im asking the feedback what your doing
a video is you know, if your using a audio

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.760
or video whatever like be, is like be oh a
lot of microphone that's gonna take away from

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.680
the video or something like that, you know,
lot of certain things away well take away

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.910
but not the one percent difference in image
in sound quality and to me, oh guys your kidding

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.920
me, so I just started doing all the videos
on that and now, because my work flow is so

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.800
quick I can just turn them out, in videos
getting from my audince and the sales pages

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.450
and the more things I'm doing the more you
know, helping people and the more that I'm

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:11.450
making money and so, you know, speed matter.
(James) You open up that button and your business

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.600
such great, so tell us cause we wanna see
that video, I want everone watching this to

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.310

if you got videos because the worst thing

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.190
and I'm sure you saw it on time right? is
barriers of why people dont do videos and

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.500
my opinion you know, you've heard what im
saying before BUY the best camera you can

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.070
or buy the best equipment you can I dont necisary
believe on that cause I believe in getting

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:03.610
the one you've used. (James) Yes, absulutely.
(David) I dont care what it is as long that

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:07.450
