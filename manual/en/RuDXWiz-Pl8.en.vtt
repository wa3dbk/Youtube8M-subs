00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.840
In this clip, we're going to show you basically
all the essentials for kite surfing. With

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.960
this sport, it's the fastest growing water
sport in the world right now and it's also

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.540
one of the most versatile. You can do three
basic disciplines with this sport. There's

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.460
freestyle, free ride, there's actually more
than three. You can pretty much take this

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.860
sport where ever you want. You can surf with
it. You can do wake-style tricks. Anything

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.070
you're looking to do it's possible in this
sport. All you really need, basically, for

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.350
this is wind, kite, bar, board and a harness.
The harnesses we have there's two main styles.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.940
The harness, that simply wraps around your
waist. Or a seat harness, depending on what

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.649
you like. Everything in this sport is personal
preference and although most people are going

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.430
to be trying to sell you on a certain thing,
don't listen to it. Try everything in this

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.480
sport before you buy it. Everything is going
to be different. A seat harness is good for

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.280
a bigger guy who wants a little more support
down here, but sometimes it can bunch up a

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.160
little bit too much, so waist harnesses are
better for like freestyle-oriented riders.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.769
All the different kites we have here are,
you know, we have different meters for different

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.280
sizes of wind. You know, if we have a hurricane,
we're going to use a very small kite, obviously,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.260
and people aren't going to go out unless they're
an expert rider. Light wind days, you're going

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.300
to need a larger kite, something around 14
meters. Or, on an average windy day, you know

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.450
a 12 meter kite is pretty much the most standard
kite here. We have a very fortunate quiver

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.750
of kites here and have pretty much every style
from Bose, Cs, SLEs to hybrids and pretty

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.350
much ranging from '05 until 2008 kites. Since
'05 this sport has gone drastically evolving

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.180
into the future. We can use kites now in higher
wind ranges than what we've ever been able

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.110
to before. And, you know, they're also much
more user-friendly and forgiving. So, with

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.610
one of these new kites, you can do everything
that you could a couple of years ago, but

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.210
you're actually getting the equivalent of
three kites out of just one. So, what we're

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.770
going to do today is just pretty much show
you the difference between, how to set them

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.880
up, how to use them and why it is absolutely
essential to take lessons before you get into

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.110
this sport.
