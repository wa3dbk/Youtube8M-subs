Hi, I'm Ann Myrick and today we're going to
talk about decluttering a home. The big thing

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.040
is containers. If you have in all your items
and everything you have, if you have a place

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.980
to put it, then it helps contain the item
and it helps keep it really neat. What I'm

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.060
going to show you today is we're looking at
this side table that has books on it, picture

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.060
frames, all types of things. And it's like
how can we clean this up and make it look

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.829
a little bit more unified. So what I'm going
to do is we got these great baskets that have

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:44.929
a lot of texture. Now I'm all into mixing
materials. Because I think it creates interest,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:59.601
so what I want to do is just take these baskets
and I'm going to put the books in it. And

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:05.360
then we can either - we can set them in this
way, or we can set them in this way and then

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.390
still have like something - well I don't have
well, we could still have something else sitting

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.320
here if we wanted to. But we will do this
and then we'll take another basket and do

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.740
the same thing. Okay, that's one way to do
it, so using containers. Another way is these

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.119
I got at just a discount retail store, and
then another thing is I love garage sales,

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.250
estate sales, what I love to do is put things
in interesting baskets. This is just stationery,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:48.140
I am a card writer, stationery writer, and
so I like to keep all my stationery together.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.679
And I found this cute little basket at a garage
sale for a dollar, and so I just put everything,

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:01.399
I would just put it in neatly, and then I
have an interesting container, maybe a little

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:08.119
container that would hold my pens and pencils.
So, containers, garage sale, buying them at

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.890
a store, great to use for decluttering also,
important to go through the closets, go through

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.750
your children's rooms, and things that you
don't - no longer need, sack up, take to Goodwill,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.190
take to Salvation Army, and really just each
room go through and decide what doesn't need

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.060
to be there, what is really trash, what is
really things that you'll never use again,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.710
and just sack all that up, and take that out
of your house. And those are ways to declutter.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.200
This is Ann Myrick, and I have just talked
to you about decluttering.
