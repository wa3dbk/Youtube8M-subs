What up guys! Welcome to Inspire to Cook!

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.343
Minion Movie 2015 is coming up

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:05.152
And that gets me excited

00:00:05.152 --> 00:00:07.843
So today, we are going to create some edible minions

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.840
Let's get to it

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.913
For this, we'll need some fondant, you can buy it at any baking specialty store

00:00:11.913 --> 00:00:13.306
I actually got it at wal-mart

00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:15.272
As well as some food coloring

00:00:15.272 --> 00:00:16.986
And confection or powder  sugar

00:00:16.986 --> 00:00:19.281
So we are going to open up our fondant

00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:20.808
This is what it looks like

00:00:20.808 --> 00:00:22.416
WE are going to cut it into three parts

00:00:22.416 --> 00:00:24.895
One for the blue, for the minion pants

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.404
For the bottom portion of the minion

00:00:27.404 --> 00:00:30.604
One is for the yellow part, the body of the minion

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:32.789
The rest will go for some small parts

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.914
There are couple of ways to do it

00:00:33.914 --> 00:00:36.605
you can actually spread some confection sugar on your board

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:39.594
And mix it in on as we are going to be doing in a second

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:41.214
But I am just going to do it in my hands

00:00:41.227 --> 00:00:41.867
Let' do it

00:00:42.912 --> 00:00:44.752
I will take my food coloring

00:00:44.752 --> 00:00:45.340
Start with the blue

00:00:47.137 --> 00:00:50.497
Be carefull as if you spill it, it will be very nasty

00:00:50.497 --> 00:00:54.036
And we'll add the food coloring with a tooth pick on our fondant

00:00:54.036 --> 00:00:57.038
We'll start with that and add more if we need to

00:00:57.038 --> 00:00:58.239
I am going to mix it in

00:00:58.695 --> 00:00:59.655
Just like that

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:05.411
Our blue color fondant is done and we are going to pain the yellow one

00:01:05.411 --> 00:01:07.037
With the food coloring again

00:01:07.037 --> 00:01:08.955
We are going to use the other side of the stick

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.358
ANd add some food coloring in it

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:16.809
I had to add extra blue color on the other one

00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:18.843
So I know how much it will take

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:22.158
ANd we may have to add a little bit more

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:24.327
ANd we'll give it a good mix

00:01:24.737 --> 00:01:27.937
And for the white one, we'll mix it in really well

00:01:27.937 --> 00:01:30.704
ANd sit it aside, tha's a small piece that we need

00:01:30.704 --> 00:01:32.565
FOr the eyes and everything else

00:01:32.565 --> 00:01:35.249
ANd for the black color, we just need a tiny piece

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:36.860
This is for the pupil of the minion eye

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.723
ANd for the black belt around it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.990
The way I will achieve the black is by adding some brown color

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.859
And then add a little bit of purple color

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:47.452
That should achieve the black

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:55.569
As you are mixing it and it starts to get sticky, all you gotta do is get some confection sugar

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.236
And put your hands in it

00:01:57.236 --> 00:01:58.659
Same with the other hand

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:00.719
Roll it up a little bit

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.766
And it's going to get into elastic shape again

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:05.213
So once all of our colors are mixed in pretty well

00:02:05.213 --> 00:02:06.863
I am going to start with the yellow one

00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:10.607
ANd I'll grab a small piece ofr the minon arms

00:02:10.607 --> 00:02:11.532
Something like that

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:16.716
ANd the rest I'll roll up into minion shape body

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:18.868
Smooth it out a little on the cutting board

00:02:20.062 --> 00:02:21.582
And we'll cut into half

00:02:21.582 --> 00:02:23.982
This is the top portion of the minion body

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.143
Then we grab a small piece for overalls

00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:31.017
A little bit larger in the overall

00:02:34.407 --> 00:02:36.727
Trying to get rid of imperfections

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.623
It has to be the same width as the other part

00:02:40.104 --> 00:02:41.064
So we push it in

00:02:41.922 --> 00:02:43.042
ANd cut it in half
