00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.130
How Do You Decide What to Remember?

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.130
I actually don’t remember.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:04.130
I was hoping that you did.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.130
No?

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.580
Well, that’s some medulla oblongarbage.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.900
Hey folks, Matt Lieberman here for DNews.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.410
Our brains are capable of storing enormous
amounts of information, so why do we often

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.480
feel like our brains prioritize the wrong
things when it comes to long-term memory?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.750
Every Monday on DNews, we answer your questions,
and Yash Bharti wants to know: “Why do I

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.850
remember something that happened four years
earlier but I don’t remember what I ate

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.920
yesterday for dinner?”

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:30.920
Good question!

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.960
Well, according to computational neuroscientist
Paul King, our brains prioritize memory creation

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.210
and storage based on what we subconsciously
determine as useful for our long-term survival,

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.120
to which I respond, okay, that’s all fine
and good, but why did my brain remember several

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.770
names of Scooby-Doo episodes and nothing I
learned in algebra?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.379
I can’t imagine a situation where my life
will be saved by namechecking Jeepers, It’s

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.440
the Creeper or Go Away, Ghost Ship.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
Well, your brain has no way of knowing what
types of information will be useful in the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
future, so it has a variety of criteria to
determine what to hold onto.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.039
First, your brain is really great at noticing
patterns.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.350
Repeated facts, sights, sounds, and experiences
must all be examined to determine whether

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.109
they’re worth remembering or if they should
fade from perception.

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.310
In addition, your brain prioritizes moments
or facts presented earlier, as they dictate

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.130
what’s to come, and whatever happened most
recently, as it’s often the most relevant

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.210
to your current situation.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.229
That’s why most presentations begin and
end with a summary of key points.

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.829
However, the element of surprise may be even
more powerful than that.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:30.969
A shocking or unpredictable outcome greatly
increases retention, which is why you remember

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.299
more about last season of Game of Thrones
than you do about where you left your keys.

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.399
I mean, unless you left them in the fridge.

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.489
That would be incredibly surprising.

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:47.340
On top of that, the brain also holds onto
memories and thoughts that offer a strong

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.670
emotional impact.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.869
Moments of extreme joy, sadness, or anger,
for example, will always be easier to recall

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.409
than clinical or boring moments, even if they’re
valuable for your continued success at work

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.409
or school.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.149
Finally and perhaps most significantly, your
brain pays very close attention to moments

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.809
and decisions that lead to positive and negative
outcomes.

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:09.310
So Yash, maybe you can’t recall what you
ate last night for dinner because it simply

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.599
was unremarkable.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.310
If it had been incredible or god awful, that
meal would’ve left a strong impression on

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.469
you, and would dictate your future behavior.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.120
Outside of those criteria, your brain decides
what to hold onto through another method,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.090
called consolidation.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.090
What is consolidation?

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.470
Let’s say you just learned how to drive
a car.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.560
Every time you access the memories associated
with your driving skills, aka every time you

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.730
get behind the wheel of a car, the neuronal
connections to those specific memories get

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.069
stronger, making them that much harder to
forget.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.370
Sleep has been shown to be vital to the consolidation
of memories.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.609
While sleeping, the brain processes subconsciously
learned information into tangible knowledge

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.890
for later use.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.620
So if you really want to hold onto your memories
and skills, get a good night’s sleep.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.520
So now we want to hear from you: What’s
the seemingly most useless thing that you

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
remember?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.910
Let us know down in the comments and keep
the questions coming, too.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:17.879
We might answer them in another video.
