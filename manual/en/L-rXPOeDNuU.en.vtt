00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.530
There you are, spending a quiet day with your
monocle and your pug, when suddenly a temporal

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.441
rift opens up, whisking you away to a world
where one God is planning on using you to

00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:18.800
overthrow his rival and thus take control
of the land once again.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.500
In exchange for your help, he'll send you
back home.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.740
Towel Fight 2: The Monocle of Destiny doesn't
take itself too seriously, which you'd expect

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.320
of a game where your primary attack is using
your enchanted monocle to hurl animals to

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.570
their doom.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.461
The game is technically a twin stick shooter,
or a twin d-pad shooter, which might be a

00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:35.930
more apt description.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.960
The directional pad on the left side of the
screen moves your character in four directions,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.760
while the pad on the right shoots also in
those four directions.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.950
This rigid movement sounds like it might be
problematic but as long as you have freedom

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.119
of movement and fire, you can easily duck
in for a shot at an enemy, avoiding a projectile

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.980
as you weave back out.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.880
Unfortunately the controls don't really allow
that.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.730
You see, the d-pads only take up a small area
on the screen and are not that responsive

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.080
to your inputs.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.720
As of writing this review, an update is planned
that is supposed to solve some of the control

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.530
issues, so let's hope it delivers as while
the game is playable, you'll be fighting the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.040
d-pads more than you will be the enemies.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.150
The game itself not only has a strong sense
of personality (and of humor), but has a lot

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.810
going for it in terms of design.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.960
There's a large world map to uncover (complete
with warp points to lessen travel), and upon

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.420
clearing each room of enemies, you gain a
bonus whether that be health, a new power-up

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.010
that can fit in one of your three slots, or
a new augmentation to your weapon load-out.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.550
The weapon system might be the most interesting.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.980
You fire animals, but as you collect new animals,
you can load them into the rotating chamber

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.170
of your monocle.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.729
Each of these weapons has a different effect
and strength, but then you gather augmentations

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.850
which change the properties of the animal
when it hits an enemy.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.729
This certainly encourages experimentation
and keeps the player interested in any new

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.150
augmentation they find and what possible effects
to the weapon load-out it may result in.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.920
Towel Fight 2 seems like it would be better
suited to a PC release.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.970
Not only due to the unfortunate control issues
(although those with an iCade might have a

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.940
better time), but its presentation and mechanics
might not be accepted too well on the iOS

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.090
where the majority of players are looking
to plough through a few levels when they have

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.010
five minutes free rather than map out a world
and experiment with the weapon options on

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.010
offer.

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.690
At least such a market is niche on the App
Store, and those players will certainly enjoy

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.640
this release.
