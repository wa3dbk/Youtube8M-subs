00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
cars.com auto review

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.160
hi I'm Mike Hanley with cars.com Kia's latest
century in the compact car segment is

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.360
the Forte which they've used for 2010
there's a clear leader in this segment

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.500
already and that's the honda civic and
it takes direct aim at it and the way it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.390
looks and drives it doesn't have what it
takes to dethrone the honda let's take a

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.800
look inspector has been key is small car
up until recently and it had styling

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.910
that was softer and a little smoother
but the new Forte has a pretty chiseled

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.810
look overall and it's a pretty
attractive small car you want to look

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.050
hard though to see similarities between
it in the civic just take a look at this

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.890
front grille and headlights design it's
very reminiscent of what's on the civic

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.350
coupe fortes offered in three trim
levels there's a base LX mid-level TX in

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.390
uplevel sx this is Annie ex-model and it
has upscale features like these turn

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.399
signals integrated into the side mirrors

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.429
it's also equipped with an optional
premium package which add things like a

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:03.679
moonroof and 16-inch alloy wheels the LX
and EX version of the Forte are parted

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.370
by a 2-liter 4-cylinder engine that
makes pretty strong response for a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.960
smaller motor it makes 156 horsepower
does have pretty decent fuel economy

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.150
it's rated at 25 miles per gallon in the
city and 34 on the highway inside the

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.450
kia forte shows that you don't have to
spend a lot of money to get a nice cabin

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.680
the material quality is pretty good in
this car even though it features hard

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.120
plastic it has a nice finish to it it's
not overly shiny in the center controls

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.500
are well within reach of the driver for
the air conditioning and the stereo now

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.440
the honda civic offers some of the
better fit and finish in this segment

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.670
with the Forte stacks up pretty well in
comparison the Forte comes with a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.450
standard height adjustable driver's seat
which is a nice touch but not standard

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.590
are these leather seats they come in the
optional TX weather package and they

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.000
include besides the leather upholstery
itself a leather shift knob leather

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.470
steering wheel and heated front seats
couple issues though with this is that

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.250
the leather steering wheel doesn't feel
much like leather at all and the heated

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.900
seats only have an on/off setting like
many of its competitors the Forte has a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.600
small back seat that's not ideal for
caller adults but still born a pinch

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.370
right now I have the front seat adjusted
for where I would be driving and have

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.540
just enough space in the back and that
thanks to the front seats which give a

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.090
little bit here to allow me to have some
room

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.620
the ex and SX models of the Forte have a
center armrest and back which is nice to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.930
have and they also have a split folding
backseat so there are levers to release

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.890
the back you're looking in the trunk
seat just falls down so it's nice that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.300
feature when you're going to be carrying
large cargo items in this car in terms

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.150
of the overall driving experience the
Forte still has some things to learn

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.960
from competitors like the civic and the
mazda3 so I don't think we're ready to

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.250
call it the champ yet but having said
that it offers a nice highway ride good

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.670
power and gas mileage from its base
engine and lots of standard safety

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.590
features and perhaps most importantly in
this class is price in less than 14

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.520
thousand dollars before take undercuts
competition like the civic $YEAR ford

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.520
focus in $YEAR toyota corolla by
significant margins
