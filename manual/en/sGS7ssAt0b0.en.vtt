00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.350
Hey youtubers it’s Charlie and we finally
got the first real look at Grant Gustin in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.960
action so this is going to be a breakdown
of that along with an update about all the

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.170
things we’ve learned about the show in the
last couple of weeks.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.089
My review of the Arrow Finale is going to
post later tonight.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.210
I’ll have a link to that in the description.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.990
Before this clip we’d seen a bunch of pictures
from the set of him in costume, but it’s

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.439
really hard to judge when there aren’t any
special effects added and they haven’t color

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.439
corrected everything.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560
So first off the most obvious thing.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560
The superpowers.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.659
I’m totally digging what they’re doing
with them.

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.899
Both the look of Grant Gustin at super speed,
and the way his character treats them.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.580
In the comics, Barry Allen isn’t a reluctant
hero.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880
So it’s not like Bruce Banner and The Hulk.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.830
Barry won’t treat the Speedforce like a
curse, it’s a blessing.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.130
Of all the Justice League A-List superheroes,
he’s one of the more positive and excitable

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.130
ones.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.440
Remember what a fanboy of The Arrow he was
when he guest starred earlier this season?

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.509
He’s like a superhero fanboy who got called
to the majors.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.170
Because he’s up racing around in the suit
in the clip there’s a bit of a disconnect.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.659
Because right now in the normal timeline he’s
still passed out, he doesn’t know about

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.039
his new powers and he doesn’t have the suit
yet.

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.679
So I’d be willing to be that the events
of the trailer are taken mostly from the Pilot

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:59.679
with a few pickups.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.420
Right now they’re not in production for
season 1 yet.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.350
So the only footage they’d have is stuff
they’ve already shot, or any green screen

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.810
stuff they did on the fly.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.420
They don’t always include everything from
trailers in the final version of episodes,

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.040
but I think we can plan for Stephen Amell
and Felicity to at least have minor appearances

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.100
in the first episode.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.050
Unless they expand it and make it a two parter.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.420
But let’s talk about crossover’s with
Arrow, because the trailer itself is an Arrow

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.420
Crossover.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.380
The Flash will be it’s own show, Marc Guggenheim
and Andrew Kriesberg and all the other producers

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.680
are doing the best they can to make it a shared
universe.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.069
It kind of already is as of Episode 19 with
the Caitlin Snow, Ramon Cisco Star Labs stuff.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.590
That being said, I think full on physical
crossovers will be limited to a couple times

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.590
a season at most.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.079
But there will be tons of verbal references
to people on the other shows.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.590
Like when Felicity says she’s been dumped
by someone in a coma.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.480
Talking about Barry and Iris West.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.849
Which isn’t true.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.120
Iris West is supposed to be Barry’s best
friend in the way Oliver and Felicity are

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.600
best friends that just have a lot of chemistry.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.600
So all you shippers out there just think of
Iris and Barry as the new Olicity.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.519
Next let’s talk about the season 1 story.

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.889
Barry is like a CSI person at the Central
City Police Station.

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.579
His mentor slash father figure is Detective
West.

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.040
So there will be a freak of the week crime
solving aspect to the show.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.400
But the big main story will be Barry learning
to use his powers and clear his father of

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.739
his mother’s murder.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.830
Remember that big map board in his office
with all the connecting red lines.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.530
Imagine him super speeding to all those places
getting his CSI swerve on.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.579
The freak of the week stuff will be the day
to day, he’ll be solving his mother’s

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.340
murder in the background each week.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.979
It’s like on Arrow where the team takes
down criminals every week, but the main story

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.570
has been Deathstroke and the Mirakuru.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.500
As for Deathstroke level villains on Flash,
there’s the big question mark of Edward

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.530
Thawne, who will probably turn out to be Zoom.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.729
If you look here at the end it looks like
Zoom running past the credits.

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.030
So I’m getting really excited.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.600
I’m totally expecting Flash to do the same
thing Arrow did with superhero names and just

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.820
shorten them.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.380
There are other comic book characters on the
show like Caitlin Snow and Cisco Ramon, but

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.840
they might be doing a Laurel thing with them.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.570
As in Laurel is the Black Canary in the comics,
but Arrow made her a normal person, with the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.580
promise that in a future season she’d become
Black Canary.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.320
So Caitlin Snow could always turn into Killer
Frost, or just Frost if we’re shortening

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.320
it.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.320
But don’t expect it anytime soon.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.580
In episode 19 she seemed like such a fun person
I think she’s going to be one of the good

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.410
guys during season 1.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.440
Keep you eyes peeled on her though.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.230
Agents Of SHIELD did that thing where they
made Ward turn evil at the end of the season.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.500
Let’s talk about the other characters, I
already did a video for the main cast.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:53.900
But Tom Cavanaugh is Harrison Wells, he’s
the person that’s responsible for the Particle

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.360
Accelerator Explosion.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.270
So he’s going to be like the Professor Ivo
of the show.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.270
Just hated on.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.340
He’s not a villain like Ivo though.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.740
As for John Wesley Shipp.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.480
Yes everyone is hoping he turns out to be
the Jay Garrick Flash.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.980
Whatever his role is, it will be recurring.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:14.950
But it’s also possible he could be playing
Captain Frye from the comics.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.540
He’s one of Barry’s superiors at the police
department and also has a secret persona called

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.980
Captain Incredible.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.590
So Shipp could be playing a superhero in disguise
no matter who his alter ego is.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.650
As for When Episode 1 is going to air, As
I’m posting this video we don’t know which

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.990
night The Flash will air on.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.890
But they will say tomorrow at the upfronts.

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.700
My guess is that it will either replace Star
Crossed, which was cancelled, on Mondays at

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.210
8 or 9 or it will replace the 100 after Arrow
on Wednesdays.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.210
Because they’ll let us know tomorrow.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.210
I’m just going to post an update in the
description with the day and time it will

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.210
air on.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.652
The only reason I kind of want it to be on
a different night from Arrow is because it’s

00:05:49.652 --> 00:05:52.560
super hard for me to do videos for two shows
on the same night.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.260
That’s basically why I haven’t been doing
supernatural videos.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.910
Just because I’m so tired by the time I
finish doing SHIELD videos.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.910
Fingers Crossed.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.620
I’ll be doing weekly bonus videos for Flash
and Arrow in the off season.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.210
So be sure to subscribe to get everything
and leave me suggestions for topics in the

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.210
comments below.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.340
My Arrow Finale Review will post in a couple
hours and my Q&amp; will post tomorrow like normal.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.600
I’ll be combining Arrow and Flash stuff,
so feel free to ask me anything about either

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.620
show.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.146
Right now click here for my Arrow Finale video
and click here for that Q&amp;A.

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:22.580
I’ll add the annotations as soon as I post
them.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.280
Thanks for watching, see you guys tonight.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:24.770
High Fives!
