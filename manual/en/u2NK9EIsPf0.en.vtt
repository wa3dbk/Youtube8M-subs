00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.730
Hello and welcome to ITC Tech Share.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.920
I’m Tom Grissom.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.040
Today I would like to show you some of the
different on-screen keyboard options available

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.600
on the Surface Pro.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.039
So to begin with, lets go to the desktop.

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.660
Click on desktop icon and you will notice,
at the very bottom along the task bar, there

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.789
is an icon that is a touch keyboard.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.110
If you click on that icon, that will bring
up a touch style keyboard and you have three

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.450
different choices.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.390
The first choice, which is what I use 90%
of the time, is what I call the standard layout.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.840
It is just letters of the alphabet.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.180
You do have a Caps Lock key, which is this
up arrow key over here to give you all capital

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.180
letters.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.220
If you press it again it bring back to small
letters.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.680
Many times you do need to use numbers and
special characters, so if you click the “&amp;123”

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.760
button.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.400
Probably the two most used are the @ symbol
and slash symbol for a lot of the web work

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.610
that I do.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.689
If I press the “&amp;123” button again it
is the toggle button, so it will take me back

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.100
to the standard layout.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.020
The second style of keyboard is what I call
the thumb style keyboard.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.429
This is for you thumb typists out there.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.890
If you grab the tablet, which 90% of the time
I use it in a landscape mode.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.329
This allows you to reach from the right side
and the left side because it is very difficult

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.609
to reach the center of the Surface Tablet
because it is so wide.

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:33.570
So for you thumb typists, that is an option
for you.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.729
I hardly ever use this one.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.759
The third option, which I do sometimes use,
is the hand writing recognition one.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.939
So using the digital stylist, the pen input
that comes with the Surface Pro.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.240
Let me just close out this keyboard and open
up Microsoft Word to do a quick demo, that’s

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.369
the best way to show this here.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.999
So lets open up a blank document and lets
make this a little bit larger so you can see

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.579
as I type.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:02.889
So the cursor setting here blinking, if I
have the keyboard of course I could just start

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.289
typing away, but I don’t, it is detached
right now.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.670
So I am going to bring up my touch screen
keyboard and lets just do the traditional

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.670
way.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.730
Lets go back to the first choice here and
just start typing, “This is a test.”

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.489
Okay and I have a backspace key here so I
can backspace that out.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.520
So that is the first way.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.930
That is normally what I do if I don’t have
a physical keyboard, but just to show you

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.820
it does do hand writing recognition, lets
do the, I’m going to skip the thumb keyboard,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.750
lets do the third option here which is handwriting.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:46.360
So if I print letters, so lets do “This
is a test.”

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.569
It will recognize my handwriting and if that
is what I want, I simply just hit Insert.

00:02:52.569 --> 00:03:01.390
If I press enter, that will take me down another
line and lets go out here and do “t –e-

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.400
s- t- n- g,” misspell that on purpose.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.250
And I was close enough that it automatically
did autocorrect.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.159
So if that was not what I wanted, it does
support strike through.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:20.569
So lets say I didn’t want to put the word
testing, I can strike that out and just say,

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:21.569
“test.”

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.500
Okay, I don’t want that.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.829
Lets see if it will recognize cursive handwriting
here.

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:39.160
“This is a test,” and you can see it does
a really good job with that.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.610
It really does a pretty good job of recognizing
both my printed and handwritten letters.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.329
I usually change this back to the standard
style keyboard because that is what I use

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:51.920
90% of the time.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.500
Now this is on the desktop side of things.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.650
So lets go down to the little keyboard icon
down in the lower right hand corner.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.670
This is the hide, so I don’t want this so
lets hide the on screen keyboard.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.970
I’m done with Word, so lets close this out
and I don’t need to save that.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.330
Lets just jump back to the Start menu and
show you another demonstration on the modern

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:15.469
side.

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:22.500
Lets say I want to go out to go out to the
weather and I want to add a new place.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.889
So right now it is Charleston, IL, twenty-eight
degrees.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.639
Lets add a city.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.490
Since I don’t have a keyboard attached,
the on screen keyboard automatically pops

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.490
up.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:39.039
So lets just see what is going on in Orlando
and once again, when I’m done typing I can

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.580
hide that keyboard away.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.770
Lets say add Orlando and it will go through
to a search, which Orlando do I want.

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.960
I want Orlando, FL in the United States and
it’s a balmy seventy-four degrees.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.210
So first day of Spring here, getting a little
bit of Spring fever here.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.900
So lets go back to Weather, whenever I’m
done with that I can close that out.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.039
Now one other screen that I want to make you
aware of that may get you out of a pinch sometime.

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.800
If I swipe in from the right hand side to
bring up the Charm bar, I’m going to use

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.210
the search filter.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.520
So I’m going to search and I’m going to
search for the work “keyboard.”

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.530
And you will that there is an on screen keyboard
app and if I select that app, here is a more

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.270
fully functional keyboard.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.169
So one of the things that the normal on screen
keyboards do not have is all of these extra

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:39.730
buttons like Home, Page up, Page down, Insert,
Print Screen, and so fourth.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.110
The big one that I sometimes miss whenever
I don’t have physical keyboard attached

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.350
are the Function keys.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.130
You’ll notice in the lower left hand corner
there is “Fn” key, which represents the

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.320
function keys.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.910
So sometimes you get into a program and they’ll
say press F10 to do this or that and if you

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.360
don’t have that available to you it’s
hard to press.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.940
So, just to make you aware of that, press
it again and it goes away and gives you the

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.060
normal keys.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.410
The Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Enter, it’s more of
a traditional, physical keyboard layout machine.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.910
So there you have it, the four different on
screen options.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.910
So lets just jump back here to the start screen
and until next time.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.939
This is Tom Grissom, keep on learning!
