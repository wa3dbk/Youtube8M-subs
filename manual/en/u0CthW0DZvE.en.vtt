00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.360
[typing]

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.460
Okay, so approximately 2 billion of
you guys have asked me to review

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.420
the Sims 3 downloadable towns
Barnacle Bay and Hidden Springs.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.200
Well, I haven't done so at this point
just because I find it pointLESS,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.820
because they're just towns, they're not expansions.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.440
But, actually, now they are
kinda turning into expansions

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.480
and they cost as friggin' much as an expansion,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.220
so, uh, whatever.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.560
I guess I'll just do a quick review of them

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.680
to satiate your relentless Sims 3 appetites

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.340
and whatever else is bothering
you to bother me about this.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.160
The first one I'm going to cover
pretty quickly here is Barnacle Bay,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.280
which is the first new neighborhood

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.320
that was available to purchase
on the Sims 3 store online.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.340
It was first made available as a
download on September 23 back in 2010.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.080
It cost 2,000 Sim Points

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.840
and that equates to $20,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.860
which is just as much as an entire new Stuff Pack.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.640
Whatever, I had a bunch of
Sim Points laying around anyway,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.160
so it really didn't matter.
I went ahead and downloaded it.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.580
Then EA went ahead and decided they
weren't gonna sell it on the store anymore–

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820
at least, I can't find it online anymore.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.440
All you can do is go to a physical store and buy it.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.660
Places like Target and Walmart,
anywhere that sells Sims things boxed

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.240
will sell a copy of Barnacle Bay to you for $20.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.520
The thing is, it's not even on a disc.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.500
It's just a code in a box,
taking up space uselessly,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.900
that you can redeem online
and download it that way.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
I really don't know why they
have taken the option away

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.600
to download it directly from the store,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.320
at least as of this recording.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.020
Maybe they'll change that, I don't know.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.840
Whatever the case, it's $20

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.580
and for that much money,
I was very disappointed.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.220
It's supposed to have these
deep ties to the ocean sea life,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.500
pirates and island stuff and whatever,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.820
but really it's pretty much just Sunset Valley–

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.660
which comes with The Sims 3–

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.320
in another form and with a couple of
piracy sort of items thrown in there.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.840
Okay, so the town itself
looks decent enough. It's okay.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.520
The design is, you know... yeah, it's a town.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.240
But the thing is it really looks
more modern than anything else.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.340
I didn't get a very pirate-y kind of vibe going on,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.280
except for some of the people
that walk around looking like pirates,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.900
a few pirate-named places like Smuggler's Beach,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.520
and there's this one new rabbit hole,
Hogan's Deep Sea Diner.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.440
Looks like a pirate ship.
You can go and eat inside.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.440
It's a rabbit hole.
It's nothing that exciting.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.360
And there is a new park, which is just there.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.380
It's really nothing that you haven't seen before.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.380
One thing some people were excited about

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.000
were the fact that it comes
with a whole bunch of new Sims.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.380
I mean, there's like 57 new
Sims and bunch of NPCs.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.380
And Nina and Dina Caliente from The Sims 2

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.280
make an appearance in the game again,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.020
which is cool if you're a fan of them.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.580
I never was. I thought they
were pretty much tramps.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.660
Now the town and the NPCs
aren't the only thing you'll get.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.780
You do get a set of pirate-
themed clothes and items.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.260
But a lot of them actually come
from the Buccaneer's Bounty set

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.200
that's available on the Sims 3 store.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.280
And that only cost a fourth of this price,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.640
and that seems to make up a majority of the items.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.120
Or at least a lot of them,
so you may as well just get that.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.940
It does come with some exclusive staircases

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.220
and some other pirate-themed kind of things

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.540
like mailboxes and hats and whatever.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.560
And if you're into pirate stuff and
think that's worth 20 whole dollars,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.900
then go ahead, be my guest.
Grab Barnacle Bay.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.760
If you like the design of this, great.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.520
I don't particularly care for it,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.280
so I don't really recommend it.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.460
And now we have the second town to be released

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.340
for The Sims 3 separately,

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.940
and that is Hidden Springs,

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.040
which was released August 25 of this year, 2011.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.720
Once again, it's just another town

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.800
that happens to cost as much as a Stuff Pack.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.060
In fact, actually, this one
costs *more* than a Stuff Pack

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.900
at 2,450 Sim Points.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.300
Right now, it's on sale–
and, yeah, these things go on sale–

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.160
but the normal price is almost $25.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.800
That is $5 more than a Stuff Pack. Is it worth it?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.140
Probably not.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.020
Alright, so I do like the design of this
place a lot more than I did Barnacle Bay.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.820
It's a neat-looking town,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.620
nice and settled in between a lot of mountains.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.100
It looks relaxing. It's sort of one of those

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.420
retreat type of places where rich yuppie scum

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.560
Sims go to take vacations

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.260
from the vacation that is their everyday life.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.480
Yeah, there's a lot of rich Sims here,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.500
which is interesting if you like to play as a golddigger

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.320
going around making love to
everyone in sight that has a nice car

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.540
and then killing them off and taking their house.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.100
Yeah. I mean, I like to do that, so, uh,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.520
it's got that going for it.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.360
It does have some new Sims–

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.460
there's like 50 playable ones–

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.120
which is less than any other town that I know of

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.300
So, in a way this is kind of the smallest town so far.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.160
There are some new items.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.680
There's exclusive objects in clothing

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.820
to take advantage of in
your Hidden Springs... spring.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.580
Of spring...

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.580
springiness.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.360
Can you tell I'm really not
too excited about this stuff?

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080
It's like a fountain, a mailbox, a light,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.160
another light,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.960
and some overhanging ivy things
and doors and crap like that.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.280
It fits the overall aesthetic of a town,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.360
but that's if you like that aesthetic.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.400
It really is kind of a mini-
Stuff Pack in that regard,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.980
and, you know, I guess...
Barnacle Bay kind of was too,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.000
but this is even more so because

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.400
this doesn't just throw in a bunch of items
that were already available in the Sims 3 store.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.620
These are at least exclusive to this... town.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.200
But chances are you'll already have
most of this stuff in another form

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.860
like the playground equipment that you'll get

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.200
in Generations and Town Life Stuff.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.680
If you don't have those,
then this might be good.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.320
And it does include at least one item
that seems to be completely new

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.500
and that is the Fountain of Youth.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.700
If your Sim discovers this, they can
partake of its rejuvenating waters

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.460
and enjoy...

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.400
wishes that they may have.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.940
As long as they're wishing for a longer life.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.040
But then again, this really isn't anything

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.140
that isn't already in the game in some other form.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.940
There are lifetime rewards

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:12.920
and plants

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.060
and other things to extend your Sims life already.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.060
So, really, this is just another gimmick

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.020
that happens to have a slightly
different set of artwork applied to it.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.180
Is it worth $25?

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm sorry but

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.300
a new town is not worth $25.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.480
Is it worth getting and enjoying?
Well, yeah, probably.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.900
I mean, it's a nice place.
It's got some cool stuff.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.580
I like the design of the building.
I like the design of that

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.860
town center place and all that stuff.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.300
And the whole mountainous region thing is pretty cool.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.900
It just has a better aesthetic than Barnacle Bay.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.780
It's one of the nicer towns to play in.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.000
But $25? I'm sorry,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.100
that's just not worth it for me.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.960
But of course, this is only my opinion.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.420
To some of you, this is really important stuff.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.200
You're like, "Aw, yeah! Aw, yeah, this is
gonna be great for my Sims! Aww..."

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.020
"It's gonna be awesome."

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.520
But, no, not for me, I'm sorry.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.280
I just don't really care that much.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.660
I've got like five other towns already.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:08.040
And really, I've seen even better towns

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.080
created by Simmers in their free time

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.900
and they cost nothing at all.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.520
So that's my take on the two
standalone towns for The Sims 3 thus far.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.040
They're nice to have.
It's cool to have another town

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.040
and these objects are a nice bonus,

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.260
but it's just not worth the money.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.780
Save your cash and wait for The Sims 3 Pets

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.880
or any of the other expansions instead.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.720
I think you'll get far more value for your cash.
