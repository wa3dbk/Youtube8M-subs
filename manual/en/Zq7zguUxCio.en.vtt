00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.259
I've taught you how to juggle a single spin
club pattern. Now we're going to work towards

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.590
a double spin pattern. The only difference
is that the club is going to go a little higher

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:19.660
and spin a little more. It takes a long time
to be able to get used to seeing what is a

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.060
single, what is a double and what is a triple
spin, but as a juggler, it is your responsibility

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.339
to know. So, you may just want to practice
with one club until you're sure what the spin

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.550
is. If you catch one backwards like this,
try to be able to identify did you over spin

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.601
it or under spin it, so then when you make
your next throw, it's fixed. As I told you

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:48.510
in last clip, your arm controls the height,
and your wrist tension controls the spin.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.280
So to throw a double versus a single, you'll
want to put more arm strength into it to get

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.940
it higher, and tense your wrist a little bit
more to make sure it spins around. You won't

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.500
want to tense your wrist very much because,
technically compared to the height, the spin

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.829
is relative. But it will take just a little
bit more flick to get the spin all across.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:19.380
Otherwise you may end up with kind of dead
fish like that. Once you have that down, pick

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:27.600
up your three clubs, and start with a single
spin cascade. Once you're solid in your cascade,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.400
try throwing just one double, from each hand,
and then work your way up, eventually, to

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:48.389
being able to do all doubles. As you get confident
with doubles, you'll see that you can manipulate

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:53.560
how high they are with how much tension and
arm strength you use. I can throw doubles

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:02.630
here, or here, or here. Now you see I'm catching
them backwards, so I'm not actually throwing

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.999
accurate doubles, there we go. And those,
some of those were triples. I can identify

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.450
that, but that means I was throwing it wrong.
Again, you need to really work on being able

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.930
to control your arm strength and the tension
in your wrist to get an accurate double out.
