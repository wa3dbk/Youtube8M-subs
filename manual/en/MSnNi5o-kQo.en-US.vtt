00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.400
Bad timing

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.780
What is Ken doing?

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.200
I’ll call him.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.560
Oh, my phone is ringing.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.040
Who is it?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.660
Oh, it’s Barbie!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.080
Hello, Barbie. What’s up?

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.100
Hello, Ken. What are you doing?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.460
Why don’t we go out for dinner from now?

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.040
Well, I’m sorry but I…

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.240
Ken, let’s eat pizza before it gets cold.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.780
I’m eating pizza with Midge.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.120
What? Why are you with Midge? I don’t get it!

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.560
I bumped into her!

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260
Let’s eat pizza before it gets cold!

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.780
What is it? No way!

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.800
OK, I’ll ask someone else!

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.800
Are you messing with me, Ken?

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.700
That’s enough!

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.020
Ouch! Oh…

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.880
I’m wasted.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.320
I’m off to bed now!

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.460
It’s already morning.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Ouch!

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.560
I’ve had a run of bad luck.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.340
What? Jinro?

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.740
I don’t want it!

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.680
Oh, Ken.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.980
Barbie, I’m sorry I couldn’t go out with you last night.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.940
But believe me, we ran into each other.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.860
Yes, of course.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.840
I got flowers for you. I thought it would be beautiful if your room was decorated with them.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.900
Beautiful! Thank you!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.300
You’re welcome.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.660
The closer they are

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.240
the quicker the can make up

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.900
