00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:10.461
Hi. Dr. Drainage here to teach you how to
calculate and store stormwater runoff. One

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:14.840
of the most important elements of designing
a proper drainage system is determining how

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.810
much stormwater is falling on your property
and what to do with this volume of water.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.869
This video was developed to show you how to
do that. This will also provide you with the

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.199
tools needed to design a custom drainage system
for your property. Let’s get started!

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.650
Before we begin, there are a few things to
note.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.730
1. Please pause, rewind, and re-watch as many
times as needed

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.980
2. Drainage codes vary across the county.
Please check the drainage requirements in

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.740
your area with your local municipality. They
may use different methods or values and may

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.890
require that your calculation be stamped by
a licensed civil engineer in your state.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.829
Here is a list of things that you will need:
* Paper

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.780
* A Pen or Pencil
* A Tape measure

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.650
* And finally, a calculator.
Let’s begin!

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.670
STEPS
There are 3 steps to follow when calculating

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.909
drainage:
1. First we need to calculate the storm runoff,

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.229
or flow. Runoff is given the symbol Q
2. 2nd we convert the storm runoff into a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.139
volume of water
3. And finally, we determine how we are going

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:22.700
to store the runoff volume
STEP 1

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.851
Calculate storm Runoff
I am going to use the Rational Method. There

00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:33.040
are several methods that can be used to calculate
drainage. The Rational Method is probably

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.229
the easiest and most widely used method. The
Rational Method’s equation is Q = C x I

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:50.229
x A / 96.23; where Q is the storm runoff in
gallons per minute, C is the runoff coefficient,

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.299
I is the rainfall intensity in inches per
hour, and A is the drainage area in square

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.049
feet. 96.23 is a conversion factor when you
want the flow rate in gallons per minute and

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:10.190
your drainage area is in square feet. Each
of these will be explained in depth shortly.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.330
C is the runoff coefficient. This is essentially
the percentage of water that runs off a given

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.740
surface. For example, if rain is falling at
2 inches per hour and only 1 inch per hour

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:28.990
is running off of the surface, the C value
for that surface is 1 divided by 2 or 0.5.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.220
Here is a table that shows the C value for
various surfaces. This table is included in

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.030
the companion calculation guide to this video.
A link to this guide will be available at

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.820
the end of the video and also on the NDS Homeowner
Drainage Website under the resources tab.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:52.810
I is the rainfall intensity in inches per
hour. I can be calculated in several ways,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.740
but in this video we will use the approximate
rainfall values from this 100-year rainfall

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:03.930
map. The 100-year rainfall map shows the approximate
amount of rain that will fall in the 100-year

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.610
storm event.
A is the surface area where the runoff water

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.250
is coming from, in square feet. The square
footage for ½ of the roof of the house shown

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:26.760
here is 40’ by 20’ which equals 800 square
feet.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.070
Now let’s put it all together. Again, the
Rational Method equation says that our storm

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.650
runoff is equal to the runoff coefficient,
“C”, times the rainfall intensity, “I”,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.260
times the runoff area, “A”, all divided
by 96.23. The runoff is coming from the roof,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.640
so the C value in our equation is 1.0. Let’s
pretend this house is in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.800
The I value is 3.5 inches per hour, and the
A value is 800 square feet. Multiplying this

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.060
out we can expect to get 29.10 gallons per
minute of water from this portion of the roof

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.130
in the 100 year storm event.
Let’s do another example. This time the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.220
surface is sand, so the C value is 0.5, the
house is in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the runoff

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:27.350
area is 1000 square feet. The expected runoff
here is 7.79 gallons per minute.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.441
What if the water is coming from 2 different
surfaces but draining to the same area? You

00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:40.430
treat them individually, then combine the
results.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.780
In this example, water will come from both
the roof and the grass with areas of 800 and

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.889
1000 square feet, respectively. We will assume
2 inches of rainfall per hour. The runoff

00:04:52.889 --> 00:05:00.130
from the roof will be 16.63 gallons per minute
and the runoff from the grass will be 7.27

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.470
gallons per minute.
NOW COMBINE

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.500
The runoff from the roof was 16.63 gallons
per minute and the runoff from the grass was

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.220
7.27 gallons per minute. Adding these together
we get 23.90 gallons per minute draining from

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.130
these areas.
