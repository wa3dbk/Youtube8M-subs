00:00:11.126 --> 00:00:13.824
Our Dracula is very different to the Draculas that we've seen before

00:00:13.825 --> 00:00:17.962
in other forms of media, such as literature and movies.

00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:20.254
He's not a quintessentially evil guy.

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:22.839
This is a tale about how someone who

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.275
'through doing good, ends up becoming evil'.

00:00:25.276 --> 00:00:28.217
The character is not 'black and white', he exists within 'shades of grey'.

00:00:28.218 --> 00:00:33.726
In the first game, we showed Gabriel's journey from light to dark,

00:00:33.727 --> 00:00:36.484
and in this game we from dark to very, very dark.

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.638
The second game is a much crueler tale, a much darker tale.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:43.143
I think following a character you can identify with is really important,

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:47.231
so we wanted to have a character that people could feel for,

00:00:47.232 --> 00:00:49.050
and understand how he got to the stage of becoming Dracula.

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.716
So, in many ways, I think our Dracula is much more human

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.958
than in previous incarnations of Dracula.

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:59.314
Dracula's motivations are to end his immortal life.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:01.536
That's the main thing that's driving him in the game.

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:05.252
He's been alive for a long time and he's tired of living,

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:08.565
and he wants to end it so he can move on.

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:11.191
Don't misunderstand us, he's an evil guy.

00:01:11.192 --> 00:01:15.498
He embraced evil for real, and you're going to see that in the game.

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.311
I think Dracula is quite a scheming character and a very intelligent,

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.971
predatory animal and he's also looking to 'settle some scores'.

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:25.914
We specifically designed Dracula as a character
that people could identify with.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:29.666
Our early designs were of a very powerful character,

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:33.604
but then we wanted to refer back to how he looked
in the original game.

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:34.880
When making a game,

00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:37.719
you need to be careful when designing characters,

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.933
especially main characters, especially Dracula!

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.918
You have to remember that this is the first time
in Castlevania history

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:44.630
where you control Dracula.

00:01:44.631 --> 00:01:48.004
Also, with Dracula having new weapons and new abilities,

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:52.880
we wanted to give him a much more athletic way of moving.

00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:54.536
His animations have changed quite a lot.

00:01:54.537 --> 00:01:57.343
We also wanted to make him look cooler

00:01:57.344 --> 00:02:01.085
his hair is longer and he's more refined, more sophisticated.

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:03.695
In previous Castlevania games,
Dracula has always been the bad guy

00:02:03.696 --> 00:02:07.930
that appears for a few moments and goes 'Wooo!' and that's it.

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:12.397
We wanted to build a real character this time with emotions,

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:16.495
with contradictions from 'Day 1'.

00:02:16.496 --> 00:02:19.956
From 'Day 1' in our minds, Gabriel was always 'Dracula'.

00:02:19.957 --> 00:02:25.515
"Did they tell you that blood would fight against blood for all eternity?"

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:31.878
We recorded a 'guide' audio with the motion capture actor
for Robert to follow,

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.539
but what I think Robert has brought to the role

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.525
is a sense of dangerousness to Dracula.

00:02:36.526 --> 00:02:38.082
You can now sense the evil,

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.068
you can now sense the predatory nature of the character

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.935
that wasn't there before.

00:02:42.936 --> 00:02:47.728
These were qualities that Robert was certain
that he wanted to perform.

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.208
As developers, we wanted him to copy the guide audio,

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.050
and Robert explained to us that

00:02:53.051 --> 00:02:55.885
"No, Gabriel wouldn't do that! He wouldn't be like that!
He would be more like thisů".

00:02:55.886 --> 00:03:01.819
As soon as we heard his performance we knew he was right.

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:04.854
"I am no longer Gabriel, woman! 

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:10.747
I am The Dragon! Dracul! I am The Prince of Darkness!"

00:03:10.748 --> 00:03:16.873
My favourite Dracula in cinema is Gary Oldman's portrayal
in the Francis Ford Coppola film.

00:03:16.874 --> 00:03:21.460
He changes a lot between a person with real emotions,

00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:26.183
he's in love with Winona Ryder's character for example,

00:03:26.184 --> 00:03:29.122
but at the same time he's extremely nasty, he's a monster!

00:03:29.123 --> 00:03:33.820
His portrayal is probably the best Dracula I've ever seenů

00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:39.870
I also love previous versions, especially the very old 'Nosferatu'.

00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:47.230
It's perhaps a bit of a na´ve by today's standards, but it's a terrific movie.

00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:50.029
but my favourite vampire movie, is actually 'Near Dark',

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.473
it's one of the best vampire movies ever made.

00:03:52.474 --> 00:03:57.279
It shows vampires in a gritty, horrible, uneasy way.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.349
I don't think I've seen that since,

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.886
and there's an element of that in Lords of Shadow 2 as well.

00:04:02.887 --> 00:04:06.709
We do things with our Dracula that I don't think
have been done before.

00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:21.593
I hope that's given you a deeper insight into our vision
of Dracula in Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2.

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:23.513
