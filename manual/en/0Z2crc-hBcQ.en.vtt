00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.660
Hey there! My name is Aaron Moon and I am
here today on behalf of expertvillage.com.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.740
But what you want to do is once you get it
in like this, you want to stretch the string

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:22.829
because the string can handle a lot of stress
and a lot of tension. So if you don’t stretch

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:31.919
the string out, it is going to fall out of
tune fairly quick because you haven’t stretched

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.910
it out. You haven’t kind of already given
it some life by stretching it. So by now this

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.380
peg is in. That’s good because you don’t
have to worry about it. Don’t be shy with

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.530
this. I mean you don’t want to damage your
guitar neck. You don’t want to pull so hard

00:00:50.530 --> 00:01:00.660
that you are straining yourself but don’t
be afraid of it either. You can stabilize

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:10.409
the guitar. You can see I’m pulling up;
I’m pulling pretty hard and you are just

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.110
stretching it out. That is all you are really
doing. So that when you tune it up to a low

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:26.670
E, it is going to stay there. It’s not going
to sink on you. So already the tone, the pitch

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:39.770
of that is a lot lower. I think this is still
an A down here. Not that it is all that important

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:50.410
to get it in tune right away. So next we are
going to go to our high E which is .012 inch

00:01:50.410 --> 00:02:06.630
diameter. It is the thinnest string on the
guitar and you follow the same steps as with

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:23.400
your high E; nice light string, stick it in
there with the groove on the string and you

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.620
pull up to get it nice and snug. You can already
tell I can pull this out. I could practically

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.459
pull it out just yanking on it so for the
first little bit, you want to keep your hand

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.900
down there to secure it so it doesn’t pop
out. I failed to mention this before but there

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.320
are these little grooves up here, right at
the beginning of the head stock. Little grooves

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.730
and they are meant to just place the string
in and guide the string up, like so.
