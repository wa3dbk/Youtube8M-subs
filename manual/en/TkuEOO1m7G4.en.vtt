00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.151
Hey, I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
this is our acceleration pack Bolt-On Build

00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:17.100
Up for all 94-98 Mustang GTs.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.520
Acceleration is the sum of a couple different
parts: power, gearing, grip, and of course,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.520
driver.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.070
And that's what we're gonna be addressing
here in our '98 GT and our acceleration pack

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.840
with one exception, the driver.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.439
Now, the parts we have lined up will not only
help the car accelerate faster, but its also

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.520
gonna help me, the driver, get the car out
of the hole and through the gears as quickly

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.520
as possible.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.620
Now before we go nuts bolting everything up,
lets get our GT out of the shop and do a quick

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.739
0-60 run, just to see where it stands now.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.641
Now before we bolt everything up we want to
get a quick baseline 0-60 run down, just to

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:51.489
see where the car stands now.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.420
We're gonna do this using our wireless ITSX
tuner, and my iPhone, should give us a good

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.640
idea of where we stand.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.420
So, hit start, hold on.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.930
Alright, looks like we just clicked off a
7 second flat 0-60 run here with our '98 GT,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.910
which isn't too bad, but honestly, we can
do better.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.400
So, we're gonna get the car back in the shop,
talk a little bit more about what we have

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.230
in store for our '98, and then get it installed.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.580
Now, when you think of all-out acceleration,
what's one of the first parts that come to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.580
mind.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.520
Well, if you answered gears, then then you're
right on the money, at least here with our

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.520
build.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.080
We went with a set of Ford Racing 4.10 gears,
and why not since we're looking for maximum

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.100
acceleration, while still maintaining great
street-ability.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.860
Now, from the factories, the SN-95s came equipped
with anything from a 2.73 rear, all the way

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.470
to a 3.27, so making the big step up to a
set of 4.10s is really gonna be the shot in

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.840
the arm our GT needed to get out of the hole,
and on its way to faster acceleration.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.390
The next 3 parts all revolve around our shifting
experience, and getting that power down to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.390
the ground.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.420
First up, we went with Exedy's Mach 350 Stage
1 Clutch.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.590
Now this clutch is more than capable of power
our GT's putting out now, and we have room

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.280
to grow, just in case we want to experiment
with nitrous, or different power routers,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.500
down the road.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.710
This next part may not be as important as
our gears per se, when it comes to all-out

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.280
acceleration, but it's just as important,
especially on our older car here.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.500
I'm referring to this Clutch Adjuster Kit,
now besides offering a full range of adjustment

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.670
for your factory clutch pedal engagement,
it's also gonna beef up a weak link in your

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.870
factory clutch cable, namely that cheap plastic
factory clutch quadrant.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.340
Now this plastic part has been known to flex,
or even break under hard shifts, and we all

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.980
know there's no better to kill your acceleration
than a missed shift.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.970
By replacing those cheap plastic parts with
these hardcore billet pieces, and tossing

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.930
in a brand new clutch cable, well, we're halfway
on our way to a better shifting experience.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.360
The second part of that equation should be
pretty obvious to just about any SN-95 owner.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.660
We replaced our factory, schoolbus style shifter
here in our SN-95 with this Short Throw unit

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.810
from SR Performance.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.000
Not only will this reduce our throws by about
30-40%, but it's also gonna clean up the entire

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.460
shifting experience, taking all the sloppiness
out of our stock shifter, which is gonna make

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.530
it a lot easier for me to bang through the
gears, when we're doing a hard pull.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.940
All this for a price that's very hard to beat.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.810
With our quickshift goodies in place, the
grip of the clutch, and those gears, we should

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.370
be well on our way to some lower ET's off
the line.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.130
I guess there's really only one way to find
out, so let's get our GT out of the shop one

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:41.090
more time, do another blast to 60, and see
if we improved our times.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:53.670
Alright, so it looks like we just clicked
off a 6.3 0-60 run, with our acceleration

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.740
pack installed.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.530
That's nearly a full second difference over
our baseline times, and it's just proof that

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.020
our acceleration pack is doing a great job.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.239
I mean, the clutch was grabbing hard off the
line, and we were really rolling through those

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.090
gears with the SR Performance Shifter.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.880
So that wraps it up here with our acceleration
pack for the 94-98 GT.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.709
Be sure to check out some of our other Bolt-On
Build-Ups as well, where we work on our appearance,

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:14.239
and our handling.
