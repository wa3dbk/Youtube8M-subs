00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.780
8 Scariest Games On The Internet.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:12.200
Number 8, Purgatorium.
Purgatorium is a great game because it isn't

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.100
very long. Instead,
it is quick, simple and extremely scary. The

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.180
plot sets you up in a room
with a baby carriage, and you must find clues

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.720
that will help you out of
the room. Along the way you find hints to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.180
the story of what happened in
this house.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.740
Number 7, Exmortis.
Exmortis is considered by some as the scariest

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.100
game on the web. The
plot begins as you approach a lonely home

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.629
on a hill in the woods. Once
inside, you must put together clues that will

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.629
help you survive. There are
plenty of spooky and unpredictable things

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.859
that pop up throughout your time
in the house.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:50.109
Number 6, The Cell.
The Cell is the story of a prisoner who wakes

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.859
up with no recollection of
who he is or where he is at. Instead, he continues

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.760
getting phone calls
that tell him to get out, with hints as to

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.519
how to do so. The voice on the
other end of the phone is what will really

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.299
keep you up at night and have
you scared each time you answer your personal

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.049
phone.

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.649
Number 5, 99 Rooms.
99 Rooms is another point and click game where

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.500
you must escape before it's
too late. In case the name didn't give it

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.770
away, there are 99 rooms that
you must escape, making it a large and detailed

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.950
game. The detail and spook
factor that goes into this game was obviously

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.600
well thought out and makes
for one of the best games on the internet.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.979
Number 4, The Well.
The Well is an interactive, multi-level game

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.270
where players will gather
stones as they navigate throughout a home

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.280
in attempts to exit. Each time
you complete a part of the game, you will

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.869
earn a new stone and at the end,
you will be able to watch the entire story

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.380
unfold. You are sure to get
attached to one of the four characters in

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.070
this game, but whether or not
they'll make it to the end is for you to play

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.179
and find out.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.659
Number 3, The Outbreak.
It's great to come across a website as well

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:01.479
done as The Outbreak. Once you
enter this site, you'll come across an interactive

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.009
movie where you get to
choose the path that you take. The choices

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.019
you make could result in
gruesome and gory cut-scenes, or even an all

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.119
out death of the character.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.190
Number 2, The House.
Another interactive game, The House is just

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.580
as fun as The Outbreak.
However, while The Outbreak has more cinematic

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.129
elements to the game, where
you simply decide on the route to take, The

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:27.670
House is actually a game that
the user has more control over. It is important

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.459
to find clues and be aware
of your surroundings in this thriller game.

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.870
Number 1, The House 2.
The House 2 is a sequel to the scary game

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.069
mentioned earlier. The scare and
spook element has been raised with the advancement

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.650
of sound and random
pictures that pop up throughout the game.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.099
It's quite impressive that two
of the most scary websites on the net have

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.080
come from the same name and
include the same theme. But apparently there

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.540
is something overly spooky
and creepy about dead families to keep people

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.210
interested and coming back
for more.
