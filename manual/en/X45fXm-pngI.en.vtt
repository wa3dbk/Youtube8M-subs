00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.293
In this section we'll discuss the basic operating

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:12.225
features, such as setting the fan, choosing a system setting,

00:00:12.695 --> 00:00:15.580
manual operation, and overriding the program feature.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.996
Once again will use the 1 - F 800471 single stage thermostat

00:00:21.306 --> 00:00:22.167
in our example.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.769
The 1- F 860471 is basically the same;

00:00:26.267 --> 00:00:29.998
differences on the 1- F 850422 universal model

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.601
are covered in a later module.

00:00:33.583 --> 00:00:35.673
To choose a fans setting press the fan button

00:00:36.077 --> 00:00:37.779
to select auto or on.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:41.261
Most people use the auto setting that runs the fan only

00:00:41.537 --> 00:00:43.489
when the heating or cooling systems is on.

00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:47.138
You can also use the on setting to run the fan continuously

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:48.683
for increased circulation.

00:00:50.055 --> 00:00:52.273
To choose the system setting press the system

00:00:52.521 --> 00:00:55.344
button and select your option, choices include,

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:58.090
cool which controls the cooling system,

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:00.935
off which shuts down all systems,

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.081
heat which controls the heating system,

00:01:04.922 --> 00:01:07.404
and auto, which switches automatically between

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:09.623
the heating and cooling systems as needed.

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.785
Most people use auto in areas where temperatures

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.586
very enough to need both systems in one day.

00:01:16.194 --> 00:01:18.587
When using this feature, be sure to set the cooling

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.131
system temperature at least one degree higher

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:22.879
than the heating system temperature.

00:01:23.597 --> 00:01:26.295
In some cases the homeowner and or the equipment

00:01:26.576 --> 00:01:28.978
may be better suited to manually change from

00:01:29.383 --> 00:01:30.178
heat to cool.

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:33.270
In this case do not use the auto change over option;

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.887
to manually operated the  thermostat simply press

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.556
the system button to select heat or cool

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.597
and use the up or down arrow to adjust the temperature.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.285
After setting the temperatures you want

00:01:45.685 --> 00:01:48.509
you can also press the system button and select auto to

00:01:48.887 --> 00:01:50.819
let the thermostat automatically switch between

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:54.110
heat and cool. To override the programs and manually

00:01:54.407 --> 00:01:57.050
operate the thermostat press the up or down arrow

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.327
to find the temperature you like and press the hold button.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.093
This feature bypasses the program and holds the temperature

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:07.215
you set until you manually change it or press the run

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:09.153
schedule button to resume the program.

00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:12.538
You can also temporarily override the program

00:02:12.866 --> 00:02:14.749
by pressing the up or down arrows to adjust

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.810
the temperature, this bypasses the program temperature

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.928
until the next program time.

00:02:21.272 --> 00:02:23.532
When using temporary hold in the auto mode

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:26.169
press the up and down a row simultaneously

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:28.321
to switch between the heating and cooling

00:02:28.742 --> 00:02:30.519
systems and adjust the temperature as needed.

00:02:31.503 --> 00:02:33.457
To cancel a temporary setting, press the

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:34.937
run schedule button.
