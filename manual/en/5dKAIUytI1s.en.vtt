Both Sides of the Story, a la Shmoop
Okay, so you’re an expert on your topic,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.240
but hold on, bucko.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.889
We always need to hear both sides of the story.

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.969
Have you considered other points of view?

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.180
The thing is, there are usually more than
two sides of the story…

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.509
…and you’ll earn the respect and trust
of your readers by acknowledging it.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:34.050
Point out who might see the issue differently
and why.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.320
Get the most bang for your buck by choosing
the strongest or most common arguments against

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.199
your position.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.819
Give your opposition a fair trial by explaining
their point of view.

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.710
Use words such as “while,” “although,”
and “however” to introduce competing points

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.129
of view.

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:06.820
Don’t set up other opinions just to knock
‘em down without a fair trial.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.640
Be craftier than that.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:16.670
Poke holes in the argument by showing how
it’s uninformed, illogical, or outdated.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:27.130
You’ll probably wish you could razz the
opposition, but bite your tongue.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.880
Keep your tone respectful and your attitude
in check, cowboy.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.810
As the saying goes, kill ‘em with kindness
and bury ‘em with a smile.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.389
But hey, you still want to stand your ground
in your essay…

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:50.310
… so here are a few tips for giving the
other guy his fifteen minutes then bumping

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.200
him out of the spotlight.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.320
For every standard 5-paragraph essay—you
know - the intro, body, conclusion—confine

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.030
the competing points of view to a single paragraph.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.539
In longer papers, a good rule of thumb is
one paragraph of counterargument for each

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.250
major section.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.210
There’s always someone who will come along
and argue with your point of view…

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.170
…so beat ‘em to the punch by choosing
relevant counterarguments…

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.580
… presenting them accurately and respectfully…

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.000
… pointing out stuff the other guy failed
to consider…

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.220
… and confining your courtesy rebuttal to
about one-fifth of your essay.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.560
Then ease back into your own argument.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.269
Now you can confidently say that you’ve
looked at both sides of the story.

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.879
It’s what those in the business world call,
“Covering one’s butt.”

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.670
Blurb: When presenting an argument in an essay,
you may want to play Devil’s Advocate.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.260
Don’t play it with the Devil himself, though.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.530
That guy always wins.
