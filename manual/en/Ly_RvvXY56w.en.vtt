00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.819
Well after you take your cleaner apart, getting
the lower trunk assembly off like we've done

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.379
here sometimes it becomes necessary to replace
these. These are called the pods and also

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.750
if we need to replace any of the other pieces
like the A frame here, this is the first step.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.150
The way we do that is by using a small screwdriver.
We just sort of pop off the pod plugs, let

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.990
me get my fingers in there and work it back
and forth, there it is. This time it's a good

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.480
idea to take off the wing assemblies, there
is a little knot here and you want to move

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.930
it up one side. Those are broken obviously
and you want to replace those. Here inside

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.399
is a quarter inch nut, it's a screw rather,
but use a quarter inch nut. Here handily once

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.100
we remove this bit, that's what we are ending
up with and I'm going to put it right in here

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:07.510
holding it firmly and it backs right out.
I'm going to do that to the side.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.200
Also a little washer, keep your eye on that.
Now a lot of things that we replace comes

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.480
with stainless steel hardware and that's also
a good benefit. Now in theory these things

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.410
just pop right off. I'm here to tell you that
in reality that's not always the way. Be careful

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.070
so you don't break them. I usually use a screwdriver
or one that is slightly bigger than this and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.660
use it as a gentle wedge. You are putting
pressure right over here as the cam goes through

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:44.210
the A frame and just sort of pushing it off.
You see. Both sides here, they pop right off.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.100
On inspection what you want to make sure is
that these are perfectly square like this.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.590
When they start to wear they will bow and
what will happen is that wall you are holding

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.390
will move. But that's it, just reverse the
procedure, putting them back on, screwing

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.520
them back in and you've got a new set of pods.
