Hi everyone, this is Choicerish or aka Chihiro

00:00:10.547 --> 00:00:17.415
Today I would like to show you guys how I 
 would style my hair using hair bands

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:24.102
It's really difficult to style head bands because depending how you style 
 it can make you look like you're just washing your face...

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:31.065
I wouldn't call it techniques.. rather like tips that 
 I make sure to be careful of

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:38.305
we're going into spring soon so hairstyles would become 
 more essential to make bring and outfit together

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:44.275
these hairstyles are not difficult at all because 
 I can't do fancy things myself

00:00:44.275 --> 00:00:50.482
so I'd like to show you some quick hair styles 
 that you can do in less than 5 minutes!

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:53.414
Well, let's get started!

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.719
for the first look, we're keeping it simple with our hair down

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.528
but if it's too simple we're going to look like we're 
 washing our face so I'm taking a white bandana

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:08.503
fold it diagonally then fold from the corner to create 
 a long strip and tie to secure onto head

00:01:17.993 --> 00:01:21.050
This completes the first look

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:27.785
for the second look, if you have to wear something formal or simple,

00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:33.872
curl the ends of your hair with a 
 flat iron to bring more dimension

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:39.121
I'm just randomly taking sections so it doesn't have to be precise

00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.360
then take some hair wax to bring further movement and dimension to hair

00:01:50.403 --> 00:01:58.720
this is the finished look but I like to 
 add larger earrings to balance the look

00:02:01.264 --> 00:02:04.320
for the third look, we're tying our hair up into a pony tail

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.660
it's easier to balance out the hairstyle if the 
 ends are loose and a little messy

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:19.720
then take a section of hair and wrap around 
 the hair tie to hide it

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:28.671
If you wear a bandana with a pony tail, it could end 
 up looking like a 'hachimaki' so here are some tips

00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.910
firstly, use a bandana with some sort of print or pattern

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:41.398
the most important thing to do is to place 
 the bandana so that it overlaps your ear

00:02:41.398 --> 00:02:45.869
and bring the knot to the top of the head 
 to get rid of the 'hachimaki' feel.

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:48.540
and this completes our third look

00:02:51.213 --> 00:02:55.310
for the fourth look, we're going to use 
 our pony tail to create a bun

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.880
wrap the hair around the hair band and start 
 pinning randomly to create a loose bun

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:07.815
gently pull on some sections of hair for more volume

00:03:07.815 --> 00:03:10.390
this completes the fourth look

00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:19.266
for the last look, tie your hair in a bun

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:22.437
In my case, I use 2 hair ties for a rough look

00:03:22.437 --> 00:03:26.950
wrap the hair around and secure for the rough look

00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:34.150
then put on a simple hair band

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:38.570
make sure you place the hairband so that it overlaps your ears

00:03:38.572 --> 00:03:42.420
and then pull out some strands to give an effortless look

00:03:50.561 --> 00:04:01.670
you can leave it at that or, to make it really casual, pull out 
 some hair by your ears and near the base of your neck

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:10.750
I also like to wear earrings with this look and now it's complete!

00:04:10.874 --> 00:04:14.450
this completes my easy hairband tutorial

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:18.010
hope it was helpful in some sort of way

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:21.326
Well, thank you for watching till the end!

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.920
See you again next week!
