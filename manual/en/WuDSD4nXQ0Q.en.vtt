Welcome to How To Cook That
I am Ann Reardon

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.830
Today we are making a rainbow loom band cake.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.720
With rainbow frosting in between the layers
and a giant loom band bracelet on top.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.530
For the uninitiated loom bands are just little
bands that you weave together to make into

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.289
bracelets and all different other creations.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.159
Firstly you Will need to make two quantities
of the sponge cake recipe and two quantities

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.470
of one of the frosting recipes.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.199
The sponge cake and frosting recipes and all
the videos of how to make them are all on

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.140
the website howtocookthat.net and I'll put
a link in the description below this video.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.730
Place 2/3 cup of your frosting into 5 different
bowls and mix in your pink colour into the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.990
first one.

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.230
And here I am using the french buttercream
frosting recipe you can use any of the recipes

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.560
that I've got on the website just use the
on that you like the taste of the best.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.190
And I'm also making it pastel colours, if
you want them brighter you can of course just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.440
add more colouring.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.810
Then I've mixed an orange, yellow, green and
a blue.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.729
Use a cake leveler or a knife to split your
sponge cakes in half and level off the top

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.930
of each one.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.189
Place your first cake onto the cake stand
and then spread the pink frosting over the

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:20.869
top going close to but not quite to the edges
so that when you add that next layer it doesn't

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.189
all squeeze out the sides.

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.210
Continue to layer it up with the other colours.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.709
Now a few weeks back I made youtube cupcakes
with all your favourite you-tubers on them

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.450
and someone requested could i do something
similar with apps.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.859
And I thought that's a great idea.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:39.469
So let me know your favourite apps in the
comments below they can be games, photo &amp; videos

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.429
ones, lifestyle, productivity whatever apps
you love using the most.

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.990
Now cover the whole thing in a thin layer
of the uncoloured frosting.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.959
This thin layer catches any crumbs so it's
called the crumb coat.

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.969
Once it's covered place it into the fridge
to firm up.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.060
While it is in the fridge we want to make
our loom bands.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.970
Take a snake lolly and cut it's mouth so that
it opens.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.899
Then cut two slices off the tail leaving so
it leaves you with a point like this.

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.060
Heat that up with a brulee torch and then
make the snake bite it's own tail.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.200
Give it a squeeze together and then let that
cool.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.850
If you don't have a brulee torch you can light
a candle and hold it next to the base of the

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.090
flame, don't put it in the flame or it will
go black.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.650
Make lots of these in whatever colours you
like.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.130
Then we are ready to make a giant edible loom
band bracelet.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.640
Take two of your bands squash them with the
join the snake head bit in the middle and

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.180
then place one on top of the other to make
a cross.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.510
Fold the bottom one in half so it wraps around
that yellow one.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.910
Then take a red band find the head again and
squash it so the that's in the centre and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.040
then feed that through the loops on the orange
band.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.260
Now fold up the ends of the red one to make
the loops for the next bit . And you can see

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.090
we are starting to get that woven pattern.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.900
Keep adding more, for those who are unsure
what I just did I'll show you a couple more.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.410
So squash the circle and then feed it through
the loops of the last one, then straighten

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.740
it up and fold it to make that the loops for
the next one.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.610
Once you are happy with the length we need
to join it together.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.180
Now usually you'd have a plastic clasp but
we are going to use another snake.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.210
So place it through the loops of each one
then loop it around so that it is nice and

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.690
neat and trim it and use your brulee torch
again to heat it up and seal the ends together.

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.350
Now you could give this as a gift to your
friends just like that.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.941
But we are actually going to use it on the
cake.

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:44.260
Take the cake out of the fridge and cover
it in another layer of frosting using your

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.900
spatula to smooth it out.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.140
Add your loom bracelet on top and then put
the spare bands around the edge.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.040
And to make it look pretty add a smarty and
then a mini m&amp;m above each one in the matching

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040
colour.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.490
Then you can cut through the bracelet use
sharp clean scissors and obviously then use

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.960
a knife to cut through the rest of the cake
and reveal those beautiful layers of colours.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.960
