00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.310
We're going to talk about getting in and out
of the kayak at the shore. You're not always

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.230
going to have a dock to get in and out of,
so it's a lot easier, actually, than the dock.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.610
All you need to do, get in the water about
below your knees, nice shallow water. All

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.160
you want to do is basically rest the paddle
out of your way on the boat in the water,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.980
and there's two ways you can do it. You can
put a foot into the boat first, grab both

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.410
sides, using your hands for balance, and lower
your butt into the boat, grab the paddle and

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.260
you're ready to go. The other way, for some
people, it's easier for them if they have

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:45.820
less flexibility, go ahead and grab both sides
of the boat, leaving the paddle where they

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.600
can reach it, again using their hands to flex,
just setting their butt into the boat, shifting

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.200
their hands, again I've got all my weight
on my hands at the moment, and just getting

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:02.390
into the boat. Whichever works easier for
you, both ways are okay. So you always want

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.900
to have the boat facing out when you do that
so you're ready to go. Now coming in, getting

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:17.020
out of the boat, is done the exact same way.
I want to pull into the shore, put the paddle

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.100
out of my way, put both hands on the boat
so I can use the balance of my hands, I'm

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.270
shifting one leg out, shifting the other leg
out, and then just standing up. See, it's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.860
a lot easier than getting in and out at the
dock. One other thing we want to talk about

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.869
is if your boat's full of water, and you're
by yourself, what you can do is actually take

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:47.460
one end up on shore like this. That end's
up on shore, you can flip the boat over like

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.979
this, and basically seesaw the boat up and
down to drain out the water. So that way if

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.490
you have water in your boat, if you've swamped
it, that's the easy way to get the water out.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.920
Again, just seesawing one end up and down
that you're holding, the other end's on the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.229
shore.
