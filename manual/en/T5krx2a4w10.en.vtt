Hi, I am Chitrotpola Mukherjee speaking on
behalf of Expert Village. When you are working

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:19.820
on a small sculpture it can be hand held for
molding and hollowing. When you are doing

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.999
a large or tall sculpture you will require
an armature. If you attempt a large or tall

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:39.960
sculpture without this support it will collapse.
You begin making your armature with a block

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:51.750
of wood. The block should be big and sturdy
enough to support your armature and the clay

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:02.580
for your sculpture. The material for your
armature can be wood, wire or any sturdy material.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:14.040
The only requirement is that it be tall enough
to support your completed sculpture. You continue

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:35.659
to add or remove pieces of your armature as
needed. When your armature is complete to

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:42.080
your satisfaction, you will wrap it with rope.
The rope will ensure your clay does not fall

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:56.659
or disintegrate. You will secure your armature
to the block of wood using nails. Once you

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:11.769
begin to sculpt your clay onto the armature
you will need to keep it wet. When you finish

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:25.610
working wrap a cloth around the piece and
wet it. You will continue this process until

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.889
the piece is completed. The armature should
be removed when you feel the sculpture has

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.969
settled and removal can be done safely. Thank
you.
