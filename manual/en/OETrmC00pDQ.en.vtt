FEMALE SPEAKER: What's
that smell?

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.940
Are you wearing cologne?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.830
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's
Driven by Derek Jeter.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.330
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.393
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:29.257 --> 00:00:31.420
MALE SPEAKER: OK what
just happened there?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.840
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.770
She hooked up with me.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.115
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:00:33.115 --> 00:00:34.420
I saw.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.780
Why?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.540
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.452
I think it had to do
with my cologne.

00:00:38.452 --> 00:00:40.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: You know I'm
only making out with you

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.560
because you smell like
Jeter, right?

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.740
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I don't care.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.300
MALE SPEAKER: Leland,
this is amazing.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.210
Come on, you've been wanting
this for so long.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.340
MALE SPEAKER: Is it amazing?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.490
It's never going to
happen again.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.310
MALE SPEAKER: What are
you talking about?

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.685
Why?

00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:50.960
MALE SPEAKER: Because
Leif, I don't have

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.260
any more Jeter cologne.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.200
Do you understand?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.690
That was a sample.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.680
This is worse than having never
hooked up with her in

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.370
the first place.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.335
I feel like Dwayne
Wade in 2007.

00:01:01.335 --> 00:01:01.790
[HONK]

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.060
[BOOING]

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.010
MALE SPEAKER: No,
no, no, no, no.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.110
Easy solution.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.130
We go inside, we make some
calls, order some new cologne.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.050
MALE SPEAKER: You really think
it's going to work?

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.490
MALE SPEAKER: I cannot imagine
one possible scenario where it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.210
won't work.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.130
So you don't have any more?

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.200
Well, that doesn't help us.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.070
Thanks.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.920
Everyone's sold out.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.340
MALE SPEAKER: Of course
they're sold out.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.040
OK, when people go out they want
to smell like AstroTurf,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.370
and Bengay, and Tough
Actin' Tinactin.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.625
People want to smell
like athletes.

00:01:26.625 --> 00:01:26.880
MALE SPEAKER: No, no, no.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.680
When people go out, they want
to smell like celebrities.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.100
Remember that fragrance I made
for Macaulay Culkin in the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.980
early '90s?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.198
MALE SPEAKER: Home Cologne?

00:01:34.198 --> 00:01:36.488
NARRATOR (WHISPERING):
Home Cologne.

00:01:36.488 --> 00:01:37.870
MALE SPEAKER: I still
have hundreds of

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.040
bottles of that stuff.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.360
MALE SPEAKER: So how does
that help me with Bev?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.520
MALE SPEAKER: Easily.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.000
We're going to find an athlete,
put his name on that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.010
cologne, slide samples of that
cologne in the card packs

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.640
instead of gum, and then watch
the money roll in.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.000
MALE SPEAKER: But I still
won't smell like Jeter.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.015
MALE SPEAKER: No you won't.

00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:54.610
But do you know what smells
even better than Jeter?

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.550
MALE SPEAKER: Robinson Cano?

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.600
MALE SPEAKER: No, the sweet
smell of success.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.850
(TOGETHER) Ohhhhhhh--

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.050
Because Gaylen is out of the
office at a bible study--

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.420
MALE SPEAKER: Slash
singles retreat--

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.390
MALE SPEAKER: Father,
son, holy ghost.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.980
Now that's some synergy.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.270
MALE SPEAKER: We have called all
of you together to help us

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.660
come up with an athlete who can

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.266
represent our new fragrance.

00:02:45.266 --> 00:02:46.620
Take it all in.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.940
MALE SPEAKER: Smells like
Macaulay Culkin to me.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.940
NARRATOR (WHISPERING):
Home Cologne.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.050
MALE SPEAKER: I could
have been rich.

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.220
Hey Bleisner, where's
replacement Bleisner?

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.830
MALE SPEAKER: I'm not
my brother's keeper.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.140
MALE SPEAKER: So you
guys are brothers.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.940
MALE SPEAKER: In the Talmud, we
learned that Aesop affixes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.290
his hair to his arms, and--

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:02.010
MALE SPEAKER: Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.770
Who are you?

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.970
MALE SPEAKER: I think it
was Jacob by the way.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:04.480
MALE SPEAKER: It was Jacob.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.640
MALE SPEAKER: But who are you?

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.980
MALE SPEAKER: I'm [INAUDIBLE]
brother, Mordecai.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.910
MALE SPEAKER: Are you Jewish?

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.830
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.186
Please don't tell my rabbi.

00:03:13.186 --> 00:03:14.674
MALE SPEAKER: Hey my brothers.

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:16.860
Mind If I just set this up
for little bit later?

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.800
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, that's on.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.970
That camera's on.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.490
MALE SPEAKER: No, no.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.930
It's just warming up.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.050
MALE SPEAKER: OK that's
weird, right?

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.160
Let's go somewhere where
we can talk.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.500
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.750
Thank you.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.470
MALE SPEAKER: OK
that was weird.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.120
MALE SPEAKER: No what's weird
is that I'm totally

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.700
pulling this off.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.970
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you're
really pulling that off.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:36.840
MALE SPEAKER: You
do pull it off.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.760
You lose weight?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.334
You look great.

00:03:39.334 --> 00:03:40.150
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.060
Can we focus now?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.150
We need an athlete to represent
this cologne.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.670
MALE SPEAKER: Got it.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.030
Sandy Koufax.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.650
MALE SPEAKER: I feel like
that's a little old.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.000
MALE SPEAKER: Fine.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.170
Mark Spitz.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.990
MALE SPEAKER: No, again that's
just another Jewish athlete.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.450
MALE SPEAKER: Sue me.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.870
I'm proud of my heritage.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.380
MALE SPEAKER: But you're
not Jewish.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.260
MALE SPEAKER: I've got it.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.340

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.640
MALE SPEAKER: Ew.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.560
OK, let's whisper the name
because in cologne

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.810
commercials, when they whisper
the name, its always sexy.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:02.560
It sounds good.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.830
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.810
NARRATOR (WHISPERING):

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.910

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.170
MALE SPEAKER: Right?

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.840
MALE SPEAKER: I feel like it's
going to smell like catnip.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.690
MALE SPEAKER: What about--

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.310
NARRATOR (WHISPERING):
Andujar.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.940
MALE SPEAKER: I like that.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.920
MALE SPEAKER: It's a
little aggressive.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:14.520
MALE SPEAKER: But it might
be too aggressive.

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.755
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, little
too aggressive.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:16.525
MALE SPEAKER: (WHISPERED)
Hank Greenberg.

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:18.640
MALE SPEAKER: OK, that's again,
another Jewish athlete.

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.890
MALE SPEAKER: (WHISPERED)
Eliot Gould.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.090
MALE SPEAKER: Eliot Gould's
not even an athlete.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.240
MALE SPEAKER: I've got it.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.330
Candy Maldonado.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.930
MALE SPEAKER: Do we call
it Candy or Maldonado?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.380
MALE SPEAKER: Is that
even a question?

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.030
MALE SPEAKER: (WHISPERED)
Tova Feldenshush.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.110
MALE SPEAKER: That is not
even a real person.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.910
MALE SPEAKER: No.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.140
Adding a Bergstein at
the end of Tovah--

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.140
MALE SPEAKER: Let him
finish the name, and

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.960
then we can tell him--

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.790
MALE SPEAKER: (WHISPERED)
Dr. Tovah--

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.080
MALE SPEAKER: OK, see

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.210
Feldenshushbergstein and I'm
thinking yes, I've got--

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:44.460
MALE SPEAKER: That could
be a person.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.180
MALE SPEAKER: New cologne card
packs came in today, and while

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.890
they don't smell like
Jeter, get ready to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.320
have your world rocked.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.590
Right?

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.750
I mean come on.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:00.940

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.340
What are you doing?

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.860
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm going to
go find a baby's diaper to

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.150
change so I can get the
smell out of my nose.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.863
MALE SPEAKER: Really?

00:05:07.863 --> 00:05:08.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.460
Preferably a baby's who's
eaten a lot of chili.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.710
MALE SPEAKER: Well, that
was a disaster.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.890
MALE SPEAKER: My son has been
throwing up all night long.

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.540
Who's in charge here?

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.680
I need to talk to somebody.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.440
So you don't work here?

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.820
MALE SPEAKER: No, I don't.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.800
I wander through the halls--

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.570
MALE SPEAKER: Well
who's in charge?

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.650
MALE SPEAKER: We are.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.740
MALE SPEAKER: Oh way to go.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.480
MALE SPEAKER: Well you
guys have a lot of

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.510
explaining to do.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.850
MALE SPEAKER: Why?

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.590
What explaining do
we have to do?

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:38.450
MALE SPEAKER: My son has been
throwing up all night long.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.377
MALE SPEAKER: I feel like
I'm going to [BLEEP]

00:05:39.377 --> 00:05:40.510
my stomach out.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.880
MALE SPEAKER: Why is that
our responsibility?

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.840
MALE SPEAKER: Because he
drank your cologne.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.180
MALE SPEAKER: Why would
he drink our cologne?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.560
That's--

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.200
I'm sorry, but that's foolish.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.730
MALE SPEAKER: I don't know.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.008
Maybe because you
called it this.

00:05:51.008 --> 00:05:53.250
NARRATOR (WHISPERING): Candy.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.750
MALE SPEAKER: I knew we should
have gone with Maldonado.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:55.240
MALE SPEAKER: That's
what I said.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.110
MALE SPEAKER: No, that's
what I said.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.790
MALE SPEAKER: I said Maldonado
from the beginning.

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.200
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.340
What's that smell?

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.380
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, that's me.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.840
