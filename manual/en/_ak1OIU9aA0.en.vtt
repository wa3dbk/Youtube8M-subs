00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:04.310
- Ashlé: Hey.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.360
Ashlé and Henri.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.610
We're going to show you some easy, funky footwork
for the Latin fusion series.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.219
We'll demo it first and then we'll break it
down.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:21.980
And, we go one, two, three, six, seven, two,
three, six, seven.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.000
So, let's break down exactly whats happening.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.980
Without using the heel, we'll just do the
steps.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.720
So, you're stepping across one, back two,
in place, three, five, six, seven.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.100
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.000
Now what we're adding, we're adding the heel,
so you start with the heel, foot facing the

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.670
direction that you want to go in.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.020
As you move the opposite foot, you switch
back, and then place it back down.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:58.790
Then, you cross over, heel, pivot, back, and
place, and heel, pivot, back and place.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.560
And now, when you put it all together you
allow your hips to move and you move through

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.619
it leaning the direction that you're going.

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.860
So, you lean in the direction that you're
going with the heel, one two, three, five,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.139
six, seven.

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:18.469
So, when we demonstrate it with the music
and you dance it with us together, we're going

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.759
to show you two different rhythms that you
can follow.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:22.759
- Henri: Yes.

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.590
To add, again, standing, because it's funky,
you find your own flair when you do it.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.030
You can lean more up or lean more down.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.049
And it depends if you lean more rough or lean
more soft.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.950
All of them are valid in the fusion integrity
of our videos.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.910
- Ashlé: So, let's do it with the music.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.910
- Henri: Alright.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.200
So, first we are going to do it, and the same
beat, just slow.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.810
It's eight steps, alright?

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.329
- Ashlé: Five, six, five, six, seven, and
one, two, three , five six seven.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.929
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:03.529
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.139
One, two, three, five six, seven.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:10.743
Now we'll take it a little bit quicker and
we'll jump with it, so you can see what it'll

00:02:10.743 --> 00:02:11.743
look like to a faster rhythm.

00:02:11.743 --> 00:02:12.743
Ready?

00:02:12.743 --> 00:02:15.660
And five, six, seven, and, one, two, three,
five, six, seven.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.610
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.569
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.520
One, two, three, five, six, seven.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.319
- Henri: And that was our Latin fusion funky
footwork.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.319
Okay?

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.780
This is a easy version of it, so I hoped you
enjoy.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.400
Practice.
