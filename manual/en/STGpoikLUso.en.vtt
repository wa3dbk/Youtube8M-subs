00:00:05.528 --> 00:00:06.782
- [Voiceover] Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to another

00:00:06.782 --> 00:00:08.863
edition of Cooking with Booze.

00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:10.577
We got additional movies in the house

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:15.229
and today we are making
hamburgers that have beer onions,

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:15.994
- Yes indeed.

00:00:15.994 --> 00:00:17.613
- Tequila ketchup.
- That's right.

00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:19.757
- And beer cheese.
- That's right.

00:00:19.757 --> 00:00:21.479
- Yeah, loaded with booze.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.946
Alright, let's make these
burgers, cheese sauce thingies.

00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:28.446
- So we've actually got
onions that's sauteing

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:29.946
in some butter.
- Uh huh.

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:34.272
- And just a pinch of brown
sugar, to help it caramelize.

00:00:34.272 --> 00:00:37.196
And now we're just gonna
go ahead and add some beer.

00:00:37.196 --> 00:00:38.578
- Really.
- Oh yeah.

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:40.529
- The beer will burn off, won't it?

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:41.729
- The beer will cook off,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.730
but it's gonna give it a nice flavor.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.912
That beer flavor.

00:00:44.912 --> 00:00:46.095
But we're not gonna cook it all the way,

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:47.729
so we'll have a little bit of
the alcohol still in there.

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:49.364
- OK, cool.

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:51.662
- Alright so we got some
flour, some horseradish,

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:55.029
some butter, some mustard
powder, some half-and-half,

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:58.230
some cheddar cheese, and
some beer from pumpkin ale.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.754
- Alright so right here we're
making a beer cheese sauce.

00:01:00.754 --> 00:01:01.745
- Yes indeed.

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:03.162
- So we're gonna go ahead
and take some butter,

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:04.350
- Mhm.

00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.161
- Good job.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.128
- Take that flour, and we're
gonna go ahead and stir it

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:12.477
'til it gets kinda thick.

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.497
And we're gonna add
that mustard powder too.

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:17.279
Ten more seconds.
- We gotta be patient.

00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:19.078
Calm your nerves.

00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:21.328
- Have some beer while you're waiting.

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:22.396
- I don't know where his lips have been.

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.364
- Damn right girl, they
been a lotta pretty places.

00:01:24.364 --> 00:01:25.545
- (laughs)

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:27.097
- Pretty (mumbling)?

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.564
(laughs)

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:30.516
- Alright, we can just (mumbling)

00:01:30.531 --> 00:01:32.591
- You can pour that in and I'll say when,

00:01:32.591 --> 00:01:33.515
when you should stop.

00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:34.070
- Thank you.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.780
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.796
- Ready?
- Ready.

00:01:35.796 --> 00:01:37.067
- Hit me.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:38.246
- (shout)

00:01:38.246 --> 00:01:39.325
- (laughs)

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.313
- Oh no!

00:01:40.313 --> 00:01:40.982
(laughs)

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:42.337
- That ain't right, that ain't right.

00:01:42.476 --> 00:01:43.395
- And there you have it.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.383
- So now we're gonna add some
heavy, half-and-half rather.

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:51.463
- And we're gonna add some
horseradish for a kick.

00:01:51.463 --> 00:01:52.746
- You're gonna scare Krista, huh?

00:01:52.746 --> 00:01:55.195
- [Voiceover] So this is like
a nice little spicy sauce.

00:01:55.195 --> 00:01:55.914
- It is.

00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:57.627
The spicy, beery, cheese sauce.

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.257
Alright, so now I'm
gonna add, just add this.

00:01:59.257 --> 00:02:01.280
Oops, cheese.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.429
- [Voiceover] How's this
gonna be on your hamburger

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:07.796
since it's so watery?

00:02:08.113 --> 00:02:09.596
- It's a sauce!

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:11.696
- No but I mean shouldn't
it be, like, thicker?

00:02:11.696 --> 00:02:12.864
- It's gonna thicken.

00:02:12.913 --> 00:02:16.646
- We got some cumin,
ketchup, lime, adobo, agave,

00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:18.313
and of course, tequila.

00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:20.145
- Oh yeah. - So, real easy,
we're gonna actually just take

00:02:20.145 --> 00:02:22.428
store-bought (mumbling).
- Mhm.

00:02:22.428 --> 00:02:24.815
- If you make your own tomato
sauce, ketchup, we're just...

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:26.779
- Buy store-bought ketchup home boy, OK?

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.563
Cut corners.
- They got organic.

00:02:28.563 --> 00:02:29.445
You can do what you want.

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:30.388
- That is organic actually.
- Yeah.

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:33.512
- So, nothing goes with tequila like lime.

00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:34.978
Got some lime juice in there.

00:02:34.978 --> 00:02:36.313
- Boom.

00:02:36.313 --> 00:02:36.828
- (laughs)

00:02:36.828 --> 00:02:37.897
- Some cumin.

00:02:37.897 --> 00:02:38.846
- Oh yeah.

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:40.712
- We got some sweetener:
we got some agave.

00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:42.046
- Mhm.

00:02:42.046 --> 00:02:43.603
- You can use honey if
you ain't got agave.

00:02:43.603 --> 00:02:44.814
- Yeah, or even maple syrup.

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.279
Agave or honey, I would say.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:47.578
And then we got some adobo.

00:02:47.578 --> 00:02:52.496
That's gonna be that latin-y
chipotle spicy sauce.

00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:56.697
And now we're just gonna add some tequila.

00:02:56.697 --> 00:02:57.863
- Yay, the best part!

00:02:57.863 --> 00:02:59.262
For me.

00:03:00.563 --> 00:03:01.980
- [Voiceover] You don't
overdue it though, right?

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:02.814
- Yeah.

00:03:02.814 --> 00:03:04.697
Like anywhere between a
third or a fourth of a cup

00:03:04.697 --> 00:03:05.712
is all you need.
- Yeah.

00:03:05.712 --> 00:03:07.538
- (mumbling) tequila off.

00:03:07.538 --> 00:03:08.450
- Exactly.
- Yep.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.530
- So we're just stirring it up.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.196
- We can probably turn
the heat off, really.

00:03:12.196 --> 00:03:13.779
- Yeah.

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:16.147
- Alright, so we got our buns.

00:03:16.147 --> 00:03:17.436
Who doesn't like a nice soft bun, right?

00:03:17.436 --> 00:03:18.646
- Oh, word.

00:03:18.646 --> 00:03:20.763
- So we gotta get our
tequila ketchup going.

00:03:22.516 --> 00:03:24.479
- I love big buns and I cannot lie.

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:25.928
Other brothers can't deny.

00:03:25.928 --> 00:03:27.228
- What?

00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.615
- My anaconda what?

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:34.410
- My anaconda oops, right.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.518
- So I'm gonna take this
cheese sauce, look at that.

00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:38.513
- Oh that looks good!

00:03:38.513 --> 00:03:40.913
- So we got our cheese there.

00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:43.113
Stick it right on.

00:03:43.113 --> 00:03:44.994
- Oh and don't forget them beer onions.

00:03:44.994 --> 00:03:46.809
- Oh, I did not.

00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:56.712
- Alright, we made it, now
let's get in to the cutting.

00:03:58.529 --> 00:03:59.995
- And there you have it!
- That's right.

00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:00.912
- Look at that.

00:04:00.912 --> 00:04:02.613
- Burgers with beer cheese!

00:04:02.613 --> 00:04:04.295
Tequila ketchup!
- Right!

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:05.729
- Beer onions!

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.196
And lovely ladies.

00:04:07.196 --> 00:04:08.078
Alright!

00:04:08.078 --> 00:04:08.995
- You guys wanna get in it?

00:04:08.995 --> 00:04:09.885
- Yes, please.

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:11.912
- Alright, I'll make
another round for you.

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:15.230
If you want tomato, grab it.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.029
- Here.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.745
- And Brittany, cut that beautiful tomato.

00:04:17.745 --> 00:04:19.445
- Yeah, good job Brittany,
on them tomatoes.

00:04:19.445 --> 00:04:21.229
- Yeah? (laughs)

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.813
- This is a messy eat,
so don't try to eat this

00:04:22.813 --> 00:04:24.102
and try to be cute, alright?

00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:25.629
- That looks so good!

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.263
- What do you think, Brit?

00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:28.396
You like it?

00:04:28.396 --> 00:04:30.257
- Oh it's sweet!

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.722
- The onions.

00:04:34.046 --> 00:04:35.529
- Guys, go check out our channel,

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:36.614
additional movies, alright?

00:04:36.614 --> 00:04:37.745
- That's right guys.

00:04:37.745 --> 00:04:39.813
- We're gonna finish up here,
eating some of their stuff.

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:41.595
And you can use any burger, right?

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:42.979
- Just...
- Any burger you like.

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.128
- So the burger, how do you
know the burger was important,

00:04:46.128 --> 00:04:47.531
you can go to McDonald's, buy a burger,

00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:49.412
I wouldn't suggest...
- No! No!

00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:51.172
- You can get ground beef.

00:04:51.172 --> 00:04:53.278
But you can use turkey, ground veggie,

00:04:53.278 --> 00:04:54.245
whatever you want.
- Yeah.

00:04:54.245 --> 00:04:57.213
- It's more about these sweet
onions and tangy ketchup

00:04:57.213 --> 00:04:59.563
and that really pungent cheese.

00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:01.196
- Tips the bartender, I'm out.

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:03.762
- Today, we are making
an Elsa, from frozen.

00:05:03.762 --> 00:05:05.295
- Amazing (mumbling).

00:05:05.295 --> 00:05:06.695
Taste!

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:07.696
- OK.

00:05:07.696 --> 00:05:08.479
Elsa.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.045
- Taste the different
layers, the different levels.

00:05:10.045 --> 00:05:11.814
Let me know what you feel.

00:05:11.814 --> 00:05:12.780
Tell me how it touches you.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.481
How does it go?

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.162
- This middle layer, I love it by the way.
