00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:09.410
Now I'm going to show you a different way
to do the leaf stem. I'm going to just turn

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:24.829
the wires that are left together and I'm going
to take the green tape, just cut it a little

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:36.520
bit. And I'm going to cut because it's very
thin it's harder to do it, attach to...because

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.210
it's very thin I don't leave it attached to
the tape, I cut it. And I'm just going to

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:58.460
go around the wires
as close as possible to the last bead of the

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:25.979
leaf. You should do it very tight. It makes
it a little bit stronger. Until the end, and

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:47.310
now I'm going to cut the rest. And take the
leaf and attach it to the flower. When you

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:00.750
put the green tape it makes it a little bit
thicker and more stable. And It looks like

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.850
that.
