00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.575
Alrighty then. We're gonna jump right into it--you're gonna have your base ready.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:26.772
If you wanna know how I got here, you can watch... that video.

00:00:27.365 --> 00:00:32.492
And this is inspired by goth. Goth chic.

00:00:32.492 --> 00:00:36.275
I wore a look very similar to this in 
 my music video, so I'm gonna recreate it.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:45.878
Get your favorite eyeliner. I honestly need help--can you guys let me know what 
 your favorite eyeliner is? Because I still haven't found one that I like.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:48.125
Right now I'm using Wet N' Wild.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.704
I like the Infallible. I like this one--it lasts, 
 but it doesn't go on very like, thick.

00:00:54.963 --> 00:00:56.437
Does that make sense? Okay.

00:00:56.796 --> 00:00:59.479
Let's start here.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.430
This Wet N' Wild glides on super easy.

00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:17.947
Liner everywhere! Okay. Liner everywhere.

00:01:17.947 --> 00:01:20.724
It's okay! We're gonna take it off.

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:23.285
What a mess!

00:01:23.285 --> 00:01:29.881
So we got 2 eyes done! That is a basic winged eyeliner.

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:35.185
I am now going to go in. You just wanna start in here somewhere.

00:01:44.908 --> 00:01:47.850
Now the trick is to balance this with this!

00:01:50.847 --> 00:01:52.410
Look at that, it's runny.

00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:04.440
You want it--see that's--it's liquidy! And it's liquid. I guess I like pencils more.

00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:09.400
You wanna start it thin, and then go out. So 
 it's not as thin as I wanted it.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:35.050
There we go! And because I'm a perfectionist, I'm not feeling... 

00:02:35.046 --> 00:02:38.940
This thing in the front. I'm not even feeling this eyeliner!

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:42.740
 It dries matte.

00:02:42.948 --> 00:02:46.280
Now I'm gonna use this other one, Infallible.

00:02:49.035 --> 00:02:54.660
I prefer this one. Okay, so that's a 
 light line. Now I'm gonna press harder.

00:03:19.688 --> 00:03:28.030
There we go! This is just a series of filling in the 
 blanks. And finding the right liquid liner that works for you.

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:35.910
So I prefer this, Infallible, for the control. The liquid doesn't fly everywhere.

00:03:35.907 --> 00:03:43.090
But it's not liquidy enough. I don't know if it's dried out. But 
 I'm gonna clean up this eye, and I'll be right back.

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:47.330
Sorry about the sound--there is construction and it is New York City.

00:03:47.327 --> 00:03:53.680
So I fixed it. That's the dramatic cat eye. 
 And you can bring it out even more.

00:03:53.685 --> 00:03:58.390
My eyebrows were different in the video, they were straight across.

00:03:58.988 --> 00:04:02.530
I'm gonna get rid of this fall off from the eyeshadow.

00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:14.670
Now you wanna use a black liner. I just 
 got this new one from Sigma. Eclipse.

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:18.810
Just put it in the water line.

00:04:21.403 --> 00:04:26.550
So it's not as dramatic as the video because my natural brow goes down.

00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:34.820
The flow, the symmetry of it all, the flow is better if it's 
 going up. But my eyebrow is going down, so it's... 

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:39.690
It's creating a cutesy look. But if we wanna 
 go fierce, we gotta block it out.

00:04:39.688 --> 00:04:44.730
If you wanna know how I blocked it out, you can click right 
 here. But this is what it looks like with a blocked brow.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.120
Can you guys see the difference?

00:04:49.005 --> 00:04:51.980
So this is what it looks like. That's the look.

00:04:51.984 --> 00:04:57.310
Now that my eyebrows are fierced out, it can be even more dramatic.

00:04:58.248 --> 00:05:00.060
So let's just go there.

00:05:02.495 --> 00:05:06.880
See, now that my eyebrow is gone--'cause it 
 was there--I have more room to play.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.000
There.

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.900
That's what you call DRAMA, ladies and gentlemen!

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:14.830
Now for some lashes.

00:05:24.008 --> 00:05:32.600
Now for some lips. So I have an easier time controlling a brush. 
 So I'm gonna use an angled brush, some black cream liner...

00:05:32.698 --> 00:05:35.500
So I like to use a point, and I start in the corner.

00:05:36.685 --> 00:05:38.810
And work my way out.

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.970
And then I pull it inwards. Just make sure the corners are clean.

00:05:56.416 --> 00:06:00.880
Now you can leave it like this--with your natural 
 lip color in the middle--I'm gonna use this.

00:06:01.055 --> 00:06:05.620
This cute lipstick--look at the packaging! Ooh, fancy! It's from Lip Bar.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.870
And the color is Cafe Au Lait.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:11.880
I'm just gonna put it in the middle. Work it out!

00:06:11.881 --> 00:06:14.360
And then smudge my lips together.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.700
I'm not gonna put any blush on this look.

00:06:20.701 --> 00:06:26.240
If I were to put a blush on, I 
 would go with a deeper, darker color. 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:34.940
I would stay away from pinks and corals--I love those colors but for a goth 
 inspired look, I don't know if that would be the route to go.

00:06:35.362 --> 00:06:40.360
And now you put on some clothes, you know 
 what I'm sayin'? Put on some clothes, boo!

00:06:55.273 --> 00:07:01.180
Make sure you guys buy your beanies! This 
 is a great holiday gift to get.

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:06.370
When I wear the Do You Boo, you 
 know how many times people would stop?

00:07:06.372 --> 00:07:09.440
You better cop it, yo. You best cop it!

00:07:09.443 --> 00:07:12.880
And I am ready for the cold! Bring it!

00:07:12.875 --> 00:07:16.960
Cop your beanie. Have positive messages seep into your mind.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.260
This is a constant reminder to everyone looking at you, and yourself.

00:07:20.258 --> 00:07:30.900
Even when you're not looking in the mirror, the energy that I've endowed into this hat 
 is seeping into your brain. So doing you will be a lifestyle and habit, okay?

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.640
Simple as that, cop your beanie!

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:39.360
Do you--hah! Do you, be you, stay true.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.330
Be shameless, yo!

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.320
Ahh! Illuminati! Oh my God, Maya, what are you doing?!

00:07:45.321 --> 00:07:49.450
Y'all be crazy, yo! Be shameless!

00:07:53.063 --> 00:07:56.000
Ven aqui--Ven aqui, Jackie! Que pasa, Jackie?!

00:07:56.002 --> 00:08:02.380
You want--you want me to do your eyes? Want me 
 to do your liner? Black liner for you? 

00:08:02.378 --> 00:08:05.890
No! Don't lick my makeup girl, I worked really hard on this!

00:08:05.886 --> 00:08:10.060
Say 'bye'! Say 'be shameless'! Say 'do you boo'!
