Hi, I am Simon from Warm Glass UK.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.640
Mould preparation is a really important
part of the kiln forming process.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.230
So in this video today I'm going to show
you

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.950
three types of mould preparation products and what they're used for.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.930
In the Warm Glass studio we use Bullseye Shelf Primer, Primo Primer and Boron Nitride Spray.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.260
The Bullseye Shelf Primer is a great primer for priming large moulds.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.220
You basically want to give 5 even coatings of the primer, changing direction each time you add an application.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.920
You don't need to dry this between applications because it only needs a thin coat.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.600
And any of these bumps that you get, you can actually wipe out afterwards

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.699
by just putting a piece of paper between the shelf primer in your hand

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.200
and just rubbing gently and it'll give you really smooth finish that will last for ages. 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.500
The Primo Primer is good for small detail moulds,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.520
and Primo Primer really settles a lot in the bottom of the container,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.740
so be careful to make sure that you stir it up really, really well before you actually use it.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.950
And then you can use a brush to apply
the primer

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.500
and you just work it into the small little
details in the mould, 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.680
applying a single coat at a time, 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.300
and it's best to dry this in between each coat using a hair dryer or

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.300
something like that, because that allows you to pick up more detail.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.469
Finally, for stainless steel moulds, we
use Boron Nitride spray.

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:44.320
Boron Nitride spray is limited to the lower temperature ranges.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.720
You need to put about three second blast,
you just spray that onto the mould.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.880
It's best for stainless steal moulds because
it's very expensive.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.100
and it's not great at really high temperatures, so more suited to 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.680
slumping temperatures, so just save it for your stainless steel moulds.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.880
So all these products and many more alike

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.880
are available on the Warm Glass website
warm-glass.co.uk

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.520
I hope that's been helpful. Thanks for
watching.
