00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.840
On the muck that people hate..
Blooms a beautiful lotus…

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.040
To worship the holy God
Helps the beautiful lotus too...

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.220
In the dirty oysters…
See the beautiful pearls we do…

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.500
To tie this as a lovely chain...
And to beautify help it does...

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.880
The blackish Cuckoo it does have..
A very soothing voice to sing…

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.080
Makes me want to listen more...
To the melodious tune i hear...

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.200
With the poisonous Snake...
Is the most precious gem…

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.540
Oho, that beautiful gem…
Will reach the hands of the King…

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.900
Upon the needle like thorns…
Will the beautiful rose blossom...

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.160
To the fragrant smell of it…
I wish to hold and adorn it…

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.320
In the dirtiest of places…
Are the most beautiful of things…

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.540
With no concern to others…
Why do you mock at them…

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.620
In the dirtiest of places…
Are the most beautiful of things…

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.980
With no concern to others…
Why do you mock at them…

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.280
On the muck that people hate..
Blooms a beautiful lotus…

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.520
To worship the holy God
Helps the beautiful lotus too...

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.740
In the dirty oysters…

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.000
To tie this as a lovely chain...
And to beautify help it does...

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.380
