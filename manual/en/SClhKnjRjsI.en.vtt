This is Diana Sullivan. I'm doing some beginning machine knitting lessons

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.179
and I'm demonstrating a plain hem  To save time,

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.089
I've begun with a few rows already knitted in a contrasting color of waste yarn.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.549
We commonly call this waste yarn in machine knitting because we're going to pull it off and throw it away.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.410
And then I have some slippery string that we call ravel cord, and I'm going to knit one row with the ravel cord.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.930
The ravel cord acts as a divider.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.960
And I leave the ravel cord hanging down,

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.679
then I put the main yarn in the carriage, and I'm going to knit twice the number of rows as

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.420
the depth of the hem.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.520
So if the inside of the hem and the outside of the hem

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.920
are six rows each, it's 12 rows folded over, so I'm going to go 12 rows.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.770
Then I pick up,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.520
remove the comb from the knitting,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.400
and I'm going to pick up the hem.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.120
What I'm going to do is pick the open loops up

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.500
from must above the throw-away yarn,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080
and I'm going to put them on the needle.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.909
Starting with the right -- you start either side.  Keep in mind that you're going to end up

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.539
with one loop too few for your hem,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.319
because there's one less loop at the bottom than there is at the top. And if you look at this

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.929
contrasting thread in between, the loop that I'm getting is a u-shape.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:01.019
I don't want to pick up the upside down U's.  I want to pick up the u-shapes and just hang it on the needle

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.050
that is the most directly above.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.130
I'm going to work on across.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.710
When I get to the end, I'm going to be short one stitch.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.289
The tool I'm using is called a transfer tool. I slip it inside the loop

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.969
I want to put on the needle.  I put the needle inside the loop of the transfer tool.

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.969
It has an eye on it like a needle.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.450
Then I put that I eye right over that hook, and then I just kind of lift up and it goes in.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.139
A little awkward here, because I'm trying to stay out of the way of the camera.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.740
If I get to a place where it's hard to see what to pick up.  I just kind of stretch all downward

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.930
and look at where the loops are.  This is the last loop right here,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.620
and I'm just going to pick that up.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.590
And it's a good idea to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.959
put everything in E position before going and closing the hem by knitting one row.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260
It's now joined.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.020
I'm gonna knit a few rows,

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.160
pop it off the machine,

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500
and show you the hem.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.910
Of course, I'm going to have to catch it.

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.829
This is the hem.  We take the clothespin off,

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.489
and I'm going to remove

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.390
the waste yarn by just grabbing the end of the slippery

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.169
ravel cord and taking that off.  It comes right off.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.650
Then this is the inside of the hem.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.159
This is the doubled part down here, and if you flip it over, there's the stockinette side.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.440
And that is a simple hem.
