Sylvia Pereira: I chose the Creative Photography program at Humber because 
 I knew actually a lot of people who had

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:24.799
come to this program and they're a lot of my friends 
 who are photographers that I really admire their ability to

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:30.952
put together an image that was really arresting in both technical quality and concept.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:36.130
Bruce Redstone: I think that when I came into the program 
 my knowledge was quite a bit more superficial and

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.958
I feel at this point in time the program 
 has built a foundation of knowledge and skill.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:49.017
Gillian Mapp: I think it's a lot about technical capabilities and 
 I just didn't have the environment to learn about lighting.

00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:53.220
I was doing a lot of just street photography, natural light.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:02.369
Sylvia Pereira: What I learned most at Humber was lighting techniques 
 as well as overall composition and how to work in

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:06.608
the studio. I had never used Hasselblads and phase backs before.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:12.307
Bruce Redstone: This is really a photography-oriented program and that's what 
 I was looking for. I also like the fact

00:01:12.307 --> 00:01:16.970
that it was a two-year program. A very intense two-year program.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:26.536
Gillian Mapp: We've been working for two years now to build a portfolio, 
 a strong portfolio and here's all the second years work and

00:01:26.536 --> 00:01:30.836
sort of like the last step for us as Humber students, which is amazing.

00:01:31.905 --> 00:01:39.892
I guess my plan is to try to get into as many magazines as I can. I've 
 had a few pieces here published but I want to do a lot more of that.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.670
I'm planning to set up my own studio. Part of the 
 program here involves the study of the business of photography

00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:54.320
entrepreneurship and the like and I think that those things have 
 really helped me a lot so I feel quite confident

00:01:54.325 --> 00:01:57.590
stepping ahead into my own business.

00:01:58.503 --> 00:02:06.780
Now I realize that I want to go back into photojournalism and use 
 that to help sort of build my portfolio in portraiture 

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:13.550
and fashion because if you have an eye in photojournalism then I think 
 I can bring that towards working with people in any environment.
