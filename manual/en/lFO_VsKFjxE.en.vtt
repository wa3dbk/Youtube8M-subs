00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.510
00:08
COMM: Hurtling forward at speeds of 226 miles

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.220
per hour, this is view from inside Britain's
fastest road legal car.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.820
00:17
ANDY: Sweet as a nut.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.440
00:20
COMM: Red victor 3 carries a 3000 horse power

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.100
VA engine that can propel it from 0 to 60
in under a second, yet you can still see owner

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.529
Andy Frost taking it out for a spin round
the streets of Wolverhampton.

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:39.730
00:35
COMM: Andy has dedicated his life to the project

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.619
spending thousand converting a humble Vauxhall
Victor into the speed demon we see today.

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.810
00:46
SHANE: So Andy's got everything invested in

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.810
this.

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.309
Time, y'know this is a 30 year project for
him because realistically this started with

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.310
Red Victor 1 and the original Red Victor that
he bought you know as a VX490 but way back

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.310
whenever.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.320
So this is an evolution of that, sort of lets
say dream and so he's got every single thing

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.550
in his life for 30 years invested into what
is sitting right behind him.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.390
01:09
COMM: But Andy's efforts were once again paid

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.470
back when at the Santa Pod raceway in Bedfordshire,
the 53-year-old broke his own speed record

00:01:18.470 --> 00:02:00.570
by covering a quarter of a mile in just 6.4
seconds.
