00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.699
&gt;&gt;MICHAEL LITTMAN: The Model T story got 
started, I guess it's about eight years ago,

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.460
I was running a summer workshop program and I had 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.019
put in a request for a three-dimensional printer

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.559
to be used in our machine shop which
cost $30,000

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.499
I put in the request to the dean of the college

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.210
and I got one of these congratulations letters

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.210
and then in came the check for $10,000

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.720
We were heading over to our senior dinner

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.180
and there's another Model T

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.310
originally from the Class of 1950, now 
the Class of '82... we were driving 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.910
over to the Mountain Lakes House and I 
said, "Glenn, what are we going to do

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.130
with $10,000?" And we were in the T, 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.270
and Glenn said, "Well, why don't we get
a T?" Which we went out and did.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.880
So we restored the T, worked on it with 
students for a number of years

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.600
that was great fun

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.040
and the students learned a lot

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.250
and then Glenn came up with an idea to
do a motorcycle.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.500
We were looking at them and Glenn 
pulled up the Triumph Tiger Cub

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.600
I looked at it, I saw the name, and
I don't know much about motorcycles

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.980
But we're Princeton, it's for Princeton
freshmen. What could be better than a
Tiger Cub? 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.890
This is not motorcycle maintenance

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.570
[laughter] because we're Princeton.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.280
It's motorcycle design.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.390
There's a huge difference there.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.410
We look at many years of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.890
the motorcycle -- 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.500
sequential years -- 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.970
which allows us to do some critical
comparative analysis. 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.820
If we think about the motorcycle as 
a system, you can break it into four
basic systems.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630
There's the structural,
the mechanical,  

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.299
there's an electrical network, and 
a process.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.909
I use this in another course on the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.130
history of engineering. We use those
four systems

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.329
to describe all of engineering. 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.420
So what I have here is a little gadget
in front: the ping-pong rocket.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.330
You hook up,

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.000
there's a little bit of acid in there
to allow for some conductivity.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.169
We'll hook it up to a battery,

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.299
two electrodes in the liquid,

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:19.469
and then when you do that

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.529
you have the process of hydrolysis

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:29.269
-- you break water into hydrogen and 
oxygen.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.489
OK, so hydrogen and oxygen come together

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.159
-- next slide -- open the valve to mix 
gasses -- next slide

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.039
ignite the mixture, bang!

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:37.409
OK should we try that?

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.089
We'll bring the gasses in...

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.199
[LOUD POP] 
            [laughter]

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.480
Did that wake everybody up?

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.979
The gas tank on the motorcycle 
serves two purposes --

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.459
it holds the gasoline,

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.059
but it also is at a point in the
frame that needs bracing.

00:02:57.059 --> 00:03:03.329
As you look inside the gas tank, 
you see that there's an internal

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.269
strut there that completes the 
frame.

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.250
So the tank is 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.079
part of the frame

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.769
and it's also serving the role

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:13.319
that it holds the fuel. It's doing two
things at once,

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.899
and there are a lot of those kinds of
integrated parts that are part of the 
motorcycle.

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.339
This year, I am happy to report

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:25.229
that I talked risk management into 
letting the students onto the motorcycle.

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:30.409
So students, if they get learners' permits,
which means they'll be street legal,

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.959
We're going to let them take the motorcycle 
around a track

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.409
after we get the motorcycle restored.
