00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.680
Oxford Business Group: The ink is barely dry
on the big money deal that saw Abu Dhabi and

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.260
Qatar
take a major stake in the UK's second largest

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.260
bank, Barclays.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.240
But this
hasn't deterred Britain's Prime Minister from

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.900
asking this region for more
financial help, this time for the IMF.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
Ben Thompson reports.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.150
Ben Thompson

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.420
This was a fundraiser like no other.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.930
Gordon Brown on a mission to the
Middle East to win support from the oil rich

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.590
Gulf States and persuade them
to part with more cash to help the West.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.870
He wants the region to use its
vast oil wealth to contribute to an IMF bailout

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.210
pot for countries with
failing economies.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.560
As more and more countries struggle to pay
back their

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.320
debt, the existing pot simply isn't big enough.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.489
Oliver Cornock, Regional Editor, Oxford Business
Group

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.450
One of the major factors, which Gordon Brown
has realized, as has everybody

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.600
else, the IMF is desperately short of money.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.640
There is a huge amount of
liquidity within this region, and it is time

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.949
to try and drum up some of
that, according to Gordon Brown.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.539
The Gulf has a commodity which the world
needs.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.300
We live in a globalized era, and I think there
has to be some

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.350
interaction, interdependency now.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.610
Ben Thompson

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.020
But whilst the handshakes are welcoming and
the smiles are friendly, asking

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.890
for money is never an easy job, and with the
region still struggling to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.640
assess its own exposure to the crisis, the
timing of Gordon Brown's visit

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.750
has surprised many.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.870
Mohammed Ali Yasin, Managing Director, Shuaa
Securities

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.340
I really believe that today the response that
you're getting from the

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.600
governments is that they're saying that, yes,
we will be contributing to

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.890
this, but it is not an open check.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.060
We still have, I think it will be very
difficult for them to justify them putting

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.490
money outside if they still have
some problems in their local markets.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.600
And today you have to remember that
those governments and some of their sovereign

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.310
funds have been invested in
the West for a long time, and they got hit

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.299
as bad as anybody else.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.119
So I
would say maybe somewhere toward the early

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.540
first quarter 2009 would have
been a better time to have come and talk to

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.710
them once you see that they
have stabled their economies.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.950
Ben Thompson

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.920
So whilst the some region may have the money,
it also wants something in

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
return.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.659
That could mean more deals like this one.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.220
Investors from Abu Dhabi
and Qatar paid more than $12 billon for a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.720
30% stake in the UK's second
largest bank.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.379
So with some of the world's biggest businesses
in desperate

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.980
need of cash, does this signal the start of
a spending spree by cash rich

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.250
Middle Eastern investors?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.270
With share prices at record lows some experts
say

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.900
they could now be eyeing up some prized assets.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.900
Adeel Khan, Chief Executive, Potentia Inc.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.470
They don't have any industry specification.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:40.239
They don't tie themselves to a
particular geographical location.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.570
So the world is their oyster.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.950
If they
will find a good deal, they will go.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.069
There will be so much activity in
trying to get that particular deal.

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:59.890
They like good commercial deals, and
when they see it, they buy it.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.890
Ben Thompson

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.840
And if the last few years are anything to
go by, they'd be right.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.269
New
figures from the IMF suggest that regional

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:12.080
investors and sovereign wealth
funds now hold assets worth more than $3 trillion,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.150
and that figure is set
to triple in the next five years.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.300
And so for the struggling economies of
the West and their cash starved businesses,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.010
a shopping spree from the
Middle East and the ready money that that

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.200
provides couldn't come at a
better time.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.340
Ben Thompson reporting there.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.599
And its businesses like those . . .
