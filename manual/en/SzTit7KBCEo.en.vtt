00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:13.599
Hello everyone, here we are today with a slightly
different kind of product.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.870
This is a case but not quite like you might have seen before.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:21.270
These are designed for when you're going on
 holiday so if you know you're going to be 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.820
round by the pool or taking a trip out on a boat or anything like that and you 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.199
are concerned about moisture getting into your phone, who isn't!

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.350
Then this could be the product for you.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.490
So let me show you what these actually are.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.440
Essentially it's a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.210
plastic bag

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.160
which

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.160
you can pop your phone into, seal up and it
 remains waterproof and it has

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.300
these stickers so that you know if any moisture has got into the device

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.290
that you can immediately change the bag etcetera.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.300
So what we do, we take one of these stickers

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.920
and we just pop it onto the back of the device

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.950
and then

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.540
we stretch this cover so that it goes over

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.460
the device

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.610
and our phone will sit inside it.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.980
Now you might think to yourself, this is a
little bit

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.100
fiddly, you're going to risk tearing it, but the plastic bag is actually quite

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.130
durable

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.100
Let's get this into here.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.200
It does take a little bit of fiddling

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.580
it's a little bit 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.580
oops, I've actually put that on the wrong way round, let's go again.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.830
As I say, it does take a little bit of work
to make this happen.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.390
I'm trying to stop it from getting bunched up, there we go.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.560
What you need to do is really get it as 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.340
close a fit as possible all the way
around the device

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.590
if you can

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.590
Not the easiest thing in the world to do,
admittedly

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:15.839
and then

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:18.189
you take one of these sealing strips at
the back

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.119
and you seal up that hole

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.629
but bear in mind that depending on which way round you pop this on,

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.169
it is going to cover up

00:02:26.169 --> 00:02:29.059
or make the camera slightly more difficult to use but 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.329
what you then have

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.549
is a device that you can still use

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:33.789
still works

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:38.289
all your touch controls, all your buttons can still be got to but it's within a 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:43.409
100% sealed package basically so you can now take this down to the pool and not

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.659
worry about getting moisture in there. Like I say you can use this indicator

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:54.129
and if when you first go near a source of
water this changes color

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.179
then you know that the seal hasn't been good
enough and you'll have to do it again, take it

00:02:57.179 --> 00:03:00.489
back out. Now they reckon that you can use each one of these bags a couple of times

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.919
which is why you get two in 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:07.019
each packet you get two of these covers,
that's good enough  for four uses basically

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.369
and four of the sealing tabs

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.789
and four of the water indicators

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:14.779
and basically

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.349
that keeps your device nice and dry.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:24.069
A perfect option for those going on any nice holiday.
