Hey whats up people its your boy AnimeAnalyst!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.610
Here with yet another Naruto Storm Revolution
Discussion.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.180
Now today we are going to be discussing the
Naruto Revolution Gameplay Footage Leaked

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.260
via Twitch, Ninja Escapades Mode, Ninja World
Tournament Mode, Free Battle everything like

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.260
that.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.870
Next Relays vs Guard Break Pills.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.840
Should they remap it to the circle button?

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.520
How does it feel to use either or?

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.940
Which one do you like better?

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.110
Was it a good choice to give everyone a guard
break pill?

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.922
Just everyones thoughts on it, im going to
give my thoughts on it and lastly we are going

00:00:48.922 --> 00:00:55.630
to be talking about something that i was talking
about in the comments with some naruto commenters.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.030
He actually came up with the idea.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.670
I really cant remember where it was but, yea
this really not my idea but im just going

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.860
to add on to it because it was a great idea.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:16.820
So without further ado...Where we at people?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:25.780
So A while ago the people over at SpazioGames
on Twitch got a copy of the full game of Revolution

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.289
I think and they really just streamed fifty
minutes worth of gameplay footage on twitch

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.820
and it really showed us what the game entailed.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.009
So they showed free battles they showed the
Ninja World Tournament Mode and they showed

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.759
the Ninja Escapade Mode.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:50.039
So the one that i am probly most hyped about
would probly be Ninja Escapade mode because

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.259
i just like being able to see animations that
i've never seen before and its just awesome

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:01.950
to be able to play that and basically breath
life into a story that otherwise hasn't been

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.780
really covered in detail and I can say that
Ninja Escapade could be the one that I am

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.280
most anticipating in the game because having
seen Ninja World Tournament Mode and the Free

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.800
Battle, everything basically looks the same
as storm 3.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.519
I mean you probably cant even sprint in Ninja
World Tournament Mode Which is just running

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:31.829
stupid errands that really have no value and
have no in depth like its just shallow as

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.689
a whole modes like that to me unless its like
a Storm 1 style where you can actually jump

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.819
around and stuff but that seems to not be
the case in this Ninja World Tournament Mode

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.719
so the the regular battles they did a couple
regular battles like free battles and they

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:54.319
basically looked the same i mean the character
roster if you guys have seen it, It might

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.189
be the official roster but im not, we are
not sure yet at this point.But the character

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.890
roster really looked weak in my point of view.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.810
I think they could have done alot more with
the roster.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.689
And i personally don't like the design either
it makes it look like...I like vibrant colors

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.349
in my character selection screen so that character
roster wasn't up my alley and it just needed

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.349
more.

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.420
Which Mode are you guys anticipating the most
in Naruto Revolution so do you wanna get your

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.390
free battles in or are you waiting for Ninja
World Tournament Mode or are you ready to

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.359
dive into Ninja Escapade Mode.

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.530
Leave that down in the Comments Section Below.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.670
Next we are going to be talking about relays
vs guard break pills.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.280
When we first saw the trailer we thought that
the guard break pill was actually a relay

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.719
but it turns out relays have been erased from
the game completely.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.260
A new feature that they added last entry has
been erased from the series.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.400
I feel that that was just not a really good
move on their part because i've become accustomed

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.810
to using relays so much that its basically
second nature to relay when i feel the time

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.810
is necessary.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.689
And with the guard break pill it just seems...it
doesn't seem natural because of how you press

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.209
the up directional button on my controller
and that just seems out of the way when im

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.639
mid way in a combo fighting someone.

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.829
Maybe it could be more useful if they actually
mapped it to a control where you did relays

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.030
in storm 3.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.500
You either hold circle on playstation 3 and
you will do your relay.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.270
So i dont see why they just didnt make the
guard break pill accessible through the up

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.740
directional pad and the control where relay
was functional in storm 3 just hold the circle

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:39.740
button.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.740
What are you guys opinions on it.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.120
Do you like Relays better or do you like guard
break pills better.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.420
You think the guard break pill could have
has potential to be a great addition to the

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.840
game if they just switched up how it works
a little bit or do you think its just a total

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.139
flat on fail addition to the game?

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.060
Leave that down in the comments section below
discuss it people.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.960
Lastly we going to be talking about what an
idea that a naruto commenter from someones

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.740
video i kinda forget but if you see this video
thumbs up to you im just adding onto it, its

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.240
not my idea what so ever but team awakenings
in Naruto Storm Revolution.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.199
Could that be a beast addition to the game?

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.400
So the way that the guy kinda explained how
it worked was that if you pick a certain team

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.430
that corresponds with each other as an awakening
type.

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.330
When you awaken they would actually do a team
awakening thought an example of that would

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.300
be...You pick naruto and sasuke and you pick
awakening mode for either or them and you

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.410
have them as support so when you awaken they
would actually turn into Kurama Susanoo Equipped.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.240
So you would be Kurama with the Susanoo Armor
Equipped because both of them would actually

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.800
have a part in the awakening.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:59.930
Now its kind of a good idea if you think about
it because all three battle types have some

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.990
involvement with their support.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.400
Awakening Type is the only battle type that
does not have any involvement with their support

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.090
outta just having them as a support, if you
get what i mean.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.699
So I think that this would really be amazing
it would just add onto the wow ness factor

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:18.699
in this game.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.139
I know they already done team ultimate jutsus
but once you have a team ultimate jutsus on

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:25.860
deck maybe you can just add team awakenings.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.020
Maybe it has to wait until the next entry
in the game but i think it would be cool.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.110
The ones that i thought of personally i couldnt
really think of that much but the ones that

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:42.569
i thought of could be also ideas is Minato
and Naruto doing the Team Ultimate i mean

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.530
Team Awakening where they fist bump and they
have both dark side and light side Kurama

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.530
and they really just turn into the ninetails
all together like actually fur and everything

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.850
beast team awakening for Minato And Naruto.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.099
And the last one i thought off...Well the
only one i could think of.

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:05.320
Gaara and his dad awakening into Shukaku but
Gaaras Dad making Shukaku Golden so Gaara

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:11.150
would transform into Shukaku and the kazekage
his dad would just brew up gold dust around

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:17.030
shukaku as a shield and as just to look awesome
because wouldnt that be amazing to have a

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.630
golden shukaku that would just look beast
and yea.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.120
