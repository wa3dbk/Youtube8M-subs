00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.600
EVENTUALLY I'M A SON --

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.000
EVENTUALLY, SUN SHOULD REACH

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.340
MOST OF THE AREA.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.470
AARON HERNANDEZ FLASHING

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.410
THAT

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.340
SMILE AND A BOSTON COURTROOM.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.640
THE JUDGE SETTING HIS TRIAL DATE

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.810
FOR A DOUBLE MURDER IN THE SOUTH

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.380
END.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.450
THAT IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN MAY

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.980
28 OF NEXT YEAR.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.450
IT IS ONLY A FEW MONTHS AFTER HE

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.590
GOES ON TRIAL FOR ANOTHER MURDER

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.720
.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.290
A FORMER TEAMMATE OF HERNANDEZ

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.330
IS SHOWING HIM SOME SUPPORT.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.360
FOR THE FIRST TIME WE

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.800
HEAR

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.730
FROM A FORMER TEAMMATE, THE ONLY

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.200
PERSON WHO PLAYED WITH AARON

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.740
HERNANDEZ PUBLICLY STANDING BY

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.540
THE TRIPLE MURDER SUSPECT.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.420
RETIRED PATRIOT RUNNING BACK

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:53.040
KEVIN FAULK TELLING

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.780
CNN HE HAS

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.120
NOT GIVEN UP ON HIS EX TEAMMATE.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.250
PROSECUTORS ARE SAYING THAT

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.480
HE ORCHESTRATED THE EXECUTION OF

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.950
SOMEONE.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.960
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE ME

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.630
BELIEVE THAT HE IS A MONSTER

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.830
BECAUSE YOU'D USE THOSE TYPE OF

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.160
WORDS.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.660
HERNANDEZ IS NOW ACCUSED OF

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.600
THREE MURDERS.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.870
THAT HAS NOT CHANGED FAU

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.740
LK'S

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.870
OPINION.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.110
I DO NOT WANT HIM TO HAVE

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.070
DONE IT.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.360
I DO NOT THINK HE DID IT.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.910
AT THE SAME TIME, ANYBODY CAN BE

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.180
PUSHED TO DO SOMETHING DRASTIC

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.680
LIKE THAT.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.220
WE ALSO HEAR FROM THE SHERIFF

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.250
WHO IS TRYING TO KEEP HERNANDEZ

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.620
IN LINE HE AWAITS TRIAL IN

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.560
BRISTOL COUNTY.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.090
HE SAYS THAT

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.930
HERNANDEZ HAS BEEN

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.730
READING THE BIBLE AND ANOTHER

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.470
BOOK HE SUGGESTED.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.870
TO EXAMINE HOW TO CREATE A

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.100
CENTERED, MEANINGFUL LIFE.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.920
HE WAS MOVED BY THE BOOK.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.780
THAT DOES NOT STOP HERNANDEZ

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.980
AND GETTING IN TROUBLE EVEN IN

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.450
JAIL.
