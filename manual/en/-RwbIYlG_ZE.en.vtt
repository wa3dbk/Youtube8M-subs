00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.000
hi Anthony my name is David Burns over
here a handy Toyota up in Saint Albans

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.920
I pulled up here 2014 FJ Cruiser

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.420
I think you're well aware of what
addition this is the ultimate trail team

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.070
edition

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.139
so I want to give you this video just
kinda

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.529
give you a quick walk around of the vehicle
open up the doors and kinda

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.910
give you different look at those
features so starting here in the front

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.170
obviously the color special one in 2500
available this year

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.740
now we actually have two here but this
one again

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.790
very well equipped I think everything
that one can look for on the FJ

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180
basically is gonna come with this
package anyhow

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.489
everything from the the wheels to
obviously

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.039
the roof rack you have the side step
bars or or roll bars really depending on

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:47.270
what your use would be

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.250
all the upgrade equipment so all of
obviously the shocks and suspension

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.360
everything

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.680
all upgraded um just a nice vehicle

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.859
great look to it I not shying any other
features for instance

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.250
as you come around the back even have
obviously big spare tire full-size

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.570
mounted right on the back there trailer hitch
in all even with a nice chromed out

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.360
exhaust tip so very beautiful vehicle
let me open up the doors

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.670
I'm not sure maybe you've alreay been in
the FJ Cruiser family and you're well

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.830
aware of these vehicles

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.960
I find them very unique because they're
not something I'm used to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.409
so for instance like opening up the back
door kinda swings out a little bit there

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.040
in down for easy opening and easy access
for people to hop in the back

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.409
that's what I'll show you right now at
least in this perspective

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.740
is all the vinyl here on the floor
really easy to keep clean

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.650
obviously pretty rugged you have a nice
dark interior here with a grey black

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.490
contrast

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.340
all kinds adjustable headrests and
everything which is nice to have

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.130
now while this head rest is folded down
when I reach up here go ahead and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.700
fold this seat  down just to come to give
you that perspective what it would look

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.329
like to have that folded down

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.579
now you can have the seat up 
a little bit here

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.880
now that is just without this part so
you can get the fold

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.590
flat feature by going ahead with
adjusting the headrest once again

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.360
popping up the bottom part of the seat and then
you can push in a lot more flat that way

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.099
course the rugged back there which backs
the seats

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.239
so if you do have some cargo you are stowing away here in a

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.160
not scratching up anything that way nice
utility I mean everything's covered now

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.930
the vinyl

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.830
or that hard plastic backing lots of
different adjustments for people who

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.060
confrot and everything

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.489
so it's a pretty cool pretty
accommodating vehicle again if you

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.840
haven't had a chance to be able to step
inside an FJ Cruiser highly suggest

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.959
you can take it out for a test drive
mean either way

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.860
whether you're familiar with this
product or not it's a whole lot of fun

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.879
and there's no compromise in terms of
options and features

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.209
I'm gonna have you actually hop right
into the driver's seat at this point and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.769
talk a little bit about those features

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.269
to know that you in the driver's seat
definitely worth mentioning this truck

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.959
just came off from the other truck

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.690
with only eight miles so it's just a
baby hasn't seen even a lot of test drives 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.140
pretty new to our inventory as we back away
we'll start off with all the hands-free

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.030
technology there on the steering wheel

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.090
from volume adjustments different modes on
the left hand side to your Bluetooth and

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.510
voice recognition system

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.980
preparing up your cell phone they're on
the right now

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.400
in conjunction with that CD player all
kinda nice audio stuff

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.920
really unique layout for this FJ Cruiser
for the audio system

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.920
other big large controls here for
temperature control

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.489
I'm gonna take you up not down see have
obviously your clock

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.129
your other information here compass
outside temperature

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.580
and obviously your degree of role

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.650
auto dim rearview mirror that you have
there and you also have a home link

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.040
three different settings where

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.450
if you want to pair garage door opener of
and of course

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.450
on the trial team edition here you have
a locking differential for the rear

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.049
advanced traction control and different
speed adjustments for

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.959
when you're climbing in doing any kind
of off-roading like that some kind

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.310
unique things on is taking over the head
rest here

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.500
not the address the sorry
the visor so couple different options to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.430
be able to have both your mirrors here

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.450
for your guests as well as on your side
and also your comfort

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.150
for having this really unique visor
there over on my side

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.530
as we can to come down you noticed USB
auxiliary ports here

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.790
for your cell phone plugins 12 volt there

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.889

and some different adjustments here for
electrical hookups 400 watt

120 volt AC in a 100 watt also

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.290
so here obviously your shift into

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.560
four-wheel drive low as well as high
two and high four

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.830
so unique in that sense the FJ Cruiser

four drive three drive

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.389

from so lots of different options as far as

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.460
the system the drive system in the
vehicle

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.680
