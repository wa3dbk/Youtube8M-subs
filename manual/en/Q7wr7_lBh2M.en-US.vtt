00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.828
Hi girls, summer is now here! Let's have a fabulous pedicure. (generique)

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.714
Here's two nail art tutorials for your feet (generique)

00:00:12.742 --> 00:00:16.971
First of all I apply a watermelon color varnish on my nails

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.742
I apply two layers as usual

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.257
Here's a video about pedicure before the application of the varnish.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.200
You'll find in it, many advices to do perfectly your pedicure.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.200
Don't forget to do it before apply your varnish.

00:00:32.028 --> 00:00:37.057
Once the varnish has been applied, let's do the watermelon design.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.057
For that, you'll need a green varnish.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.914
Do not use opposite colors, like red and green.

00:00:44.914 --> 00:00:46.910
It won't look great.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.228
Here I am using a green Pantone of this year.

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:54.400
As you can see, I have done a straight and large French manicure.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.371
So that it really looks like a watermelon.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.142
If it overflows, scratch it with a stick.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.228
And now with a white varnish liner,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.057
I mark out this French manicure

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.857
It's a funny nail art that you can of course do on your hands

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.542
if you want to match them with your feet

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.200
I did the nail art only on the big toe

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
as it will be a bit complicated on the small ones.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.514
You may do the green French manicure on the small ones.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.342
But I prefer to leave the little nails as they are

00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:29.914
Now that the mark out is done

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.342
With a black liner, I draw some drops to draw the seeds

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.342
To do the seeds you just need to press with your liner

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.600
and if the liner is correctly wiped in the bottle it will make the seed directly

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.571
I recommend the use of a thin liner brush.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.314
Do not use cheap quality liner.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.742
I only use the Artclub now

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.257
It's my favorite and the best liner brush.

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:04.057
Then to add some texture to these seeds

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.457
I add a little drop of white on the right or the left side of the seeds

00:02:09.457 --> 00:02:11.450
To create a shadow

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.685
It will make it more noticeable.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.600
But it's useless to do one stroke or detailed spirals on toenails.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Since it is on your toenails, no one will really pay much attention to them.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.885
So do simple and noticeable designs.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.885
Now I clean up with my square brush and acetone

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:31.880
And then I apply my top coat

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.742
So there's the final result of the watermelon nail art.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:40.514
And now I will show you how to do a nail art which is a bit more serious

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.342
A flowered nail art

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.057
So first as usual, I apply a base. Here it's the A.England varnish.

00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:53.914
You can't see it on the video but in fact I had so many difficulties to shoot it.

00:02:53.914 --> 00:02:55.910
I was very badly positioned

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.542
and my leg was being crushed by the table aside.

00:02:59.542 --> 00:03:01.540
It was hurting so much!

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.540
It makes me laugh to think of that

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.828
Ounce I have applied two layers of varnish

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.942
I choose an OPI varnish and I will do a diagonal French manicure

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.257
I thought that I would be more visible but it does not really matter.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.085
Here's the diagonal French manicure

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:26.685
And now, with my white liner brush

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.542
- The liners are very practical to design on toenails -

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.857
So I mark out the French manicure

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.828
With a thick line at the beginning and thin at the end

00:03:38.742 --> 00:03:41.542
I correct the lines, and I make them slightly thicker

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.828
So that they may be visible from a distance

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.600
So that it can look great

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.514
Then I add a stroke of glittery liner in the middle

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:54.510
It's a silver liner.

00:03:57.314 --> 00:04:00.085
And now, I will show you how to apply dried flowers

00:04:00.085 --> 00:04:02.080
I have never done it before.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.514
I just received those little flowers. They are very cute.

00:04:06.514 --> 00:04:08.510
See how I proceed to stick them on my nail.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.828
First apply some topcoat.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.057
Then apply the dried flower.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.828
You can find them on many nail art websites.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.485
There are loads of them.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.142
It's a real flowers. It is pretty and thin.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.342
I squeeze it so that it sticks well to my top coat and to prevent it from flying off.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.257
Cut the edge or file it.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.200
I don't file it because I'm scared to tear it off.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.200
It's better to cut it with a pair of scissors

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.800
And now I protect with my final top coat

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.571
Here is it! The flowered nail art is done.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.571
Do not bother about doing complicated things on your feet.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.342
I hope that you liked those two tutorials

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.971
See you next week for the next video.
