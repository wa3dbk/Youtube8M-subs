00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.110
There you go buddy I conjured this up for
christmas

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.940
Oh why thank you
So, what's in the picture?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.079
Stick around until the end and all will be
revealed, as they say

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.869
In the meantime, here's our take on making
a basic picture frame

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.420
We'll kick off the build by firstly putting
the stock through the jointer

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.769
In this case we're using bloodwood
That's the edge done now for the face

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:45.420
Hone it to a uniform thickness
In this first of two sandings we'll use the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:58.390
120 grit and then the 240
Raising the grain

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:09.659
And a final sand with 400 grit
Moving on to the router we'll firstly rout

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:25.479
the frame's inner profile
Looking good

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:47.899
Now for the rabbet

00:01:47.899 --> 00:03:21.340
Next up the slots for the biscuits
Now back over to the router to complete the

00:03:21.340 --> 00:04:01.660
outer profile
Mix up the shellac

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:34.380
And once that's dry we'll rub it back lightly
with an 800 grit

00:04:34.380 --> 00:05:16.750
After a very light sand followed by residue
removal we'll apply a final coat of shellac

00:05:16.750 --> 00:06:13.230
With the hanger done that just leaves the
tabs

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:26.900
And finally the backing board and glass

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.960
There you go buddy I conjured this up for
christmas

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.810
Oh why thank you
