What's up guys! You're watching Lavendaire 

00:00:02.848 --> 00:00:08.048
Today I want to share a simple idea that can make your world a lot more beautiful

00:00:08.056 --> 00:00:11.896
I've been reading A Return to Love by Marianne Williamson

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:16.035
and this book has just been so healing and inspiring. 

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:21.618
I picked it up because I had this gut intuition that I needed it at the moment

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.400
Throughout January, I had been so scatterbrained and 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.075
a little bit too focused on chasing my goals and ambitions

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:31.713
I felt like a piece of the puzzle was missing

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.880
And this book literally brought me back to love

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.420
And reminded me how important it is to put love first because love should always be our first priority 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.920
over everything that we want to do in life

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.893
So here's the idea that can make your world more beautiful, and it's really simple

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:00.380
We already are a living expressions of love; we just don’t always choose to express the love that we have within us 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.300
We usually hide it or hold it back because we just want to protect ourselves

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.220
but what we want to do is to choose love over fear

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:19.920
and tap into that power within ourselves to bring love into the world through our actions, words, through us

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.000
When you put love first, you’re choosing to see the world through the eyes of love, 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.053
which immediately makes your world more beautiful.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.180
You see the good, the positivity and the hope that is all around

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.040
rather than focusing on the fear and negativity

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:53.920
You see the good in people and how perfect they already are, rather than focusing on their human flaws.

00:01:53.955 --> 00:02:00.915
There's just a lot of beautiful things that happen once you start to see the world through the eyes of love

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.060
and choose love over fear

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:08.214
As you choose to see the love in the world, you start to find it everywhere

00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:12.877
and notice the little miracles that are happening everywhere, every day.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:21.480
As I’m shifting my perception back to love, I’ve noticed so many little examples of love in places that I normally would take for granted

00:02:21.744 --> 00:02:27.184
moments like a really great conversation at dinner, or laughing with my cousins, 

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:31.784
or something nice that a person did for me that shows that they care

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.900
Simple things, little things. There's literally love everywhere if you choose to see it.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:47.120
Also, when you express love in all that you think, say and do, you are contributing to the world in the best way.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.260
Love can be expressed in so many forms

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.240
it’s compassion, kindness, helping, supporting or  uplifting others, it's being genuine and authentic,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.540
giving, serving; it's being confident in yourself and loving yourself; and just doing things that you love

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.240
doing things that make you happy like singing, dancing, playing sports, anything...

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.880
When you think, speak, and act out of love, you are affecting the people and environment around you in a positive way, 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.160
making the world around you more beautiful.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.760
The world genuinely needs more love - and I know we all have a lot to give.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.220
So be a living expression o f love, and you will make your world and the world around you a much more beautiful place.

00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:41.660
Alright that's it for today, thank you so much for watching

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.900
Before I go, I want to share this Kickstarter by my friend Life By Jazz

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.540
She's making this mantra candle that is super awesome

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.480
It's a candle with a powerful mantra on the outside for you to meditate to

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:04.320
As it burns, you will find another surprise mantra on the inside that you can then give to somebody else or share with the world

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:13.880
Jazz is an example of a living expression of love. She’s always creating new ideas that add value to people’s lives.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:17.894
Check out her Kickstarter - I'll post the link below

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:25.260
I will see you guys in my next video. Have a beautiful day! Love you all. Bye!
