known as the october surprise

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:20.189

embassy in the heart of tehran was a

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.960

manager cut a deal with the ayatollah as

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:54.680
the president of iran is now speaking
out loud

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.810
to hold those hostages for those four
and forty four days even though and

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.229
maybe six percent of people who wanted a
white that way

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:07.150
which is why he's saying the movie argos
highly inactive

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.650
cut a deal with the ayatollah tahoma
hostages until reagan was released in

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.150
exchange for weapon and change came
because they had a military that was

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:16.479
all-american

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:17.449
hardware

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.719

know about uh... in a proportion the

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:33.879
supreme court since eisenhower there has
not been a legitimate republican present
