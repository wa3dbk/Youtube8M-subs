00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.210
Hi I'm Tricia, an organic gardener. I grow organically for a healthy and safe

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.280
food supply,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.849
for a clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.199
for an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.469
Mulch can be a gardeners best friend.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.730
As defined by the Colorado State
University, mulch is any material that

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.290
provides protection

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.630
or improves the soil when applied to the
soil surface.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.279
Mulches serve some important purposes in
the garden.

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.139
They regulate soil temperature,

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:31.560
suppress weeds,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.780
improve soil structure, reduce surface
evaporation,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.840
protects shallow rooted plants from frost heave and improves water penetration and air movement.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.400
Compost is probably one of the most familiar mulching materials

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.190
and a lot of gardeners will put about an inch of
compost on top of the soil and then they'll add

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.180
other types of mulching materials as
well.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.130
Compost can be used alone as a mulch but
there's a whole world of other mulching

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.640
materials available.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.730
There are two types of mulches available:

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.839
organic, which is plant matter

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.410
and inorganic: such as plastics.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.620
Today we are going to be focusing on mulching in the vegetable garden.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.620
Inorganic mulches like plastic films
come in a variety of colors

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.080
and that's not for aesthetics.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.810
Plants have favorite mulch colors

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.850
tomatoes, eggplants and strawberries
like red,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.660
peppers favor reflective mulches.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.960
Potatoes like the black mulching film.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.240
Plastic mulches

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.370
should be laid down on top of any
irrigation lines

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.430
and normally will need to be replaced every
season.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.200
The other category of mulches are
organic mulches.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.380
These are materials that decompose

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.260
like straw, paper, bark, wood chips, grass
clippings, finished compost and more.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.270
In addition to water conservation, soil temperature
regulation and weed

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.380
suppression

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.390
organic marches can actually help the soil

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.470
when they decompose and make organic
matter

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.030
as well as help prevent erosion.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.870
One of the misconceptions about organic
mulches is that more is better and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.280
that's not the case

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.240
you want to apply the organic mulches at the recommended depths and then

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.749
reapply as it decomposes.

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.659
Organic mulches should be laid down two to
three inches thick for fine materials

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.699
like compost or straw

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.400
and three to four inches deep for course
materials like bark or wood chips.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.389
leave one to two inches of clear space 
around stems and as much as six inches

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.519
of space from tree trunks.

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.600
this is because the moisture that the
marches hold

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.189
can cause rot around the stems and trunks.

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.950
Grass clippings can be a great mulching material

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.269
but make sure and put them down when
they're dry or they could prevent

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.650
water penetration also don't use any
grass clippings that been treated with an

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.859
herbicide.

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.799
High carbon mulches like bark, wood chips and
straw

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.329
work very well,

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.699
however,

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.230
as they decompose

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.349
they can pull nitrogen from the soil and
that can compete

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.329
for the plant's nutrients.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.209
When you add a high carbon mulch during
the growing season

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.369
sprinkle a high nitrogen fertilizer
such as this Compost Maker from

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.449
E.B. Stone on top of the mulch

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.019
to provide a nitrogen source for
decomposition.

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.609
Mulching is good so mulch like you mean it and grow organic for life.
