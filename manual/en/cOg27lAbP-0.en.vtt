00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.790
Flyfishing and bluegills: They’ll bring
out the kid in you. And Kansas has its share

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.620
of big sunfish in waters ranging from streams
to ponds to lakes across the state. Bluegills

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.490
and their cousins, redears, green sunfish,
and sunfish hybrids, spawn in spring when

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.370
water temperatures reach about 75 degrees.
And if conditions are right, they’ll spawn

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:31.840
intermittently through summer, providing fast
fishing action and tasty eating.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.480
Spawning sunfish are easy to find in shallow
water, and male fish aggressively guard the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.030
hatching fry in 12-inch nests cleared of vegetation.
In clear water, these are easy to see. Pull

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.690
a fly near a nest, and the fish will grab
it and haul it away. That often results in

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.239
a caught fish. Sunfish will take on all comers
– marauding bass, and even an underwater

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.010
camera placed close to its nursery. Since
sunfish are among nature’s most prolific

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.650
parents, catching spawning fish can actually
be good to prevent overpopulation and stunting.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.460
Scott Waters, KDWP Fisheries Biologist, and
his friend Cleo Hahn, enjoy catching big sunfish

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.659
in northcentral Kansas from float tubes. Using
lightweight flyrods and small, size 10 flies

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.070
like McGintys, wooley buggers, and beadhead
nymphs, they search for feeding or spawning

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.979
fish in weedbeds and rocky areas under shade.
Last week, they hit Jewell State Fishing Lake

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.979
near Mankato in Jewell County several times,
catching numbers of sunfish up to nine inches

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.600
long – bigger than average for Kansas Public
Lands waters.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.630
And the fishing was pure fun. There was plenty
of room on this 57-acre lake, and they weren’t

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.381
the only ones trying this summer pattern.
Several other fly-anglers with tubes were

00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:07.181
also getting in on the action. Like many Kansas
public waters, there’s no limit on sunfish

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:13.530
at Jewell, and bluegills and redears are among
the tastiest gamefish. But on this particular

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.440
evening, all were catch-and-release fishing,
turning them back for other anglers to catch

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.920
again.
If you want a unique and relaxing new fishing

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.730
experience, try float-tubing for Kansas sunfish.
Ultralight spinning gear using jigs or small

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.700
spinners, or flyrods using wet flies are great
ways to catch these hardy fighters. Sunfish

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.170
are waiting in Kansas water near you. Fish
Kansas!
