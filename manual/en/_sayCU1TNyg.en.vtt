00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.440
Welcome to the Science Asylum. I am Nick Lucid.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.160
In the centrifugal force video,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.460
we got to see how weird things look and feel when you're rotating, but the weirdness doesn't stop there.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.160
Centrifugal force is not the only force that seems to appear when you're rotating.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.900
There's this other one. You may have heard of it's called the Coriolis force or sometimes the Coriolis effect

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.840
That's the thing that tells you which way your toilet flushes, right?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.480
No toilets are way too small for that. Milton roll the footage!

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.140
[Alien Noises]

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.340
I don't care if you're in the middle of something. Roll it!

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.520
These are two toilets in Michigan flushing in opposite directions.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.840
Myth Busted!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.040
Now, it is true that the rotation of the Earth causes a Coriolis effect.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.460
It's just not strong enough to affect something as small as a toilet which are influenced far more by

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.300
imperfections in the toilet bowl, how level the floor is, and how the water is released from the toilet tank?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.800
Yes

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.480
Those are monkeys on my shower curtain. Got a problem with that?

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.380
However, if we're dealing with something

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.840
really big with motion that spans over at least today. Then we'd have to worry about it.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.300
In the Detroit science center,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.240
they have something called a Foucault pendulum this pendulum is so big that it hangs from the top floor down to the basement floor

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.920
Since it's so big and heavy,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.960
it's basically unaffected by all those small scale influences like the air or friction

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.060
Standing on the Earth it appears that the direction of the swing

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.320
changes throughout the day

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.520
and how much time the cycle takes depends on your latitude here at 42 degrees North it takes about?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.560
36 hours to go all the way around

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.760
Sometimes science centers will put clocks underneath them.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.980
Google even had one in the Google doodle on September 18, 2013.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.620
If you're able to step off the Earth though, you'll just see the rotation of the Earth exerting a torque on the pendulum.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.540
Bigger!

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.320
Oh yeah? Hurricanes!

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.700
Hurricanes, also called tropical cyclones, are so big you can see them from space.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.060
In the northern hemisphere, they always rotate counterclockwise.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.660
In the southern hemisphere, they always rotate clockwise.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.500
In fact, it's such a major part of how hurricanes work, they can't even cross the equator.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.500
This graphic from NASA shows the paths taken by all the hurricanes from 1985 to 2005.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.840
Notice the gap at the equator? If you zoom in you can actually see some of them approach the equator

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.120
and veer off along it like it's a wall.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.940
We can also make the Coriolis force more significant by returning to our friend: the merry-go-round.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.660
Since it rotates faster than once a day we should notice the weirdness. let's say

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.540
Let's say I'm on the merry-go-round and I decide to throw a ball.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.400
If you're watching from the ground, then the ball appears to basically travel straight once released

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.940
It's only being pulled to the ground by gravity,

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.440
which is exactly what you'd expect for something without any other forces on it.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.040
But that's not what I see. To anyone on the merry-go-round things look really weird

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.760
See the ball veer off to one side. It looks like there's some other weird force on it

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.180
That force is the Coriolis force and it's fictitious

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.940
It's an illusion.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.640
The Coriolis force is determined by the mass of the ball, the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.280
rotational speed of the merry-go-round, and the motion of the ball in other words it only acts on moving

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.360
objects and only when you're taking measurements from the rotating perspective.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.060
These things are the coolest! So much science!

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.960
So why don't we just always look from the outside and forget this whole Coriolis thing?

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.300
That's a good idea and in the centrifugal force video, I did say if at all possible

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.300
you should try to work from a perspective with no acceleration at all.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.019
Unfortunately, sometimes that's really

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.569
inconvenient or nearly impossible. When you're trying to be practical though, sometimes

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.480
it's easier just to pretend like it's there and get through the work.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.280
Just don't ever forget you're pretending !

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.980
So, which way does your toilet flush?

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.020
Let us know in the comments along with where you live.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.740
Whoa, whoa, nothing specific?

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.000
Just like northern or southern hemisphere and until next time remember. It's okay to be a little crazy

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.740
you
