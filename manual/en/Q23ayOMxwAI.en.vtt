(soft music)

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.750
- Hi, I'm Andrea Butje
from Aromahead Institute

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.040
and I want to show you how to make

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.280
my favorite sinus headache oil.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.820
It's really effective if
you have that kind of pain

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.900
that's right here from a sinus infection

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.420
or congestion or even just from

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.810
allergies that are causing a headache.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.150
This is a great one.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.110
It's got a base of trauma oil.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.460
And trauma oil is a urbanely infused oil

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.930
that's made with arnica flowers and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.460
Saint John's Ward flowers
and calendula flowers.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.370
And it's a great one for reducing

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.080
pain and also inflammation.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.200
So I have a nice blue glass bottle

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.330
and it's thirty mLs or one ounce

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.540
and I'm just gonna pour this trauma oil

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.260
right into the glass bottle

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.710
and I'm gonna fill it most of the way,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.750
leaving just a little bit
of room for essential oils.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.180
There we go.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.500
Good.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.050
And in this blend I'm
gonna use eucalyptus,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.620
eucalyptus globulus, and I'm gonna

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.000
use roman chamomile and frankincense.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.570
And we have eight drops of
eucalyptus in this blend,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.820
and probably you're
familiar with eucalyptus,

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.860
it just opens up your sinuses

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.450
and it's incredibly
effective at reducing pain.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
And so I'm gonna put eight
drops right into the trauma oil.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.320
There we go, they come
out fast those drops.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.130
And then I'm gonna put six
drops of the roman chamomile.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.100
And Roman camomile's great for pain.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.970
I love using it in blends,

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.370
good six,

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.630
When I'm trying to calm down and reduce

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.430
any sort of inflammation and also stress.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.890
And we all know how stressful
it is to have a headache.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.180
And then I'm going to use
four drops of frankincense.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.650
And this frankincense is beautiful.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.360
It's from a distiller in Vermont

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.780
and this distilleries called Boswellness.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.299
And they import their
resins from Somaliland

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.050
and distill the oil right in Vermont,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.350
and it is beautiful and a
great one for headaches.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.460
It's actually one of my
favorite oils for a headache.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.400
Four drops there.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.910
Okay so, we have this beautiful

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.610
blend that smells incredible.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.270
What I'm gonna do with this blend

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.590
is give it a little shake and then

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.670
I'm just gonna put it
on the back of my neck.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.960
That is the ideal place for it to go

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.760
because the eucalyptus is so strong

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.160
that if you actually put it on your face,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.240
it can really irritate your eyes,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.900
so if you put it on the back of your neck

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.270
it's perfect for relieving a headache.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.640
And then I just want to
put a little label on it

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.740
so I know what it is I've made.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.830
So I have this roll of
these purple labels.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.160
They really don't say anything on it,

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.220
just my Aromahead website.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.040
So I just write on it with
a Sharpie pen, magic marker,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.190
and put it right on the blend.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.740
So I just put the label on.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.510
And then I have the laminate labels

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.100
and they're clear and they go on top.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.400
So this way you won't spear the writing

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.700
on the label if the oil drips on it.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.840
So I just put it right
over it just like that,

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.650
and now it's protected and I know

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.380
what I have in my bottle which is great.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.280
Hope you enjoy it.
