Hi today I would like to talk with you about the new MultiButton Component. The MultiButton doesn't do anything special that you can't do in any other way, it just makes building such user interfaces really simple.

00:00:18.007 --> 00:00:31.668
Lets start by creating a form and dragging in a multi button. We will set the layout to Box Y layout so the UI will look more familar and drag in some more multi-buttons.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:45.412
A multi button has several neat features, we can have up to 4 lines of text an icon and an emblem.

We can also layout the first two lines of the button horizontally to support some user interface designs. In that case we can also reverse the first and second line.

A multi button can act as a CheckBox or a Radio button allowing users to select an entry

And it works as you would expect across all themes!
