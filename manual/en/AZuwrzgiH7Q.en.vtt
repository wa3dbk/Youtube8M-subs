00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.630
Speaking as someone who's been through clearing
himself, I can tell you the best thing to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.690
do is to remain calm.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.680
Not make snap decisions, to not commit yourself
to a three or four year degree course you

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.449
don't want to be on.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.880
If they can at all possibly going and speak
to a careers advisers, that would be a much

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.610
advised route.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.830
You still should be looking for that balance
of the course and the subject area that's

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.700
going to stimulate, and motivate you as well
as the university, and the environment with

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.230
what you think you can thrive and succeed
in.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.090
So this is why the research is really important
all the way through the process.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.110
The biggest point there is to try and make
sure you have done some preparation.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.711
Take down some of those universities and courses
and some contact details for them so you have

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:06.660
a plan, and also then find out more information
that the university itself.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.480
If it's not a university that you previously
considered in your research phase, or you

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.720
haven't been previously had the chance to
visit then I would certainly look to visit

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.100
that university or find out more information
from the people that had studied there.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.450
So if you do that, you're going to have a
good grounding within which to make a good

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.020
decision in the future.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.420
When we look at applicants in clearing, there's
no big difference as to what we are looking

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.700
for as opposed to what we would be looking
for earlier on in the cycle which is always

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.220
somebody's capability and motivation to study
the course in particular.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.880
And then also some indication that they have
truly understood about us as an institution.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.840
It's really the students that are able to
articulate their love of the subject and that

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.789
understanding of commitment, that will stand
out the most.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:04.459
Thousands of students go into university through
clearing every single year.

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:09.220
It's a tried and tested process and there's
always lots and lots of courses available

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.240
for students, which means you are going to
have lots of options even if you've not done

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.242
so well.
