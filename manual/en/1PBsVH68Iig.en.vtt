00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.460
from harvard students are now being
forced to would temperament temporarily

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.189
withdraw from school because of a
cheating scandal add now you might have

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.230
heard about this when you take place on
the laszlo veres us to do the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.299
investigation relatively recently that
men divesting s and all the final exam

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.360
in a class on congress and because of
the amount of she then went on

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.090
through a lot of high-profile criticism
from around the nation and from that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.960
several on this

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.069
as according to the initial reports as
many as one here in twenty-five students

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.389
who participated in the cheating and now
abouts approx elise sixty

00:00:33.389 --> 00:00:35.989
are going to be forced to withdraw
because it's been proven that they were

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:36.819
cheating now

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.700
in case you were following up on this
story from last year

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.640
there

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.170
detected problems come because it did
test was a take-home test

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.540
had worry

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.740
it's not ok to contact yeah let me just
give you a summer night in your

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.470
university professor expecting and
there's a take-home test yeah and i mean

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.100
i can balance heating i just think if
you're going to anything online

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.700
or anything at home scenes are either
going to see other inserted is it really

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.030
what happened in this case when you look
out the answers online area but that's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.510
just the way guys people see mission
necessary thing at the cheating but you

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.840
should hold that at harvard they would
at least hide the fact that they're

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.740
sharing answers will be better

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.080
having to be smarter and they're
cheating you have any cleaning done some

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.670
videos attempts and they have a few
lakes and cheating tab-stops

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.450
just getting we don't condone cheating
but

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.250
this s_l_ that although cheating it
doesn't take place even at marion

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.090
quote-unquote prestige s

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.400
universities

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.440
uh... you can still get high and it is a
hot some pretty serious conflict when

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.220
says anna no doubt that's going on your
hot university record and so if you plan

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.770
on getting a job after harvard which i'm
sure is probably why you into harvard

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.090
good luck with that because if you're
gonna have a much harder time now that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.100
you know you're gonna there is no what's
this wasn't gap from a few one eleven

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.560
ten a four-part you so much for years
she had only

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.830
yeah so uh... you better watch out

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
and i'd i don't know exactly how they
made a meanie summer seems unlikely

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.199
deals there something and they don't get
on the record but

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:04.790
if it is and you were going to harvard
like first of all

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.779
that's you possibly losing financial aid
by having to take that forced down

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.969
that's a lot of money there you're
wasting a lot of time

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:15.129
uh... i'd like that they're taking it
seriously but

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.179
this is not to be pretty noteworthy
historically sixty students from an ivy

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.269
league university forces withdraw

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.580
because it shooting in look body ta dat
focal science classes the seriously

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.479
insured up to the congress

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.669
yeah you should not have to change one
incident in the congress if you're in

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:31.699
harbor

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:35.719
uh... how we will see from exam

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.309
but yes there is little eight

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:42.669
i'd understand that she needed special
take-home test that will happen

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:46.310
but this is a challenge and continue to
be a little bit smarter about a change

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.029
in the but i think perhaps that's where
we were sitting occurs is because when

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:53.269
you're in the headquarters one classes
that they don't really care about here

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.599
is not really pursuing seriously if they
had zachary but i do think it's a good

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.260
harvard

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.830
is going after this because sometimes
only see especially with a bit uh...

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.989
universities and just groups internal it
had very high reputations

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.800
isn't something like this that's has is
really bad for them they happened they

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.829
just kind of trying to sleep in and
around a bit like that happen

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.059
so i'm sure a net uh...

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.519
probably some of the some of this city
year action is in part to kind of

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.650
company reputations and no no we don't
heights i think that's abut regardless

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.999
but that they're going after south lake
this any even more bad news for

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:28.180
stereotyping a lot of athletes were in
snared in this

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.640
supposedly at least two basketball team
co captain inside this will have a

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.730
scratch from your team roster and the
harvard crimson has also linked football

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.040
baseball and hockey players indictments
are not great for the sports stereotype

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.279
uh...

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:44.169
p_p_ rise on your own pay-per-view bomb

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.459
i'd like to bath which were actually

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.819
doing the tests and sharing your own
answers of the as opposed to having one

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.919
of their schools sponsored tutors
incentive for them

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.429
so this is actually an improvement it
does get better domain on all athletes

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:58.529
men just

00:03:58.529 --> 00:03:59.179
will succeed
