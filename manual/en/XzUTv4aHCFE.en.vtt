00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.159
WOOSH what's up Daily crew alright it's
Thursday

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.940
and I am going to delve into the origins of the
words of A word

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.639
and today the word is swag it is a corruption of the Scandinavian 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.379
word Svagga meaning to rock unsteadily

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.439
or to lurch it then entered into the English
language around the 13th or 14th century

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.830
the earliest we have seen in in print is 1303

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.050
over a time it evolved into hanging

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.590
loosely or to Sag an then in the 1700s

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.600
a turned into like a booty

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.620
plunder you know stuff that you have stolen

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.510
you get all booty it's all your swag which
is actually how I know the word

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510
you know you go to an event and they have swag bags

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.039
all this stuff only you're not stealing it they're
giving it to you that's the  difference

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.230
in Australia the word swag man refers to 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.559
someone who carries around a bundle of
things

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.820
in america we call that a hobo
also in Australia to go the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.350
swag means to become a tramp no judgments

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.180
go on a swag but the term swagger is
something that

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.400
is of course steeped in hip-hop it was
currently popularized by Jay Z in a song

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.689
called all I need

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.950
and since then it's just pretty much been used by
rappers talk bout

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.470
and brag about all the cool things that
they have or do

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.850
there's a rumor that I heard that swag
actually stands

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.720
or secretly we are gay it's an acronym
that was used

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.909
in the nineteen sixties to let other

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.540
men know that you were gay. I've actually
seen no evidence

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.049
to support this but if you want to
believe it go right ahead

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.560
in today's usage swag means that you
have style

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.619
and that you are confident and I'm confident

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.060
in the fact that you used the phrase I
have swag

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.630
any other way than ironically you're
dead to me

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.210
now listen to me dead one time I did
Justin Bieber cover

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.710
I used the word Swaggy and a little bit of
my soul died that day

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.960
anyway tell me in the comments down
below if someone walked up to you said I have

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.679
