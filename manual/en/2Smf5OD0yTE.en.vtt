00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:04.400
David: Hi I'm David Reutens. I'm the director
of the Centre for Advanced Imaging.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.009
I'm also a neurologist and I'd like you to meet
a patient Brian who will tell you about his

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:16.000
medical history and the role that imaging
played throughout its course.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
David: So Brian, can you tell us how old you are?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Brian: I'm 29.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
David: And are you working?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.230
Brian: I used to work up until the accident a year ago.
 But then, they couldn't hold my job and I've been

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.280
searching for work ever since.
David: What happened a year ago?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.660
Brian: Basically I was driving home from work,
I'd had a pretty long day. Probably didn't

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.329
help I was out drinking the night before.
But on the way home I started to get a funny

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.380
feeling in my stomach, and I don't remember
anything actually after that.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.090
David: Did anyone see what happened?
Brian: Yeah, yeah. They said that the ambulance

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.430
had talked to the guy behind me. And that
he said I had just run through a red light

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.820
and got t-boned at the intersection. I wasn't
speeding or anything, sure only going about 60, but.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.560
David: Were you wearing a seat belt?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.080
Brian: Yeah, always do, yeah.
David: So what happened to the other driver?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.390
Brian: They said a few cuts and bruises. My car
was written off.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.930
David: And then they took you to hospital?
Brian: Yep.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.920
David: So what do you remember about your
time in hospital?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.840
Brian: Not much really, I mean was feeling pretty
sick the whole time, so. I do remember I spent

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.840
10 days in ICU and then another month in rehab.
I don't remember much of ICU, 'cause you

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.670
know I was strapped to a ventilator the whole
time. But I do have a scar on my right arm

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.200
and on my stomach where they took out my spleen.
David: Gee, it sounds like you had a really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.299
rough time in ICU and after the accident.
But your back on your feet now?

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.470
Brian: Yeah, yeah, I mean it was pretty hard
slog at rehab, but. Now I've got this new

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.689
problem.
David: Tell me about the new problem.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:10.920
Brian: About 3 weeks ago, I just had that
same funny feeling and the same thing happen

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.640
again.
David: What were you doing at the time?

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.760
Brian: My girlfriend and I, Jackie, we'd
just been out to dinner and I was about to

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.760
propose, and I had the ring everything, and
then basically I started to get that funny

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.560
feeling again in my stomach out of the blue.
David: You weren't just nervous were you,

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.300
being about to propose and stuff?
Brian: No, that's what I thought it was.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:41.040
I mean I had that same butterflies, that same...you
know the rush you get when you're nervous, but.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.640
David: Well, what happened after that?

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.830
Brian: Well, that feeling started to go from
my stomach into my chest and into my head.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.220
I got metallic taste in my mouth and then the
next thing I remember I was in the hospital.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.220
David: Did your girlfriend see what happened?
Brian: She said that my face went really blank

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.260
and then I started to make "nnnggghh"
noises and chewing. And then I started to

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.360
grab my clothes with my hands.
David: Both your hands?

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.950
Brian: Just the right hand I think it was.
Yeah, kind of like this...if I remember.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.750
David: And, what did your girlfriend do?
Brian: I don't think she knew what to do

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:30.750
to be honest. Yeah it was pretty new for her.
So she basically tried to get me back onto

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.040
the chair, but I wasn't cooperating at all.
And so then I fell off my chair and started

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.010
jerking.
David: And did she say that went on for long?

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.819
Brian: All I remember was waking up a awhile
later with a splitting headache, and I think

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.050
I bit my tongue, and I had wet myself.
David: And what happened next?

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:57.840
Brian: Jackie, she called the ambulance and
they took me straight to Emergency. They ran

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:04.319
a few blood tests and then they sent me to
you. I think they gave me an EEG.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.769
David: Have you had any other spells like
before or since?

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.360
Brian: Not that I could remember, I mean I've
had that feeling a few times since but none

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.419
of those spells again.
David: OK well let's see if we can figure

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.369
out what's going on.

00:04:20.369 --> 00:04:20.619
