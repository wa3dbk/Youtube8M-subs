Hi!! Today we're making Lembas Bread

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.120
Since the last film of The Hobbit is on cinemas, I wanted to end this long journey with this amazing recipe.

00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:30.488
First add 3 eggs to a jar

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.410
chopped almonds

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.480
Orange zest

00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:49.091
and honey :)

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.620
You can substitute with some sugar

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.820
but i recomend you to use honey because it's a natural preservative

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.720
(you want your bread to last long for your journeys ;)

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:12.768
add a few drops of orange blossom water

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.160
add orange juice or vanilla extract if you dont have orange blossom water

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.865
MIX!

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:39.505
Put all the mixture in a bigger bowl

00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:05.667
Add the flour and a pinch of salt and mix again

00:02:06.904 --> 00:02:10.424
you can mix the dough with your hands

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.620
Sprinkle some flour

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.860
it's a bit sticky so be careful

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.980
cover with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge 10-15 min

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.580
Stretch the dough

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:35.414
dont make it too thin

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:39.114
and cut in square pieces

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.020
I did a paper pattern of 7x7 centimeters

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.580
use a square cookie cutter if you have

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.460
place the pattern in the dough and cut

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.120
take off the excess flour

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.859
place the bread on a baking tray

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.690
i made the cross with a knife 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.920
Bake at 175ÂºC for 20-25 min.

00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:26.111
now it's ready it's time for wrapping!

00:05:31.924 --> 00:05:37.164
take the leaf and place the bread in the middle

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.500
and wrap it 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.680
Cut some lace, cord, etc...

00:06:14.026 --> 00:06:18.286
and tie your leambas bread

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.940
And it's done! :)

00:06:32.447 --> 00:06:35.787
Hope you enjoyed the video

00:06:37.032 --> 00:06:39.032
