00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.740
Hello everyone, today MamaCheung would like to show you how to make &lt;Pan Fried Meat Bun&gt;

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.140
Let's have a look at the ingredients

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.960
400g of plain flour, 2 teaspoon of fast acting dried yeast

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.040
black sesame seeds, 2 tablespoon of sugar, 1.5 bowl of water

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:42.320
Chicken strips which have been marinated with soy sauce, corn flour, sugar, ginger, ground pepper and sesame oil

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.680
Marinated for 15 minutes

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.360
3 Shitake mushrooms, sliced

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.260
Pickled vegetables

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.640
Fry the pickled vegetables and mushrooms for 10 minutes

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.020
300 g of cabbage, sliced.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.200
We need to use salt to prepare the cabbage which I will show you later

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.120
Now we prepare the dough. Put 2 teaspoon of yeast into a pan of plain flour

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360
2 tablespoon of sugar

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.420
Add half a bowl of water into the pan, mix it with the flour

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:35.980
Normally when we knead the dough, we need to check the consistency of the dough, so if we feel that the dough is too crumbly, add some more water

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.140
Knead the dough well, push the dough out and knead it back

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.440
We just used 1.5 bowl of water altogether

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.300
OK, now the dough is ready

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:02.220
We need to place the dough in a pot, and put the lid on, and rest the dough for 30 minutes before use

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.740
We put 1 teaspoon of salt into the sliced cabbage

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.240
This is to extract the water from the cabbage

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.660
The salt has soften the cabbage

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.680
Squeeze out the juice from the cabbage

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.780
Otherwise the filling will be too soggy

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:39.240
Mix in the sliced mushrooms and pickled vegetables with the chicken and cabbage

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.300
The dough has risen, and it is ready to make the buns

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.660
Place the dough on the worktop

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.560
Prepare the dough for slicing into portions

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
Do not knead the dough, otherwise it will flatten again

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.700
We divide the dough into small portions

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:30.560
Make sure they are similar in sizes, so they cook evenly in the wok later

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.100
About 40 gram of dough per portion

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.300
Roll the dough flat, the rim should be thinner

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.460
Add the filling

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.860
Use your thumb to push the filling in, and try to close the bun

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:14.380
Pull the wrapper out slowly and carefully and fold it and try to bury the filling

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.660
Try to seal it well by turning and squeezing the dough together, to prevent the filling coming out

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.340
Now the buns are wrapped nicely, we have to cook them in a wok

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.720
Heat up the pan, place 1 tablespoon of oil

00:04:36.528 --> 00:04:38.528
Place the buns in the pan evenly

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.980
leave some space between the buns in case they get stuck together

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:57.460
Mix 1 tablespoon of plain flour, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoon of vinegar into a bowl of water

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.320
Then pour the mixture into the pan

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.100
The fluid should half cover the buns, so add an extra 1/2 bowl of water

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.040
Place the lid on, use medium heat to cook the buns until all the water has evaporated

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.220
This takes about 5 to 6 minutes

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:27.220
Now this is ready, we sprinkle some back sesame seeds onto the buns

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.240
We also add some chopped spring onion

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.640
Use a large plate and place it over the buns, and flip the pan over

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.640
Look the crust is beautiful

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.560
Pan fried meat buns are ready to serve

00:05:50.694 --> 00:05:52.694
Let's give it a try

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.500
Very delicious, please try this at home
