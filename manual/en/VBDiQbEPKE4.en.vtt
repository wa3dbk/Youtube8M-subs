00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.190
So if you come in and we determine you
are candidate for Invisalign, what we do

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.960
is have to take special impressions of your teeth.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.740
We mail those impressions to Invisalign, and based on

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.330
the treatment plan that I came up with
from you from our clinical exam,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.609
and from the photos and X-rays, I will sit
down and type up a detailed

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.840
treatment plan of exactly how I want your teeth to move.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.199
Invisalign will create digital models
and that's what you see here on screen.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.519
Nothing has been done. This is the
initial model the way you came into our office.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.739
And what we do is I will scroll through
this case with a patient. And

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.700
I can rotate this to the side; and you will
notice the bite is off.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.940
I can spin it around to the other side
and look at it this way.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.320
I can also spin it around from the back
and look at the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.350
bite from the back.  I can look at the upper
arch independently

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.570
and you can see how significant the crowding is in the upper arch.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.460
I can do the same by looking at the
lower arch and flipping that down.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.620
These are how your teeth look initially. You'll see the progression of treatment,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.380
as well as the end result; and you can
see the teeth aligning the bite is

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.820
starting to open up, if you just look at
the front. Then in the end, if I pan to the side,

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.810
and I'll show you how her teeth fit
together, and they fit together

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.450
beautifully on the side.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.420
You can look at it from the frontal view. The
midlines are corrected

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.180
and even, as we like to see. The bite
relationship here in the front is perfect.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.780
And if we look at the other side, her bite
relationship is normal and 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.340
corrected as well, so everything fits
well. So what you see a lot of times on

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.119
the computer is not really

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.790
exactly what's taking place inside the
mouth. There is some variation.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.119
The thing I can tell you today about
Invisalign, it is

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.740
much more accurate than what it was back
in 2002

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.439
when I was first trained on it. Typically in an Invisalign case, 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.450
there are attachments that go on the
teeth and what attachments are,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.130
are little tooth colored composite
buttons, I call them, 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.170
or bumps, that we put on the teeth; and
those bumps are determined by movements that

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.160
we need to place in those teeth when we
do the treatment plan.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.819
Not all teeth get them but some do. One thing that's interesting about Invisalign,

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.660
is it works by pushing teeth. So we can't
really pull teeth, 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.030
or move teeth in any other dimension other than by pushing them.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.760
So these attachments that go on the teeth
have flat plains and the aligners push

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.290
against those planes,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.430
and cause the movements that we need in those teeth.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.030
I rarely do attachments on the first aligner. I'll often do them on

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.260
aligner number four. Initially, I want
patients to get used to wearing the

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.319
aligners, taking them in and out,

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.839
get used to the comfort at the aligner, 
and just dealing with it on a daily basis. 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.160
Once the attachments go on on aligner
four, 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.940
oftentimes they're little harder to take
on and off and they fit a little bit snugger. 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.580
Teeth tend to be a little more sore at
that time because teeth are moving a

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.510
little bit more,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.190
and you know just a little more to get
used to, so I don't want to overwhelm

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.870
anybody at the beginning.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.390
I tell all of our patients that many 
cases have to have at least one

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.159
to two refinements, and a refinement is where we kind of  detail and finish the case.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.420
At refinements, we will take all the little
bumps off the teeth, 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.230
take new impressions of the teeth, send it
back in to Invisalign, 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.640
and tell them exactly what we want to
detail in the finish.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.520
Fortunately, I've had some cases that
never need a refinement and they finish beautifully. 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.280
But, especially in severe rotations and other movements that are more difficult, things

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.390
may not be together exactly the way you
want them, 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.000
and those cases would require a refinement.
