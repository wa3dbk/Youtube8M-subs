Hi, I am Karina Fraley for Expert Village
and we have just finished making our baby

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:07.899
blanket and our burping cloths. So I thought
I would just share with you just a few pointers

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.920
on some things that you might want to have
handy if decide to take sewing. This is a

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.500
bobbin; now bobbins come in a varieties of
shapes and sizes. There aren't that many different

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.220
variations but you do want to go ahead and
check which one your sewing machine takes

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.121
before you go down to the store and buy it.
Because if you buy the wrong size you are

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:33.520
not going to be able to use it on your machine
and basically that goes into the bobbin chamber.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.480
Now, this is a thimble which pretty much any
seamstress should have handy. And this is

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.280
a seam ripper; so when you make a mistake
and sew something that you didn't mean to

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.780
sew which will happen many times I am sure.
You are not going to want to rip or use scissors

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.100
to cut your stitches apart because that will
wreak your fabric. So this is very sharp,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.190
you always want to keep it covered when you
are not using it and keep it away from small

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.259
children. But basically what it does is rips
the seam in such a way that you are not going

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:14.740
to ruin the fabric and will show you how.
I am going to go ahead and sew just this little

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:27.380
tiny piece, it is just a regular straight
stitch. So, the proper way to use this is

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:37.859
by gently inserting the edge and pulling on
it so that it breaks the thread and moving

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:44.329
on to the next one. You are going to be tempted
to open your fabric like this, your seam like

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.740
this and try to work through it that way and
it is going to ruin your fabric. So you have

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.840
to be patient and sometimes if you have matched
your thread really, really well it is hard

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:02.899
to see what you are doing. But be patient
and just rip the stitches out one by one and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.420
again don't do this. Don't open it and go
like this and try to rip it apart because

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.170
eventually that will ruin your fabric. Anyway,
that is a seam ripper and it is handy to have

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.650
around and again sharp, so be sure that you
cover it.
