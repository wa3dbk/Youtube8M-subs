00:00:19.772 --> 00:00:22.712
Tears have cried 'till the sun rows again

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:28.286
All of the nights, it felt like the end


00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:32.788
But I'm breathing, I'm here


00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:37.717
So together the peace that we left

00:00:37.872 --> 00:00:43.159
Start all over and burn again

00:00:43.988 --> 00:00:47.623
But I'm breathing, I'm here.

00:00:49.124 --> 00:00:52.445
We can break so easily,

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:56.966
'Cos we are only human beings.

00:00:58.798 --> 00:01:02.084
On the surface, on the surface

00:01:02.304 --> 00:01:03.554
We are,

00:01:03.614 --> 00:01:07.344
Like a start, our hearts fall hard

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:11.993
But, we are proud of all our scars

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:17.306
'Cos it's worth it, it's worth it,

00:01:17.426 --> 00:01:19.945
For love.

00:01:40.618 --> 00:01:44.386
Built these walls as a safe place to hide

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.465
All cracks down from the look from your eyes


00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:53.012
And I'm breathing, the wind.

00:01:55.602 --> 00:01:59.156
Maybe I stand at the edge of the cliff

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:03.818
But that is a prize of this moment of this

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:08.783
As I'm breathing, the wind

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:20.150
(Ooooo)

00:02:39.898 --> 00:02:43.136
We can break so easily,

00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:48.367
'Cos we are only human beings

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:54.000
On the surface, on the surface, we are

00:02:54.596 --> 00:02:58.169
Like a start, our hearts fall hard

00:02:58.198 --> 00:03:03.009
But we are proud of all our scars

00:03:04.102 --> 00:03:07.957
'Cos it's worth it, it's worth it

00:03:07.998 --> 00:03:11.128
For love.
