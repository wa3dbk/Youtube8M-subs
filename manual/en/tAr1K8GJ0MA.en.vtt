00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:23.109
Hey guys. Jeremy here from RCNightmare.com.
Today we’re going to be doing an unboxing

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:32.419
video of the Spektrum DX6i. I just picked
up a new electric plane and of course I had

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.050
to get the necessary equipment to control
the darn thing in the air.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.090
Spektrum is one of the leading radio controls
and radio control units. Obviously Futaba’s

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:52.510
really popular for the planes too. The 6i
is not super high end but it is great for

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.870
what I’m going to need – for park flyers
as they’re called.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:08.550
So, let’s get to the unboxing.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:17.020
Now with the 6i, you’ve got a little bit
different features. You’ve got the newest

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.390
tecs, you’ve got DSM2, and you’ve got
2.4 GHz, but this one’s got a little bit

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.850
different receiver than what you’re normally
going to notice and I’ll show you that when

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.800
I get to that. It’s totally fine for most
planes – this one has a lot of the same

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.930
features as the DX3, so it’s got 10-model
memory, its programmable for airplanes/helicopters,

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.960
it’s got an integrated timer which is important.
It’s got all sorts of other things like

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.350
servo monitors, throttle cuts, trainer mode.
It’s also got – when your battery gets

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.190
low – you’ll be able to tell. It’s going
to react a little bit different so you’ve

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.370
got a warning not that your plane just falls
from the sky. Again, six channels as I said.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:17.500
So looking at the top of the box here – flip
it over – the manuals packed in the top

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:28.170
here. It’s actually quite thick, which I
guess is what I would expect with a controller

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.850
this complex. I will be definitely spending
a lot of time on this. On the simulator in

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.300
the hobby store, I spent a lot of time crashing.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:48.060
So, I talked a little bit about the receiver
too. What you’ve got here is Spektrum’s

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:56.210
micro light receiver. It’s a little bit
smaller than what you’d get if you were

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:01.900
to go a model up, but it’s perfectly fine
for park flying. This is about a $200 retail

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.430
item. If you go to A Main Hobbies or Stormer
Hobbies, you could probably get it for $170’s

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.480
 – I’m guessing.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.440
The other things you get with this are all
your little servos. This isn’t something

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.100
I’m used to getting with my receivers but
you actually get a bunch of servos – looks

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.620
like four in total – and all the servo arms
and everything that you need to get your plane

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:48.790
ready to go – it comes with four. Then all
the screws that are required, little charging

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.819
unit.

00:03:52.819 --> 00:04:05.349
Then you get to this bohemeth radio. So as
far as radios for planes or helicopters go,

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.160
really there’s a huge range in pricing.
You can go all the way from $100 or $79 maybe

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.510
for the most simple up to I’ve seen some
Futaba’s over two grand.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.889
So do your research, know what you want to
do with it and if you’re just a park flyer

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.050
like me, something like the DX6i is going
to be perfectly fine for you. Really light

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.590
in my hand – it actually fits your hand
really nice. You’ve got your – on the

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.801
actual unit itself – you’ve got your throttle
cut, you’ve got your flap gyros, and all

00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:47.029
your controls on the top here – real nice,
real sturdy. You’ve got your gear and your

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:54.539
rudder and then you’ve got a little switch
on the back here for training mode which is

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.039
real nice. If you’re going to do trainer,
that’s the way to go.

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:04.110
So the other thing is you’ll note, too,
the receiver bends down like this a little

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:11.319
bit which makes moving it around or packing
it a lot easier. Other features – again,

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.699
it runs on 6 channels, you can program up
to 10 models. So with 6 channels you can pretty

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:23.099
much fly most anything you would consider
a park flyer or a helicopter – should give

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.740
you all the control you need for that kind
of stuff.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:34.210
It runs on 4 AA batteries – you can see
there. You want to keep those charged, because

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.870
what good is your cutoff if your receiver
turns off on you. Again it has a low-battery

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.909
indicator and everything like that as well.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:53.300
So that is the DX6i. You know, there are a
lot of different models out there again. Besides

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.630
the included servo – so the DSP75 are the
digital servos that are included – you’ve

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.059
also got the universal connectors, mounting
hardware, and a wide assortment of servo arms

00:06:04.059 --> 00:06:08.460
so you should be able to fit it in to almost
any application. You’ve got a servo monitor;

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.630
you’ve got a roller selector. The roller
selector I didn’t mention is right here

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.759
and you just kind of roll it. It’s real
nice for going through the menus – really

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:22.509
convenient. Same as my DX3R except it’s
on the top and it goes the other way but very,

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:32.389
very nice. Dual speed trim scroll and boy,
more features than you could every care to

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:36.680
need – if you’re a park flyer anyway.
If you’re a little more advanced, you should

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.189
have plenty of features.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:45.219
So this is the DX6i. I’m actually going
to be binding it with the ParkZone T-28D Trojan

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:51.089
which is about a $200 plane. Again classified
as what I would call a park flyer so nothing

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:55.889
super advanced but a great plane to start
with. And I’m kind of getting into planes

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.789
so that’s why I’m starting there.

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:03.460
So I hope you liked our unboxing of the DX6i
and I hope that if you have any questions

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.460
about how we like it or any more specific
questions about it, feel free to post them

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:16.009
in the comments below and make sure you subscribe
to our channel so you can be notified as soon

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:21.589
as we upload new videos which we do almost

00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:22.150
great day!
