Now I want to talk about setting up your signal
standard, your aspect ratio, and your frame

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.930
rate. Basically, this is are you recording
to HD or not HD? HD, high definition footage

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.641
on your XH A1 means 10 ADI. That's the standard
it records in. You also have the option to

00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:32.220
record through Standard definition which is
4 ADI. If you have a reason to record in the

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.420
standard definition, go ahead go for it. But,
you bought a high definition camera, so I'm

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.920
assuming you want to be recording in HD. Let
me show you how to set that up. You want to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.130
hit your menu button and then the very first
option is where you want to go, 'Signal Setup'.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:54.700
We want to switch down here, we have 'Signal
standard HD', which is what I'm on right now.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.399
So, I click this I can actually see my options.
Here are the options 'HD', which is 10 ADI

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.920
like I said, 'SD' which stands for standard
definition and you can record that in 16:9

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.570
which means wide screen which is what the
video you're watching now looks like, and

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:19.180
then 'SD4:3' which is a more of a square picture,
the same aspect ratio that older tube tv's

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.710
are in. So, set that up. I want to stay HD,
of course. The next option you have is your

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.360
frame rate. Here are your options. You have
'6DI' which is basically sixty frames interlaced

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.710
which is your basic video. Then you have 'thirty
frames' which is thirty frames progressive

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.369
which also looks a lot like video. Then you
have 'twenty-four frames' progressive which

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.010
gives a more film look. Play around with these
frame rates. Basically, twenty-four gives

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.430
you, essentially like I said more film look,
but it can also cause problems of, when you

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.890
pan the camera you get a little bit of stuttering.
If you don't like that, maybe switch to 30F,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.869
thirty frames and then you get a more video
look, but that stutter is gone. That's basically

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.719
it. I shoot in twenty-four frames because
I just think it's a little bit better. But,

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:20.329
it's kind of like, up to you and get that
setup. That's setting your signal standard,

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.769
and your frame rate on your XH A1.
