00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.380
Here we are testing direct sowing corn under organic conditions.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:13.920
This is a big challenge, because we are forgoing the use of herbicides, specifically Roundup.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.440
We are trying it here because there is no erosion in this field.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.180
There is some natural runoff; you can observe that here in the gentle sloping.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.920
Here the soil is compacted, you can see that in the deep tire tracks

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.480
that you don’t find here.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.219
With the heavy harvester, you have almost no tracks there, whereas here, you do.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.400
There is also a lot more organic material in this field, but not here.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.340
And from the legumes, extra nitrogen is brought to the soil.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.460
To summarize, this are some advantage of direct sowing in comparison to the plough.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.740
Direct sowing without herbicide: Experience from four years of practical trials

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.380
The direct sowing process for corn actually begins the year before:

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.420
After the harvest, the stubble is cultivated.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.240
Then, from mid-September to the end of October, the winter cover crops are seeded.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.000
We’ve tested various cover crops.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.740
EFB 33 has done best.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.030
This is a feed pea that grows evenly and is very hardy.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.930
Seed sowing in the spring has to wait until

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.580
a ground temperature of 8-10° has been reached

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.760
because the soil warms up more slowly due to the green cover.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.870
In the previous years, we could sow the corn between May 20th and the first of June.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.880
First, the crimper roller cuts down the cover crop

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.430
and then a direct seeder places the corn in the slots.

Hans-Peter Breiter customized and refined the sowing technique.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:20.689
We always had trouble because the slot was only 1-2cm wide

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.620
and the corn seedlings had to grow there.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.960
He customized the sowing machine

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.280
so that it first cuts the plant cover

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.600
and then clears the sowing slot with the “clearers”.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.760
This way, the corn has better conditions to grow.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.320
The ground warms up better

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.320
and we’re hoping the corn will grow faster.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.579
To optimize the corn’s start,

00:02:52.579 --> 00:03:00.709
we added 250kg of Biorga Quick directly to the seed in the past few years.

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.200
Now we’re in the mulching process.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.599
We mulched the whole field with rye, vetches, peas, and clover three days ago.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.299
This layer covers the ground and prevents weeds from growing.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:27.559
Under this level you can see that it’s still rather damp, despite the low precipitation.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.840
Here we are in the EFB 33 process.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:42.840
It’s great that the corn is just as high as in the plough process.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.680
We can only speculate as to why that is so.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.220
It is possible that the corn is benefiting from the fixed nitrogen of the Rhizobia,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.780
from the peas.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.180
For comparison, we cleared a row.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.000
By opening up the two hoeing rows, we had a measurably better N-mineralization

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.730
and you can see this in the plant height.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:21.530
It’s interesting, however, that the upper layers of the earth are relatively dry.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.670
What effect that will ultimately have on the harvest will only be known in the fall

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.750
when we’ve measured the corn’s dry substance.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.690
It is often the case that direct sown corn has a higher dry substance

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.070
which compensates smaller yields.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:52.740
It is possible to direct sow corn organically. The last 4 years have shown that.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.280
But it still needs optimization in the overall area of fertilization.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.060
We need corn varieties with shorter growing seasons.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.440
Slugs are another issue.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.930
We have noticed that plots with rye have more slug infestations,

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.860
in comparison with EFB 33 or clover and vetches plots.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:26.240
Another interesting observation was that we initially thought we were losing crop to crows,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:32.740
because they were in the fields. But after carefully observing the crows, we realized

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.130
that the birds weren’t eating the corn, but the slugs.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.660
But the whole slug problem is certainly something we need to keep an eye on.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.500
We’ll find a solution through green manuring!
