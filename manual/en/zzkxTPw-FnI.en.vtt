00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:21.258
Today we will be showing you how easy it is to create your own 3D printed object.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:29.079
Let's choose a model to print first. Thingiverse.com has a lot of different downloadable models on offer.

00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:36.515
We also have a section there. Please visit us!

00:00:47.427 --> 00:00:51.427
Let's choose the Caseking keytag we made.

00:00:51.427 --> 00:00:55.427
And download it to our Computer so we can prepare it for printing.

00:00:57.254 --> 00:01:01.254
The next step is to "slice" it. This converts the 3D model file into many Layers.

00:01:01.254 --> 00:01:05.254
The output is a so called GCODE file we will send to printer later.

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:17.571
As you can see, we made the inside hollow. This saves material and is not visible from the outside.

00:01:23.053 --> 00:01:27.053
We will use our ExcelFil™ Sky Blue Filament today. This printers uses 1.75mm diameter filaments.

00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:42.901
As filaments are hygroscopic, we carefully vacuum seal every spool to protect it during transport.

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:50.934
Every Spool is marked with a QR Code which leads you to our support website.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.609
We test each of our filaments extensively to be able to provide you with the correct print temperatures.

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:05.243
This saves you from trial and error you experience with other vendors.

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:10.877
This printable spool holder can be downloaded from our Thingiverse.com page as well!

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.810
We manufacture within industry leading tolerances of only 0.05mm!

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.500
Diameter accuracy is critical for smooth surfaces and to avoid your printer getting stuck.

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:27.594
This is our new filament cleaner. Simple, but effective.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.585
It stops dust, hair or other debris from entering your print head and nozzle.

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:44.581
It designed to work with 3mm and 1.75mm filaments.

00:02:52.577 --> 00:02:56.577
Let's start the print! 

00:03:06.321 --> 00:03:10.321
Here we are printing at 90mm/s. 

00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:15.321
We tested ExcelFil™ up to 200mm/s using a modified Ultimaker.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:20.321
This is faster than most printers on the market today can achieve.

00:03:35.974 --> 00:03:39.974
The quality of the first layer is critical for a good result.

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:57.918
We formulated ExcelFil™ to stick well on Aluminium, Glass, Ceramic and Polyamide (Kapton) surfaces.

00:04:00.411 --> 00:04:04.411
Let's speed it up!

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:35.176
All done! Let's have a look.

00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:42.431
And there it is: Clean surfaces and no need to post process anything.

00:04:45.434 --> 00:04:49.434
And there it is on the keychain.

00:04:51.109 --> 00:04:57.109
