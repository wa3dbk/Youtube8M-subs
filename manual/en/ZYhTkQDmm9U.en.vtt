00:00:08.057 --> 00:00:12.274
(Alex Kingsbury) So 3D printing is a process by which material is

00:00:12.275 --> 00:00:16.592
added in successive layers, it builds up a part, typically you use

00:00:16.593 --> 00:00:18.983
a heat source to build that part up,

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:21.019
but you could use something like a binder as well.

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:24.638
It’s got application in aerospace and biomed

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:26.823
and in the Defence industry as well,

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:29.259
and to a less extent the auto industry.

00:00:29.774 --> 00:00:33.218
So the LAB22 Innovation Centre is a try before you buy

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.633
place, where industry can come in and use the equipment and

00:00:36.634 --> 00:00:39.613
access the expertise of our research scientists.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.277
It means that they get to get familiar with the equipment

00:00:43.278 --> 00:00:45.905
and get the training and support to enable them to

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:48.563
feel confident about potentially making a purchase of one of these

00:00:48.564 --> 00:00:50.203
types of machines in the future.

00:00:50.204 --> 00:00:53.615
This centre enables SMEs to come in and gain a competitive edge.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.580
So, so far here at CSIRO we’ve 3D printed

00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.842
a heel implant for a man that was about to lose his leg,

00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:03.242
so we worked together with the surgeons at St Vincent’s

00:01:03.243 --> 00:01:07.210
and Anatomics. Flying Machine is a Perth based company and

00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:10.219
we 3D print the bike lugs for them and that means they can

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.049
customise bikes according to an individual’s

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.099
height and riding style. We worked with a company

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.170
called Oventus to 3D print a device that goes into

00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.416
your mouth that helps combat sleep apnoea.

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:27.595
The Arcam machine is a 3D metal printer, it prints in a lot

00:01:27.596 --> 00:01:30.365
of different metals and it produces really high

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:32.326
quality parts in a really short amount of time

00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.016
the Concept Laser is a laser-based metal 3D printer.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:41.316
It produces really fine, detailed parts

00:01:41.317 --> 00:01:43.612
with a really nice surface finish.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.825
The Optomec Lense System is a blown powder system.

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:50.257
With this system you can add features to a part, or you can

00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:53.920
functionally grade materials as well. That means, for example,

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.054
you can put a wear resistant coating in a high wear

00:01:57.055 --> 00:02:00.730
area on a part. The Voxeljet is a sand printer.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.163
With the sand printer we can apply a

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:06.061
binder and that prints out our 3D part.

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:09.905
We can use that to make a casting that can be

00:02:09.906 --> 00:02:12.690
more complex than your conventional castings.

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:14.570
The Australian Manufacturing Industry is

00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.210
in a real state of flux at the moment.

00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.330
It’s essential that SMEs transition to advance manufacturing technology

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:26.440
such as 3D printing. Access to the centre enables SMEs to de-risk the

00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:28.955
capital investment that they might make in this technology,

00:02:28.956 --> 00:02:32.098
it enables them to develop up products in an easy

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.084
an accessible and affordable way.

00:02:34.175 --> 00:02:36.944
We want industry to come in and tell us their great

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:39.810
ideas and to try out their ideas using our equipment.

00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:41.809
You’re only limited by your imagination

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.457
when it comes to 3D printing.

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:49.873
