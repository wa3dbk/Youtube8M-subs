00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.970
The craziest thing happened at 
the comedy show tonight.

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.420
She's like, "Keep looking!"

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.220
This has never happened, man,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.820
where someone is THIS comfortable

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.370
in the middle of the show

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.410
sleeping

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.049
passed out

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.289
front and center.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:16.360
This guy's not waking up.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.430
This dude could be dead.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.230
He was--

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.250
--Damn, you killed!

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.359
You really killed!

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.059
He was knocked out.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.250
What happened to the comedian?

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.350
What happened to the comedian?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.880
Is this fool dead or something?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.710
Is this "Weekend at Bernie's 5?"

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I go to comedy shows when I want to take a
long-ass nap!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.700
How much to get in?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.800
15? Cool.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.000
I can really sleep good there.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.300
Long day at work, bud?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And why would you pick

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.410
mid-center

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.410
to take a nap?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.410
There's corners, areas in the back.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.410
He's like, "No, I want to sit in the middle,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.810
front-row center,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.010
so I can fall asleep at the comedy show."

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.000
What's his name? Does anyone know?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.439
Ruben.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.749
If you're asleep and you hear your name

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.009
you would normally respond, right?

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.409
On three, everybody, we're going to say

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.809
We're going to yell "Ruben."

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.509
1-2-3

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.499
RUBEN!

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.509
Is there a paramedic in the building?

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.509
Man, did he do a double-shift or something?

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.979
Ruben, this is God.

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.009
We all love you, 
we just want you to come back.

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:01.009
I didn't tell you this, but Ruben was asleep

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:04.079
when I started the show.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.570
Damn...

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.460
Frickin' Rube.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.150
RUBEN!

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.420
Yay!

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.290
Ruben!

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.290
My bad.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.770
Don't apologize, man.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.020
Do you know how many laughs we got from you?

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.970
We got 20 minutes of straight 
laughter from your sleeping ass.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.720
And man, you WILL be on YouTube.
