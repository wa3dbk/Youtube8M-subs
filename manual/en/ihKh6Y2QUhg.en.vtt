00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.960
I wanna show this great, old Oriental rug
that I found at an estate sale, recently.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.130
It was marked $2,000, and I got it for, I'm
embarrassed to say, $400.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.631
And I just love the colors in it.

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:26.779
And I debated whether to get it or not because
I wasn't sure about the size and there was

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:27.779
a hole in it.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.729
There's a hole right here, but we'll come
back to that in just a minute.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:34.480
There's some wear on the rug, but I kinda
like that -- it has a wonderful sort of patina

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480
to it.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.410
It can add some soulfulness to a room.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.410
Now, you can use an Oriental rug to be the
full rug for a room.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.170
Those are really expensive and hard to come
by, particularly if you have a large room.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.800
So what I like to do is use an Oriental rug
over another rug.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.899
You can see here, I have a room-size rug that's
in sisal, a natural fiber.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.940
And what I'd like to do is lay this colorful,
old Oriental rug over it in a certain area.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.140
Let me show you what I mean: For instance,
this rug is 6 1/2 by 16 1/2 feet.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.930
So if I measure it out, the rug will come
about middle way here, up to this point, under

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.750
the sofa, and over here, and it will define
this sitting area that's focused on the fireplace.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.720
You see, I find that layering a rug on another
rug is a great look and a good use for these

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.910
Oriental rugs, particularly if you want a
seasonal change in a room.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.080
I don't plan to keep this rug in here throughout
the year.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.010
I wanna use it in the fall and winter.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.190
It'll add a certain warmth both in terms of
its color and the fact that's a lovely wool

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.190
rug.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.730
Now if you find a rug like this, there are
a couple things you'll wanna keep in mind:

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.230
Since I was able to buy this at such a great
price, I have enough room in my budget, if

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.910
you will, to have this rug cleaned.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.050
And I can also have it repaired.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.250
But both of these things need to be down by
an expert.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.590
I'm David Martinous, Martinous Oriental Rug
Company.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.140
Our family has been in this business since
1923.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.561
We introduced professional rug cleaning to
the state of Arkansas, and of course, we're

00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:08.479
dealers in handmade Oriental rugs from around
the world.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.670
I just had a nice rug brought in by Allen.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.090
It's a Herati.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.540
It needs a little bit of attention.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.370
It's got a place where we need to patch it,
clean it, and spruce it up a little bit.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.230
What Robert is doing here right now, he's
cutting this out and we're gonna plug this

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.230
in.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.760
A lot of times, instead of weaving a rug,
we have a lot of scrapes and so we can plug

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.890
it and make it look real good.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.870
So that's what he's gonna be doing.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.640
We've got a couple pieces here.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.270
He'll put a patch on the back to keep it in
place, and it will look real well when he's

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.270
finished.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.060
Okay, in this case, what he's gonna do, he's
gonna do something a little bit different.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.120
Instead of using this, it's gonna be a little
bit off on the pattern, he put this solid

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.390
piece in, and he'll put a patch on the back,
glue that in, make it stable, and then he'll

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.340
take his color kit and he'll color this and
blend this in with this so you won't even

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.590
notice that a patch is even there.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.819
Okay, now what we've got here is: This rug
has been submerged.

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.950
It's been in the pit for about 24 hours.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.250
With animal stains and odors.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.770
We're getting ready to pull it out.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.319
We're gonna squeegee all the water out.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.530
It's gonna slide into our dry room.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.430
We're gonna vacuum this pull with the water
out, pull it up to dry.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.890
And after it's finished, we do a shampoo wash
and rinse, and then we check the rug and make

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:48.659
sure that all the odor's out and all the stain's
out.
