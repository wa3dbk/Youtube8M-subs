Susan from Topeka writes, "Dear Mary, my husband
and I always talked about moving to the beach

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.770
when we retired.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.160
We have both been retired for about 7 years
and he keeps making excuses why we can’t

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160
move.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.519
We are both healthy and our finances are secure
so most of his reasons revolve around moving

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.260
away from the children and grandchildren.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.620
How can I get my husband back on board with
our dream?"

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.640
Well, Susan I kind of got stuck on that part
about your finances being secure.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.480
As my husband and I watch our IRA disappear
into the cloud zone, it’s heartening to

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.219
hear from someone who’s not map questing
a route to the nearest homeless shelter.

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.350
Now about the beach.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.809
Seriously?

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.940
Do you plan to be out on the beach?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.210
Do you have a 7-piece bathing suit and a hat
and a quilt?

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.140
Will your beach home be near freshwater or
saltwater?

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.240
If it’s saltwater, I have to ask you, Susan,
is your skin not dry enough already?

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.190
Do you really want to add saltwater to the
mix?

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.220
I guess I’m on your husband’s side.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.410
I like be near our children and grandchildren.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:42.830
My advice would be to stay at home and spend
the secure finances.
