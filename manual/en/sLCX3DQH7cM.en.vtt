00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.600
yes yes, eh this...

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello everybody and welcome back in our kitchen, 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.900
I and AmicoOrso were discussing

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.359
what to do today and we'd like

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:15.189
to prepare a dinner with gnocco fritto (fried pizza), sausages and cheese

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.000
the gnocco fritto is a typical recipe of emilia romagna

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.679
but also of Mantova

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.569
the recipe could change a little from country to country, often change also name

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.339
fried cake, fried pizza, gnocco fritto, crescentina... but is 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.000
always the some thing, a leavened dought and the fried

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.500
usually the gnocco fritto is served with sauges, mortadella, raw ham

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.700
but also why not salame,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.080
cheeses more or less seasoned

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.300
and pickles and for gourmets, various types of jams

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.890
confitures and honey

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.000
But let's start, for this recipe we need

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.100
flour, brewer's yeast, water, butter

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.810
extra virgin oil, sugar, salt

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.010
in many recipes of gnocco fritto we will find

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.000
the lard

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.090
but we that are used to hold a paw to balance and one to taste

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.830
like AmicoOrso says

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.000
we'll use the light butter with 50% less of fat

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.400
Ok, let's pour the flour in a cup

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.020
I remember you that ingredients are a the end of the video

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.930
and put also the salt

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.660
stir

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.370
and then add the water with the yeast

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:40.300
the sugar and the butter... that does not fall ^^"

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.300
and the oil also

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.380
for the dough I use the extra vergin olive oil

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.000
let's pour the liquid in the flour

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.400
and mix

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.800
with the fork

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.000
and after with the bear... ah ah ah

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.100
scared eh..?

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.380
ouch!

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.900
Oh!

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.799
and after with the hands

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.700
yes, now I explane

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.409
if you have troubles to knead with the hands you could

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.709
also put the dough on worktop

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.000
press with the hand

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.600
once finish... make a ball

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.400
and put in a bowl to rise, cover with covered with a wet rag

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.100
for two hour

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400
A once rised, put the dough 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.159
on a shit of oven paper

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.100
with few flour, for not smudge too much

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.100
and pull with the rolling pin

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.000
give to dough the thickness

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.200
of two mm

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.200
thank you

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.400
cut with the cutter

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.339
triangles

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:13.179
more or less big

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:16.000
depending on your imagination

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.249
for me it's ok

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:22.329
you could make also bigger

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:24.699
somebody makes squared

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:26.329
and let's fry

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.900
When the oil is hot put down

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.900
gnocco fritto

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.100
fry it well on all two sides

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:50.989
it's rapid

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.100
I use peanut oil

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.300
I suggest, always mono seed oil

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.300
et voila

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:00.849
then we put

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.600
on dish with blotting paper

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.129
and if you want, you can salt on the top

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.600
the gnocco fritto is ready

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.200
we have prepared on a dish with nuts cheese

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.229
smoked cheese,

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:20.389
we put also jam of pears, of chestnuts

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.539
and red onions

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.200
and it's ok for a quick aperitif or also a light brunch

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300
for a last minute dinner with friends, 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.960
once rise, the dought could be frozen

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.000
and you can use like pizza, bread, bread sticks, 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.700
tortillas, all what you want

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.400
