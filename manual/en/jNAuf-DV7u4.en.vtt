Kathy Savoie, Cooperative Extension Educator:
"Homemade jams and jellies are an all-time

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.950
favorite for most home canners. Why not try
your hand at making a low-sugar jam or jelly

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.200
with one of the many low-sugar pectin products
available on the market today? Your homemade

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.210
jams and jellies using Maine strawberries
and blueberries will taste all the better.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.850
"Supplies and materials: colander, paper towels,
towels, strawberry huller, cutting board,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.210
masher, measuring tools, pots, spatulas, canning
tools, standard canning jars with two-piece

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.230
dome lids and boiling water.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.500
"Step one: Rinse, hull and mash strawberries.
Measure strawberries and sugar.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.440
"Step two: Combine jam or jelly ingredients
according to the pectin box directions. Remember,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.890
pectin is the product that helps your jam
or jelly set. Low-sugar jams provide high

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.219
fruit taste without added sugar. Some even
provide options for using honey, sugar substitutes

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:24.350
or fruit juice. Once done cooking, remember
to skim the foam.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.429
"Step three: Pack into sterilized jars with
the recommended amount of head space. Head

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.250
space is the amount of air between the top
of your product and the lid of your jar. For

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.959
jams and jellies, you want a quarter-inch
of head space. Screw bands should be tightened

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.409
by hand.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:54.719
"Step four: Strawberry jam is processed in
boiling water for 10 minutes. Make sure the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:01.060
water level is at least one to two inches
over the tops of the jars. Processing time

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.819
starts once the water has returned to a boil.
Afterward, place jars on a cooling rack. The

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.470
vacuum seals should form with the classic
“ping” sound within 12 to 24 hours, usually

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.780
in the first 10 to 15 minutes.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.730
"Step five: Check for seals. A vacuum seal
is the ultimate goal for home canners, since

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.580
it prevents air from entering the jar and
causing spoilage. Properly sealed lids will

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.070
be firm to the touch and not make the popping
sound of an unsealed jar. Store home canned

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.460
goods in a cool, 50- to 70-degree space that
is dark and dry. A surprise to many people

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.490
is that home canned goods are stored without
the screw band. Simply label, date, rinse

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.860
off your jars and use within one year.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.720
