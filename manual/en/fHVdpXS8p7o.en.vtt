00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.140
Today I'm gonna tell you about

Brewing tea

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.700
Gyokuro is one of the most
 healthy and valued Japanese teas.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:36.500
Why is it so special? Well, it's worth mentioning
 the different production method of this tea

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.000
when compared to other green teas. 
First of all, it's about the cultivation itself

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.900
but the difference is also in the strain of tea. 
An average sencha is produced of

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:58.400
Yabukita variation while Gyokuro usually comes from 
strains such as Asahi, Okumidori, Yamakai or  Saemidori.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.000
Depending on the plantation, those strains
 are used in a variety of ways.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:14.100
What's important, this tea as you can see 
is intense dark green and looks like needles.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:22.400
The production is done normally like
 in Japan with water steam, then it's dried

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.400
it's in the form of needles
 that are pretty valued in Japan.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.300
The difference I want to talk about is on the field, 
on the plantation where the tea grows.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.100
It's interesting. That tea tp make it not so dark 
and to have a valued flavor by the Japanese

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:52.600
it has to be shadowed. It ages in the shadow, 
that's why roofs are built over the whole tea plantation.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.400
It's made of bamboo, cane or foil, 
depending on the planter.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.900
It's all done with an aim
 to make a dark place for tea.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.000
Tea leaves age in the dark then. Of course
 it's not totally dark, there's limited access to light

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.400
thanks to which tea releases more chlorophyll. 
Because it's less Sun and tea tries to feed,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.600
providing enough nutrients
 to photosynthesize, it can be done in the dark.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.700
The tea needs to create more chlorophyll, thanks to which
 it has a dark, pine tree like color of the leaves.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.600
It's very rich in chlorophyll, and it's
 slightly similar to Kabusecha

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:45.200
which is also shadowed but only for a week. Gyokuro, in turn, 
should be shadowed as long as three weeks before harvest.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.510
What's different about Gyokuro from other 
teas is the flavor. It's more on the sweet side,

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.510
it has no bitterness and there's not
 much tannin coming from it.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.410
Very intense grassy like flavor, fresh 
and spinach-like, and a lot of Umami

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.410
which is what Japanese people 
appreciate a lot in tea.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:17.610
What we're gonna brew now is Gyokuro
 Yame, itąs Yame plantation in Fukuoka

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.510
This is the largest producer of Gyokuro in Japan 
and most Gyokuro comes from that plantation.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.110
This is also the most appreciated Gyokuro. In 2017
 amongst all Gyokuros that were assessed,

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.810
this one was chosen as the best and tastiest 
Gyokuro in Japan so it's the best that can be.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.110
Gyokuro is brewed differently 
than average most Japanese teas.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.410
Here we need to use even cooler water, 
water in the temperature of 60°C or even 50°C.

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.210
Some planters even recommend 
40°C so it's really cool water.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.730
So our delightful Gyokuro is done.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:57.930
Amazing aroma, really deep one.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.830
Very vegetable and spinach-like but I can 
smell the sweetness in the aroma.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.330
A slightly fruity note, perhaps a little bit of papaya.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.230
Amazing composition.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.060
It's perfect. The most precious Japanese tea.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.150
Perhaps it's not the most precious harvest 
but one that's affordable for us

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.970
Amazing. Every tea enthusiast must know 
this flavor. There's no other way.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.180
Wonderful. And very healthy, too. 
As I said, it never gets bitter,

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.880
of course provided its brewed
 properly. So it's never bitter,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:50.080
it's always pleasantly sweet, and you can taste 
that sweetness later after drinking, too.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.980
Deep on the tongue. It's really 
awesome tea. What more can I say?

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.280
Drink Gyokuro. visit us for 
next episodes and website.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.480
That's all for now.
 See you soon!
