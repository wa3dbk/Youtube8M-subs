Hi guys, and welcome back to another episode
of hair with Hollie. Today I'm going to be

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:07.470
showing you how to do these fabulous top knots.
We're going to show you three ways on how

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.110
you can achieve them, from real casual to
something quite elegant and formal. So they've

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.160
all been wearing top knots Gwen Stefani. Kim
Kardashian. Beyonce. Everyone. It's a great

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:26.230
look for kind of dirtier hair and it's also
great for the weekend too.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.230
[Music]

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.680
Okay, so we are going to start by pulling
the hair into quite a high, sleek ponytail.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.630
So you want to aim for it not so much in the
top of your head, but definitely up around

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.221
the crown. If you want, you can pop a little
bit of product in the hair if you want to

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:48.780
give it a sleeker look. You can prep it with
some mousse or even put a bit of wet look

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.820
gel in it.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.040
So, as this is quite a high knot, for this
look you will need quite a high ponytail.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:02.350
So again, aim just kind of short of the crown
of the head, so just around there. And you

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.119
can adjust it if you want it to be more prominent,
you can put the ponytail up a bit higher.

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.229
Or again, if you want it down low, you can
pop it down low as well. So once you are happy

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:18.049
with your height, simply pop your hair band
on.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.350
[Music]

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.810
So there are three ways you can go about constructing
your top knot. If you have thinner hair, it's

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.229
a great idea to use a sock, we'll get to that
in a minute, or a bundy, because it really

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.970
plumps out the bun and gives it a great bit
of volume. But if you have thicker hair, you

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.590
can simply wind the hair around itself and
pin it in place. Or, like we are going to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.500
do here, if you want to add a bit of volume,
take your ponytail, just backcomb through

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.710
the length. And then, easy breezey, just start
to twist it, and the hair will wrap around

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.260
itself like so, until you are left with something
like that. So once you are happy with the

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.380
shape of the bun, if you just run a little
bit of hairspray over the sides of the hair

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.720
and along the back, just to smooth away the
little flyaways.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720
[Music]

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.489
So as I was saying, if you have thinner hair,
these bundys are a great option because they

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.439
add volume instantly and you don't damage
your hair by back combing or anything. You

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.670
can get them in loads of different sizes.
I have quite a big one here. So literally

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.230
pop them on as you would a bobbin, and then,
just slightly position the hair around the

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.700
bun.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.540
So trying to cover all the exposed bundy just
like so. And then using grips the same color

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.590
as your hair, start to pin the hair in place,
working your way around the bun until you

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.780
have covered all of the bundy.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.720
Then when you are finished and you are happy
with your look, just secure the bun and again

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.099
the flyaways with a squirt of hair spray.
So this is quite a glam look. It is quite

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.260
dramatic. If you are looking for something
a bit smaller you can go for a smaller bundy.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.909
But this is a beautiful kind of statement
look. and again, it would be lovely with some

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.099
hair jewellery or a ribbon. If you don't have
a bundy to hand and still want to get a full

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.160
look, there is a way.

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.519
All you need is an old sock, preferably in
around the same shade as your hair. So if

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.920
you are blonde or fair haired, just use a
white one or a yellow one. If you are red

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.209
haired, use the same. So we have here an old
sock, a clean old sock. So what we are going

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:49.780
to do is take our scissors, mind your fingers,
and just cut it down where the heel starts.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.849
There we go. We have just a kind of tube shape
left. So what we are going to do now is just

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:06.579
roll the sock up over itself like so, so you
have a little bun shape. If you want a bigger

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:12.950
bundy, you use a sports sock or maybe a man's
sock or a whole sock even. So you can just

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.349
cut the toe off the entire sock.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:23.310
So already you can see it kind of plumps out
the hair a little bit. So we are going to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.060
go for a knot look here, a real street style
look, as opposed to the polished one that

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.020
we had been going for. So I am going to split
the hair in two and back comb through the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.020
length of it.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:48.090
And I am going to start winding the hair around
this little bun ring here. Then I'm taking

00:04:48.090 --> 00:05:02.530
a second bit here, and I'm just going to wind
this the other way until you have quite an

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.190
informal, literally just a knot shape. So
once you are happy with the direction of the

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.199
hair, simply pin in place and finish with
a bit of hair spray.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.979
Okay! And there you have it: three ways to
get a really cool top knot style. If you liked
