00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:14.769
Don't worry.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:27.230
I'm not gonna do what everyone thinks I'm
gonna do, and just praise Pixar for five minutes.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.800
Though I could do that.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.930
But here's the shocker...I'm not a big fan
of The Incredibles.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.590
It's, like, the only Pixar movie I didn't
fall in love with.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.270
Well, that and Cars, but...Cars isn't even
a movie.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.600
It's, like...a Pixar commercial.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.989
For Pixar toys.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.860
And speaking of things that aren't that great
but are produced to make a sh*t load of money,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.060
anyway...this is video game based on a movie.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:58.730
It's The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:10.610
So this game was released in 2005, a year
after The Incredibles hit theaters.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.110
As you might expect, it came to virtually
every platform imaginable at the time, including...the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.630
Game Boy Advance, which is the version we're
playing here.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.010
On the GBA, it's a 2D platformer with three
worlds and about twice as many enemies.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:35.070
So that's the kind of game it's gonna be.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:48.170
You play as both Mr. Incredible and Frozone,
switching between them whenever you need to.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.110
So it's a tag-team platformer, kind of like
Donkey Kong Country.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.640
With a lot less awesome, included.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.250
Anyway, the game picks up right after the
events of the film, with the Underminer showing

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.420
up and being a real jerk about things.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.950
Short story shorter, time to button mash.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.270
Obviously, each character is different.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.040
Mr. Incredible is the powerhouse of the two,
so he's able to lift heavy gates and smash

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040
stuff.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.870
While Frozone is faster and more nimble.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.000
He can also freeze enemies in their steps.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.710
Oh, uh...and he can pretty much fly across
the levels, when he wants to.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.050
And he can make steps, out...of...ice.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:49.000
But hey...Mr. Incredible sure is a big...guy.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.680
Point is, even though it's a tag-team platformer,
it's kind of not.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.080
You spend about 90 percent of the game as
Frozone.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.530
You only switch to Mr. Incredible when he
has to lift something heavy or smash a computer.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.170
Otherwise, he's basically useless.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.320
And for a game in which repetition is a serious
problem, making one of its two characters

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.239
a situational character seems like...kind
of a bad move.

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.330
Speaking of repetition, though...holy sh*t,
this game's repetitive.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.989
You get the same handful of enemies, repeatedly,
over the game's three different worlds.

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.989
That's it.

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:23.989
There are three worlds.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.510
There's an ice world, a factory and a more
different factory.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.170
And each one has the same enemies, which you
attack the same way, over and over.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.790
Until you realize, "Wait, why am I even playing
this?

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.540
I could be doing any number of things."

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.990
"Like...drawing dragons."

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:57.099
So the game's really short and shallow, but...it's
not like what's there is any good.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.230
The controls are just adequate, at best.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.090
There's some rough hit detection, which makes
the platforming more difficult than it should

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.090
be.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.090
The game doesn't look terrible, but...since
there are only three environments, the levels

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.799
all feel exactly the same.

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:16.140
I mean, these licensed games are usually pretty
rushed, but...this actually feels like it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.579
was half of a game, unfinished, rushed to
the market for the holidays.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.849
That's the only thing about this game that's
incredible.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.789
Very young players might get a bit of a kick
out of it, but even they'll probably ask where

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.080
cartridge two is.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.319
Spoiler alert, kidsâ€”there is no cartridge
two in Rise of the Underminer.
