00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.139
As you can see I've been really filling out
this arrangement with some inexpensive elements.

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.389
We've got a lot of different kinds of greens,
some berries.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.070
We've got Queen Anne's lace, a lot of what
we call filler, and we have a little bit of

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.620
lysianthus as well another sort of more wild
and abundant flower.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.010
When you're considering the cost you have
to really think about what part of the country

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.140
you're in, what flowers might be local there,
what flowers are going to require shipping

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.300
in from somewhere abroad.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.109
Most of the flowers that you see here are
going to be common and found anywhere.

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.449
Especially things like greens it doesn't really
matter what green you use.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.399
It's just something that's local, that fills
out, and that looks interesting to you.

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.129
The main idea is to really fill out an arrangement
as much as possible with this filler and the

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.260
greens, and you have this great structure
in which to put these more expensive flowers,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.260
the roses.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.080
But, you know, things can really range, and
when you're thinking about price point for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.640
an inexpensive arrangement you might walk
into a floral shop and want to spend 20, 25

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.729
dollars on an arrangement.

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.729
Something like this, where you don't have
too many expensive feature flowers, might

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.120
be in the range of 25 to 35 dollars.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.189
That might be a reasonable cost.

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:28.030
Then maybe you add 3 or 4, maybe even 5 to
10 of these more feature flowers to the arrangement,

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.650
and it could be anywhere from 35 to 45 dollars
depending again.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.899
You don't have to use roses.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.070
You could use something like a daisy.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.979
Anything that you, when you walk around and
see in a market, in a farmers market, in a

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.329
bodega.

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.119
Those kinds of flowers are always good to
find if you're going into a florist shop and

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.171
say to yourself, OK well I know that I've
seen tulips at my local grocery store, so

00:01:55.171 --> 00:02:00.170
that means that if I walk into the flower
shop I know that they're not going to be too,

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.329
too expensive.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.569
As long as they're not exotic French tulips
that have been shipped in from somewhere.

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.890
So, that's something to consider for price
point.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.990
And then you also want to make sure that you're
coming to a shop that seems to be, in general,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.990
within your price point.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.740
So, you know a place that does mostly events
and weddings or that has very fabulous, fancy

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.210
window displays, they might be looking at
a higher price point customer.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.110
That's not where you want to go for your 25
dollar bouquet of flowers.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.300
I'm just filling in.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.960
You can fill in, really once you have the
structure, any way you want.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.050
I like to sometimes sort of cluster a few
things, and especially if you're using only

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.100
a few feature flowers, that's a nice way to
give it some heft.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.930
So we cluster the roses.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.890
I do spin the arrangement, because although
it's mostly that we're looking at the arrangement

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.040
from the front here, I want it to be finished
in back as well.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.120
So maybe I'll take some of these roses and
cut them down a little bit so that if somebody

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.540
saw it from the back it would look just as
nice.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.540
You can see that with really gorgeous, open,
more expensive blooms it still looks, even

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.430
though we've only used about ten of them,
it still looks pretty substantial.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.590
And that's how you make a floral arrangement
that's not too expensive.
