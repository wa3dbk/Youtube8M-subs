00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:09.920
Air Pollution

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.560
 Global Warming

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.860
Traffic Congestion and smog

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.540
Refueling queues at gas stations

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
The soaring prices of fossil fuel

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.680
To increase gas supply

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800
The government has decided

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.900
to keep CNG stations closed for 6 hours

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.260
from 3-9 pm

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.080
These problems are making our lives harder each day

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.050
How can this be solved?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.420
Do we keep staring at the future?

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.820
We are already affiliated with electric cars

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.160
 If we think a little we will see

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.640
The RC cars that we've played with, when we were young, are actually electric cars

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.600
If its possible in such smaller scales

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.180
Then

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.560
Why don't we think in larger scales?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.720
The motors used in RC cars are DC motors

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.100
Which run on AA batteries

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.100
As we are thinking big

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.340
and due to some limitations of DC motors

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.740
we will use, induction motors

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.340
Induction motor

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.960
Sounds familiar?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.900
We can see uses of induction motors in many electric machines around us

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.020
like fans

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.380
compressor of a refrigerator 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.160
escalator

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.000
elevators

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.740
water pumps

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760
even drill machines!

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.420
An induction motor is comprised of two parts

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.500
The outer part is the stator, and the inner part is the rotor

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.040
judging the name you can easily understand that the rotor rotates

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.620
and the stator remains static

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.820
but the funny part is, the rotor and the stator has no direct electrical connection

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.400
this is a metallic disc

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.920
if it is placed in a magnetic field

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.180
then it tries to stop according to lenz's law

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.780
then again, if the magnetic field is moved around it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.160
then the disc starts rotating

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.440
therefore, even without electrical connections

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.980
a stator can make a rotor rotate using this principle

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.760
Why use an induction motor in your car?

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.940
The first thing that comes to our heads when judging a machine is it's efficiency

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.340
For engine driven cars which is usually only 15%

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.200
but for induction motors it is 88%

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:34.440
54% energy of gasoline driven cars, is wasted in it's internal combustion engine

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.900
internal combustion engine converts chemical energy into mechanical energy very inefficiently

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.960
because every cycle of ignition

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.040
generates a lot of unwanted heat

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.840
moreover aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, etc waste the generated energy.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.700
On the contrary, induction motors have only one rotating part

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.540
and it is completely seperated from the stator

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.960
hence, there is no frictional energy loss

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.800
On the upper hand, as there is no point for ignition

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.080
unwanted heat is not generated

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.840
If force is applied on an object it accelerates linearly

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.660
and the force that causes angular or rotational acceleration is called torque

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.320
again

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.135
load is proportional to torque

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.460
more load requires more torque

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.320
as induction motor generates instant torque

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.360
induction motors are being used in formula-e racing cars!

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.880
a petrol driven SLS

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.560
generates sound at intensity levels of 120 dB

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.480
on the other hand

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.220
an electric SLS is so soundless that

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.440
it made geremy clarkson from top gear, feel nervous!

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.160
Can such a world be imagined which is free from carbon emissions?

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.440
development of electric cars is an important milestone in attaining such a world

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.960
the parts of which are also generated in methods that don't produce carbon dioxide 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.640
you know that iPhones are keys to happiness

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.980
therefore if you

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.720
instead of using petrol driven cars

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.240
use an electric car

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.480
then you will be able to buy 10 iPhones with the money you save 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.560
annually

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.840
When the acceleration of an electric car is stopped

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.860
according to lenz's law, the magnetic field of the stator tries to stop the rotor

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.560
this, is called, Engine Breaking

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.020
as a result the batteries get recharged

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.480
the world of electric cars

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.740
might seem dreamlike to you, from what you've seen to this point

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.540
but it's disadvantages are not hard to come by

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.680
Firstly

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.780
to buy a Tesla Electric Car, you will have to spend $70,000

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.200
you might be thinking why an engine-less car is so expensive...

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.480
the reason is

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.180
the batteries used in this car, are worth half it's price

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.500
the price of the battery pack is equivalent to a brand new BMW X1 SUV

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.620
one of the perks of buying such an expensive car is that

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:27.540
you can charge your car from any tesla supercharger station, FOR FREE

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.780
are you thinking that your transportation costs just reached zero?

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.040
that will be true

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.740
if

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.620
time has very little significance to you

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.340
because

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:39.900
fully charging this car requires 20 hours!

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.680
and supercharger stations?

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.240
it is absent in most of the countries, like bangladesh

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:45.740
not only that

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.160
an electric Mercedes SLS is 353 Kg heavier than an engine driven Jaguar

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.020
using that mass of fuel, you can go to Makkah from Dhaka and perform Hajj!

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.780
But if that is the situation

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.720
then why should we use electric cars?

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.080
