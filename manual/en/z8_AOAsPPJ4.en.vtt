00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.038 align:end position:100%
I'll let you
take a look at it.

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.407 align:start size:72% position:28%
You like where it's at?

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.077 align:start position:0%
He just looks
lonely there.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.278
I'm exhausted.

00:00:12.278 --> 00:00:14.447
She's having me change this
and change that.

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.481 align:start size:38% position:63%
That's good?

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.950 align:start position:0%
It's right on the blade
though.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.019 align:end position:100%
You got your other
shoulder blade tattooed already.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.955
At home,
I own my own shop.

00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:24.791
If I don't want to do it,
I send 'em on their way.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.993 align:end position:100%
You relaxed?
Let your shoulders down.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.762
I got my back against the wall,
and I'm having to compromise.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:32.097 align:start position:0%
Now, I feel like I just have
a hole in the back.

00:00:32.097 --> 00:00:34.467 align:start size:22% position:78%
A hole?

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.503 align:end position:100%
All right, take a look
at that.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.605 align:start position:0%
Yeah, perfect.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:41.541 align:end position:100%
Let's get it popping,
girl.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:43.709 align:start position:0%
I compromised.
I did good, right?

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:45.011 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:48.347 line:0%
My canvas has given me
a headache from the get-go.

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:51.450
Luckily for me, she compromised
to let me do outlines.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.820 align:start size:63% position:38%
Mine's half the size
of everybody else's,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.256 align:end position:100%
but I'm gonna have contrast
and good, clean lines.

00:00:57.256 --> 00:00:58.591
(Dave C voice-over)
Is that enough to keep me safe?

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.926
I don't know,

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.562
but I don't want to be
anywhere near the bottom.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:09.535 line:0%
There are so many stretch marks
and cellulite

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:12.806 line:0%
that I am scared to death
to have to put this tattoo here.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.445 align:end position:100% line:0%
Yeah, no, you should be
an expert at that now.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.914
[scoffs]
[bleep] my life.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.884 align:start position:0%
Oh, my God,
oh, my God.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:28.220 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do a flower
in color.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.656 line:0%
Being in this competition,
there's a lot of pressure.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.859
Sometimes I question
if I am built for this.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.562 align:start position:0%
Oh, my God.
I'm pressed for time right now.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:37.997
(Big Ceeze voice-over)
Growing up, it was hard.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:41.668
Because of the way I was raised,
my kids mean everything to me,

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:43.570
and I'm here
in this competition

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.438
because I want
to give them more.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.473 align:end position:100%
Can't believe you go
from a stencil to this, like--

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:48.174 align:start position:0%
[chuckles]
