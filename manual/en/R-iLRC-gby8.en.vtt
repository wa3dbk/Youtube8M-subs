00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.400
 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.509
So, you've heard of xeriscape, right?

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.259
pull up your lawn, throw down some rocks and call it a garden. (ugh) Well,

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.289
not quite.

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:18.529
I'm Kyla with tuja wellness dot com and I'm here with Gwen, the executive director of

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.010
the Okanagan Xeriscape Association.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.960
We're here to debunked some of those myth around the xeri - zero - zeri

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.239
xeriscaping

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.159
what exactly is xeriscaping? 
Basically xeriscaping is gardening with the natural

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:31.909
environment that you live in

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:35.590
So, gardening such that you are just using the natural rainfall.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.980
and there's seven principles of xeriscape and i think they're fabulous. I

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.970
think it's the best way to have a
successful garden is to keep all of these so

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.810
they're planning and design

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.040
practical turf areas, soil preparation, 
efficient irrigation

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.030
appropriate plant selection which is the
fun part

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.320
mulching

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.980
and timely maintenance.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.250
and, so what are some of the biggest misconceptions

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.460
well like you said at the beginning
zeroscape people call it zero-scape

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.230
and it's actually xeriscape and x-e-r-i is actually the Greek word for dry, that's where it

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.290
comes from.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.920
and the big, big misconception is people
think it's rocks, cactus, straggling

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.720
plants - ugly, ugly

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.700
if you follow the principles of xeriscape
you can have absolutely beautiful, lush

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.860
garden in almost any style, there's tons of
plants to choose from

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.299
and i actually strongly recommend that
you don't use rock mulch, it throws a lot of

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.810
heat back on your huse and on your plants

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.190
and  it's really hard to weed out
of

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.300
and what are some of the positive effects on the environment?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.210
well number one you can save water and
it doesn't matter where you live in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.060
canada you can save water

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.049
the infrastructure for treated drinking
water is getting more and more expensive

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.460
and cities are more and more going to
be putting restrictions on using it on

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.070
outdoor irrigation so if you create a
 garden right now with using this

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.270
xeriscape principles your garden will be

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.120
really drought tolerant no matter what
happens and you'll have a beautiful

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.510
garden even if the water is completely
restricted.  (oh, wonderful) And the other

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.810
positive advantages is that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.990
growing your plants using the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.400
xeriscape principles you have really
healthy

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.890
happy plants so they don't attract pests
and diseases so you don't have to use

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.099
nasty chemicals in your garden.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.059
Nice. And where can we find out more information?
