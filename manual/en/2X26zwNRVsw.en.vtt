Hi, I’m Jackie and Welcome to Healthy Eating with HealthWorks! 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.329
In this feature, we’re focusing on two healthy ways you can incorporate dairy into your 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:30.329
diet. In the first episode, I’m going to show you how to make a more nutritious version of a grilled cheese sandwich. In the second episode, you can learn how to make 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:37.500
a delicious fruit and yogurt smoothie. Dairy products are a very important part of a healthy, well-balanced diet.  

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.840
They provide you with calcium for strong bones and teeth, which will reduce your risk for osteoporosis. So let’s start with the grilled cheese sandwich.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.260
This is a classic sandwich that’s tasty, and quick and easy to make. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.800
I know I grew up eating grilled cheese sandwiches and looking back on it, they definitely weren’t as healthy as they could have been.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.580
Simple ingredient substitutions can increase the nutritional value of the sandwich and still save you time and money for a quick lunch or dinner. 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.390
And I promise, you won’t miss your old grilled cheese.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.770
Before you begin, make sure you have a clean work space, and then you can gather your ingredients.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.170
For this recipe, we’re going to be using two slices of whole wheat bread, two pieces of low fat Swiss cheese, olive oil,

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.410
you need a spoon for your olive oil, a cutting board, a knife, one tomato, a frying pan, and heat safe spatula.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.330
We're going to start assembling our sandwich by placing the two pieces of whole wheat bread on the plate. 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.770
When looking to buy whole wheat bread, make sure it says “whole wheat” on the package, and not just wheat. And it should also have

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.070
three grams of fiber per slice. Next, you're going to take your tomato, knife, and cutting board.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:48.330
And you’re just going to make one slice on one side.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.619
Tomatoes are a great source of vitamin C, vitamin A, and licopene, 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.939
which is an antioxidant. Now you're going to take your slices of tomato and put them on one slice of bread.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.780
Next we’re going to add our two slices of Swiss cheese.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.609
You can add any cheese you like, but look for natural cheeses that are made with skim or part-skim milk.

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.779
Mozzarella would also be a great cheese on the sandwich.

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:23.799
Next we're going to put our other slice of bread on top, and then we're going to take our olive oil and just spoon a little bit on.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.679
Olive oil can reduce your risk of heart disease by reducing your total cholesterol in your LDL, or bad cholesterol, in your blood. 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:38.419
Saturated fats do the opposite, so it’s better to start a healthy habit now. 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:43.309
Next, you're going to turn your stove on to a low-medium heat.  

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:57.760
And then you can just add your sandwich onto the stove and let one side brown, and then when that’s done, you can flip it on the other side.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:07.760
So once you see that one side of the bread is lightly toasted, you can flip it, and let the other side toast.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:18.039
Once you can tell that both sides are nicely toasted and your cheese is melted, you can turn the heat off, and you can plate your sandwich.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:24.109
Let it cool, and it’s ready to eat. 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:31.109
Ok, so we’re just going to cut it in half.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:39.129
So there you have it, a healthy and delicious way to incorporate dairy into your diet.

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.479
