for I am Diane Wallace welcome to
Adorama TV

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.559
today we're talking about Zeiss's
collection of compact prime CP.2

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.770
lenses now there's 14 lenses in this
line

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.160
and they're really going to bring your
cinematography to the next level

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.500
let's get started with some other
features that you can seem right from

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.279
the beginning

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.660
all these markings on the lens at the
front you've got to focus ring

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.059
you've got three hundred degrees the
rotation here it's nice and smooth as

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:34.899
you can see

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.480
and turning it right now and its care
for Follow Focus

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.739
so you won't have to retrofit anything
later on if you're moving on with their

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.579
photography

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.149
and you reading right on the box so you
don't have to spend time setting up a

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.000
extra gears are extra gadgets to use the
ones you're just ready to go which saves

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.860
a lot of time

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.449
next to that we have an aperture or an
iris

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.570
their used interchangeably here we have
a nice

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.750
smooth click less rain that clients

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.490
that's really going to save you some
trouble it's never going to interfere

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.750
with their shops

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.610
there's a fourteen blade aperture
honestly you have beautiful Boca

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.490
beautiful highlights in your background

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.600
again very simple to use and everything
is marked so you always get repeatable

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.560
results

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.170
now town on the 14 months as in the line
have the same barrel dimensions

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.380
and what that means for you is that it's
really easy to swap out lenses

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
while they're right on a red so again
it's a great time saver

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.570
also these lenses have what's a
different mounts now

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.100
you can see my Canon here I have EF
mount on this Sat

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.340
but what's available in five different
amounts and so

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.040
as your cameras change in grow your
lenders will stay with you forever it's

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.450

lenses do cover 24 by 36

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.490
size so full frame and the 4k compatible
which is really nice as technology is

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.189
