00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This video demonstrates the operation of the PT6.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The bed size of the PT6 is 48” deep x 96” wide.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This permits the fabrication of a wide range of products.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
42 pairs of form arms define the inner 
 surface of the component to be formed.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The position of the form arms is controlled by a series of 
 DC stepper motors which are linked to the computer control system.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This system allows the manufacturer to rapidly set up and manufacture a 
 component without the use of forms or templates of any kind.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Once entered, all the pertinent manufacturing information to make a part is stored on the computer 
 hard drive, and can be recalled at any time to reproduce an identical component.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:20.000
A heavy stainless steel band, suspended over the bed by 2 carriages, is tensioned by hydraulic brakes and 
 is used to form the component to the form arms and provide the necessary laminating pressure.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The component to be formed is placed on the stock positioners.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The machine has a maximum width capacity of 11 inches and is provided with 2 
 sets of adjustable stock positioners, permitting 2 parts to be run per machine cycle.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Pressing a button on a console begins the machine cycle.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The overhead bridge moves forward and the tensioned stainless steel 
 band forms the component to the form arms.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Remove the stainless steel or wood fillers used on 
 the inside of the part being formed.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Once the part is dried, the machine automatically cycles 
 to prepare for the removal of the part.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The filler distributes the contact force of the form arms 
 uniformly along the inside surface of the part.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Let’s take a closer look at the machine details.  

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Each of the 42 pairs of form arms are mounted on a common 
 driven shaft which is in turn coupled with a geared stepper motor.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Once the stepper motors have positioned the form arms in their correct location, they are individually locked 
 firmly in place by a hydraulic clamp built into the base of each arm.  

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This provides a stable and accurate surface to define the 
 inner perimeter of the part to be formed.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The heavy stainless steel band is suspended over the bed by 2 carriages.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The stainless steel band is tensioned by adjustable hydraulic brakes and used to form 
 the component to the form arms and provide the necessary laminating pressure.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The stainless steel tension band is also the 
 negative conductor for the radio frequency generator.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The bridge is mounted on machine slides and 
 is driven by a large gear motor.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The bridge is mounted on machine slides and 
 is driven by a large gear motor.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:24.000
A large tank of pneumatic cylinders is suspended below the bridge and behind the carriage.  These 
 cylinders will be automatically actuated by the computer in forming parts with the straight leg section.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The control console is designed around a standard PC platform.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The PT6 console is separated from the radio frequency generator console.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The main machine interface is straightforward.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Part geometrical data is entered into the system via windows like environment.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Compensation for spring in and spring out can 
 be added separately to each arched section.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The program includes machine diagnostics and on-line help features.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Parts can be graphically represented on the computer screen.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The PT6 can also form aluminum extrusions.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The extrusions must first be encapsulated in UHMW form 
 to support the piece during the forming operation.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The UHMW form supports the sections of the profile that 
 are subjected to compressive forces during the forming process.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There is no curing or cooling cycle when forming aluminum extrusions

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The part is merely loaded into the machine and the bending cycle initiated.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The machine will automatically then form the component.
