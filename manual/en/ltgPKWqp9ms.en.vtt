SUE: Hi. My name is Sue. I'm with Georgia
Career Institute on behalf of Expert Village,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.050
and we're going to talk about freehand nail
art today. Now I'm going to show you how to

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:38.489
do a simple bouquet of flowers by teardrop
dots. You don't want too much polish on the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:56.040
brush or it will just mush together when you
make your teardrops. Then you can use yellow

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:06.730
or any other types of pinks.
Dot at the bottom. Don't put on the whole

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:31.580
petal 'cause then it won't look like a flower.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:43.939
And to make the stem of the flowers, I could
dot it and make it really dark so you'd know

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:58.640
where the stem starts and ends. You can make
more flowers or you can make less depending

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:28.840
on how big or small the nail is. And then
you can dot the stem, just the top of it,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.090
and then you would apply the top coat after
the nail dries.
