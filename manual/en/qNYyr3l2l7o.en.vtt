00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.322
- Hey, everyone, my name is Tyler

00:00:01.322 --> 00:00:03.807
and it is the Friday video
of the year and this week

00:00:03.807 --> 00:00:06.384
I saw a little challenge
going around on Tumblr

00:00:06.384 --> 00:00:09.008
and so I decided that I would participate.

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:11.817
And put myself through
a little bit of pain

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:12.868
for your pleasure.

00:00:12.868 --> 00:00:14.679
But apparently, the challenge is to watch

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.628
a video of this clip called Circus Afro

00:00:17.628 --> 00:00:19.393
that plays in a loop for 10 minutes,

00:00:19.393 --> 00:00:21.134
and see if you can survive.

00:00:21.134 --> 00:00:22.156
And this doesn't seem that hard,

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.617
I mean, I've watched an
entire episode of Dance Moms

00:00:24.617 --> 00:00:26.150
so I feel like I can get through

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.403
10 minutes of this.

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:29.493
Okay, so I've pulled it up
and I'm about to watch it.

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:31.560
So, here goes.

I can do this, it's like whatever.

00:00:46.438 --> 00:00:50.501
This may be the most annoying
thing I've ever watched.

00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.846
When Chris Rock dies and
tries to go to heaven

00:00:52.846 --> 00:00:55.284
God is going to pull this
shit up and be like uh-uh.

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.095
I can't even like, think right now.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:00:59.185

you because it's like

O. J. Simpson, although he got away

00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:09.523
with killing his wife,

00:01:09.523 --> 00:01:12.379
and then wrote a book
about, 'If I had done it'

00:01:12.379 --> 00:01:14.562
page one has a link to this video

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:16.443
because this would have killed anybody.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.438
I'm four minutes in, I'm
about to murder something.

00:01:19.438 --> 00:01:23.037
I can feel my earbuds
disintegrating right now.

00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:24.500
I would literally not be surprised if this

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.171
was Katy Perry's next single.

Oh my god.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.677
I feel like, if you want
to summon Bloody Mary,

00:01:37.677 --> 00:01:39.232
you say her name into
the mirror three times,

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.602
but if you wanna get rid of her,

00:01:40.602 --> 00:01:42.390
you just sing this one time.

It's not funny.

00:02:02.853 --> 00:02:05.152
My brain literally feels
like I want to itch it,

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:07.091

from Harry Potter coming into my world

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.306

with a lot of tongue.

We made it.

00:02:58.632 --> 00:03:01.575
I am ready to snap my iPad in half.

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:03.247
I feel like my blood pressure is fucking

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:05.539
through the roof, Madagascar 3.

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:06.700
So that was fun.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.395
I'm ready to fucking kill something.

00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:10.067
Um, yeah.

00:03:10.067 --> 00:03:12.366
So this week on Twitter
and Tumblr and Facebook,

00:03:12.366 --> 00:03:13.922
I asked you guys, what
are the most annoying

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:15.199
things in the world, and these

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.126
are some of my favorite responses.

00:03:17.126 --> 00:03:20.562
Wow, you guys, none of
this fucking compares

00:03:20.562 --> 00:03:22.257
to Circus Afro.

00:03:22.257 --> 00:03:23.929
So comment below, what is
the most annoying thing

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:24.997
in the world for you?

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:26.181
I am going to be picking some of my

00:03:26.181 --> 00:03:27.667
favorite responses and putting them

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.710
at the end of my next video.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.941
And last week, if you recall,

00:03:30.941 --> 00:03:33.124
I told you the story
of my worst hookup ever

00:03:33.124 --> 00:03:35.399
and I asked you what is the
worst thing that can happen

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.862
during the hookup, and these were some

00:03:36.862 --> 00:03:38.255
of my favorite responses.

00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:40.896
Wow, you guys, these are all reasons why

00:03:40.896 --> 00:03:42.452
I'm never going to leave my computer.

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:45.099
Because, really, I don't want
any of this to happen to me.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.980
So that is all I have
for you guys this week.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.651
I'm really stressed out, right now.

00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:50.184
Don't go watch Circus Afro,

00:03:50.184 --> 00:03:52.134
unless, I hate you, and then, please

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:54.526
go watch the hour version
of what I just watched.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:55.455
Okay, so have a good life,

00:03:55.455 --> 00:03:56.987
I will see you next Friday, Goodbye.
