00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.710
Building a gaming PC is great but not everyone
wants a giant tower below their desk. That’s

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.150
where the Fermion comes in with a smaller
chassis that still packs a punch. At the heart

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.360
of the build is an Intel Core i3-4160. With
a pair of Haswell cores running at 3.6 gigahertz

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.680
you’ve got plenty of power for gaming and
with Hyperthreading this works like a quad

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.630
core chip. It’s also power efficient which
is a big help when working with a smaller

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.960
PC. Alongside the Core i3 is an EVGA GTX 750Ti.
As the most powerful graphics card you can

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.970
get that doesn’t need external PCI power
the 750Ti is a solid choice for 1080p gaming

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.940
with two gigabytes of memory. It’s also
a smaller card which definitely makes installing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.980
it into our case a lot easier. For the motherboard
the Fermion is using an MSI B85-I. This is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.010
a Mini-ITX board that still has all the features
we need like USB 3.0, SATA 3 and nicely laid

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.780
out connections making it easy to work with.
On the memory side of things we have eight

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.739
gigabytes of Crucial Ballistix Sport. Clocked
at 1600 megahertz this is a single DIMM which

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.030
leaves room to expand to 16 gigabytes later
on and it’s low profile, again making it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.700
easy to install. See a trend here? With a
small and efficient build like this the Crucial

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.740
BX100 is perfect for storage. It’s a 250
gigabyte SSD that isn’t too much more expensive

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.580
than a normal hard drive while delivering
a huge boost in performance. Since we’re

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.820
working with an ITX build we’ve got a 300
watt Silverstone SFX power supply. 300 watts

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.280
is more than enough to power the Fermion and
this is small enough to easily fit inside

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.650
our case while delivering a solid 80 Plus
Bronze rating. The final piece of the build

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.950
is the Silverstone RVZ01, also known as the
Raven Z. This is capable of packing all of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.299
our hardware into a 14 liter case that isn’t
that much bigger than a console. It’s a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.869
bit tricky to work in however Silverstone
provide decent instructions on putting things

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.540
together. Having a cool looking gaming PC
is nice but how does the Fermion perform?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.909
Load up Grand Theft Auto 5 and things are
playable on Normal settings at 1080p at 49.6

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.349
frames per second.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.600
Move over to Shadow of Mordor and we can notch
the graphics up to High settings and we’re

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.740
getting over 44 FPS.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.280
With Metro: Last Light Redux we’re also
able to run things on High at 1080p at a solid

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.120
57 frames per second.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.520
Even under full gaming load the Fermion is
pretty easy on power compared to most gaming

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.750
PC builds and even the Xbox One and PS4. With
plenty of power for 1080p gaming inside a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.319
compact ITX chassis the Fermion is a solid
PC for gaming or even as a Steambox. As always

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.739
I’ll have all the links you need in the
description of this video. Anyway guys thank

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.719
you so much for watching and I will catch
you in the next one!
