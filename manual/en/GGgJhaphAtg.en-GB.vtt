00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.859
william bear from new hampshire was
appalled at a book that his 14-year-old

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.430
daughter was reading in school

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.440
she the ninth grade and one day his
friend was just looking to the book

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.480
and noticed I H part of it a passage

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.810
that was very sexually graphic and so
william bear was mortified was angered

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.710
by it because the school had never even
asked him permission

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.660
before allowing his daughter to read the
book now the book's title is ninety

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.640
minutes its by Jodi Picoult old

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.869
and it's about a school shooting and are
several parts of the book that discuss

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.010
graphic sex and interestingly enough

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.410
none other newspapers that cover the
story would print

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.930
the passage in question which he asked
them to do me having to do it yes

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.500
so he said that he wanted to publish it
and he wanted parents to read it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.280
you want to school administrators
treated as well in fact he said quote

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.800
I'd like to see them read this to see
them squirm

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.070
so I was very very curious with his
passage was

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.880
iPad 2 I'm great after after much
research I find out if I like I did good

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.310
yeah

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.750
okay so I want to read a few guys and it
is a little graphic but

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.119
you know it it talk about what he
described as a sexual assault

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.290
you guys will decide whether you
considers sexual assault and whether or

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.110
not it's too sexually graphic for
14-year-old student

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.320
so they talk about is sex scene between
Matt and Josie

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.610
he kissed her so hard that it hurt boom
she said pushing at him

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.009
relax Matt murmured and then he sank his
teeth into your shoulder he pinned her

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.490
hands over her head

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.520
and by the way these are teenagers and
ground his hips against hers

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.060
she could feel his erection hard against
her stomach it wasn't the way it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.159
normally was but Josie had to admit that
it was exciting

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.530
she couldn't remember ever feeling so
happy as a for heart were beating

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.649
between her legs

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.869
she clawed at matts back to bring him
closer

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.630
yeah he groaned and pushed her thighs
apart and then suddenly Matt was inside

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.719
her pumping so hard that she scooted
back word on the carpet

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.280
burning the backs of her legs wat Josey
said trying to roll away beneath him

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.530
but he clapped his hands over her mouth
and dragged ok what drove harder

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.310
and harder until Josie felt income
Siemens sticky and hot called on the

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.390
carpet beneath her

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.120
JD Pasadena yeah but kinda

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.430
before I comic I get kleenex corporate
it's a bit hesitant Jonny peco's books

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.879
are always about you know issues that
are

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.940
up to date and optical she rushes
written about the Holocaust and she's

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.580
trying to access an audience with

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.069
you know this was about this with this
novel I believe has to do with school

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.030
shooting yeah

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.080
during his youth thousand yeah and and
so that thats

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.670
a hand and one other thing here is the
school has always

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.830
asked parents advise parents before
doing this

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.300
that look for consent in in teaching
this book and eating this novel

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.150
I and this time they admit that they
forgot to ask the parents for permission

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.159
so it seems an innocent mistake because
they've done it all along this time they

00:02:59.159 --> 00:02:59.769
forgot

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.280
I get why this girl's father

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.670
was upset I totally understand why he's
upset I mean I think that a parent

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.400
should make a decision as to whether or
not their child should read a book like

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.730
this

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.489
yeah I think that it is graphic n the
thing is a fourteen

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.750
your daughter knows about fax: you know
she whereabouts at AXA hopefully she's

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.930
educated about the fact that she's not
living in an area where they're teaching

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.730
abstinence only education

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.830
because that usually gives her
misinformation but

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.730
I i still believe that a parent should
have the ability to make that decision

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.840
and he also made a really good case

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.909
four how the parents should be informed
on what this passage says

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.330
so it's one thing no give the parents a
form that says hey there might be some

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.290
sexual content

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.970
it's another thing to actually include
part in this passage the parents know

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:46.930
what they're getting

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.470
or what their child was gonna read here
and so I should know there was a school

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.280
board meeting

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.239
he showed up to it any had two minutes
to make his case against this book

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.680
he would over his two minutes and

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.349
he got in trouble for it ed since he was
getting a little loud and rowdy

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.310
Bay threatened to arrest him he's like
oh you can arrest me for going over two

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.680
minutes will then I guess you just gonna
have to arrest me

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.430
and a cop arrested him yet disorderly
conduct rightly can follow the rules a

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.269
meeting 'em

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.160
I would just the guy who was upset by
that time how this is gonna be about the

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.169
cut but not yeah

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.430
poppin dog up but its this guy's very
lucky right

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.840
the the guide is protesting this book is
very lucky that is because they wanted

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.009
daughter to see it

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:31.840
is lucky that his daughter doesn't have
access to the internet because then she

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.710
would be ruined

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.740
like I mean it's all over now you guys
but you know that was there

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.830
it he is but but but the rehearsal thing
as a parent and I'm

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.530
Jr has a a kid Jesus as a kid the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.169
there there something happens to you
were yes you know

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.419
I mean person you want to protect your
kid from everything yeah I know anything

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:50.790
yet

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.810
a sadly a mother in my son's class
passed away a couple weeks ago

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.160
I was talkin is another parents like all
that we didn't want to tell their kids

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.350
about it because

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.759
up the sadness so there's it the you're
constantly trying to predict because of

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:06.620
the internet because I'm so many threats

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.850
to that in a sense that you've been
nurturing all along that innocence is

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.210
always going to be lost

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.840
you just wanna hang on to it as long as
you can if you have a 14-year-old

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.330
daughter

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.190
your father and as Anna said she knows
what's going on yes she knows the score

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.590
yeah internet out there well you still
want to protect your daughter

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.669
even though the Internet's out there it
said it's a just a natural

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.630
your inclination I want to do that so I
haven't 0 problem with with what he did

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.610
you know it's not even

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.530
it's not censorship you know I don't
have you know no I'm not angry at the

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:34.990
guy

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.870
yeah I respect your instinct to want to
protect your kids really I guess

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.199
think that I mean I've feel for you you
know because it's a tough world out

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.080
because it's over

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.100
and it was a good talker art harris
tougher for a fact that was for their

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.620
parents at Saturday's other number over
now it's super overdue get on our

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.380
particular is your kid is access to the
Internet is over if that happens before

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.860
their ten or eleven right

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.720
so I don't know how you bring up the
kids today right I mean I don't know

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.100
what you do because

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.300
it is that that's the what are the tamer
things

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.470
that fourteen-year-old girls gonna
rewrite see but you're always taught

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.479
you're always as a parent I think and as
anyone as a society even

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.020
a time thinking about what is
appropriate what's you know is that okay

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.470
to

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.699
you know a forty-two came out the Jackie
Robinson movie and and and you know the

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:20.930
language in that movie

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.199
it was racially insensitive and and my
son was he that the time but really

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:26.850
wanted to see it loves baseball

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.870
so you have to know when it's
appropriate to show rammed

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.190
then eventually they're going to learn
that we all do eventually right this

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.060
girl is gonna be able to read a passage

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.110
that's far racier than what her father
protecting her from now

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.180
but that Dad never gonna have to be
involved at that level so now he has he

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.520
still hanging on to the

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.800
to the yes to my my quiz I think that
girl probably already

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.430
already has read things that are way
worse that for sure but not but her

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.490
father hasn't seen in

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.280
and I think the deaths and I think that
ball was when you're reading that

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.520
I was thinking like if you don't look at
it and make lemonade

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.810
finds over like this would be a great by
like %uh

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.610
Abu teachable moment maybe you know open
a dialogue with your daughter about sex

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.300
what's appropriate what's not

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.810
why did she feel excited when he pinned
her arms overhead what's that about

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.449
yeah what what what is that appropriate
to feel that way should I feel bad if

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.130
I'm excited when someone is overpowering
me sexual

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:23.650
you know this these are rare is the
father who so yeah their 14-year-old to

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.349
say why it feels good to pin your arms
over your head

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:29.639
I mean that's after she read that and
what what would you say nor that

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:32.550
police strike that from your memory oh
you don't let me say this is an

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:33.729
appropriate for you and I

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:36.949
and it's something I'm uncomfortable
with some other curious about it right

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.099
futures and should there are other ways
for her to explore that curiosity them

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:40.699
with her that

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.130
so in an ideal world I actually agree
with Jimmy on that like having a

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.530
conversation with your kids maybe not
about like why do you feel excited and

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.539
you know what what are you into sexually
I think that goes a little far

00:07:50.539 --> 00:07:54.500
but having a conversation about fax and
answering any type the question that she

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.440
might have

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.960
is definitely better than trying to hide
the material away from her

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:03.629
but before she read that I think that if
it is graphic or sexual in nature the

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:04.940
pair should be informed

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.750
and it she still under 18s he'd like to
make that decision
