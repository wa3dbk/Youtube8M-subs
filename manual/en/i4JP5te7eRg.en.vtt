00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.919
Hey, roses are red, violets are blue.

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:14.969
I've got a tip, just waiting for you.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.160
You know, I have to say, I absolutely adore
roses.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.000
I go crazy over, well, just about every single
variety.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.570
And my belief is that everyone ought to have
at least one rose bush near them all the time.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.570
They're so beautiful.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.430
They just make you smile.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.700
And so many of them are fragrant.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.680
And, you know, there's really a rose for every
place, unless you have absolute shade.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.110
Roses really need about 6 hours of sunlight
to perform.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.810
They can take more, but they need at least
6.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.280
And when you buy roses, think about what you
want out of them.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.280
If you want them for cutting and bringing
into the house, you may want to go with Hybrid

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.100
Tea's, with those big blooms.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.610
If you want something that's a big shrub rose
to fill a corner in your flower border, like

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.600
these, then you'll want to go for a shrub
rose.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.790
Many of those old fashioned shrub roses have
an incredible fragrance.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.000
And if you're looking for a rose to climb,
cause, you can see this one's already started.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.090
This is its first full year in this garden
and it's already produced almost 3 feet of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.900
growth, and it's still considered spring.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.840
It's going to shoot up and go all the way
to the top of this structure, which will be

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.780
in place to help hold it, even in the highest
winds.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.670
Roses, as long as they get good air circulation,
are great for growing on walls.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.670
But you want to make sure you do get a breeze
through there.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.790
Because you don't want fungus to build up
because that can cause things like black spotted

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.150
powdery mildew to occur on the leaves, and
cause them to defoliate.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.110
And my point is that there's a rose for everything.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.240
You can even grow a rose as a single tree,
like a patio plant.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.920
Perfect for a poolside container.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.200
And think about this: a rose as a ground cover.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.779
Now, this rose is only a couple of years old,
and just look at how it's doing in this space.

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:13.090
We got it on the middle grass that's just
coming out.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.989
As it warms up, it'll fill in more.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.359
I have these beautiful Supertunias here.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.140
And all three of these plants will sort of
fight it out.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.549
But look how dense and full this Drift Rose
is in terms of its foliage.

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.120
Won't get much taller than this, but it will
continue to spread.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.969
So it's a great way to cover the area in a
bed or in a garden.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.629
And just look at the blooms.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.319
It's only now beginning to flower.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.790
It's very exciting.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:53.030
