00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
Heavy weapon in a defilade below, I ain't got a shot.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.900
Panzer move. Parker! Targets 8 o'clock low!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.000
Parker: Shit!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
God grant me strength.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.200
C'mon. Displace

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200
C'mon!

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.600
(GI's screaming)

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.680
Cover Upham!

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.740
Cover!

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.660
Cover!

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.460
(GI screaming)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.680
Parker: I'm out of 30 caliber.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.020
Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teach my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.500
My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.620
My shield, and he in whom I trust;

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.120
Parker, get out!

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.440
(Explosion)
