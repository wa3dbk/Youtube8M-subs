Hi, my name is Dave Andrews. Today I'm going
to show you how to program a computer. There's

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.010
a lot of ways for beginners to break into
programming. Some people say you should use

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.800
Java, other people say you should use C . But
I'm going to show you how to use a programming

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.480
language called Python which I think is the
easiest for beginners who are getting started.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.470
To get going with Python, if you can see my
computer, basically just point your web browser

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:38.460
to Python.org. Now once you have Python installed,
let's write a simple program by clicking on

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.450
your start button, going to all programs.
Let's find Python two point six and just run

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:53.550
Python command line. Now this pulls up a simple
Python interpreter, meaning Python is an interpreted

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.520
language, and that means that it basically
figures out what it's going to do as it's

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.740
going over the line of code, as opposed to
being a compiled language which is compiled

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:08.369
into machine programming and just executed
natively. Let's type in a simple program here.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.119
I'm going to show you how easy it is to program
in Python. I'll say for i in range zero to

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.100
twenty, and this basically says create a variable
called i, and we're going to loop it from

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.619
zero to twenty. Therefore i will be zero,
then i will be one, then two, then three,

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.920
on up until twenty. Type a colon, and then
your enter. Now let's do a tab here, and we're

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:40.509
going to say print hello exclamation point
and make sure that's enclosed in quotation

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:51.489
marks. Then space. Say plus. And then a STR
for string. We're going to convert i to a

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:55.710
string, and that's what you have to do in
order to print it out with other text on the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:04.389
screen. Then another plus, and then say i
times twenty is equal to... let's close our

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:11.629
quote, then another plus. I'm going to say
string again, i times twenty, that asterisk

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.849
means multiplication. So basically we're going
to print out the text hello twenty times and

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.900
then the number that i currently is and then
multiply i times twenty and print out what

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.689
that is. I'm going to put a little space here
after my hello so we can read it a little

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:34.209
better. Say enter and say enter again. Now
i as you can see has looped from zero to twenty,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.340
and it's saying it didn't include twenty.
It's important to keep in mind. See i times

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.099
twenty is zero, if i is ten, then i times
twenty is two hundred. It just shows you how

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.841
easy it is to kind of crunch some numbers
in a programming language. Just search the

00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:56.530
internet for Python tutorials, you can find
a whole lot more interesting stuff than this.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.810
My name is Dave Andrews and I've just showed
you how to program a computer.
