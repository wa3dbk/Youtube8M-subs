00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.010
What's going on nation? Today I'm going to demonstrate for you guys how to do a dumbbell deadlift now

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.930
This is a great exercise for overall power and your strength. It's also great if you're going to switch it up

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.320
If you've been doing a lot of barbell deadlifting in you're lifting routines

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.170
now you might notice with the dumbbells a few different things

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.869
Okay

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.918
Number one you're going to stand with your feet while shoulder length apart

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.849
pointing toes out a little bit and when you hold the dumbbells you're not necessarily

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.430
holding them in front of you like this like you would hold the barbell you can hold a little bit off to the side

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.680
What that actually might help you with is

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.859
keeping your shoulder blades pinched now for this

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.010
Exercise what you're going to do is going to keep your shoulder blades pinched

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.109
The whole time keep your core nice and tight

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.200
Gonna keep your chest up and as you come down you want to try and

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.470
keep your heels under your hips okay you want to

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.760
Push through the heels and as you come up you want to thrust up with the hips okay?

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.599
So let me demonstrate for you how it's done. You get down just like this is the starting position

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.959
Chest up shoulder blades together, okay?

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.479
Breathe out on the way up. See how my hips are nice and deep I'm kind of sitting straight up like this

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.700
I'm gonna breathe out

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.059
Push the hips forward keep the shoulder blades pinched come down breathe in

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.939
See how the dumbbells are off to the side, they're not back here

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.769
They're still kind of forward but not directly in front like this. It's hanging off the sides of my knees

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.780
Let's do a couple more down. Down

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.390
one more

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.280
That's how you do a dumbbell deadlift. Hope you guys enjoyed this demonstration video and as always

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.249
More good stuff coming soon. See you guys
