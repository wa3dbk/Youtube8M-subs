Hello! On behalf of expertvillage.com, my
name is Bryan Pemberton from the Reserve at

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.849
Spanos Park and today we are going to talk
a little bit about grips in putting. Okay,

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
one of the traditional grips that we have
here is basically just your right hand underneath

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.830
your left. This would be for a right handed
golfer but you will notice on the grips, most

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.590
of the grips today will have a flat edge here.
Some will be a little more flat on the other

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.519
side but you will generally have a flat edge
here. What that does is it gets it so that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.190
your thumbs are on this particular part of
the grip and what that will do is it will

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.591
get this palm facing the target and this palm
facing away from the target. So this is a

00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:43.530
traditional grip right here. You can see he
has an overlapping finger here and again,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.090
it's not just a preference of what is more
comfortable. But basically whenever you are

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.840
getting a grip like this the main thing that
you want to do is you want to have the palms

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.260
together and this left palm will be leading.
Again this grip would be more of the conventional

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.130
grip where he's got his right hand below the
left hand and again, his palms would be facing

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.690
each other. This is more your traditional.
This grip right here is what we call a cross-handed

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.869
grip and again, this grip is just for preference
but you will notice that both the palms will

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.329
still be facing the target. What this grip
is really designed to do is actually keep

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:18.469
a player from breaking his wrist because this
is going to be a lot harder breaking the wrist

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.549
and in golf we want to kind of have this in
one piece and one motion. So cross-handed

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:27.479
grip basically keeps a player from breaking
his wrist like this. It is pretty hard to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.640
do it right now but again, that will keep
it a little bit more solid. That is pretty

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.280
much the only reason someone would use that
grip and again, it is not something that you

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.850
would go to and teach. You really find this
based on one of the elements. We talked about

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.520
this is a conventional grip in putting. Again
where the right hand is below the left hand

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.649
for right handed golfer with the palms facing
each other. One of the other grips we will

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.609
talk about and this is sort of a new thing
today what they call the clock putting. Again,

00:01:53.609 --> 00:02:00.130
what this does is it actually you have your
right hand separated from your left. Again

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.840
the back of his hand will be facing the target
and this hand is leading the putter. One of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.340
the things that makes this grip unique is
because you have your hands separated and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.390
it is a little bit different but it also keeps
the player from breaking his wrist. I would

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.030
say that this putting grip right here is evolved
from what we call a yeps of someone having

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.420
uncontrollable muscle spasms and not being
able to control their distance. Again this

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.250
will actually make a player have it a little
bit smoother and if you haven't tried this,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.170
it is a little bit different. It is a little
less conventional and it takes a little bit

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.140
of time to get used to it. There is a lot
of trust in this grip. A lot of players on

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.920
tour and a lot of good amateur players are
finding this as a good grip to use when they

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.720
are having problems with their distance and
some of their motor controls.
