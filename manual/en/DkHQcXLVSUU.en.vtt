[Opening jingle]

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.699
Assalaamu Alaikum and welcome to Titli's Busy Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.999
In Europe, many countries make Apple Pies without a top on so they're like an open tart.

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:23.209
In jolly old England, we know how to make a proper Apple Pie!

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:25.970
It goes a little something like this.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.960
For my Apple Pie, I've got 4 good-sized apples and I like to cook with Pink Lady.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.990
You may have your own favourite but that's fine. Choose whatever you like.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.880
I've got 500 g of pastry. This happens to be ready-made pastry but you could make your own too.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.220
4 tablespoons of raisins,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.230
2 tablespoons of sugar,

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.050
half a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of nutmeg,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.220
the juice of half a lemon and the grated rind for half a lemon.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:05.120
Begin by coring, peeling and slicing the apples.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.990
Put the apples in a large bowl. Add in the remaining ingredients

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.530
and mix well.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.590
Line an 8-inch pie dish with half of the pastry.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.570
Add in the pie filling.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.600
Now you might have to jiggle the pieces around to fit it all in

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.600
and with any luck, you might even end up with a few pieces left over. Hmm... hmm...

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.970
Add on the pie top.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:47.180
Crimp the edges of the pie with a fork or you can use a special pastry crimper if you've got one

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.230
and then trim away the excess pastry.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.960
I've made this cute pastry apple motif, just to remind me that it is in face an apple pie.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.380
I'm gonna brush the surface of the pie with some milk. This will help to give it a nice brown colour.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.829
Sprinkle well with caster sugar.

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:15.669
This will go into the oven at 200 degrees Celsius for 15 minutes.

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:23.969
After 15 minutes, turn the oven temperature down to a 170 degrees Celsius and let it cook for another 20 minutes.

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:27.339
Allow to cool before serving.

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.930
Lovely Apple Pie.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.340
Serve with pouring cream, ice cream

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.489
OR SQUIRTY CREEEAM !!

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.059
Yes. We, British, know a thing or two about Apple Pie.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:46.179
In fact, we know a think or two about a lot of things and there are many I'm too embarrassed to mention.

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:49.730
Join me next time in Titli's Busy Kitchen with me Titli Nihaan.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.549
Until next time... Khuda hafiz.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:01.779
