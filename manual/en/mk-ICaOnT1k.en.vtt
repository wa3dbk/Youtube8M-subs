This is Marie French with Expert Village again.
Here we are going to learn how to wire wrap

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.300
but the first thing you want to do on this
is you are going to take your wire cutters

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.830
and these are your wire cutters. You are going
to go ahead and you are going to cut the wire,

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:20.440
usually I go to about an inch and I am using
26 gage wire. It is sterling silver wire and

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.680
I'm using this wire because it is the one
size I can get through a lot of the different

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.769
gem stones. What I do is I cut a few strands
at an inch because I want to have them handy

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:37.120
when I am ready to wire wrap. Now after I
have cut this wire I go ahead and I take the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.370
gem that I am about to use and I'll stick
the wire through it and then I'll take it

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.010
to the piece I am connecting it with. I'll
again go through the section of the gem, chain,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:58.370
or charm that I am using, I'll bend the wire
over that charm. Now I'll take some round

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.259
nose pliers and I'll grab the end of the wire
and I'll wrap it around. Usually I use my

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.049
fingers just to start it, then I take the
round nose and I stick the nose of the plier

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:20.609
inside of that loop. Then I'll take a straight
nose plier and I'll wrap it so I'm actually

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:27.979
using two pliers. One to go through the hole
that I've now formed and another one to wrap

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.380
the wire. So I'll take the wrapping and I'll
move it around as many times as I can utilizing

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:46.549
my finger and the tool so then I get a nice
strong, secure wrap. Now what I'll do is I'll

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:56.029
connect the next side to here a pendant because
I want the pendant to be the focal point and

00:01:56.029 --> 00:02:02.479
here I'm finishing up this necklace, again
wrapping the wire around the piece, using

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.879
the small needle nose pliers and then wrapping
the wire, again two to three times around

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.379
and then tightening it so that I have a nice
secure wrap.
