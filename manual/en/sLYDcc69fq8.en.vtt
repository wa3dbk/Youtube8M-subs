00:00:00.529 --> 00:00:07.529
Happy 2013!, but first... Check out this sweet hoodie!   And on with the cold starts!

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.519
Alright, Burger King anyone?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.180
(engine starting)

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.180
Ah, look at the snow!

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:10.070
I'm not worried about this thing starting.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.660
Whop, I need to remember to turn that thing off.
-Is it recording now?
-Yep

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.070
(and shaking)

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.070
That wait-to-start light is staying on for a long time.  It must know it's cold out.  (beeping)

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.670
Well, this is kinda hill-run(ish) but,

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.890
the...uh...

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.830
start buttons are actually right behind the frame, there, but that's ok.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.869
I can reach up behind here and hit em'

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.270
pushing the... uh.. pre-heat button

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.510
as soon as I find it.  

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.150
So you have to hit the pre-heat button on this thing

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.920
Its a diesel.  I am yet to.. uh...hook up the... uh...that's what this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.079
conn-wiring harness is for... the uh...

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.349
remote star option, which I am 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.149
going to hook up still

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:19.540
Anyway...you hit this preheat and it actually circulates fuel,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.779
primes itself and...uh..does the pre-heat too.

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:27.359
Hmmm, I haven't been counting but we'll see if it will...uh..fire up.

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:34.059
The exhaust points straight down.  

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:37.059
Whop.

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.599
Let me hit the pre-heat again.  

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.209
It doesn't sound like it's got enough fuel up into it.  

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.209
Yeah,  (exhaust) right all over me.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:12.039
Alright, my little "TC".

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:24.339
Hey this thing's a good little running machine.  It hasn't started in over a year.  Wow.

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:36.579
Alright, now you guys can't be mad at me yet...

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:39.089
Is it a gas or is it a diesel?

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.319
Alright, this is horrible light quality, but I 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.319
don't have any lights in here.  I'm gonna start this generator first.  

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.180
Let's find some buttons--there we go.  

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.339
Hold that button.  Thats for the uh...the glow plugs.

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:04.339
Its a Cummins-Onan generator. I don't even know what size this thing is.  

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.739
(engine starting)

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.699
Alright, it's dark, but lets give this baby a start.  

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:26.690
What do you guys think?  Gas or Diesel?

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.749
Well, what do you think?

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:37.749
Intake heater?  (beeping)

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.380
Geez, I might have some time to go eat something first.  

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:08.380
Oh, there we go.  

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.770
Yeah, its a meow-meow.  

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:13.630
Only these d*** things 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.660
take that long to warm up.  

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.279
I need to put some seats in this thing- Its a seven-window.  

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:31.279
Alright, now you guys can be mad.  

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:35.099
Uh-oh.  Alright, this thing hasn't been started

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.240
in at least a month

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.939
I don't know if the battery is any good in it.  

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.300
See, it doesn't have that

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:47.559
rubber thing on the knob, this thing's got a round air brake knob.  

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:48.949
(beeping)

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:54.860
Turn that off...Ooo, voltage is looking kinda low.  I don't know if this one's gonna go or not.  

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.860
The voltage is over there, see.  It's like nine and a half, that thing says.  

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:04.419
Oh, now that thing pops over.  

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.050
(beeping)

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.050
Alright, lets see if it goes.  

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.530
Whoof.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.930
We'll 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.520
try that again.  

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.400
(beeping)

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.000
May have to get out the jumper cables with this thing.  

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.889
(beeping)

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.280
Not liking the cold weather, are you?

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.169
(beeping)

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.740
It's probably pissed off that it's being neglected.  

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.629
(beeping)

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:45.399
(beeping)

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:49.639
Whop, yeah...gonna have to jump this one.  

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.909
Man, I'm getting tired of doing this.  Jumper cables...

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:56.389
Alright, jumper cabled up.  Lets see what this thing does.  

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.270
(beeping)

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.029
(beeping)

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:03.090
Well, we're not really reading any more volts, maybe 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.469
a little more.  

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:05.330
(beeping)

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.639
(beeping)

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.059
(beeping)

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:22.059
Alright, lets try that.  

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.679
Well looky there.  Its a runnin' machine!  Its really cranking the amps down.  

00:07:32.679 --> 00:07:37.599
Hey, the idle adjust actually works in this thing.  You push this little button here  

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:40.320
and tone down the idle.  

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.180
Or if you want, crank the idle up.
