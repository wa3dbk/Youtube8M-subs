Hi, I'm Bobby crispy this video is part of my guitar lesson series

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.859
So today, I'll try how to play the theme from the x-Files TV show

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.880
So I'll play the parts first then show how to play [it] note for [note] using tabs

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.729
Okay to start with I'll start off with the spread here

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.429
Which is played sort of separately right through the main theme, [okay]?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:40.049
Okay, so first of all you're heavy on the delay and the [reverb] on the [app] try to get as much as you can

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.819
So okay, so it's the fourth string seventh fret

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.489
Third string fifth fret

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.110
first string

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.239
Open first string open

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.989
in the second string

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.780
sixth fret

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.260
leather notes ring

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.959
Now you can either pick a note separately yeah each one at a time or I can just use [your] pick in the fingers

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.619
[so] okay, and now for the main melody. I'll play it first

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.060
you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.810
you

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.229
you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.799
Okay, it's almost like a bit of a d chord so you start off on the third string second fret

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.860
first string open

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.990
second string Third fret

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.290
first ring open

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.360
first string third fret for stringer

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.510
Okay, that's part 1

00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:00.219
Part 2 is exactly the same except for playing the first string third fret you play the first string fifth fret

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.170
so once again for third string second fret

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.739
first string open

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.979
thirds sorry second string Third fret

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.160
first ring open

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.910
first string fifth fret

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.959
First you know

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.110
Okay, next part is this

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.650
Which is the first string 8th fret so 5th?

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.190
[second] [Sweeney]

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.850
first string fifth fret

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.880
over

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.340
[let's] part 3 part

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.559
4 is exactly the same as part 3 but instead of playing

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.659
first string 5th fret you play the first string 7th row, so it's

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.639
So once again first [string] 8th

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.849
7th 5th

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.169
second-string eight

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.289
[four] string seventh fret

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.690
for shingle

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700
So you go back?

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.790
part 1 again

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.680
Do that again?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.220
Okay, have to again

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:59.930
- and you play the last two notes again

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.860
for string fifth fret

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.860
first [finger]

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.489
Okay, and that's the theme to the x files. [I] hope you have film this pitar [less] [than] helpful and thanks for watching
