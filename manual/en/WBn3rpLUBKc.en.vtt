00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:53.700
Things required

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.300
Let's begin

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:10.100
Take two square sheets of paper and fold it into half

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.700
Again fold it into half

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:52.200
Fold along the diagonal to form a crease

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:33.600
Make a leaf shape with crease as center

00:02:41.400 --> 00:03:00.900
Cut it along the leaf

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.500
Open the leaf

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.500
Place upper layer petals in between the lower layer

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:43.800
Cut 4 slits of different widths

00:04:44.100 --> 00:05:00.300
Roll the slits to form the inner petals

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:50.800
Put the inner petals inside one another

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:20.000
Paste the petals

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:39.000
Paper flower is ready
