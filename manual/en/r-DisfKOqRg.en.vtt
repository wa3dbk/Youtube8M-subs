Hello, and welcome to this video about Frotcom.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Are you finding it difficult to manage your fleet of vehicles?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Are fuel costs rising, or becoming unmanageable?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Is the efficiency of your work force in decline?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Do you find customer complaints on the rise because of missed or late deliveries?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well, Frotcom is an all inclusive solution to these problems.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.500
Basic features include:

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Vehicle tracking

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Reports

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Alarms

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and cost management.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Additional features, available as options in Frotcom, include:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Fuel level and fuel consumption control

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.000
Engine speed and temperature control

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Driver tachograph control

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.500
Integrated navigation and 2-way messaging

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Automatic driver identification

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Door open sensors

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and Temperature sensors

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The system is very scalable and is perfect for tracking large fleets of vehicles

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.500
or just a single vehicle.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
All of these done simultaneously and from the convenience of one single user interface

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
So let's take a look and see how Frotcom works.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.500
An onboard device calculates the location of the vehicle from GPS satellite signals.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The device then sends this information onto receivers

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which then pass it on to the Frotcom Data Center

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.000
And the Information is then uploaded to the Cloud.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
From there, it gets sent down to users

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.000
who can access the information easily via their PCs or Smartphones.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
It really is that simple

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.500
As an example of how Frotcom can help you, let's take a look at our yellow truck.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Without Frotcom, we have no way of knowing where it is, what route is using,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.500
and we can't predict whether or not it will arrive on time to its destination.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.000
If we take our blue Frotcom truck, we can access all of this information quickly and easily, using the Frotcom interface

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Insuring its route is the most efficient one available and that it's being executed according to plan.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.500
Unfortunately, sometimes delays are unavoidable.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But at least with Frotcom the fleet manager can be alerted of delay

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and then pass this information on to the customer.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.500
For any unwanted intruders, Frotcom is able to alert the fleet manager,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.500
if for example, there is any unauthorized access to the rear door of the vehicle

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If itÂ´s stolen you can track it down immediately

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Frotcom is used in road transportation, overnight courier services, logistics and distribution, as well as sales forces and field services, construction machinery and vehicle renting, among many others.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
All tracking data and alerts are accessible via the Frotcom interface, on a PC or Smartphone.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Frotcom's efficiency and simplicity make it a very popular solution for intelligent vehicle tracking. Here are some of the current regions of the world where Frotcom is being used right now.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.000
