Hi, I'm Trevor, with Monster Pest Control.
We're located in American Fork, Utah. We're

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:13.161
talking about how to rid your home of insects.
The topic, is 5 ways of getting rid of termites,

00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:19.689
or helping your house be rid of termites.
Most importantly, is an inspection. When you

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.300
do an inspection, have a professional come
out. Check the house, to make sure any of

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.929
the wood has not been eaten. Generally, in
areas that are open, such as this, that we

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:38.660
can see what's going on. Another way, is making
sure when you come down, like down to the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.630
floor areas, that you're checking to see if
there's any frass, or markings from termites,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:54.030
and those markings generally will look like
dirt, brought up along the edge, and they

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.990
flare out, and that's where the colony is
basically hanging out, and being inside the

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:07.259
wood, wood to earth contact. Here, well basically,
we have wood against concrete, which is fine,

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.500
which we'll take outside in just a moment,
to show you about making sure you have no

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.060
wood to earth contact. Moisture is a killer,
also for homes and termites, is making sure

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.470
that everything is dry. Utility rooms, washer
and dryer, all your plumbing, make sure you

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.409
don't have any drips. Those can cause termites
to come into the house. Now, let's go outside

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.450
and take a look out there, to see some other
ways of getting rid of termites. We're outside

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.780
now. We're still talking about the termites,
and a couple of things to watch out for. When

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.841
you walk around your home, make sure you have
no wood to earth contact, where the wood is

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:48.490
basically touching the dirt, right up against
your home. Also, if you notice here, someone

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.530
has put this piece of wood here, so when the
water doesn't splash down on to the house,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.540
which is another problem too, is as water
gets onto this wood, termites are going to

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.090
come up and eat this wood, so always make
sure you remove these kinds of items, away

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:11.180
from the house, as far away as you can. No
wood piles next to the home. Those can cause

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.879
termite issues and problems. Water is an issue
on the outside. Make sure you have no pooling

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:22.519
water. The earth is dug out right here, that
you can actually get, and pool that water,

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:33.629
which can be a real problem. Termites do an
estimated, over what fire, flood, damage,

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:40.099
in one year, and one termite colony could
eat this whole piece of wood, in about six

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.460
to eight months, time frame, so make sure
that you have it always inspected. Treat it

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.830
if necessary, and when you treat it, make
sure you have a qualified company to come

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.020
out, treat the house. They'll use what they
call a trench and rod. They'll trench along

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.379
the house, and treat down into those areas.
Slabs, they'll drill the slabs, put the material

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.440
down underneath where the slab is, and treat
that. A lot of times you can actually do a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.329
partial treatment, which is when you find
termites in one area of your home, you can

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.850
have just that area treated, and that will
generally take care of any problems or issues,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.650
that you have, depending on what state or
what location your home is in.
