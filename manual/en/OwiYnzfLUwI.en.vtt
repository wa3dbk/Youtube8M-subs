00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is one of the most beautiful mummies

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.000
that, actually, I discovered at Saqqara only few months ago.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:24.000
We went inside the burial chamber and we found this mummy completely by accident.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.000
The tomb is dated to the Old Kingdom, about 4200 years ago.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.000
But I never expected to discover inside the Old Kingdom tomb

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.000
a typical Late Period mummy.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.500
It's very important to talk about mummification to explain really what happened.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
When the deceased die, they take his body to wash.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.000
And after the washing they began to open the stomach

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.000
they take all the viscera of the king,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.000
everything inside his stomach they picked out.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And they put it on natron to dry.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.000
And after that they covered them with linen and they put them inside [abacks].

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
After that they leaved the heart in the body,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.000
because the heart is a place of knowledge,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.000
it gives knowledge to the deceased in the afterlife.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.000
But they take the brain, because if you leave the brain inside the mummy, t

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.000
he brain can be damaged.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.000
And this why they go through the nose

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.000
and they insert some thin material inside

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.000
and they take the brain out.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.500
After that they take the body and they closed everything open

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
in the body of the deceased like his nose,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.000
like areas inside here.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.000
And after that they completely clean and wash the body,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.000
completely with wine that was made of dates.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.000
And they put the wine made of dates inside the body.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.000
Why did they do all of that?

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.000
Why the Egyptians mummified the body like this?

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.000
Because they believed in the afterlife.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.000
They believed, they had to preserve the body for a long time,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.500
because this time inside the tomb is for the eternal life.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.000
The Egyptians did all of this because of their belief in the afterlife.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.000
And that's why building a tomb,

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.500
mummification built Ancient Egypt.
