[MUSIC]

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:07.911
&gt;&gt; T.V. Reporter: This just in,
for some unexplained reason,

00:00:07.911 --> 00:00:11.207
a large number of known heroes
have turned to a life of crime.

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:13.902
While many villains
are suddenly being good.

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:18.738
&gt;&gt; Batroc the Leaper: Hazul, haha, we hug.

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:21.816

00:00:21.816 --> 00:00:23.624

&gt;&gt; Modok: I'm trying to help you.

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:36.271
Be thankful, ow ow ow quit it.

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.682
&gt;&gt; Titanium Man: Titanium Man thinks
old mural could use little touching up.

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.700
Oh Smoey, heh heh.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:50.122
No matter, Titanium Man will
simply be removing his hand.

00:00:50.122 --> 00:00:53.091
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Gremblin: Ow, ow stop!

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:53.904
&gt;&gt; Batroc the Leaper: Free hug?

00:00:53.904 --> 00:00:58.648
&gt;&gt; Titanium Man: [NOISE] If anyone asks,
Titanium Man was

00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:02.817
here playing on swing set all day.

00:01:02.817 --> 00:01:04.316
&gt;&gt; Puck: Oh ho ho ho.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:06.931
Another victim of the atomic wedgie, eh.

00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.107
It's so fun being bad.

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:12.236
&gt;&gt; Batroc the Leaper: Sacre blue
what is the meaning of this?

00:01:12.236 --> 00:01:15.391
&gt;&gt; Hawkeye: We used to be good, and
now we're bad, is that really so

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.439
hard to understand?

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.784
&gt;&gt; Batroc the Leaper: Enough,
we are the hero's now.

00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:22.308
[LAUGH] So, prepare to die.

00:01:22.308 --> 00:01:25.502
&gt;&gt; Tigra: No, no, no, see,
hero's don't kill, that's against the law.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:27.509
&gt;&gt; Modok: No killing?

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.721
But that's literally the only
thing I was made for.

00:01:31.721 --> 00:01:35.454
&gt;&gt; Batroc the Leaper: Okay, and
then we will, what do heroes do, ah,

00:01:35.454 --> 00:01:40.994
we will beat you all up and then put you
in very complicated and specific prison's.

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:43.021
&gt;&gt; Speaker 9: I think not Frenchy,

00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:45.716
while you were doing good
deeds all around the city.

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:47.163
I took the liberty of stealing and

00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.878
shrinking down SHEILD's
most powerful weapon.

00:01:49.878 --> 00:01:54.260
And with it we will destroy the, oh crap.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.103
Oh you guys, nobody move okay.

00:01:57.103 --> 00:01:59.094
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: Pathetic.

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:01.503
&gt;&gt; Batroc the Leaper: The Punisher.

00:02:01.503 --> 00:02:06.162
&gt;&gt; Hawkeye: Okay you're not exactly good
or bad, so who's side are you on now?

00:02:06.162 --> 00:02:09.255
&gt;&gt; The Punisher: Same side as usual,
my side.

&gt;&gt; Vanos: Oh, no!

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.238
What is this?

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:26.223
All of my best chums, in distress!

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:28.209
Let Vanos help you all.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.623
Please, my friends, my Vanos copter
is parked around the corner, and

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:34.907
I'll help you all get better, and
then we'll go for jelly donuts.

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:35.925
How does that sound?

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.314
Oh, [LAUGH] Modok, you look bad.
