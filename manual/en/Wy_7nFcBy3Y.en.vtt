00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.740
Today, we are in the city of dreams "Mumbai"

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.114
With us today we have  

00:00:37.114 --> 00:00:40.094
the current media sensation Raju's , mother  

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.080
So mother, did you ever think that

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.020
 your son would become this famous overnight?  

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.300
In my wildest of dreams also i never imagined

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.160
 that my Raju     

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.220
 would become such a famous person

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.040
So you finally came

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.460
You are late again Raju

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.040
I have told you many times to find some decent work

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.820
 still you go wandering on the streets  wearing your fathers old, tattered clothes.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.900
Are you even listening to me?

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.380
Wait! 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.900
You will not understand like this

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.560
Move

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.940
This charade ends today,  

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.320
your father left me with a debt and two kids, 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.360
atleast think about your sister,  if not yourself.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.380
Eh! 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.140
Move away !!!!

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.060
As a journalist

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.880
I have seen many real life heroes stories in my career

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.040
on the cover page 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.820
Courtesy of being in this profession for a long time,  

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.280
even I became a part of sensationalism, somewhere along the way 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.140
 In today's society,     

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.620
where in the name of religion and social service,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.880
the common man is being cheated, 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.380
Raju, is a revelation 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500
because without worrying about personal gain,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.700
he makes an earnest request 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.120
for us to find an escape 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.980
from our daily stressful life. 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500
Despite all his problems, 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
he has taught us how to live life to the fullest 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.020
You guys must be wondering 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.300
as to what was written on the chits

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.720
those small small things 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.660
that make us smile, 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.640
but we often forget 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.020
due to the rigours of our daily life and gets left behind.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.540
Today, everyone talks about change

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.260
but the question is, 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.860
how can one man instigate that change on his own.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.160
Raju has made a start

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.700
his small idea is now spreading all around

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.440
Every city and every village, 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.440
is giving rise to a Raju 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.980
who earnestly wants to try and bring a smile to everyone's face. 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.280
This proves that 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.080
to change the world, all that is required 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.980
is thought and courage, 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.120
courage to face the adversity,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.120
and courage to overcome obstacles.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.460
So come and inspire change

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.100
 after all change begins with    

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.100
US!
