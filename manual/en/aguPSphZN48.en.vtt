00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:04.400
- GIVEN THE COMPLEX NUMBER 
IN POLAR FORM Z = 2

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.600
x (COSINE PI/6 + "I" SINE PI/6),

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.167
WE WANT TO FIND Z TO THE 5th 
POWER USING DE MOIVRE'S THEOREM.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.633
WELL, DE MOIVRE'S THEOREM 
IS STATED HERE BELOW.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:18.633
IF WE HAVE A COMPLEX NUMBER 
GIVEN IN POLAR FORM,

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.100
AS WE SEE HERE,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.233
THEN Z TO THE Nth POWER IS 
EQUAL TO R TO THE Nth

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:29.767
x COSINE OF N x THETA 
+ "I" SINE OF N x THETA.

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:33.900
SO FOR OUR EXAMPLE, 
NOTICE THAT N = 5.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.500
SO WE'LL HAVE Z TO THE 5th 
= R TO THE 5th

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:53.133
OR 2 TO THE 5th x COSINE OF 5 
x PI/6 + "I" SINE 5 x PI/6.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.733
WELL, 2 TO THE 5th = 32,

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:08.907
AND WE'LL HAVE COSINE OF 5PI/6 
+ "I" SINE 5PI/6.

00:01:08.907 --> 00:01:11.340
NOW, TO DETERMINE THESE 
TRIG FUNCTION VALUES,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.773
LET'S GO AHEAD 
AND USE A UNIT CIRCLE.

00:01:17.207 --> 00:01:20.273
HERE'S 5PI/6 RADIANS.

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:24.707
SO THE COSINE FUNCTION VALUE IS 
-SQUARE ROOT 3 DIVIDED BY 2

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:29.340
AND THE SINE FUNCTION VALUE 
IS 1/2.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.440
SO WE HAVE -SQUARE ROOT 3

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.140
DIVIDED BY 2 + "I" x 1/2 
OR 1/2I.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.507
NOW, WE'LL DISTRIBUTE. 
32 IS DIVISIBLE BY 2.

00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:50.740
SO THIS WILL SIMPLIFY 
TO -16 SQUARE ROOT 3 + 16I.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.473
SO THIS WOULD BE 
OUR COMPLEX NUMBER

00:01:55.473 --> 00:02:00.013
RAISED TO THE 5th POWER 
USING DE MOIVRE'S THEOREM.

00:02:00.013 --> 00:02:02.080
I DO WANT TO SHOW HOW TO DO THIS 
EXACT SAME PROBLEM

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.313
USING THE EXPONENTIAL FORM 
OF A COMPLEX NUMBER GIVEN HERE.

00:02:06.313 --> 00:02:07.513
SO IF THAT INTERESTS YOU,

00:02:07.513 --> 00:02:09.480
PLEASE FOLLOW THE LINK 
ON THE SCREEN.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.680
I HOPE YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
