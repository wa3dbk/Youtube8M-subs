Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today’s Mini Tute, I’m gonna

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:14.740
show you how to make my Lietz Teardrop blend,
and it’s an easier and faster way to do

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.740
the skinner blend.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.930
Now, if you have ever bought a tutorial from
me that has a blend in it, you’ll already

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.839
know how to do the teardrop blend, and here’s
some examples of some of the tutorials that

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.619
I do the teardrop blend in.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:36.120
Now this is a bead made with the Easter lily
cane, here are the Sweet Pea earrings.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.890
Now, this one’s more obvious, you can see
the blend in it, and this is from the Frosted

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.130
Rainbow Flower beads tutorial.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.830
Then I’ve got some Cone Flower beads here,
and I used the teardrop blend in that as well,

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:58.250
and the Parrot Tulip cane bead, so that’s
all of them where we used a lot of the teardrop

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.250
blends.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.570
Now, in some previous videos, I showed you
how to do blends in another way.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.810
The first one I showed you how to do the Stepped
Graduated blend, and this is where you mix

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.299
each color individually, and then you blend…
have them go side by side...and then you give

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.340
the illusion of having a blend from one color
to the other, now it’s quite a labor intensive

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.499
way of going about it and it’s difficult
to have a very smooth transition between,

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:32.689
color to color.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.479
Then Judith Skinner came along and took a
more scientific approach to doing the blends…now

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:45.709
I did a video on this as well, where you take
triangles of White and Black…I used in this

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:50.149
blend here, but you can use any colors that
you like, and the way it’s blended together,

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.640
you get a much smoother blend, and it’s
way simpler.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.039
With two colors, it’s quite simple to do
a Skinner blend with, but when you’re working

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:06.459
with more than one color, doing a multicolored
rainbow blend like this one here, it can get

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:12.150
a little bit tricky, you have to kinda bring
out your old geometry skills to get it…to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.500
make the blend.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.700
What you have to do is you have to precondition
your clay, roll out sheets, and then cutout

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.590
triangles that fit together properly and in
fact there’s even a template out there so

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.860
that you can actually trace out the right
size pieces to make your blend work easily.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.840
I figured out a way to make the blend that
looks…here’s the blend that I got from

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.840
the skinner blend, but here’s the same blend
done again using a much simpler method I figured

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.280
out years ago called the Teardrop blend, and
we just use some teardrop shaped pieces of

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.540
clay to get the same blend in a much easier
fashion.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.890
Now, let me just explain to you how this kinda
came to be.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.780
I was sitting around, rolling some clay in
my hands, trying to come up with something

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.400
new to do…you know, I always do that…

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.430
I’m playing around, and I had made a bunch
of teardrop shapes, and the way to do that

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.350
is you take a ball of clay and then you just
make a V out of your hands and you get a teardrop

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:18.350
shape.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.690
Well, I’d done up a bunch of these shapes,
and I had a couple laying on the desk next

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:33.580
to each other, opposite like that, and when
I looked at it, I realized that these were

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:42.010
two triangles, much like the Skinner blend
is, and I realized that I could take these,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.100
and squash them down just like this…and
I’ll flatten them a bit to start, and if

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.040
I take a roller, and flatten them out so that
they can fit into the pasta machine, I’m

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.850
gonna have something that will resemble the
triangles in a Skinner blend.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.960
So I’m just gonna run these through here
first, and when I fold it in half, and keep

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:12.100
running this through, it makes exactly the
same kind of blend that you get with the Skinner

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.420
blend.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:21.090
Now, the other thing that I discovered is
that you can speed up the whole process if

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.200
you roll it up instead of folding it, now
I’m just rolling it up from this one end,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.920
and what this essentially does is instead
of folding it just the one time, you get several

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.560
folds all at the same time, and it forces
the colors together to blend really quickly.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:46.220
Now, normally a Skinner blend takes about…I
don’t know, depends on how soft your clay

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.190
is and the brand and all that, but it can
take like 40 times for the colors to start

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:59.840
blending properly, but with the teardrop blend
and this rolling up process, it can be a lot

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.250
faster, so let me just do a few more here
and show you.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:14.550
Okay, so now I’ve done that about 15 times
in total, and now we’ve got a nice blend

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.240
that’s happening, now I can go a few more
times if I wanted it to be a little bit smoother,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.490
but you can see that it’s a much simpler
way of going about it.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.780
Now, if you’re doing a multicolor blend,
like this one here, all you need to do is…

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.790
you don’t have to worry about measuring
and all that stuff, you just choose the colors

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.139
that you want in the blend, and make teardrops
of them and put them side by side however

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:44.900
number you want, so you’d end up...and then
just blend it the same way, and you get these

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.970
wonderful multicolored blends.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:53.240
Now you can also control the colors… if
you want a large blend, then you use larger

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.730
amounts of… like larger balls to start off
with…with the teardrops, if you want a small

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.500
one, you can even go right down to super tiny,
like this one here, to just do a little test

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.900
sample, now, try doing that with a Skinner
blend, you would never be able to do a tiny

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.860
little skinner blend that tiny, and what’s
great about it is you can test it out to see

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.230
how your colors are gonna blend before you
have…so that you’re not wasting large

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.420
amounts of clay.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:26.480
Now, you can also control the… if you have
a color like this Fuchsia here that’s a

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.820
little bit more dominant, or has a little
higher saturation, I just made smaller balls

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.330
of the Fuchsia than I did of the other two
colors and then it made a proper blend at

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.480
the end.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.680
So I hope that was helpful for you, click
that like button if it was that would be really

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.980
great, we’d really appreciate that.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.290
And today, instead of a question, I have a
challenge for you, what I’d like you to

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:57.169
do is go grab your favorite colors of Polymer
clay and go make yourself a teardrop blend,

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:02.170
then I want you to come back and tell us how
it went, we’d love to hear your stories

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:04.480
