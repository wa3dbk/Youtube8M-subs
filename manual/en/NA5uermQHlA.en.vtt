Czajnikowy.pl - a good cup of tea!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.990
Hello and welcome in another episode of Czajnikowy.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.990
Today we will talk about the energy of teas and also how they should be matched to seasons of the year.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.990
Stay with us.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.990
Tips and opinions, yerba mate

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Tests, brewing tea

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.990
According to Chinese medicine, tea has a wide range of applications.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.990
It's worth mentioning it also has a particular energy that impacts the human body.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.990
In the West medicine certainly doesn't pay too much atention to it

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.990
but the Chinese medicine is actually based on the flow of energy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Here we're also at Taoistic philosophy, which believes there is Yin and Yang in humans.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.990
That there is Yin and Yang in the whole world which means opposites,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.990
you've certainly seen this picture, very characteristic two interweaving teardrops,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.990
making a circle. Yin and Yang, which is female or male energy,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.990
good and bad, hot and cold, simply speaking, opposites.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.990
It says there's also yin and yang in humans and we need to balance it to be healthy.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Yang means everything that's warm, everything that's growing and developing and light,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.990
while Ying is everything that's cold, wet, astringent, and negative, in general. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's impossible to remove one of these energies, none of these elements can be removed,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.990
balance is important, which is the line that separates these two drops on that sign.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.990
And we should try to stick to this line as well as possible.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.990
So when it's becoming cold outside, we should provide ourselves with warm energy,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.990
but when it's hot outside, we should cool down inside.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.990
Of course it's very complicated, many books have been written on this subject,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.990
the whole cuisine according to five changes is based on on it, among others.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.990
So without sticking to details, which tea should we drink?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.990
Well, for hot summer green tea is recommendable.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.990
It has rather cold energy, closer to Yin than to Yang

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
so it balances our energy flow in such a way that it cools us down and then we reach Yang which means we warm up.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.990
When it's winter, however, we need more Yang, so we must drink something warming up

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.990
that would reduce the excess of Yin or coldness.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.990
For this purpose, in winter we should drink black tea. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.990
It's somehow along with the stage of the fermentation, 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.990
there's higher fermented tea with warm energy and lower fermented one which has cooler energy.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.990
Very important seasons of the year are spring and autumn because winter and summer are very clearly defined

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.990
It's just hot and cold, while the the times of change are very important for us 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because here, for example, Chinese medicine recommends undergoing surgeries that are going to improve our health then.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.990
In the time when there is not too much Yin and not too much Yang. Everything changes and is temporary.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Here in autumn we should drink Oolongs, while surprisingly, in spring aromatized teas are recommended, with an additon of flowers.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.990
Obviously the Chinese didn't know aromatized teas the way we know them today

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.990
I mean with extraordinary additions, it was most usually jasmine, rose, chrisantemum or just any types of flowers. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.990
They help us wake up from the winter sleep, let me say metaphorically.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
However, in autumn we should drink Oolongs that help us fall asleep and hibernate into winter so to speak. 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.000
help us gather a lot of energy, warm energy, and let us switch from summer time to winter one, in energetic sense.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
So for autumn, we definitely recommend Oolong. Of course not only us but also the whole Chinese folk medicine.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
That's all for now, see you in our next episodes and on our website, Czajnikowy.pl
