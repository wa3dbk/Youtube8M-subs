00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.710
CAIRN: Stop fooling around.  

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.370
We gotta get in line for TS’s autograph.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.130
LOUISE: I’m supposed to meet Victoria, 
over here.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.500
CAIRN: I don’t care about Vicki
 right now. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.910
I’m gonna finally meet TS.  

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.420
I’m gonna ask her why she never 
responds to me online. 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.280
PHOTOGRAPHER: Proceed

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.950

VICTORIA: Where are you going?

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.130
CAIRN: Look out, Vicki.
I gotta hurry…TS is signing autographs.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.030
VICTORIA: That’s one hour away. 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.320
I’ve already found her…

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.690
CAIRN: Really?

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.090
VICTORIA: Follow me.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.580
LOUISE: That’s a really nice costume
Victoria!

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.580
VICTORIA: Thank you Louise.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.460
CAIRN:  We can’t go in there, 
I didn’t buy the VIP package.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.540
VICTORIA: And, why wouldn’t you...
you’ve waited all year for this 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.000
and instead of going first class, 
you buy “Coach”?  

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.460
CAIRN: VIP tickets only get you one extra 
autogra...

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.680
LOUISE: There’s no one guarding the
door

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.250
let’s go in!

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:57.130
*Door opens*

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.430
TS: Who would you like this made out to?

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.960
LOUISE: Her name’s Cairn

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.420
*Scribbling*

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.150
TS: Here you go. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.960
Anything for you?

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.060
LOUISE: No, thank you.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.940
TS: Wanna give me a call?

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.040
*suspenseful music*

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.740
LOUISE: Thank you, TS!

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.650
TS: Would you like something signed?

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.340
VICTORIA: No thank you, TS

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.670
TS: *Gasps*

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.250
VICTORIA: Well, now you know...

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.830
TS is not worth...

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.530
* Dramatic music*

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.670
CB: Oh…Hi Victoria...
I didn’t know you’d be here,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:01.910
 I could’ve given you a ride. 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.870
I used to drive the Humvees
 across the Sahara desert 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.370
during spec-ops training....

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.200
Hey, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot 
what’s the holdup?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.080
Commander's Headquarters....

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.290
...lyin’ low in the hooch...  

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.950
LOUISE: I’ll never call her.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.290
CAIRN: It doesn’t matter.  
And, on top of all that...

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.580
look how she signed my picture.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:40.910
*whoosh*

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.780
*thwap*

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.700
CAIRN: Hey!

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.960
VICTORIA: It’s a promotional number...

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.380
you get a code to unlock...

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.630
for her new game.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.300
She gives these to everybody.
  

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.840
CAIRN: Really?  

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.920
I can love TS again?

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.300
LOUISE: Now that that’s done, 
I need to get home and get some shuteye. 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.580
I’m enlisting in the morning!

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.620
VICTORIA: You’re doing what?

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.870
LOUISE: I don’t have a uniform.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.210
*crickets chirp*

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.000
VICTORIA: Continue...

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.220
LOUISE: Remember, you asked me if 
I had served my country 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.750
and did I keep the uniform..?  

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.080
I haven’t...so I didn’t.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.750
VICTORIA: Okay, stop.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.060
Come here. 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.090
*Music*

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.710
LOUISE: Oh yeah!

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.460
CAIRN: Thanks for clearing up all the
confusion with TS!

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:58.000
VICTORIA: Whatever.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.830
CAIRN: Where you going, TS?

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.360
TS: Some angry fan 
just threw water all over me.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.070
I remember you from earlier.  

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:14.160
You’re the quiet one...

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.990
What’s your name, again?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.740
CAIRN:  Cairn.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.110
TS: Is that Scottish?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:24.760
CAIRN: Yes.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.580
TS: You...
better call me!

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.500
CAIRN: I sure will!

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.880
TS: See you online

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:39.120
...Cairn.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.330
*Oh Yeah*
