00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.600
Two new anti-gay ads just started running
in Maine this week.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.140
And as usual, they're full of misleading,
hurtful statements.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.190
I'm Matt Baume at the American Foundation
for Equal Rights.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.590
And this is a special episode of Marriage
News Watch.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.130
We can break down the claims in these commercials
by using the testimony from AFER's Prop 8

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.130
trial.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.199
That case was like a marriage equality "truth
commission" that, for the first time, examined

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.240
our opponents' claims in a federal court of
law.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.810
And we found that in court, where there's
no room to hide behind misleading statements

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.800
and vague threats, the arguments of our opponents
simply have no basis in fact.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800
They melt away.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800
Here's the first one:

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.860
"If Question 1 passes, redefining marriage,
we can expect consequences for Mainers."

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.969
Let's stop right there.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.700
Question 1 is the ballot measure that would
allow the state to issue marriage licenses

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.400
to gay and lesbian couples.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.450
If it doesn't pass, the consequences for Mainers
is clear: no marriage for gays and lesbians.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.460
That is immediately harmful to those couples
and their kids.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.890
So, what are they claiming are the consequences
if it does pass?

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.750
Well, that's a lot less clear.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.490
"I was a successful school counselor in Maine
for over 20 years.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:06.470
Once nominated as teacher of the year.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.890
Yet when I supported traditional marriage,
they tried to get me fired."

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.070
This is Don Mendell.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.790
And what he's not telling you is that he didn't
just support an anti-gay law.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.270
He went on television and attacked gay and
lesbian Mainers, despite being a school counselor

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.570
at a public high school.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.320
Here he is back in 2009:

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.710
"Prevent Question 1 from being pushed on Maine
students."

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.890
Mendell wrote that LGBT couples "use children's
trusting nature to turn them against the natural

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.510
law."

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.720
Words like these do profound harm to young
gay and lesbian people, especially when they

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.910
come from a school counselor.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.230
That's why he was investigated.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.580
"When gay marriage has become law elsewhere,
people who disagree with it have been fired,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.000
sued, fined, and punished."

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.730
There are a lot of problems with this statement.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.550
Don wasn't fired, sued, fined, or punished.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.689
The complaints against him were dismissed.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.160
And marriage equality wasn't even law during
that time.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.700
So, whether or not gay and lesbian couples
could get married, the complaints against

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.840
him would have been exactly the same.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.880
In other words, marriage equality didn't cause
his problems.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.580
He caused them by speaking out against the
very kids in his care.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.410
The fact is, nobody gets punished just for
having an opinion.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.860
There are only consequences for harassing
people, or attacking them, or using public

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.320
resources to discriminate, or using your position
of authority to cause harm.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.900
And that's just what these marriage bans do.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.920
During the Prop 8 trial, Professor Lee Badgett
testified that laws like Prop 8 have "inflicted

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.170
substantial economic harm on same sex couples
and their children."

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.950
And Professor Gary Segura pointed out "There
is no group in American society who has been

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.870
targeted by ballot initiatives more than gays
and lesbians."

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.670
Now let's take a look at the second ad.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.550
"Marriage as a man and a woman has served
Maine for hundreds of years."

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.500
Well, it's served some people for hundreds
of years.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.320
Others, like gay and lesbian Mainers, have
been out of luck.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.460
"Marriage is more than what adults want for
themselves.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.210
It's also about the next generation."

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.440
That's true.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.550
And it's why it's so important that gay and
lesbian parents be allowed to get married.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.380
Not just for themselves, for the children
that they're raising.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.620
One of the Prop 8 proponents' own witnesses
admitted as much on the stand during the trial.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.400
David Blankenhorn testified, "same-sex marriage
would likely contribute to more stability

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.120
and to longer-lasting relationships for same-sex
couples."

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.700
He added that the freedom to marry "would
extend a wide range of the natural and practical

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.390
benefits of marriage to many lesbian and gay
couples and their children," and that it would

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.110
be "a victory for the worthy ideas of tolerance
and inclusion."

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.990
Blankenhorn's admissions are persuasive.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.840
So persuasive, in fact, that he eventually
changed his mind, and he's now a supporter

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.540
of marriage equality.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.590
Straight couples do a great job of raising
the next generation.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.650
But they're not the only ones doing it.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.560
"Maine law prohibits discrimination against
gay men and lesbians..."

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.560
That's true.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.290
And the reason that we prohibit discrimination
is that it hurts all of society, and helps

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.380
no one.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.300
As the Ninth Circuit ruled, "Prop 8 serves
no purpose, and has no effect, other than

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.970
to lessen the status and human dignity of
gays and lesbians in California ... The Constitution

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.930
simply does not allow for 'laws of this sort.'"

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.930
"And same-sex couples already have the legal
protections of marriage in virtually all matters."

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.609
Did you catch that?

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:17.780
Virtually all matters.

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.400
They're admitting that domestic partnerships
are unequal, but trying to make it okay by

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.700
saying, in essence, "close enough."

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.220
"Anything remaining can be addressed without
redefining marriage."

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.220
No.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.220
It can't.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.220
We've tried.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.910
You need an army of lawyers and thousands
of dollars to try to close the gap between

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.490
a domestic partnership and a marriage.

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.930
Not to mention, California's had domestic
partnerships since 1999, and every single

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.970
year they have to pass new laws to try to
close loopholes that prevent gay and lesbian

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.880
couples from being treated equally.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.820
At this point in our country's history, we
can say with confidence that separate is not

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.820
equal.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.820
And it never will be.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.820
By the way, you might be wondering who's paying
for these embarrassing ads.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:54.820
The answer is: we don't know.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.820
What we do know is that the National Organization
for Marriage is funneling a ton of money into

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:56.820
Maine without reporting their funding sources.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.820
And they recently lost a lawsuit over that
secrecy.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:58.820
They're now compelled to report their donors
in Maine.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.820
But so far, they haven't.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.820
We're now less than a month away from the
election.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:01.820
And the polling in Maine is encouraging, but
it could still go either way, since surveys

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.820
generally overstate support for the freedom
to marry.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.970
Now is a crucial time to get involved in Maine,
as well as in Maryland, Minnesota, and Washington.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.980
Visit afer.org/election2012 for ways that
you can support the freedom to marry in those

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:13.980
states.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.630
Together, we can push back against these misleading,
dangerous messages.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.130
At the American Foundation for Equal Rights,
I'm Matt Baume.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.690
Thanks for watching.
