00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.640
Alright, you are looking at the Adesso AKB-220 completly flexible keyboard.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.580
This is going to be an awesome keyboard if you're using it outdoors,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.250
I used to work in a car shop  where they had a computer 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.990
and they used one of these, I don't remember if it's the same brand

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.620
but it's a flexible keyboard and it worked great 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.560
because it's completely waterproof, greaseproof,  

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.560
smudge proof, pound on proof, you can pretty much  do about just anything with this.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.560
They are very, very difficult to break. And Adesso pretty much claimed that 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.770
on the website, so to me it's an invitation to test. And we're going to test this thing.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.470
But before, let me tell you  little more about some of the places 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.770
that are good to use this, boats first of all, boats are great, it is waterproof,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.920
Anywhere where you're near water  if you're in a shop of any type, a machine shop,

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.520
or anywhere you can be outdoors,  touching it with greasy hands

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.250
or with gloves, whatever, it's really useful for that. 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.550
Again, it's also very portable  because you can pretty much wrap it up

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.690
and just take it like this with you  you know, wrap the cord around it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.870
and take it with you and then,  wherever you want, you've got the keyboard

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.850
right there and you know you don't have  to worry about it working or not.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.800
It usually always works.  Supposedly, it's pretty undestructable, 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.140
so I'm going to beat on it a little bit. That should do it.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:26.190
So, some pretty rigorous beating there. And let's test to see if it still works. 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.160
Try this puppy out. Get a second for the drivers to kick in,

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.200
my producer looks like I've just murdered a baby. Alright, let's try this one more time.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.300
Hey, what do you know, it still works. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.180
This is a pretty cool keyboard. Except that I can't type.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.100
That's my problem, don't blame the keyboard.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.580
This is not the keyboard's fault. 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.300
So, it still types.  Now let's move on to the next test.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.900
Let's try some water immersion, I just... 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.300
Someone left this container of water over here  I don't know why they would leave it there.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.740
But we're going to go ahead and shove this thing in here and see what happens.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.810
Stick it in there, all the way down, way, way down.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.950
And let's let it soak it for a minute. I've got to use the restroom,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.350
so I'll be right back.  

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.360
Alright, so it's been sitting in here for about 3 or 4 minutes,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.230
we're going to go ahead  and pull it out of here.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.160
 Oh, got kind of stuck. I'll let it make a mess.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.370
So, as you can see, it's definitely very wet. I'm going to splatter it down over here.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.740
And I'm going to plug it right back over in here,  little netbook.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:06.120
And let's see if it works. Capture the drivers, "Does this thing still work?"

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.330
Unbelievable, I can spell.  So it's amazing that it still works.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.270
It's actually pretty fantastic  and I think that's great.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.630
and it's just about everything Bauer, you want to come and hit this thing?

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.970
What is it? -It's an indestructable, waterproof keyboard.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.340
 Indestructable? - Yeah, you can just beat on it, if you like.

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.380
That's what I was doing  - That's more like it.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.480
That's what I was doing too. -Is it still gong to work? What if I do like this?

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.640
 I did that too. -Oh, you hear that? I think it's broken now.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.900
You actually registered all of that, which is pretty funny. It's pretty cool.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.590
Thanks for your assistance, I appreciate it. - Does it still work?

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.900
Yup. Still working. I think he killed my notebook though.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.810
This thing is awesome, completely undestructable, you saw people step on it,

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.180
we even dumped it in water. I beat on it, Bauer beat on it,

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.380
everyone stepped on it, it's really great, again the Adesso AKB 220,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.720
