Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today on 
 the show we will be making hot cross buns.

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.097
Now I didn't grow up eating hot cross buns for Easter but some 
 people say that they are synonymous with that green Easter grass

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:15.696
and I know what that is, so lets get started on the recipe.

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:21.107
Vegan Hot Cross Buns Recipe

00:00:21.107 --> 00:00:27.655
To a large pot over medium heat, you are going to 
 add in your almond milk, canola oil, and agave nectar.

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:34.203
Heat that until it is just warm and remove it from the 
 heat. You just want to take the refrigerator chill off.

00:00:34.203 --> 00:00:40.472
If it starts to simmer or boil, you are going to have to 
 let it cool down to just above room temperature so you

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:48.015
don't kill your yeast. Speaking of yeast. You are going to add in 
 you dry active yeast. Stir that in until it is well dissolved.

00:00:48.015 --> 00:00:55.522
Then we are going to add in bread flour and whole wheat white 
 flour. Stir that together until it forms a dough, and your dough

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.425
will be very wet. That is how it is supposed to look.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.579
If it looks too liquidy though, add a little bit more flour.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.782
Cover it with a clean linen and place it 
 in a warm spot for an hour. 

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:12.706
When you come back to it, it should have risen and at least doubled in 
 size and now we are ready to add in our baking powder 

00:01:12.706 --> 00:01:13.874
and baking soda. 

00:01:13.874 --> 00:01:16.672
Stir that into the dough until it is well mixed.

00:01:16.672 --> 00:01:22.779
Now you want to lightly flour a clean surface. I 
 don't ever really trust how clean my surfaces are

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:28.677
so I always do mine on parchment paper. But, place 
 your dough onto the lightly floured parchment paper

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:31.184
And pat it into a square foot.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:35.362
I am going to dust on some cinnamon, 
 nutmeg, and I am using chopped dates.

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:41.400
The original recipe says use currants, which I can never find, but 
 while I was looking for currants on the raisin aisle; 

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:45.700
which I was going to replace them with, I 
 saw chopped dates. I really love dates.

00:01:45.697 --> 00:01:50.830
That is the key to cooking. You can use whatever you want, and 
 it is my recipe so I am going to use it.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:56.940
Fold over your dough and pat down and repeat this two more times.

00:01:56.935 --> 00:02:02.250
Sprinkle on a little cinnamon, little nutmeg, more 
 dates, fold it over, pat it down.

00:02:02.253 --> 00:02:09.030
Once you have completed that, pinch off golf ball size 
 pieces of dough, roll them in your hand, 

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.980
then place them on a baking sheet that 
 has been lined with parchment paper. 

00:02:11.982 --> 00:02:15.790
Cover your dough balls with a clean linen and 
 let them rise for another 30 minutes.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.840
While that 30 minutes is tick, tick, ticking on 
 by, preheat your oven to 400 degrees F.

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:28.750
Bake your vegan hot cross buns for 15 - 20 minutes until 
 they have risen in the oven and browned over the top.

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:33.040
Take them out and let them cool on a 
 cooling rack and make your icing. 

00:02:33.042 --> 00:02:40.870
To make the icing, I am going to add icing sugar or powdered 
 sugar to a zip lock bag along with a little lemon juice.

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:46.270
Massage that together. Then I am going to add a little almond 
 milk just to thin it out just a little bit more.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:52.690
Make sure there are no clumps left in your powered sugar 
 and it is all smooth else this will not work.

00:02:52.687 --> 00:03:00.310
Cut a tiny tip at the corner of your zip lock bag and 
 squeeze out a cross decoration over each bun. And we are done.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:08.520
We are ready to taste these. I like these hot cross buns. I think 
 they would make a good breakfast bread or even a savory dinner

00:03:08.523 --> 00:03:17.160
roll, but I do wish that I had more sugar in my bread. The 
 dates are really sweet, so whenever you run into a date, 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.900
your like ohh that is so sweet. And I did have a 
 little sugar, if you remember, in our almond milk mixture, 

00:03:21.897 --> 00:03:28.770
But not a lot of sugar in with the cinnamon and the nutmeg. And 
 I could have added some there, but if you are watching your

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.900
sugar it is good, and everybody needs less sugar so 
 I will just have to get over it.

00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:40.540
Thanks for watching today. It you enjoyed this video please
