&gt;&gt; Bournemouth University has been fantastic,

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.570
I moved down here especially to go to the
university. Most of the buildings here down

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.579
at Lansdowne are for Health and Social Care
so they’re all fully equipped. We do a lot

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.470
of work with physiotherapists because in the
outside world those are the people that we’re

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.969
going to be working with and we learn to communicate
and work together as a team of health care

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:59.100
professionals.
&gt;&gt; I chose Bournemouth University because

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.947
it has a really good reputation for hands
on Midwifery so it’s kind of a more practical

00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:06.740
way of learning. I think the clinical skills
labs are really good because it gives you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.930
an opportunity to learn skills in a safe environment
and also you get to work in small groups with

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.600
your tutor and also you can learn off your
peers as well and it’s a really good opportunity

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.920
to practice where you’re not in a pressured
environment.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.969
&gt;&gt; I chose Bournemouth University because
they have a good reputation in Child Protection

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:38.210
and social work is kind of a new career that
I’d like to pursue and after discussing

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.100
with my friends they told me that Bournemouth
University ran a really good Social Work course

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.930
so that’s why I applied. The facilities
are amazing, the computer systems, like myBU,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.819
helped me a lot to get all the information
I need for my course.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.240
&gt;&gt; My placement experience was on the Acute
Admissions unit at Royal Bournemouth Hospital.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.400
I loved it, it was a ward that consists of
patients being transferred from Accident and

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.890
Emergency. We stabilise them and then they
can go to other wards if they needed to stay

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.220
for longer. The thing I enjoyed the most was
being able to liaise with doctors, getting

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.100
my confidence with that and also being able
to manage a bay. The support I had on that

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.620
placement was a mentor, we worked very closely
together. She was able to transfer skills

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.590
to me, so I could look upon her, see how she
runs the bays, liaise with doctors so that

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.500
I could take that on when I qualify as a nurse.
&gt;&gt; I did my first placement in Malaysia, Penang.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.379
I had five weeks there working with the ARG
which is the Action Research Group from USM

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:52.120
University in Penang. I spent a lot of time
in the, erm, with the people who are heroin

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:59.010
addicts in the dump site and also on the street,
it’s been a really, really great experience

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:08.680
for me.
&gt;&gt; On the placements we’ve been to Bournemouth

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.579
Hospital, Poole Hospital, some of the local
leisure centres and health clinics. We’ve

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.989
been able to see some of the health and fitness
classes and also things like cardiac rehab

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.859
and pulmonary assessments.
&gt;&gt; I thought that the course offered here

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.809
was really varied across the whole syllabus,
lots of different aspects of nutrition and

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:37.699
I think also the facilities available here
are fantastic as well.

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:45.069
&gt;&gt; I have accommodation through the university
which is fantastic, reasonably priced and,

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.709
as landlords say, super.
&gt;&gt; The campus is very centrally located which

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.790
is very, very handy because you can just go
to the centre of town and do the shopping

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.139
or just clubbing, or I mean it’s very easy
to get to the beach or into the countryside.

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:11.040
&gt;&gt; The university is based on two campuses,
you’ve got Talbot and Lansdowne. There’s

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.700
great links between the two. The library here
is mainly for the Nursing or Health and Social

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.281
Care subjects and if I want to go on a broader
scale of books and wider reading I do go to

00:04:23.281 --> 00:04:39.690
Talbot Campus.
&gt;&gt; music playing

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:49.130
&gt;&gt; You’re on the South Coast so you’ve
got the sea, the beach, the life which together

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.289
with the university experience is just brilliant,
really, really good.

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.200
&gt;&gt; To keep your balance between study and
pleasure – I think this is the right place

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.650
to study.
