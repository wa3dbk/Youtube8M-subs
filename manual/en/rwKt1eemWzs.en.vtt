00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.200
For the past 10 years, Top Thrill Dragster has 
been giving millions and millions of riders

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.360
a 17 second race for the sky at 120 MPH.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.310
But it takes a lot to keep Top Thrill Dragster running 
so we go behind the scenes

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.800
to see what keeps this ride in tip top shape!

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.850
It's one of the very few rocket
coasters in the United States.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.660
It launches you from 0 to 120 MPH using a launch technology

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.330
similar to what's on an aircraft
carrier. There's a catapult system

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.410
with a winch, powered by hydraulic motors,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.590
that stores a lot of energy

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.790
to get you going very fast very quickly.
It's an extremely complicated system of

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.690
sensors, wheels, cables,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.140
and one big motor.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.800
every 45 seconds Top Thrill dragster is
ready to launch it all starts here

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.880
in this room. Tanks called accumulators
fill up with hydraulic oil while

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.790
nitrogen acts as a spring.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.080
A piston separates the oil from the
nitrogen.

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.509
When the launch button is pressed the
sequence starts and the nitrogen pushes

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.950
a piston that in turn pushes hydraulic
oil into motors.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.100
Those motors turn a drum,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.320
which reels in the cable, which is
attached to the catch car, which attaches

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.000
to the train, and launches you at 120 MPH. 
Got it?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.600
People always ask us why the right shuts
down frequently.

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.719
That has to do with the thousands of
components on the ride.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.170
Each one of those mechanical and electrical
components has a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.429
failure life. It's going to go
bad at some point. There are so many

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.229
components in the system that we
have to keep on top of.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.509
and we have gotten a lot better at doing
that in the last

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.500
five...six...seven years than we
were when we

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.700
originally got the ride. It was new to us,
we never had anything like this before.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.540
And now we have it under control. 
We have it on a leash.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.640
Before you even get to the park, in fact,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.670
while you're sleeping our team is
working to get the ride

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.170
up and running. Every morning behind me
they spend most of the night,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.599
in fact we have a third shift at night
that comes here at 11

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.700
starts doing any preventive maintenance on
the the trains behind me. That takes

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.120
5-6 hours to go through all those trains
and they spend another couple hours

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.000
going through to track, the brakes,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.579
looking at the kicker wheels, possibly
replacing tires which moved around the

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.069
track, doing a visual inspection all
the electrical switches.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.160
It takes one guy

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.019
all night to inspect this ride. 
Once maintenance is given their OK,

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.500
the ride crew steps in. We're responsible
for all the opening procedures

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.660
in the morning transfering all of the ride
units on. Assigning crew positions,

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.600
cleaning duties,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.640
as team leaders we run ride all day
long. We are essentially

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.600
the supervisors at the location.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.900
Responsible for rotations, 
responding to mechanical down time,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.170
everything to do with the ride, we
immediately report to our supervisors, but

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.380
we're responsible on location. 
The crew will transfer all the trains on,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.110
clean each one, cycle them empty to make
sure all systems are functioning,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.950
and then they test ride each train.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.080
Dragster is a very complicated ride.
It takes a lot of

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.660
people, a lot of departments working
together to keep it open and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.210
running every day. 
What's the best part of Chris's job?

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.020
It's just the people that come here you
know? They come to ride Dragster.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.200
The faces when they get off, 
the faces before they're about to launch.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.580
The crew training the crew.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.709
Altogether it's been one of the best experiences
I've ever had. And if you think the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.519
world's first strata coaster is going
anywhere, think again!

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.900
I'm pretty sure Top Thrill Dragster 
being one of the preimere rides here

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.950
pretty sure we're gonna do anything we
can to keep it going for another

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.900
10...15...20 years. 
What would you say to somebody who's never ridden

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.100
Dragster before that's kind of on the fence?

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.000
Arms down, head back,
and hold on!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.790
Let's go! Come on! You Can do it! Yeah!
