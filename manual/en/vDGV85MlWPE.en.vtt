How To Liveable

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.990
Hello and welcome to How to Liveable my Youtube
Channel where I just teach whatever tutorial

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:21.849
happens to come to mind. Today, this one's
going out to all the kids in the world that

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.580
need to know how to tie their shoes, and the
adults that still don't know that have been

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.460
wearing velcro for at least 18 years.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.390
So, let's get started. Basically, I'm going
to turn this shoe this way, so we can look

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.390
at it from the perspective of the shoe tier.
What you want to do is take both strings and

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:51.449
cross them over so you get an X, X marks the
spot.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:02.989
Then, you take the 1 string on the X. The
one that's in your right hand, bring it under,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.610
so you get your first knot and tie it on down
Then you take your thumb from your left hand make a loop

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.950
and grab the other part of the string with
your right two fingers. Then take the string

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:34.130
that's on the left side and bring it around
and then grab it if you can with these same two

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.060
fingers. So now I've got all my necessary
components in one hand. Now what I'm going

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:50.060
to do is grab that string again that I was holding on to and I'm going
to pull it until it gets tight. Let's see

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:05.310
that again in slow motion. Grab through loop.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:20.690
Now I've got my two loops, for a nice perfect
bow. So that's basically it if you want to

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.610
see it again, or if you want to see it put
into slow motion, let me know in the comments

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.170
below. And let me know what you thought of
it and if you liked it subscribe to the channel.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.860
Thanks a lot.
