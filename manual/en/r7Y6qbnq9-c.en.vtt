[STEPHANIE] Hi I’m Stephanie from OneCall.
I’m going to talk to you about the LG LH90

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.430
series high definition television. This series
of television is full 1080 progressive high

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.300
definition resolution which means this TV
has a full 2 million pixels versus a standard

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.170
1 million pixels of the lower resolution high
definition television. This TV is full LED

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.019
backlit with local dimming, that is going
to give you the maximum amount gradation of

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.030
colors so you’re going to have much more
details and much better black levels and accurate

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:55.940
color through all of your viewing experiences.
The LG LH90 series of television has a 240Hz

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.639
refresh rate. That means when you’re watching
fast action like we are here, you’re going

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:06.830
to get a clean, crisp, picture instead of
a bunch of blurs. The TV has a full accompaniment

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.640
of audio/video inputs. The LG LH90 series
of high definition television is full THX

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.770
display certified. That means it meets the
THX standards of picture quality set forth

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.970
by George Lucas, giving you the most beautiful
picture imagined. In addition it’s Energy
