00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.230
More then just another melody instrument the
bass guitar is really a rhythm instrument

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.690
to be coupled with a drum set or a used in
place of one. So a important aspect of playing

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.880
bass is knowing how to read rhythm and understand
rhythm of different classics. Let's look at

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:24.560
reading rhythm on the bass cleft using notation.
So here is a example here is four measures

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.140
of different rhythms and these are called
quarter notes right here. They are filled

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.441
in that and a line that is going to be a quarter
note. Four four here behind the bass clef

00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:41.230
sign or in front of the bass clef sign indicates
four beats per measure. Measure would be broken

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.460
up on this way so we would count one, two,
three, four, one, two, three, four even if

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.839
we are only playing two beats. So our first
measure here would be playing a open A one,two,three,four,

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.920
try alternating those right hands fingers
one and two. One, two, one, two to play one,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.060
two, three, four. Here it are the table measure
would give you the rhythm that is why the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.979
bass clef is very important. So here is the
next line these are called half notes where

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.210
the note is not filled in but they are stem
they take out two beats per there playing.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.689
So this would be one, two, three, four, so
you pluck only once but you count two. So

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:37.200
this is twice as long as a quarter note. You
can have quarter notes and half notes in conjunction

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:45.799
with each other within the same measure. So
one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four,

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:53.969
or in this combination one, two, three, four.
Now you may end this song with a whole note

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:00.329
a whole note will have no stem and not be
filled in at all. This would count for a four

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:09.250
beats. So this would be one, two, three, four
so try playing a pattern like this using quarter

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.630
notes and half notes cause you are going to
encounter these in your simple melodies as

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.840
well as in everyday reading.
