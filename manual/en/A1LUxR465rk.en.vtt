Hi my name is Tim Labelle and this is my wife,
April. We are the owners of Pet Barn Exotics

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.770
in Hartland, Michigan and we are here on behalf
of Expert Village to help you choose the right

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.230
pet. In this segment we will be discussing
allergies to certain animals. Before you purchase

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.580
your animal you need to know if you are allergic
to certain animals. One way of finding out

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.210
is going to your local pet shop and holding
the animals and interacting with these animals

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.870
before you purchase one. For example if you
go to a pet shop and then you are thinking

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:37.059
about buying a bird they do have dander. They
clean themselves and they shake and they do

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.711
have dander so if you are allergic to these
animals or you have asthma I do not recommend

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:48.420
a bird for you. Also they are not recommended
if you have emphysema. There are ways to get

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.069
around allergies. You can purchase or adopt
an animal that is a hairless guinea pig and

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:03.639
it is called a skinny pig. Those are great
for people with allergies. There are hairless

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:14.100
cats. There
are hairless dogs. Also if you are allergic

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.310
to dogs there are different things that you
can do. There is hyper allergenic shampoo

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.460
you can wash dogs with that keeps the danger
down and it does help people with allergies.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.659
Also if you have a fur allergy there are certain
dogs that have hair. Yorkies for example do

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.320
not have fur, they have hair. If you do have
dog allergies, you may want to look into Lhasa

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.200
Apsos or Yorkies since they do not have fur
but do have hair. If you do have allergies,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:59.399
there are ways of keeping the allergy under
control. You can vacuum a lot. If you have

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:06.549
a bird, make sure you bath them quite often.
Spray them with a bottle to keep the dander

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:14.610
down. Keep a healthy safe environment for
your animal. By healthy I mean disinfecting

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.730
their cages at least once a week, washing
your dog with a hyper allergenic shampoo,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.230
vacuum your house, vacuum anywhere the dog
lays, on your bed, on your clothes, whatnot.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.720
As long as you pick up the fur and you do
that on a daily basis your allergies will

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.450
stay at a minimum.
