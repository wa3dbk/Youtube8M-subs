00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.500
Today what we're working on

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.820
is we're in the middle to end phases

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.429
of this yarn bombing project and the yarn
bombing, what that is

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.700
is a way in which artists create

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.770
using yarn and basically

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.200
transform a public space. It's really a
way to

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.300
get people to think about their everyday
environment

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.960
differently and usually it's a little silly. It's fun for the viewer and the 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.980
audience because it's

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.760
it is unexpected then it kinda makes you
laugh because it's ridiculous, it's yarn

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.519
you know it's something that you would maybe see in your grandma's bathroom but it

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:44.390
in our space. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.789
The idea behind this particular one is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.409
for students to bring a whimsical

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.420
silly, portable art project into

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.519
a place that might not normally
experience arts. 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.609
We scoped out a lot of places downtown
Greeley to choose a location

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.720
and the students were really interested

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.070
in getting in the heads of people who

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.710
were along their every day journey. We
first needed to come up with

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.710
a location which was the bus stop and
then our second step was to come up with a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.870
theme that would suit that area.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.050
We kind of tried to find things that were similar

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.870
between all of our ideas and we've
landed on the idea

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.260
this like whimsical garden element.
We're trying to play on the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.180
contrast of summer and winter

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.710
and we realized that it would be really
gray, really white

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.010
and not a lot of color and greens. So we
kinda wanted to bring them back into the space. 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.759
So with that mentality, we kinda forged
ahead and

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.790
kind of divided into groups. Everybody had

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.869
a project that they're working on,
everyone right now has kind of

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.970
each gone their own way and done

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.850
one little element for the whole thing.
Most our classes are just

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.149
you know, everybody has their project and
working on individually. I've never done

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.360
something like this in an art class before. 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.410
I think the most valuable thing that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.050
I will take away personally from this will
be the collaboration

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.440
because you don't get a chance to
collaborate with

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.019
artists. Most the time most artists work
individually

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.700
This is something really great that we can take to

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.890
the schools that we work in or the studios that we

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.530
branch out into after graduation. I
wanted to get the experience

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.060
to the students of seeing the steps that
go into creating a collaboration between

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.840
the University and the City.So we
approached

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.400
the city of Greeley and Creative Arts
District

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.430
was excited about it. Seems to be a
win-win for everybody.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.860
In this case,  the students they really want to be
stewards of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.269
our town and so we have a very specific

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.420
date that it's going up in a specific
date that it coming down.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.950
That makes it a little bit different
from the gorilla

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.090
yarn bombing. You never know what
people's reaction will be, especially when

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.320
you're invading public property

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.640
by I think yarn bombing is a
relatively

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.739
respectful Street art it's not

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.970
harmful it's very easily removed

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.620
so it's not gonna do damage to whatever
you put it on.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.930
Imagining there's a lot of people who

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.030
are seasoned crocheters who live in the
community and I would love to see

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.040
more of a collaboration between students
and people in the community to maybe

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.220
create something

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.609
much grander so I can see it I can see
it you know

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.589
getting bigger and being a really fun
tradition
