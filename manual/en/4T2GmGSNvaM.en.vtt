00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.570
Go. Go! Go...
Go, come on.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.000
Can I help you?
Name, please.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.900
Seinfeld. I made a reservation
for a mid-size, and she's a small.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.569
I'm kiddin' around, of course.

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.100
Okay, let's see here.
- Sixty six years old?!

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.070
Yeah. Well, he's in perfect health.
He works out - he's vibrant. You'd really like him.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.099
Why do people always say that?
I hate everybody - why would I like him?

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.979
So, what do you think - could you
go out with a 66-year-old woman?

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:32.290
Well, I'll tell ya...

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.290
She would have to be really vibrant.
So vibrant she'd be spinning.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.370
I'm sorry, we have no mid-size
available at the moment.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.939
I don't understand - I made a reservation.
Do you have my reservation? - Yes, we do.

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:47.770
Unfortunately, we ran out of cars.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.710
But the reservation keeps the car here.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.840
That's why you have the reservations.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.840
I know why we have reservations.
- I don't think you do.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.400
If you did, I'd have a car.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.460
See, you know how to take
the reservation. You just don't know

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.619
how to hold

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.380
the reservation.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.200
And that's REALLY the most
important part of the reservation,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.710
the holding.
Anybody can just take 'em.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.759
Let me speak with my supervisor.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.480
Here we go,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.630
the supervisor.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.470
You know what she's saying over there?

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.000
Hey, Marge, see those two people over there?
They think I'm talking to you,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.530
so you pretend like you're talking

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.060
to me.
Okay, now you start talking.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.500
Oh, you mean like this - so it looks like
I'm saying something, but I'm not really saying

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500
anything at all?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.800
Okay, now you say something else

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.900
and they won't yell at me
'cause they thought I was checking with you.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.940
Okay, I think that's enough.
See ya later!

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.960
I'm sorry. My supervisor says
there's nothing we can do.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.000
Yeah... It looked like you were
in a real conversation over there.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
Well, we do have a compact -
if you would like that.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.000
Fine.
- Alright. Well, we have a blue

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Ford Escort for you, mr. Seinfeld.
Would you like insurance?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.070
Yeah... You better give me the insurance, 
because I am

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.000
gonna beat the hell out of this thing.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.909
Please, fill this out.
