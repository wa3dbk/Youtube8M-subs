Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books the natural

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:19.340
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
for these videos I love to answer the questions

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.969
you all send me via email so any of you have
any questions you would like for me to answer

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:30.140
check out the description box below for additional
information so this video is because of an

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.100
email of course that I received from Bella
Bella emailed me because she says she's been

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.190
practicing her hair care skills on a curly
mannequin head as she wants and some suggestions

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.710
on how to actually co wash natural hair so
I'm going to do is tell you some extremely

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.630
crucial tips that you should follow along
with to successfully co wash your natural

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.640
hair this is going to work perfect for you
mannequin head as well as anyone else who

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.850
has natural hair as well so the very first
tip that I am going to share it you want to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.769
make sure that when you are co washing you
begin with a quality conditioner and water

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.450
of course so no matter how course how fine
how shore how long how curly how straight

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.830
your hair is you have to make sure you are
using quality hair products so that way you

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.090
avoid pot build up you avoid hair damage and
you can actually extend the health of your

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.290
hair without having to cut off a lot of split
ends and things like that so in my book the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.980
Natural Hair Bible of course I have recommended
so many different kinds of ways that you can

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.100
make homemade hair care products for your
own hair or a helpful list to go about purchasing

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.900
quality products if you want to know more
information on that but just make sure that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
you're beginning with a quality conditioner
and water so that way you can successfully

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.470
detangling for your hair which leads me to
my tip when detangling your hair as you are

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.350
co washing you have to make sure to either
use a wide tooth comb or your fingers your

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.830
fingers are the number one tool of choice
because you can feel all of the damage you

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:05.400
can feel any splits any single strand knots
you can feel exactly where there are any tangles

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.129
as so that way you can release them with a
comb you can feel the resistance but most

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.170
times you can accidentally snag through a
few areas in your hair so that's why you just

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.380
gotta be really careful when you are combing
through your hair you gotta make sure that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.319
your very gentle throughout the entire process
was long as you have a quality conditioner

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.980
hair saturated with water and you have you
like to call it that's what you want to do

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.319
then you can gently comb through your hair
with ease because the conditioner makes it

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.920
very slippery to do so and then my last tip
that I'm going to recommend is that especially

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.480
if you have very curly or coily hair you have
to make sure to contain sections of your hair

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.310
in braids or twists the way that I like the
co wash my hair is that first I like to section

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:56.170
in about 6 to 8 section and what I do is I
twist my hair from the roots all the way down

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.500
and then about a third of the way down I braid
just a little bit so that way as I am co-washing

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.720
each section at a time the rest of my sections
are not unraveling so this is a great tip

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.210
that you can follow along with when you are
co-washing the manikin head or even someone

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.080
else was watching this your natural hair as
well so thank you Bella for your email I hope

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.000
all these tips helped and keep practicing
on your mannequin I know you'll get better

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.650
and I have a lot of faith in you so until
then I'll see you all in my very next video
