00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.700
Hi, I came back earlier than my plan because I wanted to upload Valentine's Day specials in January. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.830
And 3-ingredient chocolate mousse is my first video. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.520
First, in a microwave safe bowl, add in 3 1/2 oz of dark chocolate, 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.120
¼ cup of whipping cream, 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.120
and 8 big marshmallows. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.220
I used Rocky Mountains marshmallows 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.420
and mildly sweet Hershey’s special dark chocolate today.  

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.120
Baking dark chocolate like Nestle noir with 52% cocoa is fine for this recipe. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.920
Microwave  it for one minute. 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:59.520
Make sure that you use big enough container because marshmallows rise.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.720
And stir a little to roughly combine. 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:15.240
Then microwave for one more minute 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.950
and stir until homogenously mixed. 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.740
Now whip ½ cup of whipping cream without sugar until thick. 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.660
And pour 1/3 of whipped cream into now-cooled chocolate mixture 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:45.240
and fold to combine. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.650
Then pour the remaining whipped cream 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.450
and fold until and homogeneously mixed. 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.450
In baking this is a good way of mixing light mixture and dense mixture. 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:12.150
½ teaspoon of pure vanilla extract is optional here.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.480
Voila, 3-ingredient chocolate mousse.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.570
Serve immediately 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.690
or chill in the refrigerator if you prefer cool chocolate mousse. 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.990
I love marshmallow chocolate mousse with whipped cream, 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.580
shredded chocolate, 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.570
and a small waffer on top.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.900
Bon appetit! 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.210
This is an ultimate chocolate treat for your Valentine.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.790
You know it takes only 3 ingredients and 20 minutes.

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.480
Check out my recipes for Valentine’s Day in my chocolate playlist. 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.346
Thank you for watching. Bye!
