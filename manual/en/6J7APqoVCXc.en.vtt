bjbjBrBr A(d+ Jan: All right, here we go.
Love this! This is a dark chocolate roux,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.250
exactly what it looks like. It's starting
to get the color of a dark chocolate. Now,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.050
we're almost done, and I'll tell you a trick
with making roux, especially if you're using

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.259
any kind of cast iron cookware, is that the
heat continues, even after you turn the heat

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.860
on the stove off. So I'm cutting it off, but
this is actually going to continue cooking

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.240
for a minute. So, you want to stop just short
of where you want the roux to end up. And

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.079
the reason is, carryover heat in the cast
iron cookware -- or actually, in a lot of

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.359
cookware, but more so in cast iron -- will
continue to take this another shade or two

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.970
darker, which is actually where I want it
to end up. So, a dark chocolate roux. Equal

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.949
parts oil and flour, and you simply cook and
stir, slowly, until it gets the color of dark

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.330
chocolate. Now, this will be the base of a
really yummy gumbo. And the flavor is second

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.580
to none, and you can't get it any other way.
So it takes a little bit of time and effort

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.630
to make one, but it is very, very worth it.
So, if you're going to do it yourself, just

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.220
remember, don't walk away from it, don't go
answering the phone, don't go yapping to your

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.260
neighbors, because it'll burn on you, and
once it's burned, you can't bring it back.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.570
However, if you're willing to take the time,
do a little stirring, maybe [laughs] turn

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.630
the TV on while you're taking care of it,
it is very, very simple, and very straightforward.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.750
And that is the base of the gumbo -- ooh,
I almost got myself -- I'm going to show you
