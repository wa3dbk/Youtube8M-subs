00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.340
Let's meet our first employee. We'll call him Blue.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.700
Now, let's meet another employee. We'll call her Orange.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.780
Blue and Orange are accountants who work in the same agency.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.920
Their job duties are the same.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.840
They both examine, analyze, and interpret accounting records so they can give advice and prepare statements.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.840
They also maintain petty cash funds, maintain fixed assets on WOLFS,

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.540
and review and approve department WOLFS documents for A/P and A/R.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.120
Now, let's practice setting a target range for Blue and Orange.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.020
Because they have similar job duties, they should be evaluated at the same target ranges.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.540
Let's practice setting a target range for communication.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.300
First, let's review the definition of communication, which is included in the Supervisor Planning Form.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.680
Communication is defined as delivering clear, timely, effective transmission of information and taking responsibility for understanding others.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:12.920
Using skill in presenting information, analysis, ideas, and positions in a clear, concise, accurate, and convincing manner, as is appropriate for the audience.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.960
Recognizing the individual's role as a representative of the State of Wyoming and not presenting personal views.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.320
Now, let's look at the target ranges for communication. There are 5 ranges, A through E, which represent increasing levels of competence.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.500
Let's consider each target range, starting with the minimum expectations for communication laid out in Target Range A.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.440
A position that is set to this target range asks that an employee ensures that regular transmission of information occurs based on the need of work, the individual, management, or situation,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:55.400
listens actively, asks clarifying questions and summarizes or paraphrases what others have said to verify understanding, and asks appropriate questions.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:04.040
Because Target Range A is the minimum expectation for any employee, this could definitely apply. But, let's take a look at the rest of the target ranges.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.760
Target Range B represents the next level of competence.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:18.720
A position that is set to this target range for communication asks that an employee readily, clearly and effectively conveys information, ensuring it is understandable, as evidenced by the reactions of the recipients,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.540
thinks through what is to be communicated, and organizes thoughts and ideas.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:34.640
Considering that Blue and Orange need to prepare statements, this target range applies as well, because that task requires that they convey information in a clear, understandable, and organized manner.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.580
Let's take a look at Target Range C next.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.900
Target Range C represents an intermediate level of competence.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:51.320
A position that is set to this target range for communication requires that an employee uses a variety of techniques to tailor transmission of information to specific audiences,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.940
understands, organizes, and analyzes what one hears and reads to decide what to think and do in response to a message,

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.840
organizes work in a manner that is clear and easy to follow, commands attention, and achieves desired results.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.220
This target range does not fit Blue and Orange's job duties, because their daily work is focused in structured computer databases,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.440
and they don't need to utilize a variety of communication strategies or tailor their communication to various audiences.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.540
So far, we've determined that Blue and Orange's positions can be expected to meet Target Range B, but not Target Range C.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.520
Just to be sure we haven't overlooked anything, let's look at Target Ranges D and E.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:42.440
Target Range D represents an advanced level of competence and a position set to this Target Range for communication can be expected to identify and use effective communication channels and methods,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:51.140
identify barriers and apply systematic sets of procedures to eliminate or reduce problems and implement the most appropriate course of action.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:04:02.600
Target Range D does not match Blue and Orange's job duties, because they are not expected to identify communication barriers or determine appropriate courses of action, as expected in Target Range D.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:10.120
Target Range E represents the highest level of competence and should be assigned to those positions that provide direction and leadership.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:18.540
After considering each of the Target Ranges for Communication, we can see that Target Range B is the best fit for Blue and Orange's job duties.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:28.640
Please note that we didn't select Target Range A, because that represents a lower level of expectation and Target Ranges should always be set to represent the optimum performance target.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:37.360
To finish the process of setting Target Ranges, this same process of considering each Target Range should now be repeated for the next four competencies,

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.560
Customer Service, Judgment and Decision Making, Team Player, and Personal Effectivenes.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:50.900
The last two competencies, Leadership and Developing Others, are reserved for supervisors and do not apply to Blue and Orange.
