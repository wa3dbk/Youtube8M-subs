As you're traveling the highways across
California, you may not think much about it but,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.260
many people are responsible for that road
under you. People designed it, built it, and

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.150
maintain it, all so that you can get to where
you need to go. In this video series we visit

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.300
those people and the transportation projects
they work on. Welcome to "On the Job with

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.500
Caltrans."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.600
Hello and welcome to "On the Job with Caltrans."
I'm Tamie McGowen, Assistant Deputy Director

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.500
for Public Affairs. Did you know Caltrans
is responsible for inspecting nearly twenty-four

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
thousand bridges across California, and about
eight hundred of those cross over some kind

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.190
of water. Today in this installment we're
going to go under the water to show you some

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.920
of the unique ways that we inspect those bridges.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.040
I'm here now with Richard Hunt who is a bridge
inspector for Caltrans. So Rich, tell us,

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.829
how underwater bridge inspections differ from
regular bridge inspections?

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.239
Well, they're very similar in many ways. We
still look for cracks in the concrete, we

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.350
still look for loss of concrete...look for
rusting in steel, we look for scouring underneath

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.119
the bridge footings, but since we go underwater
the approach method is very different.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.439
So, how do you and your team...that must take
some really intensive training for you and

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.469
your team to be able to prepare yourselves
for this kind of job.

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:27.929
It does. In addition to being qualified bridge
inspectors we're also qualified commercial

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.139
hardhat divers, and to become a commercial
hardhat diver there's a formal six hundred

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:37.490
and twenty five hours of training that has
to be done, and that includes about half in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.319
the classroom and about half in the water.
And of course the classroom goes with dive

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.939
planning, and diving physics, and physiology,
and all the stuff that you'd normally expect,

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.389
but then when we go to the water, we...it
depends on the dive school, we may be in a

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:59.859
lake, we may be in a rock quarry, we dive
down to say a hundred feet, we do tasks at

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:05.200
hundred feet, we do tasks at thirty feet,
we practice welding, bolting up flanges, and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.689
just doing different things under water. And
the whole reason for that is to give our divers

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:16.110
as much possible training as we can so that
they're very familiar with any situation we

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.769
may put them in because we're...we're very
concerned and support diver safety. We want

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.189
to make sure our divers are safe and as prepared
as they possibly can.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.650
Wow, so a hundred feet -- that's really deep.
What are...what are some of the most unusual

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.959
or interesting things you've ever encountered?

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.209
In the twenty-five years we've been doing
the underwater inspections on the bridge,

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:44.209
the unusual kind of has become usual. We run
into cars, trucks, shopping carts, phone booths,

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:51.459
old boats -- basically anything that people
would chuck over the side of the bridge falls

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.659
down to the bottom, sinks to the bottom, and
then we run into it. So we have to be really

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:03.659
careful in moving around underwater when we
have low visibility so that you don't run

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:08.469
into something, or tear your dry suit, or
get your hose hooked up on something, so we

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.129
encounter that all the time.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.310
Wow, that's amazing! So, I know you and your
team must be really used to this, but for

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.870
me it sounds so challenging and difficult
to do an underwater bridge inspection. How

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.379
do you deal with things like murky water and
fast currents?

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.069
Well in terms of fast currents we try...we
try and play the tides, so we run tide charts,

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.420
especially like when we're working in the
bay, where Carquinez is our fastest flow.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420
We can get up to eight miles an hour, so we
look for the slack tide period and we'll dive

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.599
the slacks. When we dive controlled channels
like for California Aqueduct, we coordinate

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.359
with the other agencies and they'll slow
the water down for us so we can get in there.

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:57.359
We try and dive less than a mile and half
an hour. That gives us the best ability to

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.920
do our job...do our inspections. In terms
of the murky water, if we have over a foot

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.469
of visibility we're lucky, so we're pretty
much used to a foot or less, so murky water

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:09.900
is just part of the job.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.170
That's crazy...that's really incredible!
So if I'm a diver standing here on this boat,

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.289
how do I go about preparing for and entering
the water? One thing that just...I can't even

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.639
imagine...is how cold it must be on some days.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.180
We pull all the gear out of the boat, or out
of the truck, and spread it out on the boat

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.940
and then we set it all up, and there's a checklist
for that. The diver will set up his gear,

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.220
the safety diver will set up their gear, and
there's a communication between me as the

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.370
dive supervisor and the divers as we do the
set up. Right before we get in the water the

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.930
diver gets all the gear on, and he's assisted
by what we call "tenders." The tenders

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.160
will suit the diver up, they'll put on the
harness, they'll put on the hard hat, they'll

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.949
hook everything up, and then after they've
set it up they communicate with me and say

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.800
he's ready to go. That's the second checklist.
The third one is the final one between me

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.470
and the diver. I will communicate with the
diver after he's got everything on and we'll

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:11.629
check his air flow, we'll check the communications,
we'll check that his emergency gas has pressure

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:15.220
in it, we'll check that he's all zipped
up and ready to go, that he knows what he's

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.560
supposed to be doing in the job and then as...as
he's telling me all that, I'm looking

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.879
at him making sure that everything's on, because
ultimately his safety is my responsibility,

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.460
and so when it's all done, I approve it, I
say "OK, your clear to dive.", and they'll...they'll

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.449
get into the water.

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:38.319
So, why do we use a bulky diving helmet and
a diving hose rather than a regular wet suit

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:41.819
and typical scuba gear? It seems a little
cumbersome.

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.080
Well, it may seem redundant for me to say
this again, but it all goes back to diver

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.710
safety. We want to make sure that our divers
are nice and safe. The hard hat goes on the

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.560
divers head - keeps their head warm. They
wear a dry suit, which keeps their bodies

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.900
dry and warm, and I have full communication
with the diver. I can monitor their breathing

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.639
rate, I can talk to them, I can tell how they're
doing; just by simply having a conversation

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.599
I know whether they're stressed or they're
not stressed, and if I need to -- if they

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.159
sound stressed to me -- I can pull the diver
out.

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:21.330
I've gotten to where I know all the divers,
and I know how they are under water, and so

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.750
I can monitor that.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:23.610
That's great!

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.310
In addition to that, since it's an engineering
inspection - and that's kind of the second

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:33.120
thing -- is we can take real time accurate
notes as the diver dictates them. If we were

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.849
diving scuba, they'd have to remember it
all, and bring it back to the surface, and

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:37.879
then tell somebody.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:40.860
Well Rich, don't ever worry about being
redundant with safety because that's a good

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.599
thing. And, I want to thank you for your time,
I know you and your team have a lot of work

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.050
to do so I'm going to let you go ahead and
get back to that now. Thanks again.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.750
Thank you.

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:53.599
And, for all of you, the next time you drive
across one of the many bridges in California,

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.030
it's good to know that the hardworking men
and women of Caltrans are doing their part

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.650
