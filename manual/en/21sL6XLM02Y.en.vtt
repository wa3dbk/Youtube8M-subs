00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, I am called John Bullar. 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.000
I will tell you about 'hide glue' or animal glue.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is animal glue in fine granules like sugar.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here is another make of animal glue, it is called 'pearl glue'.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It is formed into little beads.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
This is an iron glue pot.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I am adding fine glue because it dissolves quicker.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I am adding the same quantity of water.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I stir it with a glue brush.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The glue is made from animal skins. It is similar to gelatine.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This glue pot is called a double boiler.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I heat it on the workshop stove.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The double boiler has water outside and glue inside.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This heat the glue to a temperature of 55C or 140F.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You can use an electric glue pot. It has a thermostat.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The hot glue flows freely.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If you get glue on your fingers they quickly become sticky.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I am brushing glue along the edge of this oak board.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I take another oak board.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Both boards have been planed to a good straight edge 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
so that they meet with no gaps.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now I am rubbing the two oak boards together gently

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and after a few seconds they grab each other.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The two oak boards are already bonded together.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Tomorrow, this will be a strong edge joint.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Thank you for watching this video about animal glue.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I am called John Bullar.
