00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.599
So you want to set up a computer network.

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:08.450
I'm going to show you how to do it.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.950
Right here, we have two of my computers.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.480
I have a MacBook here, and a PC here.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.200
And, they both have Ethernet ports, but where
do connect them to?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.599
I can't really connect them to each other.

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.860
I mean, that would work for certain things,
but it's not a real network.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.369
What I need is something like this: a router.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.990
Now, a router has a bunch of ports in the
back that I can connect to multiple computers,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.710
and it also works wirelessly, so I can connect
more computers without cables.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.809
But right now, I'm going to show you how to
connect them with cables.

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.579
And to do that, we're going to need a bunch
of these Ethernet cables.

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:47.809
So I'm just going to get one of these, hook
it up to my Mac, and the other side is going

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.719
to go to one of these ports on my router.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.180
I'm going to do the same with my PC.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.839
I'm going to take this port right here, and
the other side will go right to my router.

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:08.100
Now, what the router is doing right now is
giving both of the computers something called

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.600
IP Addresses, which is their numbers on the
network.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.610
These are the numbers that these computers
have, so that other computers can talk to

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.420
them, and know how to address them.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.590
The third thing you could do with your router
is connect it to the Internet, so that both

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.530
of these computers could also have Internet
access, and the way you do it is by hooking

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.160
up an Ethernet cable to the one port in the
back that looks different from all the other

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.160
ports.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.490
So, if you look at the back, there are four
ports that you can use for computers, and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.369
then there's one port usually marked as WAN,
or Internet, or Uplink, that we can take our

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.570
cable to.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.420
And then, the other side goes to our DSL or
cable modem and gives us Internet.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.960
And that's basically how we set up a simple
computer network.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.119
With a router, you can connect Macs and Pc's
on a combined network.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.070
And you don't really have too much headaches
and compatibility issues, because they all

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.759
use the same standard, and it just works.
