00:00:11.046 --> 00:00:13.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every school day
afternoon, several students

00:00:13.886 --> 00:00:16.986
from Bravo Medical Magnet High
School take a five-minute walk

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:20.066
to continue their education
on the campus of one

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.846
of the most prestigious
universities in the country.

00:00:24.486 --> 00:00:27.216
&gt;&gt;Lauren: Admitting, Valencia.

00:00:27.216 --> 00:00:27.796
Lauren speaking.

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:29.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Some of them
intern at the University

00:00:29.906 --> 00:00:32.886
of Southern California
Hospital, learning the ropes

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:34.116
of the medical office world.

00:00:34.176 --> 00:00:37.236
&gt;&gt;Echo cart, so just put CA.

00:00:38.006 --> 00:00:40.446
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A select group of
students in Bravo's Science,

00:00:40.526 --> 00:00:44.336
Technology, and Research
Program, STAR, and the Engineering

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:48.976
for Health Academy, EHA, work
in labs on the USC campus.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.446
&gt;&gt;Mark: The work we're doing
is taking a blind person

00:00:52.446 --> 00:00:54.256
and putting a computer
chip in their eye.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:57.916
And by doing so, this
computer chip allows them

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:00.106
to wirelessly connect to a camera.

00:01:00.786 --> 00:01:03.776
So the camera is worn in the
glasses and sends the information

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.986
to the brain, allowing
the blind person to see.

00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:09.736
&gt;&gt;Hardik: Basically, I'm going to be
putting different amounts of current

00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:14.566
through the resistor and measuring
the corresponding temperature

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.456
for that current.

00:01:15.936 --> 00:01:18.276
&gt;&gt;Mark: Education has to
be much more hands on.

00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:22.566
We can't continue to just
educate students in silos

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:28.686
and not integrate technologies in
this case into medical applications.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:30.336
&gt;&gt;What are you working on?

00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:33.086
&gt;&gt;Hardik: Right now, I'm just
trying to smooth out the output

00:01:33.286 --> 00:01:34.446
of this circuit right now--

00:01:34.556 --> 00:01:38.316
&gt;&gt;Mark: We're providing a very
unique laboratory environment

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:40.596
so students can come over here

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.576
and actually have a very
hands-on type of experience.

00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:46.916
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Bravo students
work with researchers

00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:50.366
and graduate students five days
a week during their senior year.

00:01:50.516 --> 00:01:52.716
&gt;&gt;Faizan: And I have been
testing my compounds,

00:01:52.796 --> 00:01:54.766
which are my drugs,
over and over again.

00:01:54.836 --> 00:01:56.386
And the compounds will tell us

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.946
if these compounds have any
sort of anti-cancer activity.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.506
So like if they basically--
trying to find a cure for cancer.

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:05.826
&gt;&gt;Joe: And so Faizan has
helped to contribute to--

00:02:06.026 --> 00:02:08.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Bravo physiology
teacher, Joe Cocozza,

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:11.806
helped establish the
partnerships between Bravo and USC.

00:02:11.806 --> 00:02:14.086
&gt;&gt;Joe: Well, these
are extremities too.

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: He now splits his
time teaching classes at Bravo

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:19.466
and doing outreach
for the university.

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:23.276
&gt;&gt;Joe: I talk to the principal
investigator, find out what kind

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.856
of research is being done there.

00:02:24.856 --> 00:02:29.196
Then I explain to them
carefully the time commitment

00:02:29.196 --> 00:02:30.676
that the students need to make.

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:35.456
The students are in lab
two hours a day minimally.

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.426
And the students have to understand

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.776
that they're actually
partaking in real research.

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:42.526
It's not a class, it's
not on a bell schedule.

00:02:42.866 --> 00:02:45.326
So that if they're in a
middle of a procedure,

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:47.176
they can't just get up and walk out.

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:51.636
&gt;&gt;Nouri: What our students are
doing today is testing the activity

00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:57.886
of several drugs that we
designed against HIV 1 integrase.

00:02:59.126 --> 00:03:00.996
These high school students
are very talented.

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:02.306
These are really cream of crop.

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:05.486
They are the best of the
best in the country, in fact.

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:09.736
When I was a high school student, I
would have been so happy just to go

00:03:09.736 --> 00:03:11.016
in the lab, wash the dishes.

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:14.926
But now, my students actually
are doing experiments.

00:03:14.926 --> 00:03:17.446
And these experiments are
really very high level,

00:03:17.506 --> 00:03:20.916
sophisticated experiments, just the
same experiments that the post docs

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:22.356
and graduate students are doing.

00:03:22.446 --> 00:03:25.276
So the high school students are
really-- this is fantastic for them.

00:03:25.406 --> 00:03:27.976
They can do very cool stuff.

00:03:28.426 --> 00:03:31.316
&gt;&gt;Joe: I think we have
a real commitment

00:03:31.356 --> 00:03:35.976
that it does take a
village to educate anyone.

00:03:36.326 --> 00:03:40.136
And so we envisioned
the outreach program

00:03:40.226 --> 00:03:44.916
at the Engineering Research Center
as having a brigade of mentors.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:46.646
&gt;&gt;Tino: And when it's such a
small amount, we really do need

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:48.836
to make sure that it's exact.

00:03:48.946 --> 00:03:51.166
&gt;&gt;Tino: I graduated
from Bravo in 1998.

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:54.516
Being a mentor to all the young
high school students that used to go

00:03:54.516 --> 00:03:58.826
through Bravo, I mean, it's kind
of completing a circle in that,

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:02.286
you know, I've received a lot of
mentorship and help or whatnot.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:05.626
And then now it makes me feel even
more grown to actually be able

00:04:05.626 --> 00:04:07.916
to teach the next generation
of scientists.

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:10.886
And hopefully they
decide to say in research,

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.516
because we really need their help.

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:16.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The relationship
with Bravo and other schools

00:04:16.186 --> 00:04:18.856
in the area is part
of USC's commitment

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:20.196
to serving the local community.

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:22.466
&gt;&gt;Hit the transfer button.

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:26.176
&gt;&gt;Cesar: This past year alone,
between the faculty, staff, doctors,

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:29.416
nurses, we've raised one point two
million out of our own pockets,

00:04:30.126 --> 00:04:32.316
and 100 percent of that goes
back into community programs.

00:04:32.786 --> 00:04:36.366
There's just a fundamental commitment
that USC's in for the long haul.

00:04:36.806 --> 00:04:37.916
We're not going anywhere.

00:04:37.996 --> 00:04:39.226
We know the schools
are not going anywhere.

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:42.026
And if there's a personnel
change, we reintroduce ourselves,

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:44.536
and that each year we're
coming back with the resources.

00:04:45.006 --> 00:04:46.546
Always seeking new resources.

00:04:47.006 --> 00:04:49.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As part of a grant from
the National Science Foundation,

00:04:50.236 --> 00:04:54.696
USC partnerships extend to elementary
school classrooms, where elementary,

00:04:54.696 --> 00:04:57.766
high school, and graduate
students learn from each other.

00:04:57.766 --> 00:05:02.176
&gt;&gt;Joe: And they're all doing
hands on, project-based learning,

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:04.436
and they're all helping one anothher.

00:05:05.376 --> 00:05:07.296
And it translates in both directions,

00:05:07.296 --> 00:05:12.116
because the older mentors are
teaching some of the skills

00:05:12.386 --> 00:05:15.016
and the content, but
they're also learning

00:05:15.136 --> 00:05:18.526
from the younger kids what
does it take to be able

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:23.076
to communicate effectively
to someone younger than you.

00:05:23.076 --> 00:05:26.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The USC-Bravo partnership
has accomplished much more

00:05:26.036 --> 00:05:29.676
than its primary goal of giving
high school students a window

00:05:29.676 --> 00:05:30.366
on their future.

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:32.076
&gt;&gt;Faizan: Bravo has been great.

00:05:32.366 --> 00:05:35.496
This is like the only place that
offers me a chance to work at a lab.

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:38.096
Basically, I was in
between pharmacology

00:05:38.096 --> 00:05:40.796
or pursue something else, and
this experience has helped me.

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:44.586
Yeah, it's actually pretty fun.

00:05:45.046 --> 00:05:47.216
