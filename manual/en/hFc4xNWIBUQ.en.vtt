00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.320
How to Make Green Pizza. This pizza is tasty
any time of the year, but its green color

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.000
makes it a fun treat for St. Patrick’s Day.
Especially if your family turns up their noses

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.290
at corned beef and cabbage! You will need
A food processor An electric mixer with dough

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:29.630
hook 2 clean dish towels A cheese grater A
baking sheet without sides A rolling pin 1

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.681
clove garlic 1/4 c. pine nuts 1 1/2 c. basil
1/2 c. grated parmesan cheese 1/4 tsp. salt

00:00:38.681 --> 00:00:51.330
1/3 to 1/2 c. extra virgin olive oil 1/4 oz.
active dry yeast All-purpose flour 1 c. warm

00:00:51.330 --> 00:01:02.430
water 1 tsp. salt Green food coloring 2 lb.
spinach 8 oz. mozzarella cheese 1 clove garlic

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.570
sliced as thin as possible 2 tbsp. olive oil
Salt and pepper 1 c. corn meal Ready-made

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.100
dough (optional) and store-bought pesto (optional).
Step 1. Begin the pesto by putting a clove

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.240
of garlic in the food processor and blend
it until fine. Step 2. Add pine nuts, basil,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.380
salt, and parmesan, and blend them until fine.
Step 3. While the machine is still running,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.549
slowly add the oil, mixing until it’s emulsified.
Put the mixture into a small bowl and set

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.450
it aside. Pesto can be kept for up to a week
if covered and refrigerated, but it’s better

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.601
to use it soon after preparing it. Step 4.
In a small bowl, whisk the yeast, a tablespoon

00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:55.760
of flour, and a quarter cup of warm water
(roughly between 105° and 115° F). Let it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.259
sit until foam develops, which shouldn’t
take more then 10 minutes. If it does, the

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.659
yeast is dead--start again with a fresh package.
Some grocery stores and pizza parlors sell

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:13.469
ready-made dough. Step 5. Mix salt, 1½ cups
of flour, the foamy mix, about 6 drops of

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:17.810
food coloring (depending on how green you
want it), and the rest of the water until

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.849
incorporated. Step 6. Add half a cup of flour.
The dough should not stick to you; if it does,

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.890
add more flour a little at a time, up to another
three-quarters of a cup. Step 7. Spread flour

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.549
on your work surface and begin to knead the
dough, making sure to add more flour when

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.299
dough begins to stick to you. Continue this
process until dough has an elastic quality

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:45.720
and feels smooth throughout. This should take
about 10 minutes. Step 8. Cut the dough into

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.689
two equal pieces, and mold each half into
a circle. Heavily sprinkle the dough and two

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:56.260
medium bowls with flour. Step 9. Put the dough
into the bowls, and cover them with damp dish

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.169
towels. Let the dough rise to twice its size;
this will not happen if dough is too cold,

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:07.939
so put it in a warm area. This should take
about an hour. Dough can be put into the refrigerator,

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:14.969
covered in plastic, and saved for 24 hours.
Step 10. Grate the cheese and set it aside.

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:20.260
Step 11. Put two tablespoons of olive oil
into a sauté pan over medium heat. Heat the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.410
sliced garlic until just slightly golden,
then add washed spinach to the pan and sauté

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.019
it until it’s just wilted. Turn off the
heat and set it aside. Step 12. Sprinkle a

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.659
layer of corn meal on a cookie sheet. Roll
out the dough to the desired thickness--ideally

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.980
9 inches around--adding additional flour if
the dough gets sticky. Press down with your

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.879
fingers, handling the dough as little as possible.
If you like your pizza dough thick, roll out

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:52.609
the dough less and cook it longer at a slightly
lower temperature. Step 13. Put the dough

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.340
onto your corn meal dusted cookie sheet. Place
a thick layer of pesto in the center of the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.829
dough, leaving an inch around the parameter.
Sprinkle on a quarter cup of mozzarella cheese,

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.499
half of the spinach, and then a quarter cup
of mozzarella cheese. Step 14. Pinch the outside

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:14.650
inch of the dough, pulling it slightly back
into the pie. Step 15. Put the dough into

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.410
a 375° oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until
golden brown. Repeat with the second pie,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.010
and serve! Did you know The traditional Irish
meal bacon and cabbage became corned beef

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.350
and cabbage in America because beef was more
plentiful.
