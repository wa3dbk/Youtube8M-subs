00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.029
Who would have guessed a rusty old table saw
blade could make such a nice batarang? In

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.169
this project we're turning some old shop accessories,
into high-speed, superhero throwing stars.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.789
After changing out this 10" saw blade, I wondered
what could be done with the old one. Then

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.490
the answer became obvious. Make a custom shuriken.
To get started on this project, we're gonna

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.050
need a paper template, and a stick of glue.
Let's go ahead and glue the picture directly

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.930
to the saw blade, smoothing out any creases,
and let it dry for about 10 minutes. Now we'll

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.530
need to fasten the blade securely to a table,
making sure there's something to protect the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.030
tabletop from the saw blade, because we'll
be cutting this pattern with a jig-saw. You

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.969
can see these jig-saw blades have 30 teeth
per inch and are made for cutting metal. Let's

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.649
start the blade in a groove between the teeth,
and begin cutting the straight lines first.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.050
Now Iâ€™m cutting very slowly, because I don't
have any oil to dissipate the heat, and going

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.610
too fast could ruin the blade within minutes.
You can see I continued a straight line all

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.140
the way across the top, giving easy access
to the more intricate cuts inside. The tight

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.230
curves are gonna take a lot of time and patience,
but with some persistence, you should end

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.800
up with something like this, although it does
look a little rough around the edges. To fix

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.020
that, let's gather up a couple of half-round
metal files. I'm gonna use my bench vise to

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.190
hold the batarang for better leverage, and
here you can see it definitely looks terrible.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.230
But let's go ahead anyway, and use the flat
side of the small file to begin grinding down

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.810
the sharp points. The contours can be worked
with the rounded edge, and after a few minutes

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.910
you can already start to see a noticeable
improvement. The larger file helps smooth

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.200
and shape the bottom curves, and the goal
here is to make everything symmetrical. Now,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.920
if we carefully file the edges at an angle,
you can see it adds a bit of a bevel to the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.170
top of the wing. I angled both sides of the
wing tips to make them look sharper, and seem

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.540
a bit more authentic. This actually looks
pretty awesome in silver, but let's go one

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.310
step further and paint it black. Now if we
push the wingtip into a piece of cardboard,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.410
the batarang should stand upright, and we
can hit it with a few shots of spray paint.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.700
Make sure it's the kind that can be used on
metal, and after a couple of hours, the paint

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.049
should be dry enough to handle. At this point,
it's nearly finished, and you might be thinking

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.730
I forgot to paint the tip. But watch what
happens if we use something like sandpaper

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.129
or a sanding sponge on the beveled edges.
It re-exposes the steel, blending the unpainted

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:26.480
tip with the outer edges once again. Our superhero
shuriken is completely finished, and we don't

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.379
even have to sharpen the blade. I went ahead
and built a throwing post from a length of

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.200
2x8, and added a dart board, to use for a
target. Now, to throw a batarang, just take

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.049
3 paces away from the target, hold it by the
bottom wing, and throw it with a bit of a

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.650
flick in the wrist. If you did it right, it
should make one full rotation and stick firmly

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.209
into the target. Now if you adjust your distance
in small increments, you'll eventually find

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.540
the sweet spot where it sticks perfectly upright,
just about every time. A distance of 3 steps

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.700
equals 1 full rotation, so from 6 paces it
should spin twice. Now it's important to be

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.180
safe when handling these things, and they
should be treated with the same respect as

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.719
a throwing knife or a throwing star. You can
see that after two hours of practicing, my

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:11.389
target took an incredible beating, because
these are the real deal. Using this method,

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.349
I was able to make 5 batarangs from the one
saw blade, and you can see I made each one

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.889
a little bit different. Well now you know
how to turn rusty old saw blades, into a collection

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:25.029
of custom superhero throwing stars. Just remember
to be safe, and never to throw them at people,

00:03:25.029 --> 00:03:29.409
or property. That's it for now. If you liked
this project, perhaps you'll like some 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.869
