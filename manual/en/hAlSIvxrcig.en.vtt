Hi this is Alia and welcome back to cooking with Alia to 
 show you the mix of the flavors of Morocco 

00:00:12.313 --> 00:00:18.738
Today, we're going to an amazing, delicious dish 
 of Salmon and sweet potatoes Moroccan style

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:21.169
First, we're going to use a Tagine 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.134
which is a Morrocan clay pot used for slow cooking

00:00:24.134 --> 00:00:28.863
Second, we're going to use an amazing spice blend called Ras-El-Hanout 

00:00:28.863 --> 00:00:33.153
Ras-El-Hanout literally means the head of the shop and it's very famous in Morocco

00:00:33.153 --> 00:00:36.765
Every spice shop in Morocco usually have their own blend 

00:00:36.765 --> 00:00:39.995
and sometimes it has more than 30 spices in it

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:44.412
This show is so simple, delicious and out of this world

00:00:44.412 --> 00:00:49.249
If you need the ingredients and the written recipe, there 
 are below the video in the "About" section

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.249
This is the dish that you will remember. Let's Start!!!

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:56.342
First, we are going to prepare the marinade.

00:00:56.342 --> 00:01:02.512
 In a large bowl, add freshly squeezed lemon juice, olive oil, honey

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:06.935
and Ras-El-Hanout – a staple Moroccan spice blend! 

00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:09.127
Combine together.

00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:16.301
Now add a large pinch of saffron threads, that you 
 crush between your fingers, salt, and pepper.  

00:01:16.301 --> 00:01:19.779
Add a little bit of water and mix well. 

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:22.641
Our marinade is ready! 

00:01:22.641 --> 00:01:25.913
Look at these beautiful Salmon pieces.

00:01:25.913 --> 00:01:29.961
Place the fillets in the marinade, cover the bowl with a plastic wrap

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:34.181
and marinate the salmon in the fridge for at least one hour. 

00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:39.068
Once you are ready to cook the Salmon, 
 let’s prepare the rest of the ingredients.

00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.820
Peel, cut, and thinly slice the onion. 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.590
Peel the sweet potatoes and thinly slice them as well. 

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:53.590
I am using a tagine, the famous Moroccan 
 clay pot used for slow cooking. 

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:58.240
If you don’t have one, you can use a regular cooking pot. 

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:02.020
Drizzle some olive oil in the bottom part of the tagine, 

00:02:02.017 --> 00:02:08.020
add the onions, a pinch of salt, and 
 a few branches of fresh cilantro. 

00:02:08.016 --> 00:02:11.670
Place the tagine on low heat, cover

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:17.470
and let cook for around 5 minutes or until 
 the onion slices start sweating a bit. 

00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.780
Notice that I am using a plain clay tagine 

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:26.920
if yours is decorated and colorful, then it’s not for cooking just for presentation!

00:02:26.922 --> 00:02:31.840
Once the onion slices start sweating, it’s time to add the sweet potatoes. 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.600
Remove the Salmon pieces from the marinade and reserve. 

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:40.770
Dip the sweet potato slices into the marinade 
 before placing them in the tagine. 

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:45.100
Then pour the marinade over the potatoes and onion. 

00:02:45.103 --> 00:02:50.020
Cover the tagine and continue cooking for around 30 minutes on low heat

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:52.630
until the potatoes start becoming soft. 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:03:00.960
Now add the salmon pieces on top of the potato 
 slices and a final touch, add the raisins around.

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:08.100
Cover your tagine and let cook for 45 
 minutes to 1 hour on low heat.

00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:17.060
Cooking in a tagine is all about slow cooking, and don’t worry, 
 the salmon will not be overcooked it will be just perfect!

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:20.600
And that’s the magic of a tagine pot…

00:03:20.597 --> 00:03:28.430
However, remember, it has to cook on low heat; otherwise, 
 you will burn the bottom layer of the ingredients.

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.280
From time to time, check on the ingredients

00:03:32.285 --> 00:03:37.450
 tile the tagine and pour some of the 
 sauce on top of the salmon and potatoes

00:03:37.452 --> 00:03:42.310
But don't move the ingredients. Keep them as they are.

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:46.430
And that’s it, don’t move anything, don’t add anything…

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:54.780
just wait until the potatoes are cooked and become soft… then serve hot! 

00:03:54.775 --> 00:04:05.800
Look at this deliciously cooked to perfection salmon with 
 sweet potato, raisins, in a honey spiced sauce…

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.360
all you need is some crusty bread!

00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:12.550
Bon appetite!!!
