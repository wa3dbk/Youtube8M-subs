Let me see if we can do this in one take.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.450
Artist, producer, and filmmaker Kurt Hugo
Schneider has one of the most popular music

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.000
channels on YouTube.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.180
(B-roll)
This epic Bruno Mars Medley staring Mac Schneider

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.670
and Victoria Justice is a prime reason why.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.350
Tell me about the process of putting together
this video.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.800
It seems very intricate and complex.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.839
It started with me just walking though Max’s
house with my little notebook and like writing

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:42.280
down what was going to happen at each moment
and then we drew it out, so I literally drew

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.969
out the path that each person was going to
have to take because once the camera leaves

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.290
a person, once a person gets off of frame,
they literally got to run to their next stop

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:58.179
because you just saw them and then you see
them 5 seconds later and it’s almost impossible

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.100
but its not and its just riding that line
of how close you can get to it seeming impossible

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.300
to do it in one take and still working.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.760
Did this feel like a turning point video when
you were making it?

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.250
When we were making it I think we were mostly
focused just on having fun and also making

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.610
something cool but at the same time I did
believe that one take videos like this weren’t

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.100
anything like I’ve seen on YouTube and I
believe in new stuff, its innovative and cool,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:30.190
does rise to the top on YouTube so I did feel
like it could go big, it could go viral

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.241
So do any comments stand out to you in the
video?

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:38.670
Probably the most common comment is its not
one take, its edited or something to that

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.670
extent.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.360
I’m glad that they think it is good enough
to merit the fact that, I guess merit the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.770
un-believability that it is all done in one
shot

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.770
Do you hate that person that messes up the
tape like you guys had it done perfectly and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.909
then there is like that one person that Ughh
Yes but the thing is sometimes it is me too

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.370
so like everyone is that person sometimes.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.360
So how many takes are we talking about?

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.680
The thing is you only need to get it done
once though.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.629
So every take before that someone messed up.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:17.900
(B-roll)
You almost stop thinking of it in terms of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.569
number of takes, its just like the hours that
we have been filming so its like, well we’ve

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.439
been filming for three hours, I don’t know
how many takes we’ve managed to run in that

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.819
time, but three hours.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.599
I’m honestly not sure.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.720
Nascargamer comments: WTF Mac points to Kurt
when he said, “I think I want to marry you”

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.870
lol
(B-roll)

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.739
Well 
I would have to watch that moment again.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:56.010
I am assuming that he meant to point to Victoria,
but I don’t know, the world may never know.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.900
(B-roll edited)
Of the nearly 30 thousand comments on this

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.840
video, my favorite was a simple “wow”.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.299
Trisha Hershberger: I always try to shoot
in just one take, but not because I am super

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:13.120
talented, actually the opposite, it’s because
I am really bad at editing.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.579
Joe Bereta: Even attempting this type of video
is baller

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.159
Jimmy Wong: Kurk puts a ton of time into the
actual production.

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.090
Put some headphones on and listen to one of
his songs and they sound amazing.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.379
Trisha Hershberger: Cute, young, and talented,
yes please!

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:48.979
I’m Kurk Hugo Schneider and I made that
video.
