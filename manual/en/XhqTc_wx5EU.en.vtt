00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:07.279
A modern roundabout in the center of
Amsterdam.

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:14.689
It is a perfect circle
with a circular cycle path all around it.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.810
When you cycle there you have priority
over motor traffic.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.960
Which is clear from the shark's teeth
pointing towards motor traffic.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.599
It is very busy.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:36.350
There are many cars...

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.350
buses... trucks...

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.450
but there is a good flow of all traffic
including bicycles.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.260
The only time everything has to stop
is when a tram is approaching

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.400
the tram has the right of way over all
other traffic,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.200
and the tram tracks cut right through
the middle of the roundabout.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.770
The speed of the flow is generally high.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.570
Cars only have to yield to cyclists
when they leave the roundabout.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.979
But they are not in the way of other motor
traffic

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.050
on the roundabout.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:26.050
So the flow never really comes to a full
stop.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.220
Sometimes cyclists yield slightly

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.570
so everything can run smoothly.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.570
But the moment a cyclist hesitates,
other traffic will go first instead.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.520
Sometimes people on bikes have to make
sure the drivers stop,

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.240
by looking them in the eyes.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.790
People do signal out of courtesy

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.289
but not everybody signals.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.649
Forcing motor traffic to wait in vain.

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.309
Some cyclists signal motor traffic to go
first,

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:19.949
like this man telling the bus to go.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:26.949
Although he has the right of way.

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.639
Probably thinking of his kids, this
father signals a scooter to go first.

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:38.979
But the scooter rider shouts: 
"No, YOU go first!"

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.739
The advantages of face-to-face
communication.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.019
Children can navigate the roundabout on
their own little bicycles.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.719
That's how easy it is to ride here.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:58.959
Smaller kids are usually helped a bit
by their parents.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:08.509
And very small children are on their
parents' bikes or in a bakfiets.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:23.469
These roundabouts are also very easy for
people with disabilities.

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.679
When drivers do need to stop for any
reason

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:40.329
they should keep the cycle track open.

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.689
And most do.

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.919
So the flow of cyclists can continue.

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:49.869
The design is such that when a standard sized
car stops for other motor traffic

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:59.699
the cycle track will be kept clear just behind it,
automatically.

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:03.559
Dutch design roundabouts may seem
complicated on schematics,

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:06.069
but actually using them is really very
easy.
