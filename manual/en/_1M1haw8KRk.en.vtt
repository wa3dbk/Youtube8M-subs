00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.440
Ahhhh... isn't it great being at the local
zoo?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.320
Not if you're THAT guy.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.110
Come oooon, we can learn more about animals
here...

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.670
like did you know that one way dolphins communicate
is by breaching?

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.470
That's where they jump out of the water and
make a splash.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.980
Yea, right!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.240
See? You would've never believed it unless
you saw it with your own eyes.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.480
That's why I'm glad zoos are around.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.100
They teach us in ways that books and other
media can't.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.840
Yea, but look at the size of that tank...

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.320
call me crazy, but isn't the ocean a liiiiittle
bit bigger than that?

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.920
I mean, look at the poor dolphins!
It's like they're in jail!

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.800
Zoos are so unnatural that many animals trapped
in zoos suffer from ZOOCHOSIS.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.880
It's an actual mental illness suffered by
animals held in captivity!

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.080
So, what do you want to do?
Close them all down?

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.240
Look, the only reason zoos care about the
animals is to make money off of them 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.680
in the short-term.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.820
They don't care at all about their long-term
well-being.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.240
Plus, zoos restrict animals' natural tendencies
and cause them to be dependent on us humans!

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.140
Because of this, animals that have lived in
zoos can't adapt or even survive

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.460
if they are released into the wild.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.360
That's exactly my point!

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.880
Because that little guy couldn't survive in
the wild, he needs the zoo's help.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.440
Zoos are also helpful for conversing endangered
species such as... the Hector's Dolphin.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.200
Did you know, there are only 7,000 of them
alive today!

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.080
Zoos can breed them and help increase their
population!

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.780
Hold on, hold on...

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.660
Let's just ask them.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.460
Sure, why not?

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.180
Do YOU want to keep animals out of this heavenly
PARADISE?

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.280
He means, do you wanna keep the animals locked
in JAILS?
