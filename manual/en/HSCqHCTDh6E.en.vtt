00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.640
This video will provide you with an
overview

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.099
of effective steering techniques, hand
positioning,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.610
the use of indicators and important
safety checks

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.000
whilst driving. For the pull-push and
hand over hand steering techniques

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.519
start with your hands either in the 10 to 2

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.740
or quarter to 3 positions on the
steering wheel like a clock face

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.439
when using the pull-push technique your
hand should not cross

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.440
to turn right you'll be pulling down with
the right hand

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.430
and pushing up with the left. To turn
left

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.930
the left hand will pull down while the right
hand will push the steering wheel up

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
The hand over hand technique is performed
by turning the steering wheel

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.460
approximately

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.620
ninety degrees in the direction at the
turn with both hands

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
The lower hand then turns over the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.160
other hand to the 12 o'clock position,
the other hand then follows

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.100
the process can be repeated to complete
the turn. Ensure your hands

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.159
remain on the outside at the rim on the
steering wheel

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.840
and use both hands to steer at all
times

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.790
unless you're operating the vehicle
controls or when reversing

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.890
Be aware of the position

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.420
of the front wheels when moving off from
a stationary position

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.720
and avoid turning the steering wheel
when the vehicle is stationary

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.450
whenever

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.140
moving a vehicle from stationary,
turning,

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.470
merging or changing lanes, it's important
to use your indicators

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.930
When moving left or right ensure the
correct indicator is used to signal

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.030
surrounding traffic

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.290
of your intentions for a minimum of
5 seconds

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.729
before completing the manouevre. Ensure
you've checked side and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.189
rear mirrors and completed a blind spot
check

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.420
by turning your head before moving the
vehicle

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.820
by ensuring you complete these
procedures

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.319
and safety checks you'll maintain a
safe environment for yourself

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.180
and other drivers when ever you're
behind the wheel

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.870
so stay safe and happy driving

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.550
