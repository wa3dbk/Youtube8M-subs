00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:04.750
I'm doctor Turi King

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm a geneticist at the University of
Leicester and a lecturer in genetics and archeology there.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.900
Genetics is pretty fundamental, it's the
sort of thing it can tell you about genetic makeup of populations in the past.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.900
It can also tell you about disease genes and how the frequencies of those have changed over time. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.500
I mean I think it's just a fundamental subject, it tells us about where we came from and how we've evolved through time.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.330
Hi, I'm Matthew Morris I'm an archaeologist for the
University of Leicester.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.620
Richard III is notable for a number of reasons but he's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.480
he is notable because he's the last King
at the Plantagenet Dynasty in England,

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.350
he's the last English King to die in battle 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.950
and thanks to Shakespeare's play about him,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
he's this semi mythical figure, this vile evil tyrant

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.000
that attracts lots of popular myths and legends and makes him this really interesting character to study.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.430
So when we started looking for Richard
in 2012

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.059
and the church that he'd been buried in,
we could have encountered hundreds of

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.260
human remains buried in that church and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.400
it was being able to separate one out of that mass of human remains that was going to be difficult. 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.740
The identification process for Richard III

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.000
is like any forensic case, it's not based on
one sole strand of evidence alone

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.500
you have to take everything into account
from the archaeology to the analysis of the skeleton itself. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.700
The bones, trauma on the bones, all the injuries he'd received in battle to

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.030
carbon dating the remains to make
sure that this skeleton was someone who'd died

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.300
around about 1485. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.090
Being able to sequence the DNA of somebody who was alive all those many years ago, one of our genetic cousins,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.540
that's been one of the the really big
landmark discoveries and also this

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.910
next generation sequencing technology
which now allows us to look

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.500
in-depth at DNA of individuals in the past.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You couldn't prove it was Richard III on any one strand of evidence but when you put it all together

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.500
the answer we came up with is it
can't be anyone else, it has to be Richard III.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.300
The public's reaction to the discovery
has been amazing.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.800
 I don't think going into this project we had

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.600
any concept of how amazing it would be
and how global it would be. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.200
It seems to have caught
everybody's imagination, this story.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.570
I'm really interested in
doing some more work on Richard some of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.600
the things you can do is looking at things like DNA from a catalyst, the stuff that the dentist scrapes off

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.650
when you go to the dentist. Actually in
there you can get a lot

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.450
of DNA and you can look at things like
Richard's diet and things like that,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.880
but also doing wider studies looking at the
peopling of Britain 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.100
using ancient DNA to look at remains of individuals

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.209
from the period I think
would be a really interesting thing to do.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.080
I think it's an emerging field
essentially, the new technologies

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.800
are allowing us to do so much more now, so we're at the start of a real wave

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.900
of being able to use genetics to look at ancient events in the past.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.500
I get asked what's next a lot of times,
how can you top finding a King of England?

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.000
The big thing will probably be more of the same, it's whole genome sequencing 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.000
of individuals from the past

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.480
and that's really cool because you
can look at the genetic makeup

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.810
of populations but you can also look at how
the frequency of particular genes have changed

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.500
through time which is really interesting.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.349
Whenever there's a new building going up in Leicester or in

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.440
England, I might be one of
those archaeologists out there

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.849
excavating it and that's the fun bit because
you never know

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.540
what you're going to find next. It could be absolutely nothing

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.620
but it could be another King of England,
you don't know

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.349
you just don't know what's going to be under the ground and that's the fun of it
