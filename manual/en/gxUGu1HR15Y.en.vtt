00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:08.490
This is a couch stitch, or a vertical hemming
stitch. This one also will be invisible on

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.249
the front side. This is a hemming technique,
and it's rather simple, and it creates a little

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:26.230
pattern. So, what we're going to do is start
off again, hiding our original knot. Then

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:39.310
we pick up a bit--just a little bit, and we're
going to go into that hem from there. And

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:51.240
then once again, we're going to pick up a
bit on the--on the top of the hem, and then

00:00:51.240 --> 00:01:03.890
back down into that hem. Once again, moving
an eighth of an inch over, picking up a little

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:47.119
bit, and then--whoops. Going into our hem,
moving over. So what we're going to have is

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:54.999
that kind of pattern and it's going to be
invisible on the other side, and it's stuck

00:01:54.999 --> 00:02:02.679
onto there like that. And this is good. This
is a very strong hem; it just keeps everything

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.560
in there, in my opinion. Couch stitch.
