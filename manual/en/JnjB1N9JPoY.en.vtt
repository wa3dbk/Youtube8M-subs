Ciao everyone, here it's Marchettino,

00:00:01.928 --> 00:00:07.339
today I'm with the Alfa Romeo 4C test car and I've decided to visit my friends at Autodromo di Modena,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.960
they've been kind enough to give me all their track just for me!

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.780
I mean, how cool is that?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.400
One empty track, just the Alfa Romeo, let's go and have some fun with it!

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.340
Honeslty, I didn't expected today to drive the car around the track,

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:43.280
I was here to film a Pagani Zonda and the director of the track that is a friend of mine just invited me to go inside and have some fun!

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.440
I don't have the track helmet, I have just this Panama hat and I'm not sure if it would make a difference, anyway

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.440
First gear

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.780
Race mode engaged

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.860
now

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.920
which turns off the traction and stability control and yeah, let's go!

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.280
That was maybe a bit too much!

00:01:49.578 --> 00:01:53.418
Hopefully, I'm the only person and car around the track so

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.460
there is room for mistakes and doing more stupid things!

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.540
I'm just here to have fun!

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.700
No lap times, nothing!

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.500
Just pure fun!

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.000
The whole track just for myself, that was absolutely epic, thank you Autodromo di Modena!

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.140
That was much fun driving the 4C with the traction and stability control off,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.100
it would have been too dangerous doing something like this on a public road,

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.800
this is the perfect place for doing such stupid and fun things!

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.220
I think I will let the car cool down for a couple of minutes because it's bloody hot!

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.260
Not sure about the tires,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.640
I don't know what Alfa Romeo will say when I will return the car but

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.400
that was fun! Once again, thanks Autodromo di Modena!

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.740
And also.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.520
Don't take seriously my driving skills of this video,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.936
I was just driving to have some genuine fun.

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.740
I hope you guys did enjoy the video

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.899
