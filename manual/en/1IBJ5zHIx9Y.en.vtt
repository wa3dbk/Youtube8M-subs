00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:28.865
When I started skateboarding,

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.150
my father was
a Santos FC fanatic fan,

00:00:31.296 --> 00:00:32.908
he used to come to Vila Belmiro
all the time.

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.583
When I started skateboarding,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.787
all my skateboards...

00:00:37.788 --> 00:00:39.382
had a Santos FC logo.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.723
From that moment...

00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:44.578
my passion began.

00:00:44.842 --> 00:00:47.232
I started skateboarding
when I was 8,

00:00:48.712 --> 00:00:54.068
and I used to come here
with my skateboard,

00:00:54.663 --> 00:00:56.088
and then...

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:58.813
everything got connected,
you know?

00:00:58.814 --> 00:01:02.428
It was, like, a very positive
vibe, you know?

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:04.619
Between skateboarding and soccer.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.942
skateboarding and Santos FC,

00:01:06.426 --> 00:01:10.334
there is no explanation.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:14.586
THE BEGINNING

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.531
It was hard, because...

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:20.154
there weren't many sponsors...

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:21.390
in the past,

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:23.117
my father used to work a lot,

00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:25.332
and we had to go
to São Paulo...

00:01:25.566 --> 00:01:27.356
to compete and so on.

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:28.850
So, like,

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:33.218
the beginning of my career,
as an amateur, was really tough,

00:01:33.616 --> 00:01:34.857
and as a professional too.

00:01:34.858 --> 00:01:37.992
So, I had to move step by step.

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.395
I went through some bad moments,

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:43.101
a lot of them,

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:46.983
I slept in a bus station,
in several places like that,

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:50.725
along with my friends
and my father as well.

00:01:51.016 --> 00:01:56.475
We had to be
in the competition at 5 am,

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:57.306
so...

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.341
we used to look for hotels,
but they were always fully booked,

00:02:00.342 --> 00:02:01.451
and there were several
people sleeping.

00:02:01.769 --> 00:02:03.401
"What will we do?"

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.189
"Let's sleep in the bus station,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.547
let's sleep here."

00:02:06.657 --> 00:02:08.526
We used to sleep in the bus station.

00:02:08.724 --> 00:02:10.262
We didn't have money to eat,

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:14.415
we used to have breakfast
and dinner only,

00:02:14.683 --> 00:02:16.076
we went through
several bad moments.

00:02:16.668 --> 00:02:19.755
THE FIRST PRIZE

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:22.265
My father used to say
that I had to study,

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.149
and I used to say it wouldn't be
possible to conciliate both,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.077
and he used to say it would.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.240
I decided to study
and to skateboard,

00:02:30.515 --> 00:02:32.381
my father always motivated me,

00:02:32.382 --> 00:02:34.982
everything happened
thanks to my dad.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.878
We disputed a competition
in Mauá city,

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.022
in São Paulo,

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.657
I won it and the prize
was a brand new motorcycle,

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.263
like, it wasn't a great one.

00:02:48.717 --> 00:02:52.396
We sold it,

00:02:52.397 --> 00:02:55.850
and I told my father
I wanted to buy an iPod.

00:02:56.237 --> 00:02:57.968
He said:

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.524
"Take your money."

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:02.348
The first time I actually saw
the money in my hands,

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.907
I said:

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:05.251
"Wow, is this money mine?"

00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:06.286
Then I said:

00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:09.221
"I can make money skateboarding,

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:12.000
and I will make a living out of it."

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:16.572
Two weeks later
I won another motorcycle,

00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:17.736
which I also sold,

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:19.560
and then I bought another iPod,

00:03:19.561 --> 00:03:20.840
and so on.

00:03:21.258 --> 00:03:25.693
I'm addicted to iPods,
music.

00:03:25.694 --> 00:03:27.711
From that moment...

00:03:27.712 --> 00:03:30.183
I decided to be
a professional skateboarder...

00:03:30.184 --> 00:03:31.985
and live my life.

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:34.602
FOUR-TIME WORLD CHAMPION

00:03:34.821 --> 00:03:38.230
During my first year
as a professional...

00:03:38.438 --> 00:03:40.361
I didn't have money to travel,

00:03:40.362 --> 00:03:42.679
we had to pay for the trips
in installments,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.899
and I said I'd make it
to the finals,

00:03:45.987 --> 00:03:49.175
10 people would dispute the title.

00:03:49.347 --> 00:03:50.737
Then I went to Europe,

00:03:50.738 --> 00:03:53.170
where I disputed the World Cup
for the first time,

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:56.065
and I ended up as the winner.

00:03:56.348 --> 00:04:00.744
Then I started to think
about several things,

00:04:00.745 --> 00:04:02.857
my father kept calling me,

00:04:02.858 --> 00:04:04.040
he was extremely happy.

00:04:04.182 --> 00:04:06.674
There were two more phases,

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.391
it was the first time I disputed
the competition, back in 2011,

00:04:09.627 --> 00:04:13.734
I won the second
and the third phases,

00:04:13.735 --> 00:04:17.350
and I ended up as a world champion
for the first time.

00:04:17.562 --> 00:04:20.434
The second year was a little harder,

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:24.677
because I disputed almost
all phases while I was injured,

00:04:24.924 --> 00:04:26.281
I sprained my feet...

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.502
and broke my knee,

00:04:28.911 --> 00:04:31.056
by the end of 2011,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.599
and that disturbed things
a little by the end of 2011.

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:39.476
In 2012,
I managed to...

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:43.038
come in second place
in most events disputed,

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:45.152
since I was not completely fit,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.165
but I managed to win
the World Cup.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.749
When I won the World Cup
for the third and fourth times,

00:04:52.784 --> 00:04:55.554
I was already training,

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:58.193
so, it was very easy
to win those titles.

00:04:58.964 --> 00:05:02.210
PARTNERSHIP WITH SANTOS FC

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.477
I'm very honored
to be a Santos FC partner,

00:05:06.582 --> 00:05:11.321
I've had this dream
since I was in my mother's womb,

00:05:11.322 --> 00:05:15.329
it's very pleasing to be
a Santos FC partner, you know?

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.826
To be able come here,
to sit here,

00:05:18.523 --> 00:05:20.145
it's beautiful,

00:05:20.146 --> 00:05:23.601
to watch all Santos FC matches,
I don't miss any of them,

00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:26.703
I'm a Santos FC fanatic fan.

00:05:26.704 --> 00:05:28.029
So,

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.868
I'm really thankful
for this partnership,

00:05:32.883 --> 00:05:34.448
let's keep moving forward,
towards the fifth title!

00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:41.281
I'm aiming the fifth title,

00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:45.330
I've been training
since last year,

00:05:45.331 --> 00:05:47.119
the competition ended in October,

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.681
and I've been working
ever since,

00:05:48.907 --> 00:05:52.357
there are several
new athletes appearing,

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:55.824
many 15 and 16 year-old boys,

00:05:55.825 --> 00:05:59.105
and they are craving the title,

00:05:59.106 --> 00:06:01.270
just like I did four years ago,

00:06:01.815 --> 00:06:04.211
so, it's going to be
very hard,

00:06:05.847 --> 00:06:09.226
but I'll do my best to bring
the title home once again.

00:06:09.601 --> 00:06:10.735
Hey, guys,

00:06:10.736 --> 00:06:14.257
I'm Kelvin Hoefler,
a professional skateboarder,

00:06:15.306 --> 00:06:18.019
and I'd like to thank
all the fans...

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.230
for the support
they gave me this year...

00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:23.295
and during the last 4 years...

00:06:23.296 --> 00:06:24.767
I've been a Santos FC partner.

00:06:24.994 --> 00:06:26.303
That's it,

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:27.350
thanks!
