00:00:06.457 --> 00:00:11.012
We scheduled 3,689 final exams at University Park alone.

00:00:12.565 --> 00:00:16.918
Last year, tha faculty taught 30,669 class sections.

00:00:16.918 --> 00:00:21.996
And awarded 18,326 degrees university wide.

00:00:21.996 --> 00:00:24.725
And 2.5 million ice cream cones were eaten.

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:28.871
After all those classes, everyone needs a treat.

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:31.908
Thank you.
You're welcome, have a good day!

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:33.749
Good stuff!

00:00:33.749 --> 00:00:38.982
Penn State faculty members are making an impact on the world, one student at a time.

00:00:38.982 --> 00:00:41.987
At Penn State School of International Affairs,

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:49.134
Dr. Tiyanjana Maluwa is helping prepare graduate students to take leadership positions in the increasingly

00:00:49.134 --> 00:00:56.938
interconnected and global society. His experience as legal adviser to the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for

00:00:56.938 --> 00:01:03.169
Human Rights provides a unique perspective on the challenges faced around the world.

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:09.685
Our primary interest is in training students to understand the imperatives

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:14.659
and the qualities of leadership from an international perspective.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.100
We have quite a number of  students who are doing internships in other countries.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.668
We have a student in Israel working with communities in a kibbutz,

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:31.010
we have a student in Germany, who is working with an institute that deals with security issues,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:36.102
and we have a student right here in the United States who is working with peace keeping operations.

00:01:36.102 --> 00:01:41.059
Penn State has always been in the forefront of producing leaders,

00:01:41.059 --> 00:01:47.186
and I think the School of International Affairs can only  contribute to the production of more leaders as we go along.

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:55.074
At Penn State Brandywine, distinguished professor of political science, Dr. Stephen Cimbala,

00:01:55.074 --> 00:02:02.527
is helping shape the fields of international security studies, defense policy, and intelligence.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:04.920
I have two main goals for my students:

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.112
I want them to be able to connect dots across different kinds of readings, different kinds of concepts,

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:17.735
the second thing would be, I hope students come out of my classes feeling a sense of a more responsible citizenship,

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:27.152
more willing to vote, to take part in the political process, to join a political party, to campaign, or running for congress.

00:02:27.152 --> 00:02:29.449
You know, wouldn't that be wonderful.
