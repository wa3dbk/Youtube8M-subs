00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.240
Hi everyone!

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Kristina here.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.100
Welcome to another Make a Card Monday video.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.350
Today I'm taking part in the blog hop for
the October 2014 Card Kit from Simon Says

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.710
Stamp, and I have this little stamp image
that I've already colored.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.530
I did it in a previous video--you're seeing
a little bit of footage from that video right

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.630
now--so I'll have a link on screen where you
can click over to see the entire coloring

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.630
of this image.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.610
But I'm just going to take that image and
create a card using the supplies from the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:46.610
card kit.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.690
So I'm starting out with some Neenah Desert
Storm cardstock and I've cut it to 4.25" x

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.640
11" long and then scored it at 5.5" to create
a top-folding card.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.000
I then took this little talk bubble from the
stamp set and stamped it in Dark Chocolate

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.049
ink from Simon Says Stamp.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.630
I wanted to test it to make sure I could emboss
on top of it because I did it once and it

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.470
stuck everywhere.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.950
I heat set that and then I just put some white
embossing powder on it, tested it, and I figured

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.480
out that it was okay.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.909
So then I used my EK Success Powder Tool and
stamped the "You Mocha Me Crazy" greeting

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.700
from the stamp set in some VersaMark Ink,
coated it in white embossing powder from Hero

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.479
Arts, and heat set that until it was melted.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.950
I trimmed it out using some scissors, and
I left a little tiny bit of a margin just

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.170
outside of that talk bubble because I wanted
to emphasize that shape.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.109
Now I have some Inkadinkado Stamping Mask
paper.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.079
I'm just drawing a curved line.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.280
I could have used the Simon die, the A2 Card
Curved Edge die, but I was just doing this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.579
on the fly really quick so I just cut out
a little curved edge.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.170
Sketched it out with my pencil and then cut
it out.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.009
Then I placed it on the card and I used my
grid mat beneath my card base here to make

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.440
sure that it was on there straight.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.840
Now I'm using some Simon Says Stamp Khaki
ink.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.450
This ink is included in the card kit, and
it happens to look really great on top of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.840
kraft cardstock.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.660
So I thought I would take this circle with
a heart inside stamp from the stamp set and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.260
create a pattern at the bottom.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.070
Since I masked that off it creates a little
curved line for the background behind this

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.870
stamped image that I've cut out.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.790
I applied foam adhesive on the back of this
girl here, and placed her right over top of

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.220
that stamped area.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.450
Then I'm going to take that talk bubble and
put that right on top.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.460
And because she's already on foam adhesive,
I needed to put a second layer of adhesive

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.260
just underneath on the right side there.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:00.530
I'm going to add some dashed lines to accentuate
that area all the way around her.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.650
And that's going to be the card for today.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.950
Now, I did do two cards with this card kit.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.790
I'm going to show you the second card.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.430
And unfortunately, I didn't realize that my
camera wasn't recording and I looked up halfway

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.750
through and was like "Oh, crap."

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.090
You know?

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.270
But I still wanted to show you guys the card
so I thought I would just include the last

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.970
half of the card and I'll kind of walk you
through what I did on this card.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.910
So here we go.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.910
We're going to jump right in.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.490
So what I did was...

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.680
From that stamp set, there's these coffee
cups and I stamped them all in Memento Ink

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.090
and I did six on them, creating this pattern
going across the top right corner.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.180
Then I stamped in different colors of Memento
Ink all the little elements from the stamp

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.250
set.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.140
The base colors of the mugs, and the "Java
Great Day", and the heart that you've seen

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.420
on the previous card.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.030
Then I took my Warm Gray markers from Copic
and I started to draw in or color in some

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.680
shading on those mugs.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.770
And also I created a shadow coming down from
the mugs just because I thought it would look

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.770
cool.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.970
Looked like they were backlit or something
like that.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.980
So I took some patterned paper from the card
kit and I put that on the very bottom.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.730
I also mounted this one some white cardstock
for the card base.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.880
And I rounded the top corners as well.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:28.090
Now I'm going to be adding some detail or
some shine onto these different coffee cups.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.020
Did want to show you that those are the inks
that I used for all the stamping.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:39.949
So I added some Glossy Accents on the "Java
Great Day" area, and I also added some Wink

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.520
of Stella on some other areas of the card,
and put that Glossy Accents on the heart area

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.520
as well.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.430
I did forget to color in the coffee inside
the cups--the cocoa or whatever you want to

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.430
call it.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.669
Probably coffee because of the greeting here.

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.300
I colored that in with a marker.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.650
I also added all of that Glossy Accents detail.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.949
So that is the second card for today.

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.280
I hope you guys enjoyed seeing a couple different
cards and I apologize that I didn't have all

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.120
the video footage for this second card.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.120
And Mannie is back here meowing--Hi Mannie!

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.199
He says hello.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.699
