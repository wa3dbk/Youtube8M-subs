00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.179
The Ultimate Cool in the late '60s.

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:19.609
That is the keyword of the search in this video.

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.419
I want to stand face to face with the peak of coolness on the eve of the Seventies.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:32.090
From the time we moved from Mies Bouwman (virtuous Dutch tv presenter) to Sylvia Kristel.

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:35.450
And from Willeke Alberti (virtuous Dutch singer) to Foxy Brown.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.240
For years, I thought there was only one car in that quest...

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.830
that you could end up with.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.690
And that's the Alfa Romeo Montreal.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
The car was first shown as a concept car at the Expo in 1967 in Canada...

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.530
in Montreal.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.780
It is a fine example of crowd naming in the auto industry.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.440
Journalists named the nameless car to the city that had the scoop.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.110
Good thing the marketing department of Alfa listened to the journalists,
and stuck it above the bumper.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.579
World Expositions are officially held since 1851.

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:08.830
They symbolize progress.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.950
With the Expo 1967 it was Canada's turn.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.410
Driving around with a train in the air and a huge biosphere, for many people...

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.920
those elements were the culmination of the most successful World's Fair of the 20th century.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710
Connoisseurs knew better.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.230
The Italians came up with the prototype car which had a design...

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.260
that did not want to predict the future...

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.070
but that froze time.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.820
For an oldtimer to be convincingly cool, it should play the leading role...

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.810
in a car chase in a mostly forgotten B movie
from its early years.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.479
A film that switches from cockpit to cockpit,
between a long-haired female beauty...

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.570
and a mildly smiling and leather gloves wearing male opponent.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.170
They will either crash in the ravine, or in the next scene they will be playing around in bed.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.990
In the movie The Destructors from 1974, Maureen Kerwin takes on Michael Caine.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.099
Her cooing Porsche is surrounded by the muscles of his Alfa, the real protagonist.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.699
A mating dance of four wheelers.

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:18.219
Coolness squared.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.870
What is it that makes this car to me one of the most desirable classic cars of all time?

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.229
Its character and custom design.

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:29.469
Whichever way you look at it...

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.389
from all angles, it just looks good.

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:36.449
The headlights like mirrors of the Italian soul, encased in a chrome frame.

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:41.619
And metal lashes that provocotavely display the power of the 2.6 -liter V8.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.759
Rarely the face of a cool car looked so human.

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:48.200
No Ray-Ban, Rolex or Ralph Lauren beats that.

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.199
What did the Montreal have in common with the Lamborghini Miura. The Countach...

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:03.568
the Lancia Stratos, the De Tomaso Pantera, Ferrari Dino 308 GT4...

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.419
and the Maserati Quattro Porte?

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:11.209
They were all designed by the master Marcello Gandini, working for Bertone in Turin.

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.639
A signature that guarantees the cool factor.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.599
And not just the looks appeal to the imagination .

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.809
200 hp

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:23.429
A V8. Zero to one hundred kilometers per hour in 7.4 seconds.

00:03:23.429 --> 00:03:26.229
A top speed of more than 220 kilometers
per hour.

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:31.119
A three spoke wooden steering wheel, and aerodynamic design.

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:36.059
Race performance for everyday use.
Between 1970 and 1977...

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.732
3917 Montreal's were produced.

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:40.957
That's not many.

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.589
But maybe that's because you needed quite a lot of money 
in order to drive the Montreal.

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:49.589
The showroom price was higher than that of the Jaguar E-Type ,
or the Porsche 911.

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:57.799
I only know the Alfa Romeo Montreal from watching images and Youtube videos.

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.363
And for this reason alone, I recently went to the Spettacolo Sportivo event at Circuit Park Zandvoort...

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:05.409
organized by the largest and oldest Alfa Romeo Club in the Netherlands.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.269
If there is one place to find a Montreal,
That’s the place?

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:15.049
Immediately after entering the circuit park, you find yourself in an Alfa Romeo Museum.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.029
Wherever you walk or look, its Alfa Romeos everywhere.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:20.680
They come and they go.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.410
Some hidden in a remote corner,
and other prominent and not to be missed...

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.560
parked in front of car lovers constantly passing by.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.819
The best of today, just inches from the best of another era.

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.490
And sometimes a deep bow...

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.889
As for this racing-ready Alfa Romeo 8c from the '30s .

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.570
That looks hot!

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.759
Yes, very nice. But until now there is no sign of the Montreal!

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.460
For a better overview, I go to the roof of the pit lane,
and I see a few Montreals driving off.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.750
Did all Montreals that still drive around in the Netherlands...

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.219
just leave the circuit?

00:04:56.225 --> 00:05:01.050
Downstairs I vist the many stands where enthusiasts hunt for rare stuff.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.680
Front lights and indicators.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.580
Even cabinets full of miniatures, for those for whom the miniature car is next best.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.699
And then I walk into a golden miniature of the Montreal...

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.680
and I fear that I belong to that category too.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.419
And that it's not find the ultimate cool...

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:19.659
but the ultimate kitsch I have found.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.699
I walk towards the famous Tarzan corner. Simply because it’s beautiful...

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.550
this 180 degrees of racing history.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.449
And then the unexpected happens.

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.379
I see some men gathering around a car in the most beautiful red I have seen that day.

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:36.159
It is the Montreal!

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.729
And there is another.

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:38.770
A red one!

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.570
And yet another one.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:47.570
And an orange one, and black... and blue.
And grey. And... is this car cool?

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:49.679
Yes, it is.

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:52.590
Fingerlicking cool!

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:00.290
I want a Montreal...

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.590
I'll go anywhere!

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.390
In my Montreal...

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.590
I’ll drive from here to there...
