00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.050
This is only the fourth version of the Range
Rover in its 42 year history.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.220
And though the model become an icon during
that time.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.010
It has had its shortcomings and reliability
has always been a bit of an issue.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.300
So a whole heap of work needed to be done
to bring this British status symbol back up

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.300
to scratch.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.119
Land rover has addressed most of these problem
areas.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.721
The brick like physique has been replaced
by a relatively sleek profile and the Range

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:31.789
Rover has gone on a crash diet.

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.860
It's the world's first SUV with an all aluminum
body.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.340
That shaved up to 420 kilograms off its bulk.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.370
That's about Same as any home runner twizy.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.630
In fact this Range Rover is the first that's
light enough to be fitted with a V6 engine.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.540
The TD V6 is already used in the Range Rover
Sport and Discovery.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.510
That's done wonders for fuel economy and emissions.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.180
382 is down to 196 grams per kilometer and
claimed mpg is 37.7.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.300
This engine is paired with a smooth intelligent
8 speed automatic transmission.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.070
It can responses, depending on how heavy-footed
the driver is on the throttle.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.360
All models come with a new air suspension
system with continuously adaptive dampening

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.710
that softens and stiffens the ride to suit
the road conditions.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.920
Inside, the driver sits more than nine centimeters
high than any other SUV.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.200
And in the cabin, creature comforts abound.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.450
The last model was criticized for having a
lack of space in the back.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.920
But this Range Rover has a hundred and 18
millimeters more rear leg room, making these

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.729
seats pretty much cavernous.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.000
Boot space is improved too and we like the
convenience of the power upper and lower tailgates.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.660
But the range rover is pricey to say the least.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.521
The cheapest model costs seventy thousand
pounds and the most expensive is almost a

00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:56.760
hundred thousand pounds and that's without
any optional extras.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.220
In contrast, entry level models of the Audi
Q7, BMW X5, and Porshe Cayenne all start around

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.220
45 thousand.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.430
That's a whopping 25,000 pounds less.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.370
So is the Range Rover worth such a massive
price premium? despite all the great modern

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.310
features the latest Range Rover still oozes
traditional Britishness.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.980
And that means for many people it will definitely
retain its crown as 4 x 4 royalty.
