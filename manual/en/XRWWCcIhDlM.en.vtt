00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.480
Laid out below us is the enchanted
Dutch city of Groningen.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.280
Since the Middle Ages it has been
besieged, flooded, burned down...

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.920
and had the plague.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.280
And now in the 21st century it hosts
the annual Eurosonic Festival...

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.880
which celebrates new European music
and artists.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.480
During this festival the European Border
Breakers Awards are held, the EBBA's...

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.880
which are presented
to new European artists...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.520
who have been successful with their
music outside of their own countries...

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.280
and have performed at international
European festivals...

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.120
and playlisted
on the European EBU radio stations.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.880
Hi, this is Dominique Bourron,
head of radio France Bleu.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.920
Two years ago France Bleu Paris
discovered...

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.600
a young artist by the name of ZAZ...

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.600
and at Olympia she was awarded
the Prix Génération Réservoir.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.120
In 2010, ZAZ's breakthrough came
with the indisputable hit 'Je veux'.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.200
Here she is.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.560
It's a mix of lots of things
and lots of styles.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.600
I like all kinds of genres,
which is reflected in my music.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.480
It ranges from flamenco, jazz,
blues to funk and soul...

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.280
or R&amp;B, reggae or trance.
It goes every which way.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.920
I don't go for one particular style.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.680
I love travelling and discovering
new cultures, new scenery...

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.880
And getting to know other
people's cultures and customs...

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.120
and to see how people... At concerts,
people often don't speak my language.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.000
When I'm abroad,
I'm sure people understand me.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.400
When we were in Japan,
I talked to the audience.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.400
I said: You. They said: You!
I said: No: You!. They said: You!

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.760
That was funny.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.880
To me, something's a success
when you like it.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.280
Irrespective of how much money I earn
or how often I'm in the media...

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.120
it's about liking it,
and being able to express myself.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.360
That is success.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.280
It's nice to win a prize.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.480
I'm really happy,
because then I can travel, which I love.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.000
I want to discover
all the countries in the world.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.400
The planet has so many aspects,
so many tastes, so many things...

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.480
so many different colours,
just like music.
