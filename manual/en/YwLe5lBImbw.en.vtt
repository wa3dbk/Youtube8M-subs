00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.830
Hello friends this time I present the recipe for codfish

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.400
first

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.320
use Norwegian cod or whatever your choice

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.710
is always full of salt

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.180
cod desalt putting it in water for two days

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.820
and every night we're going to change the water

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.240
By now the codfish spent two days in water 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.680
Now let the cod one more night in evaporated milk

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.460
add evaporated milk

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.440
by that time it happened one night
and it is time to remove the cod evaporated milk

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:28.050
not rinsed with water because it loses the flavor of evaporated milk

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.670
then the next step is to shred the cod

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.400
and remove the thorns 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.880
the ingredients to be used are

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.800
spicy tomato sauce

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.160
2 pounds of chopped onion

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.890

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.420

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.820
