00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:13.174
I often wonder how and why I became an artist.

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:20.126
I think it started from just pursuing an interest in drawing, really.

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:25.670
I could draw very well from an early age and then I just followed that.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.001
I'm just always thinking up ideas and I'm just really a curious person.

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:38.215
I like to just follow through with them and see what happens if I do X, you know?

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:42.335
In Melbourne Now, I've created a work called You, me and the flock

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:49.016
and it's a 20 metre by 3 metre curved panorama.

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:56.701
It's a series of shots made into one image that I've taken in a salt pan out near Mildura.

00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:02.362
And participants come along and they're given a sticker sheet of bird silhouettes

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:08.137
and they place them wherever they want on the sky or the land, wherever

00:01:08.137 --> 00:01:11.297
and as they do so and as the crowds flock through,

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:18.477
they ... it auto-generates a drawing, a flock, and people leave their mark.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:26.527
And what's really been interesting about it is how it'll start as very free patterns

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:35.360
and then as it becomes more crowded, people look for a space to claim for themselves

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.751
and then as they start crossing over, all hell breaks loose.

00:01:39.751 --> 00:01:45.175
So while it is a child's game, and something that can be enjoyed by anyone,

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:51.171
it also is a rumination on overpopulation and what ... how we treat the environment.

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:54.105
I think Melbourne Now is important to the general community, in particular,

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:58.780
because it's a celebration of contemporary culture

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.738
and it's been done in such a way that people don't even realise

00:02:01.738 --> 00:02:05.926
they're looking at contemporary art but they are and they're really enjoying it.

00:02:05.926 --> 00:02:11.872
The installation's called a poetic engagement in reproduction. It's essentially a room.

00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:18.187
On one side of the room there is a combination of works that are both mine and historical works

00:02:18.187 --> 00:02:22.847
and all of those works are one-off pieces of work that are made by hand.

00:02:22.847 --> 00:02:29.266
The BalletLab blanket that's on display is no less than 50 hours of intense work of weaving and

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:36.901
that doesn't include set up and design, that's just straight-out hard core sitting there and weaving.

00:02:36.901 --> 00:02:42.372
I wanted to do another piece like that and I wanted to do it specifically in the public domain

00:02:42.372 --> 00:02:48.157
so that how those pieces of ribbon got into the cloth became very visible.

00:02:48.157 --> 00:02:53.283
I think there's often no connect between how a design gets on to fabric in the public mind

00:02:53.283 --> 00:02:57.158
and in my work, that's very important because all the designs

00:02:57.158 --> 00:03:00.602
that go on fabric are original pieces of artwork to begin with,

00:03:00.602 --> 00:03:04.605
then there's a certain amount of investment of time and of process

00:03:04.605 --> 00:03:08.241
and that process is also linked to technical innovation.

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:12.260
So to have that in the public eye and create awareness and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.234
connection was really important to me.

00:03:15.234 --> 00:03:18.919
There's a sort of internal logic over many years

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.243
that's developed around that.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:24.666
You know, in a sense, you're just in your own head a lot of the time.

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:30.454
When you're collaborating with other people, you are taken out of that and

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:35.121
you're challenged by the ways that the people

00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:38.993
you are collaborating with interact with your work;

00:03:38.993 --> 00:03:48.901
how they might, I suppose, at times, go straight over the top of what you've done;

00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:53.575
how they might alter, for you, the meaning by what they've introduced.

00:03:53.575 --> 00:03:57.486
The works in Melbourne Now are three Duraclear pictures

00:03:57.486 --> 00:04:02.730
that have had hand painted marks and images applied over the top.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.468
So Duraclears are essentially a photographic format;

00:04:07.468 --> 00:04:11.092
it's a way of printing out a photographic image.

00:04:11.092 --> 00:04:15.537
The photographic part of the work was made by Charles Green and Lyndell Brown

00:04:15.537 --> 00:04:18.715
who are my collaborators in this project. They are a husband and wife team.

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:25.878
And like myself, they were invited to be official artists for the Australian War Memorial

00:04:25.878 --> 00:04:30.812
so they were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan with the Australian Defence Forces

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:37.383
and I was sent to Timor-Leste and in that situation you were embedded with the soldiers

00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:43.180
and you have an experience with them and you utilise that experience however you want.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.741
We all felt that there was more work to be had out of that and

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:51.038
by degrees we formed this idea that maybe the work could be collaborative,

00:04:51.038 --> 00:04:55.018
that we didn't necessarily have to talk about the experience of being

00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:59.917
in Iraq or Afghanistan or the experience of being in Timor-Leste

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:03.002
but that what perhaps we could deal with was the experience

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:08.999
of the aftermath of conflict and ways of kind of attending

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:13.941
to the possibilities that come out of conflict,

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:17.881
those ... the ... obviously a lot of those are negative possibilities but

00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:22.122
we wanted to formulate a way of addressing some of those things

00:05:22.122 --> 00:05:24.304
through the making of visual work.

00:05:24.304 --> 00:05:28.049
The three of us were not really interested in being didactic;

00:05:28.049 --> 00:05:31.277
we were interested in a kind of bricolage approach

00:05:31.277 --> 00:05:36.436
of bringing images in from all over the place and playing with them.
