00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.240
This is one of those LED spotlight chips and if you watched my other video on it

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.000
I mentioned that it was overheating and it needed a bigger heat sink

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.270
I did not want a monster heatsink on it.  I wanted it to be a small package

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.090
And as you can see, it's not very big.  I can cover it with the end of my finger

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.700
I wanted a small package, don't want a monster heatsink, don't want to take a lot of space

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.380
be and will be a running continuously

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.969
so what I came up with was putting it on
the back of this fan.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.270
It's a processor cooling fan for a laptop and it's got an aluminum

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.040
back on it.  So I bolted it to the back.  It's got heatsink compound on it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.540
and I was hoping that the heeat

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.420
would go through in the aluminum and the fan would carry the heat away

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.280
This fan is 5 volts to I

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.469
had to us a 5 volt regulator.  My other choice was a

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.760
12 volt fan, but as you can see it is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.280
at a lot bigger lot bigger

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.229
okay, so how does it work?  Let's see.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.180
We'll crank it up

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.620
This is about 6 volts, the fan is running but the light's not on yet

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.479
Should be about 7 volts the light will come on a not really very bright yet

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.520
This is ...

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.560
8 volts and it's starting to get a little bit bright.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.569
You can start to see thru my finger.  I can't point it directly at the camera

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:46.129
'cause it freaks the camera out.  We can use my finger as an indicator of how bright it is.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.060
Crank it up to 9 volts.  You can see it getting brighter.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.480
You can see from my finger it's quite a bit brighter

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.319
But the bad news here is that this is as bright as it gets anything more than this

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.599
and it starts to overheat.  This experiment was not 100%successful.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.700
I got my small package but I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.460
can't run at 11 volts where it's supposed to be

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.640
so I'm still 2 volts shy of

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.350
being able to operate it at 100% but

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.980
still it's 1 step forward and I will have to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.900
think about how I can do this and still keep it down to a small package

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.460
OK, that was it.  Not 100%success but

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.680
Something moving forward.  Hope you found it interesting
