00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.010
Welcome to Win with Wy.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.110
Now we're going to go through the calf roping.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.230
We are going to take you step by step from
when you nod your face in the box until you

00:00:36.230 --> 00:01:09.180
throw your hands in the air.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:28.030
We're going to roll through some of this equipment
that you're going to need so you can start

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
roping calves.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.909
Might as well start from the front and work
our way back.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.890
I like to have a keeper on a lot of my horses.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.960
Most of them are young.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.350
This is a little older horse.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.200
He knows what he's doing now but I still like
to have it on there so he pays attention and

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.200
keeps looking.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.399
This is not required.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.880
It's just there to hold my horse and keep
him looking down that rope at the calf.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.659
The neck rope is required.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.530
You have to have a neck rope any time you
rope a calf or you're disqualified.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.070
The next thing is your rope.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.990
I like a good, soft rope.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.170
John Walchli at Grizzly Ropes makes these
ropes for me.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.399
I really like them.

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.399
They're really soft.

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.399
I like to use them.

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.070
I can use and reuse them and they don't wear
out.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.090
When you start to put your rope in, always
go from the front.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.610
Go through your keeper if you choose to have
one, and then go under your neck rope and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.799
don't forget to go under your reins.

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.859
Put your rope on; get it on good and tight.

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.701
Get it cranked down way down at the bottom
so it's not putting pressure at the top of

00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:37.329
your horn and it doesn't have that chance
to slip off and the calf gets away.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:38.329
All right, guys.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.329
Here's a warning.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.100
Using a metal or a plastic horn nut can allow
a rope to loosen, letting your fingers get

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.690
caught in between the rope and your horn as
you dismount.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.049
This can result in a loss of fingers.

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.810
The next thing is going to be your jerk line.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.239
Some horses don't need them.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.470
I like to have a jerk line on my horse, especially
when I'm at a rodeo.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.040
Something that hooks on under your horse's
bridle, somewhere down here to the bottom.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.120
Run it up close to your saddle somewhere.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.520
Then when you're on your horse, you're going
to tuck it into your belt.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.310
As you put your loops through your belt for
your jerk line, you want to make sure they're

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.670
not too big.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.590
If you go a big loop up here it could flop
over your horn, and then as you get off it's

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.230
going to hang and you're going to be in trouble
and in one heck of a wreck.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.489
You want to make sure they're little so that
they'll pull out as you step off your horse.

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.169
They'll pull out and then go down your rope.

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:44.060
They're going to pull out of your belt and
then ask your horse to get back.
