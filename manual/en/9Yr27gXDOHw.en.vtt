00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.439
the Holy Bible 39 books of the Old
Testament

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.820
27 books of the New Testament

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.120
the Word of God for the people of God

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.480
yup, there you go.. 
sometimes I wish it was that simple but

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.820
we are not simple people.. well some of us

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.980
are simple but others are more
complicated still

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.560
others are even mixed up into a big bag of
trail mix or

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.149
I guess I fall into that somewhere anyway

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.309
more to the point. The Bible how long
has this book been around and where did

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.140
it come from?

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.059
Well this one here, copyright

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.829
1991 so this is more than
twenty-years-old

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.890
and it came from Nashville Tennessee

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.290
simple.. Like I said

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.649
it's not that simple and that is why we
are talking about

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.820
the Bible on this episode

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.079
of Chuck Knows Church
[ ooooooo ]

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:11.079
are we doing this in 3D?
[cool intro music]

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.560
[pleasant harp music]
So..

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.600
what is the Bible? well the word

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.200
Bible in English comes from the Greek
word biblos

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.320
which means book, hmmm

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.790
that is simple..

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.140
still not done?.. ah, alright, for Jews and
Christians alike

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.810
the Bible isn't simply a book it is the
book.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.690
The most important book of our faith and
our religious communities

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.850
a collection sacred texts. Arranged
differently sometimes, yes, just making them

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.150
different bibles for both Judaism and
Christianity.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.690
But still cherished alike for centuries
revealing what God's calling us to be

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.350
and do in the world yesterday and today.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.640
Now for Jews the Bible is also called Tanakh in Hebrew

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.180
Tanakh is actually an acronym for

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.110
three major sections the make up the
Hebrew Bible: Torrah,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.370
the books have the law,  Neviim, the
profits,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.000
and Ketuvim, the writings.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.450
Now Christians have divided up these books differently arriving at a total of 39 for the

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.080
Old Testament

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.060
often called the first testament and later
Christians added more books

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.040
what we refer to as the New Testament or
second testament.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.800
Now this includes the Gospels, you know
stories about life of Jesus

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.700
ACTS a brief history of the early church
the 21 Epistles

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.770
or letters to the church's by early
Christian leaders and the book of

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.600
Revelation.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.810
Not revelations, Revelation which is
sometimes considered in the category of

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:56.290
its own.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.190
Now that gives a total of 66 books of the
Christian Bible.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.239
That simple enough for you? Now the oldest
surviving

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.950
complete Christian Bibles are Greek
manuscripts from the 4th century

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.610
and then of course after that, you know, there have been a couple a different

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.230
versions.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.970
the King James Version the American
Standard Version the New

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.200
American Standard Version the Revised
Standard Version,

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.500
the NRSV, the NIV, the NLT

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.550
the PSV MSG gluten-free and uh.. USC

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.760
Tell you what let's just save all
that

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.020
for a another time. The Bible

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.010
in all its different forms and
translations and in many languages

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.940
remains the best-selling book of all
time it is the unique

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.760
accounting of God's interaction with
people throughout history

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.260
and a way to recognize what God is
saying to us

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.310
today. To learn more about the Bible

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.709
