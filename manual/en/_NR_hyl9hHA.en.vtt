Friday, March the 1st, 2013. 
This Week on GOG: In case you missed it, here’s what’s new.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.500
Are you an extraordinary gentleman ready to descend into
the depths of wretched dungeons and boldly shoot Evil right
between its gleaming eyes?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.820
In 99 Levels to Hell, a new challenging roguelike / platformer
mashup, you can do just that.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The game comes with a plethora of weapons and upgrades to collect,
legions of hideous hellspawns to splatter, and a unique set of 99
randomly-generated levels in every single playthrough.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Add a top hat, a monocle, and a king-size mustache to the mix, 
and soon enough you'll be vanquishing demons--LIKE A SIR!

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.300
Driftmoon, a charming indie RPG adventure that we released on Tuesday,
takes you on a whimsical journey through a colorful fable-like realm.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.000
It's plain to see that every little detail in this beautiful game
brims with the passion and love of its creators. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.000
Story-driven gameplay, light-hearted humor, solid role-playing
mechanics, and hundreds of lines of witty dialog--what more could
an RPG fan possibly wish for?

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.900
A mod editor that allows to create your own adventures from scratch,
perhaps? You're in luck--Driftmoon even has that.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Viva Mexico!

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.000
Total Overdose: A Gunslinger's Tale in Mexico draws its inspiration
from the Grand Theft Auto series but spices it up with unique game

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.000
mechanics including special combo shots, mid-air aiming, and even
reversing the time flow to rewind and repeat your actions.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.000
The story here is so hardcore and badass that it could only take
place in the land of TEQUILA:

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.000
as you embark on the undercover mission to infiltrate the Mexican
drug underground, you'll be driving "borrowed" vehicles,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.100
taking part in epic shoot-outs, and exploring the exotic
sandbox environment of Los Toros city.
A fair warning: this game is LOCO!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.800
Ultimate Body Blows is a classic DOS-era fighting game that
was Team 17's answer to Capcom's Street Fighter series.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.300
It's got everything you might want from a 2D brawler, including
a unique gallery of fierce fighters, eye-catching arenas,
and mind-blowing special moves.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.200
No gimmicks here. Just plain old-school beat 'em up fun.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Wanna hear the hint for the next week classic release?
Number three. That's it. I'm not saying another word.
You'll just have to settle for that.
