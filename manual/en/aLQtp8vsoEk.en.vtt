00:00:00.241 --> 00:00:01.288
- [Voiceover] Tired of vaccuming?

00:00:01.288 --> 00:00:02.294
You need a Roomba--

00:00:02.294 --> 00:00:03.198
- Bored.

00:00:03.198 --> 00:00:04.287
- Breaking news tonight.

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:06.022
Marshmallow's gender has
slowly been revealed.

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:06.855
- Boring.

00:00:06.855 --> 00:00:09.542
- [Voiceover] Down at Crazy
Eddie's used bathtub and--

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:10.710
- Bored!

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.558
(TV clicks and show static)

00:00:11.558 --> 00:00:12.391
(Orange grunts and remote clicks)

00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:15.322
You let me down for the last time, TV!

00:00:15.322 --> 00:00:16.162
Nah! (explosion)

00:00:16.162 --> 00:00:17.930
If only there was something
else worth watching.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.466
- [Samantha] Brian, don't make a scene.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.626
- Hello?

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:21.546
- Hey, Samantha.

00:00:21.546 --> 00:00:23.451
I see you're out and about
with your new boyfriend.

00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:26.218
Glad, like, you got over our
relationship so efficiently.

00:00:26.218 --> 00:00:28.874
- Oh, I like where this is going.

00:00:28.874 --> 00:00:30.762
- Hey there, what's up, new boyfriend?

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:31.595
Brian.

00:00:31.595 --> 00:00:32.954
How much do you bench?

00:00:32.954 --> 00:00:35.482
I did 275 plus one fly.

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:37.538
Yeah, there was a fly on the bar,

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:39.682
but I went ahead and put it up anyway!

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:42.002
- You seriously dated this meat-head?

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:44.074
- I'm a chunk of sirloin, Chief.

00:00:44.074 --> 00:00:45.482
- Who cares, Brian?

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.075
I'm a chunk of pineapple.

00:00:47.075 --> 00:00:48.827
Rod is a chunk of bell pepper.

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:49.922
So what?

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:54.089
- (laughs) Rod (laughs).

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.002
- Yo, Orange, I got this.

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:59.706
You don't need to finish
my piercing insults for me.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:02.874
Now, as I was saying, your name would be--

00:01:02.874 --> 00:01:05.754
- Rod! (laughs)

00:01:05.754 --> 00:01:07.826
- Orange, let me info this guy myself!

00:01:07.826 --> 00:01:08.659
- No, Rod!

00:01:09.834 --> 00:01:10.749
- [Brian, Samantha, And Rod] Huh?

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.426
(rod slices and food screams)

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:13.842
- Ew!

00:01:13.842 --> 00:01:15.592
- What just happened?

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.938
- Yo, I believe we've been shish kabobbed.

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:21.104
- Does that mean we're
about to be (whip) eaten?

00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:21.993
(sudden note blast)

00:01:21.993 --> 00:01:23.632
- I'm more concerned about the fact

00:01:23.632 --> 00:01:27.337
that we're stuck to your
ex-boyfriend indefinitely.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.170
- Truth be told,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.824
I barely even felt that
stick go through me.

00:01:29.824 --> 00:01:31.136
Yep, didn't even hurt.

00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:32.673
See how manly I am, Samantha?

00:01:32.673 --> 00:01:33.720
You should probably take me back.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.712
I mean, that's what I'd do
if I were in your situation.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:37.184
- No, Brian!

00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:38.201
- Whatever, your new boyfriend's a nerd.

00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.209
- Good one, Brian.

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.208
Really skewered him (laughing)!

00:01:43.208 --> 00:01:44.304
- Butt out, Orange!

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:46.008
- Everyone quiet.

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:47.696
Seeing as how we're going to be together

00:01:47.696 --> 00:01:49.081
for the foreseeable future,

00:01:49.081 --> 00:01:51.824
can we please try to get along?

00:01:51.824 --> 00:01:53.377
- Yes. Let's get along.

00:01:53.377 --> 00:01:54.568
- Brian?

00:01:54.568 --> 00:01:55.776
- Why you looking at me?

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:56.888
I'm getting along.

00:01:56.888 --> 00:02:01.160
I'm getting along just fine
without you Samantha (sobs).

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.304
- Here we go!

00:02:02.304 --> 00:02:04.120
- Nah, I'm tired of this plot line.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.664
Better change it up or
I'll turn the TV back on!

00:02:06.664 --> 00:02:08.792
- Hey Rod, hope you know
what you're getting into.

00:02:08.792 --> 00:02:11.000
Did Samantha tell you about
how she snort laughed?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.216
- That was one time!

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:14.856
- Sure, per day (snorts loudly)

00:02:14.856 --> 00:02:17.369
Oh, and you may find
this interesting as well.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.641
Samantha's feet smell like pineapple.

00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:20.801
What's that about?

00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:22.192
- I don't even have feet.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.888
- Yeah, well if you did
they would most likely

00:02:24.888 --> 00:02:26.481
smell like pineapple.

00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:28.425
- Yeah, what else would they smell like?

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:30.520
- I don't know, probably feet.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.072
You're the smart one, Sherlock.

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:35.076
- (grunts) I want off this stupid kabob!

00:02:35.076 --> 00:02:37.012
- That's right, try to eject out of this,

00:02:37.012 --> 00:02:39.052
just like you ejected
out of our relationship.

00:02:39.052 --> 00:02:41.337
Did I ever tell you Samantha
broke up with me, Orange?

00:02:41.337 --> 00:02:45.737
- No, but I'm guessing you
got the shaft (laughter).

00:02:45.737 --> 00:02:47.001
- Stop encouraging him.

00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.018
He's still making kabob jokes.

00:02:49.018 --> 00:02:51.170
- Said the weakest link
in my new favorite show.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.003
- Oh, shush.

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.097
- I'll shush, but only if you shish.

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:54.930
Oh, wait.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:55.763
Too late.

00:02:55.763 --> 00:02:57.785
You already did! (laughs)

00:02:57.785 --> 00:02:58.618
- Ugh!

00:02:58.618 --> 00:02:59.674
I can't take it!

00:02:59.674 --> 00:03:02.369
How is being skewered on a
shish kabob next to my ex

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.039
suddenly the second most
annoying thing in the room?

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.959
(burps and laughs)

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.039
That was a good one!

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:10.279
- Brian, I know we've had our differences,

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:11.743
but if we're going to survive this,

00:03:11.743 --> 00:03:13.736
we need to work as a team.

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:16.072
- Anything to get away from this psycho!

00:03:16.072 --> 00:03:19.314
- Oh, burn! (laughs)

00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:20.451
Ignore that loser.

00:03:20.451 --> 00:03:21.523
Here's my plan.

00:03:21.523 --> 00:03:22.356
- Burn!

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:26.241
- Yeah, it was a burn, you loser!

00:03:27.651 --> 00:03:28.491
How's it feel?

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:29.539
- No, no, no.

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:30.979
Burn.

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:32.083
(Samantha's screams)

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:33.763
(Orange cries out)

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:35.211
- Samantha!

00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:39.028
I have always loved you! (groans)

00:03:39.028 --> 00:03:40.779
- Give it up, Brian.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:44.051
- Yeah, Brian, the flame is gone (laughs).

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.218
(screams)

00:03:47.845 --> 00:03:48.678
Whoa!

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:51.485
Spoke too soon (laughs)

00:03:51.485 --> 00:03:53.749
(sighs)

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:55.789
- [Voiceover] Cleans
every room in the house.

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.016
Even the kitchen.

00:03:57.016 --> 00:03:58.421
- I should get a Roomba.

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:01.588
(upbeat guitar music)

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:14.612
(loud slice)

00:04:14.612 --> 00:04:16.275
(Orange laughs) Knife! (knife slices)
