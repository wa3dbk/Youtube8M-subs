00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:07.100
Here we have a brown anole, its scientific
name is norops sagrei. The brown anole is

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.500
an invasive species in the United States,
and it's found from southern Georgia and Florida

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.539
to the southern tip of Mexico and the Caribbeans.
They are actually native to Cuba and the Bahamas,

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.759
and they were most likely introduced to these
areas by escaped pets and as stowaways on

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.979
planes and ships. They are quite small, about
one and a half inches to three inches in length.

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:39.530
They have a notably shorter snout than most
anoles, and they have these very long claws.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.210
They have little fibers on the surface of
their feet to help them stick to smooth surfaces

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.179
like glass and even texturized surfaces. The
most recognizable on the brown anole is this

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:01.660
beautiful orange and red dewlap you see here.
The dewlap is used by the male anole in territorial

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.950
displays and courtship displays. The female
also possesses a dewlap but it is not necessarily

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.270
used. You can distinguish the brown anole
from its native relative the green anole because

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:21.590
the green anole has a much more pointed snout,
and the green anole has a pink dewlap not

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.970
this orange and red that you see here. Little
is known about their reproductive behavior,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.890
except for the fact that they generally mate
year round and females don't have to mate

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.410
every mating season, as they have the ability
to store sperm for a long length of time.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:49.270
They eat a variety of foods including insects
such as beetles, spiders, flies, and various

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.650
invertebrates. Very interesting fact about
these guys is they're invasive and in areas

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.810
of southern Florida where they've now taken
over we see a large decline in the green anole

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.790
population and this is so because they're
very closely related, they require much the

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.390
same habitat and food source, and they're
good, you know they seem to be better competitors

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.380
at pushing the green anole out, and they actually
eat some of the green anole hatchlings.
