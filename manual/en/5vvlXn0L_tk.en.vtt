00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.340
Hey everybody, Ben with Classic Firearms here.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.980
I want to talk to you today about our current
incarnation of AK-74 rifles that we currently

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.320
have in stock.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.170
These rifles have become a real success story
for us recently, after what admittedly was

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.900
somewhat of a rocky start.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.259
Originally our AK-74s as you see here, were
being made by Waffen Werks.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.580
In the original ownership, Waffen Werks, they
were very, very good people.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.930
I still to this day have the highest respect
for them, but they were basically a small

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.070
mom and pop operation, and we put a lot of
pressure on them, which was our fault, to

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.519
turn out a number of rifles for us because
we were selling the rifles very well.

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.620
As a result, they ended up having some quality
control issues on their early rifles.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.020
Fortunately, that is all behind us now and
has been put to bed.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:05.040
A company called Destructive Devices bought
out Waffen Werks, DDI.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.030
DDI is a much larger corporation.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.929
They have a very good background in building
rifles.

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:17.590
In fact, they build some of the highest quality
AK rifles on the market today, and they are

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.520
currently producing our AK-74 rifles for us.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.630
They also carry the warranty on the AK-74
rifles.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.789
Because they bought Waffen Werks as a corporation,
they bought up all the boxes and the packaging

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.740
and everything that went with it, you will
still see the Waffen Werks name on the boxes

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.409
and on the receivers, but make no mistake
about it, these are DDI rifles, and they're

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.390
backed by a full 100% warranty by DDI.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.259
Let me tell you a little bit about the rifles
themselves.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:55.119
All of the rifles have brand new US chrome-lined
barrels on them.

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.130
They all have all matching part sets out of
Bulgaria.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.869
They all have the original compensators.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.100
Very smooth actions.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.330
All of the base rifles themselves are going
to be exactly alike as far as the metal is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.640
concerned with a nice DuraCote/CeraKote finish.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.630
The only difference you're going to see is
in the furniture.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.550
The furniture that is on these rifles is the
original furniture that came out of Bulgaria

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.450
when the rifles were dismantled from the military.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:31.250
Some, like this one, are beautiful, all matching
wood furniture sets.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.170
Others will be mismatched a little, you see
a little slight different color variation

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.920
on this between stock and the forearms.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.330
Some will even have the solid stain finish.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.790
This is a solid stain, as opposed to the transparent
stain that you see on the other weapons.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.530
It's a plum color.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.310
The solid stain covers the wood stock better
and provides better protection for the stock.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.170
Some people like it, some people don't.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.730
About 15% TO 20% of our stock is in this solid
color stain, but again the furniture is what

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.690
you get.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.890
I'll show you another one.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.070
You'll see some have a little more wear on
them than others.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.880
A few more light dents and dings, but none
are non-serviceable, none are broken, none

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.670
are anything like that.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.960
Certainly all are refinishable if you so desire.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.760
One thing I forgot to point out, is that each
one of these fine rifles does have a side

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.680
rail on it for scope mounting.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.340
You can easily mount a scope to any one of
them if you so choose.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.760
More than that, under DDIs tutelage, these
things now feed and function great.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.080
We're going to take a little break, I'm going
to put some eyes on, some ears in.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.730
We're going to come back, we're going to show
you live fire with our AK-74 rifles.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.150
All right, we're back.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.190
Ears in.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.430
We're just going to work our way up the row
on these things.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.740
These AK-74s came off of the shelf this morning
in no particular order.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.190
Brought them out here and unboxed them.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.459
We wanted you to see a random sampling, which
is what you have here.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.709
We're going to start at the end, we'll take
this really pretty one here and start with

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.709
it.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:30.999
We'll go forward, fire a few rounds through
each, let you see how these things perform.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:48.560
Range is hot.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:05:04.669
Range is hot.

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.449
Range is hot.

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:13.340
I love the light recoil on these rifles.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.210
The muzzle break does its job beautifully.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.550
If you'll see this thing just holds a natural
plane, doesn't recoil up, and I'm basically

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.289
firing into the same hole every time.

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:34.689
Couple more.

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:38.919
Range is hot.

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:51.110
They run great.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.889
Range is hot.

00:05:53.889 --> 00:06:00.650
Just like clockwork, ticking them out.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.650
Love these AK-74s.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.259
We're going to take a little break and come
right back and close this out.

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.220
All right, we're back.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.689
The reason I wanted to take a little break,
is because I remembered we had brought a drum

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:17.240
mag to the range with us.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.289
It was still laying in the back seat of the
of truck.

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.710
I forgot to bring out the first time.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.080
These are based on the beta mags, they're
made in South Korea.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.419
It's a 95 round 545 by 39 caliber drum.

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:32.439
You see they've got a clear front so you can
see your round count.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:38.039
I have not tried one of these drums before,
but we have it with us, it's loaded up and

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:42.770
there's no time like the present.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:58.919
Without further ado, grab a weapon right quick.

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.960
Ears in.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.449
As a kid shooting a lot, I never used these
ears, that's why I can't hear a thing today.

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:10.089
So we're trying to do better in our old age.

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:13.229
Anyway, AK-74 with the drum mag.

00:07:13.229 --> 00:07:16.229
Let's give her a try.

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:20.620
Range is hot.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.780
Aha!

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:26.919
Got to love that drum.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:28.039
See the clear front.

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:30.330
You've got a round count going on.

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.589
We got a cool look.

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:38.249
I love this thing, as I do all of our AK-74
rifles.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:48.210
As always, we encourage you to give these
a try and check us out at www.classicfirearms.com.
