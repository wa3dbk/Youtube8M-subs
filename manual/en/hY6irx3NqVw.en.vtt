Hi, this is Matt Senatore on behalf of Expert
Village, and today we're going to learn how

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:15.970
to make my grandma Josephine's chicken parmesan.
Okay, now that our garlic is nice and brown,

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:35.829
let's add our tomato puree. Just make sure
we get that out of the bowl, there you go.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:01:06.079
Do a little stir, get the garlic mixed in.
And now we're going to add our tomato paste.

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:12.080
Now since I'm using two twelve ounce cans
of tomato paste, I'm going to put one can

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:27.659
of water for each can of tomato paste. And
then we're going to stir this to make it nice

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.189
and even. We don't want any clumps, so we
just keep stirring it, until it's nice and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:54.039
thick and even. It's smoothing out a little
bit,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:01.619
and the garlic is mixed in nicely, and everything
is mixed together nicely. Just a little bit

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:16.630
of clumps here, but, let's get those out.
There we go, that looks nice. And now we're

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.960
ready to season.
