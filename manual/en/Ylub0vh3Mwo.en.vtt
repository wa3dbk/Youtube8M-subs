00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.180
Three things that you have to remember if
you're going to home school or tutor your

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.260
child is that it's not hard but you do have
to be serious about it and three of the most

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.150
serious things are, especially if you're going
to home school, you have to make sure that

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.759
you are legally prepared to do so and that
means checking with your state, with your

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.070
local representatives. You can look online
and find out what steps do I have to take,

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.640
do I have to fill out an application? Every
state is different but every state, home schooling

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.111
is legal but you have to make sure that you
are legally covered and ready to home school

00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:38.480
and take the necessary steps. The second thing
you have to make sure is that you have a workspace.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.820
You have to designate one place in your home
that throughout, anytime anywhere, this is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.730
going to be where we will home school. If
it's your kitchen table, then during the time

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.520
you're home schooling, no one is permitted
to bring food or anything, nobody is permitted

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.510
to disturb you at that place. That place is
the same, no matter where it is. You have

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.280
to designate it, you have to guard it. It
is the little school within your house. The

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.170
third most important thing is to be time consistent.
Every day at the same time or if you have

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.310
to have different times every day, just make
sure you know exactly what day, what time

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.310
you're going to devote a full hour, two hours,
whatever you decide you're going to do to

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.760
working with your child. You're not going
to let anybody interrupt you if you have to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.570
not answer phone calls, whatever you have
to do, everyone in your household will know,

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.990
this is the school time. This is the serious
time and children, when they're enjoying their

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.990
learning, they can go for up to two hours
without needing a break, even children as

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.880
young as four or five but it has to be fun
and if you need a break after the first hour,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.230
that's fine but make sure they know, ten minute,
five minute break, they come right back. Time

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.750
consistency. It can't, overemphasize it. Do
not let the little pushes and pulls of the

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.410
day make you say well, today we'll just put
it off till tomorrow cause that'll be the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.550
end of it.
