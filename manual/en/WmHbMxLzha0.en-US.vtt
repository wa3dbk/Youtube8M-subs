Hello everyone,

00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.925
Today I am presenting a butterfly tutorial

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.700
as promised last week

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.050
I made it using acrylic paint

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.325
and it is a bit of coloring technique

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.725
I was inspired by the zhostovo technique

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.250
I made the babyboomer manicure for the base

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.824
Click on the annotation to discover the tutorial

00:00:24.608 --> 00:00:27.920
Here is how I make the basic shape

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.064
I draw an X, then with my circular brush for zhostovo

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.152
zhostovo I draw two long drops on the top lines of the X,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.312
two smaller ones below

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.472
Two smaller drops on the bottom lines

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.448
and finally two small drops inside

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.952
The small drops are inside and the long drops are outside

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:50.576
Here is how I’ve made it

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.192
I was inspired by drawings that I saw on Google

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.416
as I do not know how to draw

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.416
The basic shape was difficult to make

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.664
and my butterfly looked like a myth, it was too ugly

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.216
With the X technique it is pretty much easier

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.800
I hope this technique will help you too

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.704
I made this shape on my babyboomer nail

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.528
I used a very light pink,

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.264
a mix white and a little amount of pink

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.536
I dip my brush into this pink

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.760
and make it slide in metallic blue acrylic paint

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.968
To make a kind of One Stroke

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.568
I apply my color at the bottom left

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.944
and work with the paint to make a gradient

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.120
I apply it on the side and make the gradient

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.624
while going towards the centre of the wing

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:52.112
Same thing this time using fluorescent paint

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.616
I dip in the pink and slide it in the fluorescent paint

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.744
I make the same thing on the top of the wing

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.256
It will create a faded bicolor wing

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.088
You will not have this result if you make one wing blue

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.720
and one wing fluorescent for example

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.800
Here it is very soft and light as it is a gradient

00:02:11.008 --> 00:02:16.176
Same thing for the bottom with fluorescent orange

00:02:17.344 --> 00:02:20.368
Next I add some iridescence to my butterfly

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.544
to keep the fairy tale effect

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.312
I took Jo Sonja’s iridescent paint, purple and gold

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.488
Using the same brush

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.344
I apply the purple on the orange

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.400
and the gold on the blue

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.400
The colors don't appear well in the video

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.816
As long as the paint is still a bit sticky

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.040
I add some golden pigments with my finger

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.408
Here is my magical butterfly

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.496
I show you the outlines of the butterfly on a fake nail

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.490
as I could not record those my nails

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.088
And so, with the very thing tartofraises brush

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.968
and with extremely diluted paint

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.000
I draw the basic outlines

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.888
following the shape I’ve made at first

00:02:55.984 --> 00:02:59.616
I divide the wing into two with a line

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.760
and round off all the angles on the top

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:08.528
and widen the outside of the wing to create depth

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.032
You should not make thin lines everywhere

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.544
otherwise your butterfly won’t have any depth

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.552
I widen only the outside

00:03:20.384 --> 00:03:24.528
I add the body and two antennas of the butterfly

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.272
by creating drops

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.280
I add some dots on the wings of butterfly

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.301
Here is the final result! 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.294
The hardest part of it was the details

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.968
because it has to be thin in the middle and wider outside

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.672
Otherwise the base of the colors is not complicated

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.080
it is very fast to make

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.448
I hope that you love this butterfly tutorial
