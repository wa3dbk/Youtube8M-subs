00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.190
Terribly scary, it’s terrifying.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.330
In this series of films we take you on a journey through the development...

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.479
...and creation of Efteling’s latest spectacular attraction.

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:19.929
In this episode we join the project team as they travel on a working trip to Germany.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.460
We also take a look at how work is progressing on the construction site.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.000
Has the adverse weather in recent weeks caused any delays?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.340
And what did the project team think of their first ride on a dive coaster?

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.570
This is 'The making-of: Baron 1898'.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:49.250
Around Christmas and New Year, the Baron 1898 construction site experienced snow and severe cold.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.700
Work has recommenced in earnest at the construction site but is everything still on schedule?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.199
We were due to work through the entire Christmas period and that’s what we did.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.679
We have had one or two setbacks.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.100
There were a few days on which it snowed quite heavily and we reached a virtual standstill. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.670
But we’ve since made up for the lost time and now we’re pretty much back on schedule.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.980
We are currently working on the tunnel beneath the new attraction.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.000
It’s reached the stage where we are now able to stand on the concrete floor.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.829
And we’re busy applying the brickwork to the terminal building.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.720
We need roughly another two weeks to complete the brickwork.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.140
And we’ve also made a start on the roofing; one roof is already watertight.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.579
We have even made a start on the building’s interior theming.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.139
Applying shading to the walls and ceilings and introducing the first of the smaller theme elements.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
From the beginning of February we will start to see a real rollercoaster.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.150
That’s when the track sections arrive and we make a start on constructing the tower.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.830
That will be a significant moment for us.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.240
The type of rollercoaster we are building is a dive coaster.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.570
The unique thing about which is that, for a few seconds, you are suspended in mid-air above the ground.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.780
This only serves to increase the excitement and anticipation.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.240
The rollercoaster manufacturer we selected is B&amp;M.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.260
B&amp;M, which specialises in the construction of dive coasters and has built more than 90 rollercoasters.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.059
The company is known for its exceptional quality, of which we will make optimal use.

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:11.959
This rollercoaster will be unique because, as you would expect, it has a story behind it, from beginning to end.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:17.379
You become part of that story from the moment you enter the queue to the moment you leave the attraction.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.139
That’s the thing I’m most proud of; that the rollercoaster is so unique, that there’s nothing standard about it.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.279
It’s important for us to look at other theme parks and their attractions.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.079
To be sure we’ve selected the right supplier and the right rollercoaster ride.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.460
That’s why we went to visit Heide Park, where we learnt a great deal.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.780
Not only in technical terms but also on an operational level. 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:42.139
To gain first-hand experience of a dive coaster, the project team has taken a working trip to Germany.

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.389
This is the Krake, a B&amp;M-built dive coaster.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.119
The rollercoaster supplier builds the track.

00:02:54.119 --> 00:03:00.579
But we have to put it all together and build the complete package surrounding it.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.720
We have to build the foundations, the steel frame has to be assembled and...

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.980
...then the electrical installations need to be fitted and connected.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.600
We work with local companies in this respect and...

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.620
...it’s good for them to see with their own eyes exactly how such a ride works.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:23.479
Our terminal building is clearly almost complete but then a large section of track has to be incorporated.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.319
That’s one of the things we’re looking at here, how to install the motor once the building is finished.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.280
From a technical perspective, this dive coaster is unbelievably well built.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.239
The ride is very smooth and very quiet; you can barely hear the track, just the sound of screaming people.

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.799
It is a technically very well planned and realised track and, of course, the drop is unique!

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.820
Terrifying!

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.539
As the project team returns to the Netherlands...

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.619
...people in Budapest are working hard on the construction of the lift tower.

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.650
As soon as this is completed it will be transported to Efteling.

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.470
And then it won’t be long before Kaatsheuvel’s first dive coaster ascends.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.890
