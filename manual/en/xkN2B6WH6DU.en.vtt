00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:10.500
“My name is Storai Stanakzai, I am in the
second class of jewellery at Turquoise Mountain.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.609
Me and Saida are very best friends here.

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:19.439
Unfortunately or fortunately, I don’t know
how to say, Saida is deaf.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.520
I think it is fortunately because when you
are not hearing something, then you will focus

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:33.600
100 per cent on your work, so…

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.399
Saida…

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.480
And she is so kind and really helped me in
my work.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.300
She is so talented.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.120
In Taliban, they didn’t let girls to go
outside and learn, study.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.540
We don’t have electricity and no music.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.040
Now I can study and I come outside.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:08.170
I born in an artistic family and they always
told me to “choose the artistic things”.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.429
Unfortunately, we have I think 80 per cent
of people that they are uneducated.

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:25.060
When they are going to study, they only choose
doctor, engineer, lawyer, like these, they

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:38.039
really never mind art and jewellery.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.099
From childhood up to now my father really
wanted his daughter to join the art.

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:52.539
We need to put colours on traditional things.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.090
We have problems.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.270
Especially girls have problems here.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.139
But I can live – not like the Taliban’s
period, I think.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:11.160
But I have to continue my study and I have
to do the things that I want, and I have to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.219
be strong.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.370
It is the ring for men.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.689
And it is my own design.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.260
I took the design from Turkmen books.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:37.840
I want to have a workshop here and work on
my own style, to have my own designs and after

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.129
that I will create a shop for learning to
others.”
