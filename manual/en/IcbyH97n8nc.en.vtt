00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.250
Not only did we used to play multiplayer in
the same room…but sometimes…we even connected

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.250
our systems.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.250
And like, physically.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.610
Not wirelessly, there were wires all over.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.890
Freaking…human console-pede.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.100
We were pretty sick.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:56.550
It’s Destruction Derby, for the original
PlayStation.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.850
Now, I grew up in a very, very, exceedingly
rural area.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.549
The kind of place that’s, like…the closer
you get, your watch starts to tick backwards.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.740
The kind of place where you get there and
wonder how it turned into the 1950s all the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.740
sudden.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.299
The bad parts of the 1950s, not the good parts…

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.890
Not the malt shops, and the poodle skirts.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.370
So playing this brings back memories, not
only of a specific era of gaming, but of growing

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.490
up in a specific place, where demolition derbies
actually happen, on a regular basis, most

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.700
of the year.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.980
And also, no one goes who didn’t get there,
in a vehicle that looks like it belongs, in

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.070
that very derby.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.470
So this one, just…this one hits a little
close to home.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.080
I don’t even need to play it, to tell you
about Destruction Derby.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.409
I lived Destruction Derby.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.930
Anyway, you flip over the case, and the game
says it supports the link cable.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.930
What that really means is human console-pede.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.190
And see, it works because the consoles eventually
bind themselves together, and all the poop

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.750
passes to the next one, like a poop chain.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.590
Also says the crowd is rough and ready.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.060
For what, I have no idea, but if it’s rough,
I don’t want to know.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.860
Nonetheless, you finally load up the game,
and you get some menu screens that look like

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590
Microsoft Word 97.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.580
Fortunately, no one buys video games for the
menu screens, least of all the people from

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.620
back home, they can barely read.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.830
That says “cars.”

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.830
Not “people.”

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.050
See, in cities, they have police.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:36.440
Back home, we have forests.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:52.690
You know, I hope I don’t sound too harsh
on this thing, because I kind of like it.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230
In fact, it’s actually kind of awesome.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.230
Kind of.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.740
I mean, it’s not really good, not in the
actual definition of the word “good.”

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.720
But at the same time, neither is a demolition
derby.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.760
I mean, it’s just beat-up cars that are
going to the dump anyway, crashing into each

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.200
other before they get there.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.850
That’s not good.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.680
That’s prisoners arm wrestling in line for
the gallows.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.780
Does it really matter who wins?

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.550
Well, in this case, yes—yes, it does.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.400
Because I kind of like it.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.489
It’s simple, it’s ugly, it’s…ugly,
it’s not a pretty sight…but it’s fun.

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:35.320
It’s hard not to have fun, with a game like
Destruction Derby.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.790
So what can you do?

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.129
Well, you can have a traditional demolition
derby, where you drive in a huge circle and

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.879
try to die last, that’s the objective…but
that’s actually the least interesting mode

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.879
in the game.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.510
For me, the real bulk of the experience is
the derby races.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.750
Basically, this is just a normal race, but
one where you can also smash the hell out

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.750
of people.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.459
And actually, one of the coolest things about
it is the presentation.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.180
The cars actually show gradual damage, which
is pretty impressive stuff for the PS1.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.160
They get bent up, they start to smoke…and
it feels good, too.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.459
Like, when you smash a car from the side?

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:18.060
There’s a nice, violent sense of impact,
and the cars spin and fly all over the place…

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.890
So, for what it is, Destruction Derby is a
good one.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:51.280
I don’t think it’s a 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.419
secret that, a lot of games from this particular
era have aged kind of poorly.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.680
But I’m actually really impressed with how
well this one holds up.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.720
It still plays well.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:09.020
I mean, the controls are a bit delicate, take
some getting used to…but once you do, it

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.180
plays just fine.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.680
It’s actually still fun to play, which is
awesome.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.000
Plus, you can watch your replays.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.340
It’s like derbies without the fairgrounds.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.410
Which is an improvement.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.250
Smells terrible there.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.410
I grew up in a sh*tty place, it’s Destruction
Derby, for the original PlayStation.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.340
Whether you play alone or sew your consoles
into one console, you sick weirdo…this is

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.320
fun for the whole family.
