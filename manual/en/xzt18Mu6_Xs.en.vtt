00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.750
Hi, we're Zach and Jody Gray and

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:06.870
we're now going to cover the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.270
steps of getting custom balance

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.960
in your Camera using the Expodisc

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.240
And we highly recommend that you

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.880
guys watch all five of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.040
the different videos that we put

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.040
together because that's going to help

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.290
you to learn how to use it

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.340
in any given lighting situation and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.090
maximize the results that

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.830
you're going to get out of the ExpoDisc.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.410
Now we're going to go through

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.450
the steps of getting custom white balance right in your camera.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:28.990
So we're going to have Meredith our model

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.370
come on up, thank you.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.990
So step number one

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.620
is in our camera, we want

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.050
to make sure that it's set to

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.160
custom white balance, so make

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.470
sure that you're in your

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.520
manual and checking that out

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.610
so you know how to do for

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.340
your camera body, step number

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.660
two is you're going

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.080
to stand where your subject

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.890
will be standing so we kind

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.730
of scoped up the area and we

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.600
know that we want a shoot Meredith right here.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.050
I'm going to be standing over there

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.070
where the camera is shooting this way.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.190
So what we want to do is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.200
we want to stand where

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.500
subject is or is going

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.830
to be, sometimes we'll do this

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.840
before they come on over, we're

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.320
going to put the ExpoDisc over

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.350
our lens and point it where we're going to be shooting from.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.220
The next thing that we need

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.270
to do step three is need

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.980
to get a good exposure, so make

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.190
sure that you check the following

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.740
video where we talk about how

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.870
to get an exposure with the ExpoDisc.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.400
So make sure to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.510
watch that, but once we have

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.180
our correct exposure, now we

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.650
are going to simply to take a

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.120
shot, and the thing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.810
to remember when you take a shot is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.610
unless you're using

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.400
back-button focus with camera,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.610
you're going to try and take a

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.780
shot with ExpoDisc over the

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:33.800
lens and it's going to

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.060
be like &amp;lt;whirring noise&amp;gt; it's going

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.120
to be making some really hard noises

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.860
because it's not going to be able to focus.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.330
So what you simply do

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.840
is you can switch your camera's focus

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.570
to manual focus take a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.900
shot and then simply

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.220
just make sure you put it back to autofocus.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.550
The next step is you want

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.850
to double check and make sure

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.250
that that exposure that you just took is correct.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.650
So, you're going to look

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.320
at the back of your camera and

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.670
look at your histogram, if you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.830
see the spike down the middle

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.560
or close to the middle you

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.620
know that you're in that sweet spot that you want to be.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.180
The next thing of what you're

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.160
going to do is you're actually

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.810
going to apply that color

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.590
in your camera, from Canon

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.320
to Nikon users the process

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.260
varies, so make sure that

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.620
you check your manual on how

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.630
to apply that custom color right in your camera.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.610
So go ahead and check that out,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.420
and then now you're ready to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.770
shoot your subject and you'll get

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.600
great color right inside your camera.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.540
The question often comes up

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.600
how often do I need

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.750
to grab a new white balance,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.470
and the answer is any time

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.250
the light changes, and it really

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.600
doesn't take that long once

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.920
you get in a habit of doing it, it takes only a few seconds.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.400
So, I'm going to demonstrate

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.980
how fast it can actually

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.470
go, so we'll have Meredith

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.400
come on up, and we're going

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.200
to shoot her right here, so

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.620
I stand in this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.930
area, I point it towards where and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.310
when we're shooting from, I adjust

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.570
my camera settings so I have

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.660
a down the line exposure, take the shot.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.720
Now I'm going to go ahead and walk and shoot our subject.
