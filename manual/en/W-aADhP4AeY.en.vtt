Hi, I'm Rithika. I'm a natural food chef
and the owner of vegan bakery called the Green Store

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.440
Today I'm going to show you
a very healthy Gajar Halwa recipe.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.140
It's vegan that means it has no dairy
products

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.240
no ghee, no mawa, no milk to know the
recipe stay tuned

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.040
The ingredients for this healthy Gajar Halwa are,

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.940
400 grams of carrots which have only been cut and steamed.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.060
3/4 cup of jaggery which has been melted

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.940
2 pods of cardamom, 2 teaspoons of pistachio and 3/4 cup of cashew nuts

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.640
The first thing you need to do is grate
the warm carrots

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.160
The carrots are done. I'm now going to powder the cashew into a very fine powder

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.280
and also going to pound the pistachio and the cardamom together in a mortar and pestle

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.600
because I want them a little coarse

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.680
Did you realize that this recipe is also oil free, so for all of you health conscious people out there

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.860

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.660
So this is almost done it's nice and coarse, Its time now to powder the cashew. Don't go anywhere

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.800
the cashews has been powdered it's now time to assemble its dessert

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.200
the first thing I'm going to do is to add the melted jaggery to the carrots

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.160
mix it well

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.380
Once the jaggery is mixed well, it's time to add the powdered cashew

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.500
we'll add a little bit at a time

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.220
and mix it well.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.820
Once it's all mixed, we will add the pistachios.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.820
You can also add other nuts like almonds and raisins and walnuts

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.200
