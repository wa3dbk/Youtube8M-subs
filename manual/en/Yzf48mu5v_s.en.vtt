00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Michel Naubert may only be 13 years old but he's learned a lot in a short   

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
period of time about the importance of staying healthy and strong.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"He had severe kidney failure when he was born and so by by age 3 he needed a transplant.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 His father gave him a kidney."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Michel is particularly aware of how to keep his food safe from contamination and for good reason.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 He just doesn't have what it takes to fight off infection.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"Where someone else might just have an upset stomach or feel like maybe they've 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
got a 24 hour flu in Michel's case it could mean life and death."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Dr. Jeff Farber is Health Canada's leading expert on microbial hazards such as listeriosis.  

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He says listeria for the most part only affects high risk individuals like 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
diabetes, HIV Aids, alcoholism and organ transplant recipients like Michel.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
&amp;quot;You may have one or two cells of listeria monocytogenes on that leaf of lettuce.  

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
If those cells encounter an individual whose immune system is weakened 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
they can take advantage of this and they can actually pass through the stomach 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
into the intestine and what happens is that they actually cross the intestinal wall

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and migrate and make their way into the liver and spleen where they can actually 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
multiply in these organs and then invade the rest of the body.&amp;quot;

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Those with weakened immune systems should take extra care when handling and preparing food.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Be sure raw meat, poultry, fish and seafood is separated from other food in your grocery cart and refrigerator.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Proper cooking is the best way to make sure your food is safe to eat. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Always remember to cook raw meat, poultry, fish and sea food to a safe internal temperature.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
A digital food thermometer works best. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Some foods are at higher risk for food borne illness than others, like:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Hot dogs and deli meats; raw or undercooked meat; poultry and seafood; 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
refrigerated smoked fish or seafood; unpasteurized juice, cider and milk; soft and semi-soft cheeses; 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000
refrigerated pâtés and meat spreads and uncooked foods made from raw or unpasteurized eggs.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
&amp;quot;It's not just important just for me but its important to like everyone too, 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I mean you know no one wants to get sick really so, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
except if you have like a big exam or something.&amp;quot; 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
