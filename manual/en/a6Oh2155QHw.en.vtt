00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:13.243
Can you explain how Javascript and jQuery
are different?

00:00:13.243 --> 00:00:15.193
JavaScript and jQuery are the same thing.

00:00:15.193 --> 00:00:20.163
I know they both start with J, and both of
them are used in web development.

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:23.333
That doesn't mean they are the same thing.

00:00:23.333 --> 00:00:26.743
You're right, in that they aren't exactly
the same.

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:30.823
jQuery is a subset of the JavaScript libraries.

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:33.433
What are jQuery libraries used for?

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:40.403
jQuery is used to simplify HTML actions like
traversing documents, animation, Ajax interactions

00:00:40.403 --> 00:00:42.173
and event handling.

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:46.403
I've heard people say you should learn jQuery
or JavaScript.

00:00:46.403 --> 00:00:50.922
If you know jQuery, you'll be able to do most
of what you'd do with JavaScript without much

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:53.283
more information or commands.

00:00:53.283 --> 00:00:57.203
So I do not need to learn JavaScript if I
learn jQuery.

00:00:57.203 --> 00:01:02.113
You have to know JavaScript to make proper
use of jQuery, such as linking it into the

00:01:02.113 --> 00:01:03.973
rest of the page.

00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:09.023
You cannot use jQuery to its full potential
without learning JavaScript.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:12.003
And where would you use jQuery?

00:01:12.003 --> 00:01:15.882
JavaScript creates the interactive web pages
people like to see.

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:19.692
Slide shows, multimedia presentations --

00:01:19.692 --> 00:01:22.043
Until they crash and error out.

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:24.553
I'm tired of Java errors --

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.753
Java is not JavaScript.

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.833
Two separate languages.

00:01:28.833 --> 00:01:33.272
And then there are the Adobe plugin errors
when multimedia tries to run.

00:01:33.272 --> 00:01:40.742
The Adobe Flash presentation may use Adobe
but be called via JavaScript AKA jQuery libraries.

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:46.162
But the crashing is entirely Flash's fault,
which is why HTML5 essentially eliminates

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:47.463
the need for it.

00:01:47.463 --> 00:01:51.253
That's why Adobe isn't supporting Flash anymore.

00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:54.552
Why isn't JavaScript used more often?

00:01:54.552 --> 00:01:58.663
JavaScript was not rendered the same in all
browsers, whereas Java is the same on all

00:01:58.663 --> 00:02:02.113
machines because it utilizes native libraries.

00:02:02.113 --> 00:02:07.393
Now web standards say it is, but that bad
experience still affects everyone.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:10.443
Why is jQuery still dominant over JavaScript?

00:02:10.443 --> 00:02:15.263
A lot of people say they built a site in jQuery
but not Java Script.

00:02:15.263 --> 00:02:18.953
jQuery was developed with web design in mind.

00:02:18.953 --> 00:02:23.773
You can spell out common scripting functions
in fewer lines of code from jQuery than with

00:02:23.773 --> 00:02:30.173
other JavaScript methods.
