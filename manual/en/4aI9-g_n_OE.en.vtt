00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940
Now you guys have two choices.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:04.720
You either leave quietly,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.140
we take the body,

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.420
or you stay,

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.340
we beat the shit out of you,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.020
we take the body.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.160
Besides, me and Billy found him first.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.120
Yeah, Vern told us how you found him.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.740
(In high pitch voice) Oh Billy, I wish we never boosted that car.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.840
Oh Billy, I think I just turned my Fruit of the Looms into a fudge factory.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.500
That's it, your- your ass is grass!

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.160
Hold it.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.620
Ok, Chambers you little faggot.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.500
This is your last chance.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.260
Whaddya say, kid?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.840
Why don't you go home and fuck your mother some more?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.980
You're dead.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.540
Come on, Chris, let's split.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.380
-They're not taking him. 
-Come on, man, that's crazy.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.440
They're not taking him.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.540
He's got a knife, man!

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.320
Ace, come on, man.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.260
You're gonna have to kill me, Ace.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.060
No problem!

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.060
[GUNSHOT]

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.340
You're not taking him.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.140
Nobody's taking him.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.360
Come on kid, just give me the gun before you take your foot off.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.520
You ain't got the sack to shoot a woodchuck.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.300
Move Ace.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.600
I'll kill you, I swear to god.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.980
Come on, Lachance, gimme the gun.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.360
You must have at least some of your brother's good sense.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.980
Suck my fat one. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.320

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.960
What're ya gonna do, shoot us all?

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:07.960
No, Ace.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.400
Just you.
