00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.350
there's a gay teen who ripped out some
Bible pages

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.090
as a kind of protest against anti-gay
bigotry

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.139
and he's been suspended by his school in
Texas Huffington Post wrote about this

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.690
the American Humanist Association
formally sent a complaint

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.010
to Birdville Independent School District
in Texas

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.109
saying that this young man's first
amendment rights have been violated

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.599
he his last name is Smith he is gay he
is Christian

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.910
he says he was told time after time it's
cool that being gay is a sin and that

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.030
gays go to hell

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.030
and as a kind a form of protest he
brought his own Bible into school

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.989
and he ripped out some pages from
Leviticus which is the portion that

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:42.860
contains

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.660
a very popular verse that anti-gay
bigots like to use

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.160
and he was sent down to the principal's
office

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.730
he was told that he can continue
carrying around his ripped Bible

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.180
but he can't tear any more pages out he
shouldn't do that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.230
then eventually he was brought back down

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.790
about the Bible ripping to the
principal's office and he was asked

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.240
how would muslims feel if a student was
tearing up the koran

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.580
he was then suspended for three days has
Bible confiscated

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.240
according to the letter first divall
when is

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.970
since when is how Muslims would feel
criteria for anything in Texas schools

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.110
that seems like a weird

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.619
barometer to me but further there is now

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.170
the ACLU is involved the American
Humanist Association is involved in

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.070
there saying listen you either have to
you

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.900
I allow students to do what they want
with their books

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.000
or you have to ban all religious books
from the school period

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.290
but this really seems like you are
specifically hand picking this because

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.720
it is the Christian Bible

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.979
and because it is this stuff about
homosexuality it is his book

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.159
right Luis Soto we can have one of two
scenarios

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.820
if the policy is that you can carry

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.770
religious texts you can carry them
regardless if ripped pages if they are

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.420
yours

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.640
however if the policy is you can't carry
religious taxed

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
there should be no Bibles at all in the
school I don't see that happening

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.610
anytime soon

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.920
now I and II don't understand how
someone kinetic

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.959
get reprimanded arm or

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.770
suspended for destroying their own
personal property in a way that harms

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.900
nobody hates

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.440
pretty amazing what's happening here
