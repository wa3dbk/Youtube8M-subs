00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.400
Right now we are
at Washington Park.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.033
We're here at Park Road Fitness.

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.567
We're here at Stella Alpina.

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:06.867
We're here at
Earth Beam on Broadway.

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:08.900
We're here now at Burlingame
High School, and now were at

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.300
the Burlingame Farmer's Market.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.033
Welcome to BurlingameBuzz.com.

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.600
My name is Raziel Ungar and
over the next couple of minutes

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.033
you're gonna have a nice
snapshot of unprecedented

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.000
footage all about our
special town of Burlingame.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.133
Enjoy.

00:00:21.133 --> 00:00:23.867
Burlingame is just
a wonderful place

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.033
to live and/or work.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:29.633
I've been all around this
great, big world and this is

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.166
just a very, very special town.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:34.867
We toured the entire Bay Area
for potential places to live,

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.200
and we selected Burlingame
because I love

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.367
the small-town feel.

00:00:39.367 --> 00:00:43.367
It was this small town, the
old plus the new; it just was

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:45.133
very attractive to us.

00:00:45.133 --> 00:00:46.367
There was a charm to
Burlingame and it was close

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:47.567
to San Francisco.

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:49.333
Obviously Burlingame
Avenue is great;

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.367
it's got the best of all worlds.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.467
Burlingame has
incredible shopping.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:55.266
It just does.

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.667
When you go to any of the
restaurants or go to any of the

00:00:57.667 --> 00:00:59.467
businesses, you're gonna
have a friendly face.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:03.900
Really good freeway access
to both the 101 and the 280,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.133
and the school districts
are also very great.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.734
There's high-level
involvement, whether it's

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:12.000
volunteering in
classrooms or fundraising.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.867
All of our schools score
over the threshold of 800 on

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.834
the Academic Performance Index.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:20.166
I have students who get
accepted to the most revered

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.133
colleges and are ready
to be critical thinkers

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.467
and go off into the world.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.166
Burlingame's a good
community because it's small.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.300
There's not very much
of a crime record.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.333
The weather is, shall
I say, Camelot-like.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:36.333
With the Avenue right there,
you can take a walk when

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:37.900
you are too hot in the kitchen.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.266
When I walk down
the street here, you know,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.100
I feel like people know me,
they recognize me.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.100
You can get to Lake Tahoe,
it's not that far away.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.467
You can get to Carmel.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.700
You can get to Napa Valley.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.233
There's, within an hour's
drive, there's plenty of places

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:53.667
to go hiking and enjoy some
really beautiful country.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.600
It's a great community,
there's a lot of good families,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.734
a lot of good kids.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.934
It's got all the amenities
that a family and people with

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:01.934
children often are looking for.

00:02:01.934 --> 00:02:05.734
You'll say to yourself.,
"This is really quaint."

00:02:05.734 --> 00:02:08.133
Burlingame's the perfect
location because of our

00:02:08.133 --> 00:02:10.166
proximity to the airport.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:14.066
So it's been a great place
to live, and I would highly

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:15.166
recommend it.

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.166
There really are no bad
neighborhoods in Burlingame.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:19.133
Everything about
Burlingame is awesome.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.266
I love it here.

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:23.133
Burlingame is
the best, you know?
