00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.880
One of my friends who was with
me died in the accident

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.240
May his soul rest in peace

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.920
"Not worth it"

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.320
I was involved in a car accident that put
me into a coma for two weeks

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.320
The main injury is in my spinal cord

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.440
which left my lower body
completely paralyzed

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.280
One of my friends who was with
me died in the accident

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.960
May his soul rest in peace

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.880
We would like to bring awareness to our
society about safety measures

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.840
that might help us avoid such accidents

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200
What are they in your opinion?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.160
An accident can happen in fractions
of a second

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.800
You might find yourself in a car accident
in a blink of an eye,

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:05.840
but the problem are the injuries
that might result from the accident

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.760
Whether you are injured yourself or you
inflict an injury on someone else

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.280
A person who drives recklessly might
not be risking his own life,

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.720
but he would be risking other
people's lives

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.520
Our youth is well-behaved, thank
God for that,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.960
but they lack awareness

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.200
What about the recovery and the medical
issues that you went through?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.680
All this led you to a point where you
can completely depend on yourself,

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.400
so you're living your life independently,
right?

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.800
Yes, and I am grateful for that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.480
I have been married for two years

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.560
I live in my own house and drive my
own car

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.000
I live my daily life as normal
as possible,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.760
I am only using the wheelchair
to help me stay mobile

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.800
and reach anywhere I want to go

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.720
What is the message you would like to send
across to our youth?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.040
Be it about traffic laws
and safety of others

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.800
I'd like to tell them that being 5 minutes late
is much better than suffering for a lifetime

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.720
being paralysed,
suffering a relative's death

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.960
or even inflict an injury on
another person
