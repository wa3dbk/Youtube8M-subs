Hey, Jon here and this is the Canon
Rebel t3i and I'm just going to quickly

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.000
show you how to take a manual photograph
with this camera. So what we're going to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.929
do is we're going to turn on our camera.
We're going to switch it over to M which

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.189
stands for manual. Now in manual exposure
mode that's where you're controlling

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.449
basically three main settings: shutter
speed, aperture, and ISO, to manipulate the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.119
amount of light coming into the camera
and trying to get the right exposure.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.480
I'll set a link to another video I have
if you want to learn more about exactly

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.239
how SLRs work. So right now you can see
I'm an M. In M mode it has the shutter

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
speed highlighted. The shutter is the
door that sits in front of the sensor. So

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.660
if I lift open my mirror here you can
almost see the door right there that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.719
sits in front of the sensor. That's the
shutter door and you decide how long

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:59.100
that stays open. Now when you do that, (let's see here to get it to pop-up) in order to do

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.399
that you turn your mode dial here and
you can see that changes my shutter

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.600
speed. As I'm changing my shutter speed
you can see that my ISO is changing,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.799
that's because it's on automatic right
now and it's compensating automatically. If I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.600
want to change my aperture, then I hold
down the AV button and you can see it

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.659
switches over to aperture and I use that
same wheel to manipulate that. The

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
aperture is the iris that's inside the
lens.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.490
It's always open until you take the
picture or if you use a depth of field

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.600
preview button. So it's kind of difficult
to demonstrate on this camera. The ISO is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
accessed through this button right here.
So you push that button and you can

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.460
either have the camera choose or you can
put it on auto. Right now I'm going to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.899
put it on 400 which is a good ISO to
have just for general shooting outside

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.060
or maybe inside with decent light. Now
as I tap the shutter button it's going

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.180
to wake up my light meter and this
little peg appears and it disappears

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.079
after a couple seconds. But if I tap it
again it'll come up. That is the light

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.820
meter; that is the camera telling me if
the exposure is correct or not and I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.110
need to manipulate these settings in
order to get that little peg to be in

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.119
the middle in Zero. So in order to do
that I can, let's say I want to change my

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.470
aperture first. I'm going to open up this
aperture as wide as it'll go so it will

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.850
let in as much light as possible. So in
order to do that I push the AV button,

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.320
and then I move the dial and this
particular lens will only open up to f/3.5.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.730
The lower this number is the more light
it will let in, but this lens is 18-55mm

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.900
standard will only open up to f/3.5. So
that means that my shutter speed, you can

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.300
see, my exposure is still way overexposed.
I'm more than four times, actually, higher,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.780
more light coming in than I need. So that
means I need a slower shutter speed

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.980
and that's fractions of a second. So you can
see as I manipulate my shutter speed, you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.320
can see my light meter goes towards zero.
So I'm at 1/800th's of a second. Now that's at 400 ISO.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.880
The ISO is the light sensitivity of the
digital sensor and the higher this

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.850
number goes, it's basically just pumping
more electricity through the sensor to

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.770
make the same picture with less
light. The trade-off is that it tends to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.630
be grainier and not very high quality.
Now once you have that done, I'm gonna

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.280
turn on the live view here by pushing this
button just to make a little easier, I have,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.450
you can move your focus point during
live view with these arrow buttons.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.260
Pushing the shutter button halfway down
to focus, you can see I also have my

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.650
light meter, my shutter speed, my aperture,
are all listed right here as well as the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.680
number of photographs I have left and
then my ISO. So that's all available in

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.060
live view as well. So I press halfway down to
focus, it's green, it beeped, it's in full

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.950
focus, now I can push it all the way down
to take the photo, and now you can see my

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.820
photo is correctly exposed. Now let's say
I'm going to turn off the live view here

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.160
for a second, and let's say I take my
shutter speed and I manipulate it so

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.600
that my light meter reads negative two.
So that's 1/3200th's of a second

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.470
that's very fast.
Go back to my live view, now you can see,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.360
that picture is almost completely dark.
But if I change my shutter speed, you can

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.450
see my light meter moving here, you can
see it gives you an exposure preview,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.010
look at that, so you can tell through the
live view how bright or dark something

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.140
is going to be and see visually as well
as on the light meter. And then if I

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.239
manipulate my aperture, which I can only
make smaller right now, it'll make it

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.169
darker. So that's an excellent learning
tool an excellent way of really getting

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.360
into photography. That's just the basics
so go

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.349
and go out and practice, ask a lot of
questions, and I hope this has helped.

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.349
