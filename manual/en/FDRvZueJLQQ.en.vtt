Hi, guys.

00:00:01.049 --> 00:00:02.049
John here with Realtruck.com.

00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:13.640
Today I want to show you how to install the
Du-Ha Under Seat Storage System on this GMC

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:29.060
Sierra Denali.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.010
Okay guys, you can see here we've got it laid
out here, where we can take a look at our

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.920
Under Seat Storage System.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.780
You can see by looking at it that it's made
out of a tough durable polymer construction,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.390
so it's going to hold up and last.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.329
You're not going to have to worry about this
thing getting torn up in your truck when you

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.329
want to use it.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.219
Also, some of the cool things about it, are
that it can be used as an under seat gun storage

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:50.219
case.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.800
Which, check with your state to make sure
it's legal.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.510
It is legal in most fifty states, but check
your applicable laws for that.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.899
Also, you have straps, and I'm going to show
you how to put these straps on here in just

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.710
a minute, which is going to hold this in place.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.250
So, guys if you've ever been looking for something,
instead of having that stuff under the seat,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.690
and it comes rolling out underneath your feet,
whatever, this is the thing to use, guys.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.040
You can throw stuff in here, and close the
seat down.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.040
You can't see it.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.070
It's not going to roll out, not going to be
a safety issue.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.290
So, let's get this in this truck.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.550
It's so simple to install our Under Seat Storage
System, that literally anybody who could pick

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.270
this thing up and carry it and put it in the
truck can install it.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.480
I'm going to show you how to do that right
now.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.470
Okay, guys, that's how easy it is to put into
the truck.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.470
Just as easy to take out.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.350
I'm going to grab those straps, and show you
how you can put that in there to secure it.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.370
Basically, the reason why you want to do that
is so that way when you put on the brakes,

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.960
remember that stuff I talked about rolling
out from under the seat?

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.670
You don't want this thing sliding out from
under the seat either, so we've got straps

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.140
to strap that down.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.060
If you ever look up underneath your truck,
and if you have kids you probably know about

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.600
this, there are some metal loops right up
here at the bottom of the back of the seat

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
back.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.050
All we're going to do is take this strap and
feed it through those metal loops.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.950
All right guys, we've got our straps tightened
down, so this thing won't come sliding out

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.480
from under the seat when you put the brakes
on, or anything like that.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.160
What I want to do is go ahead, and close these
seats down, and show you how well this thing

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
is hidden under here.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.950
So if you wanted to keep your gun safely secured
in your truck, or any other valuables, or

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.850
whatever you want to put in there, you can.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.040
And if you close the seat down, you can see
it kind of disappears.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.470
Still plenty of space to get in here, and
there you go.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.870
Seats are down.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.980
Nobody can see it.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.590
It's still very easy, quick to get in to get
whatever you need out of here, so there you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.590
go guys.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.530
And remember, until next time, happy motoring.
