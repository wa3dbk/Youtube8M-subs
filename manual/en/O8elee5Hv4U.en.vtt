00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:05.589
Aand you have to realize if you come as
far as we did that's a science of 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.010
uh... thousand small steps,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.300
you don't sit there with a glass of
wine

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.989
and say

00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:15.169
in two thousand and twelve, we will 
reach this uh... this is uh... daily

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.860
work

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.859
and your

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.689
going like

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.849
like this it's not a very straight because
it's undiscovered country.  

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.210
On any given day at any given time we can be
the first

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.920
first eyes in the world to see something new
you know 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.610
that

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.390
you know every

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.170
everyday has a promise and of course
that doesn't happen every day but um...

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.000
 it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.120
when you see that first glimpse of
something that

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.990
uh... it's... it's makes everything else

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.160
really worthwhile. We were working with

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.010
uh... developing pro drugs in other words
drugs that can be cleaved by certain

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.080
enzymes in the tumor to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.270
to be active and

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.480
so we wondered well if we can

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.380
use...

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.880
use this approach,  maybe we can
also use this basic idea for

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.549
uh... for detecting enzyme activity in
serum.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.170
We had to design  a nanoparticle of about twenty
nanometers  

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.340
which has an ability to

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.070
quench the light of an organic sensitizer
- that's a dye and this dye shines

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.790
if you put some light on it  shows floresence
but only 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.180
if it's free of the nanoparticle. So it
goes together

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.350
then the dye doesn't shine, and there's a
linker,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.770
and this linker can be  chopped by an
enzyme and that's how we detect our

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.390
cancer enzymes, so the absence of an
enzyme

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.540
nanoparticle and dye are together

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.299
in the presence of an enzyme

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.290
they become loose and then the dye shows
fluorescence so the number of photons we get out

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.590
or just how much light we get out is indicative

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.079
of how active

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.250
this enzyme is in blood serum

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.600
and then we do these tests for fifteen enzymes in parallel

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.330
and get something which we call 
a body's signature just showing how

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.099
much of each enzyme is there. But the working hypothesis is that it works on 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.129
uh... every

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:27.540
solid tuma a solid tumor

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.069
as a tumor somewhere in your body not
like your lukemia, for instance

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.790
and so a solid tumor has problems

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.900
it has to connect to connect to the blood supply

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.330
it has to grow against the tissue

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.219
and then of course it has to colonize
the whole body, 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.359
and so this enzymes helping the
tumor doing just that.

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.399
We're actually testing
this on human serum samples now

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.299
and

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.629
and were collaborating with Universe of
Kansas cancer center

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.359
to test some other kinds of cancer .
And we do work with

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.879
an expert in statistics that's Doctor
Gary  Gadbury, 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.969
who is analyzing the data that we have, and
we needs this independent uh...

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.219
statistical analysis to be sure that our
results are really meaningful and

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.249
actually, he found that they have a ninety
five percent

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.260
probability

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.289
to really

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:24.529
see early breast cancer and early

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:29.680
lung cancer in human patients 
 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.599
This project is one part of the bigger endeavor that we
have

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:34.649
so cancer

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:39.849
detection and blood samples is very
vital because early detection will save 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.289
alot of lives,

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.209
we estimate that they can

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.790
save approximately fifty percent of
lives with the existing technology that is

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.609
available right now by recognizing
cancer earliler.  The same technology can be

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:58.620
applied to find tumors in your body
and to mark tumor boundaries. 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.569
Surgeons have always the problem

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.439
that they have to excise the right tumor

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.570
you don't want to excise too much

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.780
and you don't want to excise too little
this technology helps to see the exact

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.889
boundries between cancer and healthy
tissue

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.490
I have post docs in

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.530
my lab who are also

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.549
involved

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.249
uh... and actually a couple of very good 
post docs came from 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.680
Dr. Bossmann's lab, so they have a very

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.409
excellent background in  chemistry.

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:30.599
It's important is to see that if you
you want to beat cancer, we 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:36.389
have to be functional and you cannot do
this without the expert imput from 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.780
the uh... biology from the medicinal
side. And the hurdles at Kansas State 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.500
are usually very low and I appreciate I can collaborate with colleagues

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.080
but of course Dr. Troyer and my case that's a special case because

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.459
it works so well.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:51.279
and so much fun to do.
