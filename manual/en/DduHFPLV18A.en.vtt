bjbjqPqP Mike Chang: Hey, what s up guys?

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.510
Mike Chang at Six Pack Shortcuts bringing
another workout.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.430
It's got to take about ten minutes to do.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.150
Remember getting in shape doesn t take a long
time.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.530
It doesn t take a lot of hard work.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.500
It only takes working out smartly.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:30.880
So here we go.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:01:48.670
So there we go guys.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:02:11.700
The first one we did is skyscraper, followed
by the circles, 25 reps in one direction,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.560
25 reps in the other direction, then we went
to dumbbell swing with a jump squat, 10 reps

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.720
on those, finish off with jumping lunges testing
your toes all the way down, 10 reps on each

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720
side.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.340
Reps are going to be anywhere from about 15
to 30 seconds between the whole giant set.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.660
I am out of breath.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.480
And do as many as you can within 10 minutes.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.270
A really good on cardio, really good on toning
and tightening your muscles.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.500
Do them anywhere.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.470
