I'm learning at the same
time as my daughter is, and then when we're

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.320
going home we talk about 
everything single thing

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.199
that she does at nursery.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.299
When they get to about two and
a half they tend to need

00:00:18.299 --> 00:00:20.649
more children to play with to learn.

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:26.799
She's going to be used to having other
children around her, sharing,

00:00:26.799 --> 00:00:31.830
considering other people's feelings. Interacting
with adults is a big thing as

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.040
well, it's really scary if you're a
little child and there's other

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.480
big adults around.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.469
Bringing him out to the centre here gives
us a great opportunity to develop

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.980
his social skills, for him to play with toys
that we wouldn't necessarily have at

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.469
home, outdoor toys and things like that and
to see, meet other children and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.430
generally has a lot of fun and with his learning.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.940
He's not fazed by noise, children running
around him, and he's quite happy

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.800
to have other people pick him up, he's
not, they're not isolated anymore, which

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.890
tells you quite a lot really.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.970
The key worker for my son, she's been,
you know, helping because she

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.710
knows that my son is a bit quiet, she tries
to find out what he likes.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.320
They're really good.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.910
I can have a chat with the
key worker for Safa,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.630
what type of play she is doing,
then I can do similar things

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.810
at home with her.
There's no point sending your child to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.970
a nursery if you just bring them in the
morning and drop them off, take them home,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.360
don't talk to them about it, what
do you know what your child is learning.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.030
The nursery talk to me and explain that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.500
this is what we are doing, these are
the activities that we are doing and if you

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.250
can keep talking about it, interacting,
doing different activities at home, supporting

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.940
his language that's just giving
him that extra boost. When I had my second

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.740
child as well, at that point we
were struggling with child care and they kept

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.360
him in and they were very
supportive in that area as well, so it was

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.330
really good, yeah part of the family.
