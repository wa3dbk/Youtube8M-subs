00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.380
00:01
MATT: It's definitely not bad to be vain,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.359
I think it shows that you, you crd about your
appearance, you care about what other people

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:08.359
think.

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.190

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.530

The 29-year-old has spent a staggering Â£100,000
on his looks, and he says it's money well

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.590
spent.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.750
00:21
MATT: Got with the girls I wanna get with,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.000
I've been successful with all jobs just because
of my confidence.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.710
00:28
COMM: From an early age from London has been

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.680
no stranger to the beauty salon.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.559
00:34
MATT: Pretty much all my mates are like laddy

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.059
so they um, they kinda take the mick out of
me for uh being a little bit obsessed with

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.719
the way I look.

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.989
00:45
COMM: His regular treatments include manicures,

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.170
pedicures, waxing, tanning, eyebrow shaping
and even eyelash tinting.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.980
00:54
MATT: I am the only guy normally when I walk

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.519
into a salon and it's just full of beautiful
women and that doesn't bother me at all.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.059
01:03
COMM: The only thing Matt hasn't considered

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.980
is plastic surgery, because he's perfect already.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.970
01:08
MATT: Yeah I'm pretty good shape so I've got

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.870
good features all over.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.300
01:13
COMM: Matt says his looks have helped him

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.720
become a successful personal trainer, as well
as a fitness model, and a Dreamboys stripper.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.870
He also says he's a huge hit with the ladies.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.030
01:24
MATT: I'm never really the one to go hunting

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.880
girls, I tend to just let them come to me
and they uh, they seem to so yeah.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.890
01:36
COMM: But being good looking can also have

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.890
it's downsides.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.530
01:39
MATT: I've always been good looking and I've

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.680
always kind of been successful in sports and
just school, university and uh I think with

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.290
any kind of success you get jealousy.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.140
01:52
COMM: Despite it all, Matt isn't ashamed of

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.140
his vanity.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.560
01:56
MATT: Anyone that says I'm shallow or too

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.880
vain, I take it as a compliment, I smile when
it happens because it just means they're taking

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:26.849
notes from me and their jealous basically
so yeah I never react to it.
