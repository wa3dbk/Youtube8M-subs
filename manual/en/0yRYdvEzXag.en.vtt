00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.219
Legumes and cash and cover crops use natural
symbiotic relationships with soil microbes

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.219
to get nitrogen into the soil. NC State University's
Dr. Judy Grossman is working to provide farmers

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.380
with new insights on how to harness this resource.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.610
My work really involves looking at legumes
to try and figure out how we can really make

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.480
them the most efficient nitrogen source we
possibly can by looking at the microbial component

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.640
of the legume rhizobia symbiosis and we work
a lot with organic farmers simply because

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.190
right now those are the farmers who are really
interested in using legumes for nitrogen supply.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.870
As nitrogen prices go up, we going to need
to turn to some of these alternative processes

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.460
such as nitrogen fixation, and when that happens,
we need to hit the ground running, we can't

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.890
say "Oh, now we're going to start doing the
research." We really want to get to know how-when

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.940
you take a strain of bacteria and you look
at its DNA, how does it differ from other

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.500
strains of bacteria because you can have some
which are really high performers and they

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.459
fix a lot of nitrogen and you can have others
that don't really do a heck of a lot for the

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:15.549
plant. In my mind what would really help the
farmers is trying to understand the tools

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.549
they can use as farmers to help increase nutrient
supply to their croplands. So try to figure

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:30.029
out how much nitrogen is supplied when they
put a legume in the soil and let it decompose,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.329
how is that released, when its released, how
we can get more nitrogen into the legume by

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.329
enhancing the fixation ability of the microbes.
All these little pieces will be able to help

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:45.950
farmers to develop their own research their
own experimentation so they don't need to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.789
rely on the recipes. They can say "Oh, I know
that if I can calculate a square meter of

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.270
legume biomass, and I can calculate how much
I have and how much nitrogen is in that square,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.609
I can then figure out on my whole field how
much nitrogen is being added through this

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:08.229
legume to my soil". And so those are the kinds
of things I really want to give to farmers

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.720
in terms of having them understand how they
can control their own biological processes

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.080
in their fields on their own and not have
to rely on recipes.
