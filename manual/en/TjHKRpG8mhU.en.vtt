Mushroom sandwich

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.120
Today I'm going to make a delicious shiitake
sandwich, with ricotta cream and spinach

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.460
and a poached egg on top.
So let's cook?

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.720
Let's cook

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.940
First, I'll steam the spinach
in this steamer pan, here.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.940
So I'll add water to the bottom and 
spinach on top to cook in steam.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.520
What if I don't have a steamer?

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:49.280
Just take a pan and add some water,
then steam the spinach on a sieve.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.740
Now season the shiitake with 
olive oil, salt, black pepper

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.360
chopped chive and chopped garlic.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.540
- How many cloves?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.920
I'm using 5, but it depends on 
your taste for garlic.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.340
Now I'll mix this in a baking pan.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.660
Spread well the olive oil and 
seasonings on the mushrooms.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:21.440
Then bake it at 180ÂºC for about
30 min or until it's cooked.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.440
You can't wash the mushrooms, right?

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.700
You can't, because it absorbs
 too much water.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.640
Clean it with a wet cloth, or
even a dry one if it isn't too dirty.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.160
These were clean, so I
didn't do anything.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:48.060
Now cut the steamed spinach with a knife,
then mix it with 250g of ricotta cream.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:55.520
Then add salt and pepper and
the cream to our sandwich is ready.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.620
I'm hungry, Dani, I want some of
that already.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.660
Grab a spoon for me.
You need to test the food.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.540
I'm going to make an Australian
bread sandwich, but any bread is fine.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.680
I'll cut it in half and add olive oil
on both buns.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.760
And toast it a bit on the grill.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.400
- What did you say? Bun?
- Yes, both halves of the bread.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.960
- This is my shiitake sandwich for you.
- Vegetarian a cavalo?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:25.540
That's right. So click here how to
make delicious poached eggs.
