00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.260
Hello and welcome back. I'm Joseph
Hoffman. Today we're going to be doing a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.960
rhythm challenge together, so let's come
to the heartbeat mat and get started. For

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.160
the first part of our rhythm challenge
today, we're going to be doing four beats

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.000
of rhythm.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.250
I'm going to do it first and then you
have to echo it back, my turn and then

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.629
your turn. To make it more interesting
we're going to add some percussion too.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.960
Here we go.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.620
My turn first and then you echo back what
you hear.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.890
Here I go. Tah ti ti rest tah.
Your turn.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.319
ti ti ti ti tah tah. Your turn.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:14.780
Tiki tiki ti ti tiki tiki tah
tah tah tiki tiki tah

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:28.240
Tu-u ti ti tah

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:41.900
ti ti tiki tiki tiki tiki tah
tu-u ti ti tah

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.260
Ok, now we're going to make it a little
bit harder. Now instead of echoing each

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.180
line we're going to go through without
stopping so when we get to this beat, it's going

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.549
to go right on to the next row, through
the whole sequence of rhythms. I'll

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.299
demonstrate it once by myself and you
just listen, and then we'll try it again

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.299
together. So this time it's just me.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.309
One, two, three, four.
Tah ti ti rest tah

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:18.509

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:24.969

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:31.909

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:33.909

tu-u ti ti tah

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.980
Ok, now we're going to try it together.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.730
Here we go, one, two, you know what to do.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:53.950
Tah ti ti rest tah

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.010

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:17.370
ti ti tiki tiki tiki tiki tah
tu-u ti ti tah

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.770
Now it's time for the final challenge. For this part of the challenge you'll want to have your own

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.240
rhythm cards and a heartbeat mat, which
you can download from our website, so

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.590
let's get started.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.989
For this challenge, I'll speak a rhythm
for you, and you have to try and write

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.720
the rhythm on your own heartbeat mat
using these available rhythms. This first

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.820
rhythm will only use quarter notes and
sixteenth notes, so get these rhythm

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.900
cards ready and a blank heartbeat mat.
Here's the first challenge for you to solve.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.220
Bah bah ba ba ba ba bah.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:03.140
Can you write that rhythm on your own heartbeats? Here it is one more time.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.160
Bah bah ba ba ba ba bah. In three seconds the correct answer will appear.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.280
Here's the rhythm that I performed. Can
you say it with me? Point to each beat and

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.260
let's say it in rhythm words. Go.
Tah tah tiki tiki tah

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.650
Listen and try and figure out this
rhythm. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bah bah.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.420
Here it is one more time.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.920
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba bah bah.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.720
Here's the correct answer. Can
you point and say it with me in rhythm words?

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:59.970
Ready, go. tiki tiki tiki tiki tah tah. For this next one you'll also need

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:10.030
some eighth notes available to use. Here
it is. Buh buh buh buh ba ba ba ba buh.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.300
Here it is again. Buh buh buh buh ba ba ba ba buh.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.080
Here's the correct answer. Can you point
and say it with me using rhythm words?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:42.970
Ready, go. Ti ti ti ti tiki tiki tah. For this
next one you'll need quarter notes,

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.560
eighth notes, and half notes. Here we go.

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.729
ba-ah bah bah bah.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:11.080
Here it is again. Ba-ah bah bah bah.
Here's the right answer.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:22.599
Let's say it together. We'll say tu-u for the
half note. Ready, go. Tu-u ti ti tah. Last one

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:37.990
using the same possible rhythms again.
Ba ba ba ba ba-ah. Here it is again.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:44.949
Ba ba ba ba ba-ah. And here's the answer.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:56.319
Let's say it together. Go. Ti ti ti ti tu-u. Great job trying the rhythm challenge today. If

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.819
you'd like to improve your rhythm skills
even more you can come back and watch

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:06.219
this lesson again later. To become
excellent at anything requires that you

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:11.889
practice, sometimes struggle, and never
give up until you've mastered whatever

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:12.999
you want to learn.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:19.300
I know that you can become an amazing
pianist and musician. It's all up to how

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.939
hard you're willing to try every day.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:24.939
Thanks for watching and I'll see you
next time.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.420
let's do the Ti Ti Tah dance everybody!

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:45.760
Oh yeah!
Ti ti tah! Ti ti tah! Ti ti tah! Ti ti tah!

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.770
Tiki tiki! Tiki tiki! Tiki tiki! Tiki tiki!

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.479
New dance everybody! Help me out!

00:07:54.479 --> 00:07:56.479
Get rid of these.

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:58.479
Put these right there.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:00.479
