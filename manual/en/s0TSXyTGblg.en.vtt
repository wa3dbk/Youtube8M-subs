00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.720
So me and T.J. had to sleep a whole night in the Axe smelling tent

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.900
Every breath I could taste the smell. And I just got more and more angry!

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.580
The night finally passed and I woke up early in the morning before everyone else.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
So I could start with my master revenge plan

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.700
Was I tired? Maybe. That's the sacrifice you have to make for vengence.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.700
Every campsite had a water fountain coming out of the ground connected to a PVC pipe.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.800
I found the biggest Ziploc freezer bag I could find and started to fill it up with water.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.460
It was obviously a slow prosess. I had plenty of time to reconsider

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.160
To think about what T.J. said or what would happen after I got my revenge.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.820
But nothing stopped me. I was a squeaky voiced, hormone induced monster.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.580
Once the bag was full I went back to my tent and woke T.J. up.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.100
He got up and I told him to, "Watch this."

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.780
T.J. actually had no part in the revenge plan. I just wanted to suck him down with me.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.560
I think T.J. actually didn't wanna get revenge?

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.040
I ran towards the mega log tent and hid behind the real tent that was right next to the log one.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.200
Everyone was still inside. T.J. still had no clue what I was doing.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.940
Until I chucked the bag over the real tent.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.900
If everything went according to plan, the bag would break on the roof and the water would sink through the openings.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.180
And then they'd be super wet LOL

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.580
That was the plan.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.620
(Dramatic Music)

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.800
I never saw the carnage my creation had done.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.860
I was worried that I'd completely missed the log tent.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.400
I never played any sports as a kid so just making it over the first tent would have been an accomplishment.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.300
But the fact that everyone started screaming and one boy yelled, "Micah I'm gonna kill you!"

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.100
I new it must have been the most perfect shot.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.360
Did I stay around and laugh at their stupid guilty faces?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.860
No.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.640
Me and T.J. ran away as fast as we possibly could without looking back.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.360
We sprinted off into the woods before any 15 year old saw us.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.780
We just kept running and running making sure to get as far away from camp as possible.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.080
And on the way I kinda threw up a little. (Gross)

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.520
T.J., being the good friend that he was, thought I was unfit to run so he decided that we should hide in some bushes.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.840
After about five minutes nobody came.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.840
"Should we head back to camp?"

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.260
"No"

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.000
"Yeah you're right."

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.800
So we kept running. Until we found the lake where scouts could canoein'.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.820
Me and T.J. both thought this was a good place to stop.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.000
So we sat by the lake and talked for a few hours.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.920
Because in a week, T.J. and his family were gonna move away to China for two years.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.040
And I knew I wouldn't see him again for a long time.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.740
So I wanted to spend every moment I had with him.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.500
We were just a couple of bros being real with each other.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.240
Skipping rocks and talking about our feelings.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.320
And then that night, the 15 year old's tent got Axe bombed.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.060
So I guess it wasn't them.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.200
Oh and remember how I threw up after running so much? (Still gross)

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:05.860
Well apparently, there was a sickness going around camp that all the camp instructors got and about 50% of the scouts got it, too.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:12.760
And, lo and behold, one of the 15 year olds wasn't feeling so well when he went to bed that night.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.640
And then the sudden jolt awake and the cold water made him throw up.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.160
Yaaayyy

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160
