Hi there, this is Amy Gode and I'm going to show you a short video on how to use Audio Note.  This is not the Lite version this is the paid version, which is about $5 and will let you you record

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:24.237
longer lectures and also email out anything you've typed, recorded or drawn so that's the paid version.  Alright, let's get started.

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:33.573
For a new page, you're going to hit the "+" let's say you're going to science class, you're going to take notes

00:00:33.573 --> 00:00:45.802
you're going to tap to get your keyboard, you're going to write science and this lecture gonna be about rain so we'll put

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:55.578
that right up there, and then the date...to help us keep our notes organized.

00:00:55.578 --> 00:01:01.476
And then that automatically will become the title so you can find it easier later on, ok?

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:09.847
And then you can hit "return", and hit the record button when your teacher starts lecturing.

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:16.745
(bar at top of screen turned red when recording began) So today's topic is Toxic Rain.

00:01:16.745 --> 00:01:24.142
We're going to talk about Toxic Rain, what it comes from and how we can prevent

00:01:24.142 --> 00:01:33.538
rain from becoming toxic by being responsible citizens and can avoid putting toxic chemicals on our lawns, blah blah blah.

00:01:33.538 --> 00:01:39.386
Let's say the teacher then wants you to do a diagram like she has on the board.

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:49.039
And so it's rain.  If you hit the squiggly then it's free-form. (a toolbar pops up with squiggly option) So here's the rain coming down and here's the grass, and here's a person

00:01:49.039 --> 00:02:03.355
pouring toxic chemicals on the grass, which seeps into the earth and the water table and spreads the poisons, blah blah blah.  Alright,

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:08.104
and see we didn't have to take a lot of note cause we're recording what the teacher's saying during this.

00:02:08.104 --> 00:02:13.375
Let's say the teacher's moving on, so I'm going to get the typewriter back by moving to the "T".

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:17.370
And we're going to go down here a little bit, cause it's further down in the lecture.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.441
And now the teacher's going to talk about recycling.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:27.739
And all the good things about recycling, why you should do it.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:36.867
So now she's going to talk about the reasons for it, these are the reasons we recycle, the top 10 reasons for doing it.

00:02:36.867 --> 00:02:43.104
Um, what happens if we don't recycle... so the negative effects

00:02:43.104 --> 00:02:49.268
negative effects of not recycling, blah blah blah.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:58.186
Negative effects of not recycling.  Let's say the teacher's done with the lecture you can hit the "pause" there, and this will stop

00:02:58.186 --> 00:03:09.519
the recording.  And then hit "Playback", ok, we can either hit "play" and listen to the entire lecture or we can

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.501
hit "play" and jump around to the parts of the lecture that we want to hear specifically.

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:22.371
So that's the key part of this App - that you can navigate the recorded information easier by just

00:03:22.371 --> 00:03:26.531
tapping on the paper where you want to go.

00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:39.175
So hit "play".  Turn up the volume... (audio playing in the background "today's topic is Toxic Rain") Ok, so now she's talking about that (playing in background).

00:03:39.175 --> 00:03:52.272
Let's jump down to the negative effects of recycling (in background is audio "the negative effects of not recycling").  Let's go back up here to recycling, we want to hear that part of the lecture.

00:03:52.272 --> 00:04:04.697
"and all the good things about recycling").  And we can go back to Toxic Rain if we wanted to review that (audio in background "is toxic rain").

00:04:04.697 --> 00:04:22.813
We can even tap on our picture to go back to what she was saying while we were drawing (audio in background "on the grass, which seeps in to the earth"). So it's turning blue as it goes across.  So you can hit "pause".

00:04:22.813 --> 00:04:27.248
Alright, so it's an easy way to navigate through recorded information.

00:04:27.248 --> 00:04:28.048
Lets

00:04:28.048 --> 00:04:41.870
Let's say we wanted to send out our notes to the teacher.  The teacher asked everybody to hand in their drawing

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.038
to indicate their understanding of the lecture.  So she wants this handed in.

00:04:45.038 --> 00:04:52.028
So what we're going to do is we're going to email it.  And to email it, you hit this little envelope over here

00:04:52.028 --> 00:05:02.034
Or you try.  It says "What would you like to email?", AudioNote File, Audio with PDF, PDF Only".  And you know what, she just wants the drawing

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:06.704
so let's just do PDF.  Otherwise we could have

00:05:06.704 --> 00:05:15.799
recorded our thoughts about it, and added those to the email for those to be in an audio file and she would just open it up like a regular email file.

00:05:15.799 --> 00:05:23.099
So here is our drawing, with our notes.  We're going to tap in the "To" box.

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:33.308
Maybe.  There we go.  And up comes our address book.  So our teachers are all listed here, and our teacher is "Amy Gode"

00:05:33.308 --> 00:05:39.808
so we're going to tap on that teacher's name, and we're going to hit "Send" to send it off.

00:05:39.808 --> 00:05:47.032
Ok, one last thing I want to show you is how to make folders, so we can keep our notes organized.

00:05:47.032 --> 00:05:54.837
And then this Notes thing will pop up, and you're going tap down here on "Edit", ok, and

00:05:54.837 --> 00:06:12.368
"New Folder", tap, it'll ask for a name.  We'll type in "Science".  And let's do a "Math" folder too.  "Save".

00:06:12.368 --> 00:06:22.238
You could do subfolders if you wanted to, to further divide up your Science folder.  But let's be done "Done".

00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:29.637
So now we're going to go and move our Notes into those folders.

00:06:29.637 --> 00:06:40.455
So we're going to tap "Edit", "Math" (see how the check is there).  Now we're going to go down here with this arrow saying we're going to go into a folder.

00:06:40.593 --> 00:06:48.545
And we're going to hit "Math".  Let's do that again, "Math" for the other note, hit the little folder

00:06:48.545 --> 00:07:08.430
Click on "Math".  Now we have our 2 Science Notes left.  Let's click "Science", there's the folder, "Science".

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:14.072
Click "Done" when you're done.  Alright, see now they're no longer listed.  So

00:07:14.072 --> 00:07:19.550
let's go into folders, go into our "Math" folder and there they are.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.864
So that's a nice way to keep organized.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.100
Ok, thanks for watching.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.000
