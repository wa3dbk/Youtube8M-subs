Hi my name is Noah.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:20.119
And today we are going to build LEGO city
police car.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:31.310
(I want to help you) How do I open it.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:51.990
Can you help me open it?

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.040
I don't know how to open it.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
Yeah!

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:13.439
I got it 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.700
all opened myself.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.100
Can I help build Noah.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.270
Please.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.439
No.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:42.440
This is only for big kids.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.780
Please Noah.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.950
No.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:02:04.560
Now I finished this and now I'm moving on
to the Police car.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:42.900
We're all done and this was real easy and
it was 21 steps and I like it.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:55.230
That's all I want to say.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:06.260
The bad guy run out of the car.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.020
Oh no.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.540
Bad guy coming through.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.569
Oh no.

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.569
Rrr.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.239
Where is the ... rrr.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.299
See you next time, thanks for watching.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.909
Come back another time.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:24.720
Bye bye
