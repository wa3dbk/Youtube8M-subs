00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.610
Everyone know that, before the hedgehog came
along, the fastest character in video games

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.680
was Bo Jackson.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.240
He was Sonic before Sonic was Sonic.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.490
You want to know the most effective play in
football?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.880
It's called the zig zag, and it involves Bo
Jackson, and zig zags.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.890
He could outrun time, in Tecmo Bowl.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.090
He can't outrun sh*t, in this game.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.090
Oh, wait.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.760
That's because he's not even in this game.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:52.980
So this is Bo Jackson: Two Games In One, for
the original Game Boy.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.010
And it's probably fair to point out that...this
thing came out in 1991.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.800
And the whole idea of a handheld gaming platform
was kind of a new thing.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.890
So...it's not like games were really pushing
the Game Boy.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.730
But then again, you had Metroid II, in 1991.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.570
So...I guess some games were.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.610
The point is, I can understand this game being
limited, and simple.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.610
That's not this game's problem, though.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:39.710
No, this game's problem...is that it's limited,
and simple...and crappy.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.000
So obviously, it's two games in one.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.500
You've got baseball and football, on one Game
Boy cartridge.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.860
That's actually a pretty cool idea, for 1991.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.939
In lieu of a menu, you choose your game by
choosing...pictures.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.960
Scroll left to show the baseball players,
and pick baseball...scroll to the right, for

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960
football.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.159
Took me, like, actual time to even figure
out what was going on here.

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.540
Not a long time, but...I mean, I had to think
about it.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:14.670
Not a good quality, for a menu.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.310
Anyway, you finally get to the sports...and
there's something weird.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.701
It's seriously, like...either these games
were designed by two different teams, or this

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.100
was actually supposed to just be a baseball
game.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.850
And at the last minute, someone was like,
"Actually, we need to throw in a football

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.850
game, too."

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.840
And so they had to squeeze it in, in like,
a week.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.949
Because as much as they both suck, football
is way worse.

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.130
So let's compare and contrast here.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.600
You start baseball, and you actually get some
teams to choose from.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.760
Not real teams, but...real places.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.010
So that's not bad.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.100
But in football, you start the game...and
you go straight to the coin toss.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.470
Then the game tells you, "Oh, you're gonna
be East.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.970
And you're against West."

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.419
Like it's, f*cking...early nineties hip hop
wars.

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:10.600
Anyway, the game starts...and in baseball,
you actually have a nice looking interface.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.940
When you're hitting, you have the classic
view, from the behind the batter's box.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.290
And when you're on the mound, you get the
Bases Loaded view.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.790
Not that it plays well, because it doesn't...but
the game actually looks pretty good.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.470
Especially for a Game Boy game.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.209
But with football...it's suddenly the Atari
2600.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.920
Look at this.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.310
So the aesthetic difference is, just...huge.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.810
Like I said, either football was crunched
for time, or there were actually two teams

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.240
working on this thing.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.170
That's the only possible explanation.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.540
But in terms of gameplay...well, the turd
butter spreads across both of them, evenly.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.729
In baseball, the game gets so choppy when
you're trying to hit, it's impossible to time

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:52.729
your swing.

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:56.250
And when you're in the field...you can't see
your outfielders, on fly balls; you never

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.519
know who you're actually controlling; and
the AI is awful.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.680
You try to turn a double play, and the shortstop's
not even standing on the bag.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.370
Or the first baseman, just...woops.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.200
My bad.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.299
We'll get 'em back next time.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.920
Oh, and f*ck you, Bo Jackson.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.260
But then again, football...like I said, even
worse.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.290
Running plays are completely pointless, so
you're always trying to pass...but, like,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.330
you can't even see your receivers.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.820
So, literally, you have to just guess who
might be open.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.820
And hope for the best.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.340
Then again, that's kind of fun.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.600
It's, like, you throw the ball...is it gonna
be good?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.620
Is it gonna be bad?

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.850
I don't know.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.340
Am I gonna care?

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.340
Probably not.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.720
It's like Peter Pan Football, and I'm playing
against my team's own shadows.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.070
I guess, if there's any positive to be gained
from this...it's that you can link up two

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.830
Game Boys for multiplayer.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.900
Also, there's a baseball player named Kitchen.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.900
That's about it.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.900
The gameplay is lousy, it sounds like crap
and it keeps giving you these creepy Bo Jackson

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.650
mug shots.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.650
So weird.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.690
This thing was sent to us by Doug from Lomita,
California.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.940
Thanks, Doug!

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.410
I'm gonna nightmares from this thing.

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.820
Two nightmares in one.
