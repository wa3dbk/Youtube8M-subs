Hi, I'm Mike Lais, on behalf of Expert Village
we are going to go over some guitar tuning

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.440
techniques. Okay, so for alternative tuning
open C, which is kind if one that's out there,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.720
it's really going to impress your friends
if you know what you're doing in it too though.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.300
But basically what we're going to want to
do is we're going to tune our guitar to where

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:29.270
it goes the sixth string will be a C, the
fifth string will be a G, the fourth string

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.000
will be a C, the third string will remain
a G, the second string we're going to tune

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.030
to a G as well, and then the first string
is going to be an E. And the way we're going

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.000
to get that is we're going to drop our low
string first. So right now it's an E, and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.399
we're going to drop it - here's the D that
we're going to, as we did before, and then

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.531
we're going to go all the way down. We're
going to keep going below that, so that we

00:00:57.531 --> 00:01:02.590
can get ourselves a C. But I'm not actually
going to tune it right now. I'm just going

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.329
to get it down there, just for tension's sake
on the guitar. Just because you really kind

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.790
of want to keep everything distributed evenly
and so if we loosen this up, we're going to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.369
be able to get the G a little bit better when
we drop our A, but finding the G is just going

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.639
to be as if we were to drop the sixth string
from an E to a D is the same concept of dropping

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:30.070
the fifth string A to a G. It's just in a
different position on the guitar. So we're

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:41.539
just going to drop this down. And again, you
can do the seventh fret routine, seventh fret

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:51.399
on the fifth string. That should give you
the fourth string. Pretty close there. So

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:56.700
now we have the seventh fret available on
the low string, the sixth string, to get the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:14.920
C. I'm going to come up. All right. So now
we want to drop the D string or the fourth

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.400
string down to a C, so we're going to take
that, we're going to take our low C and our

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.659
fourth string, and just kind of try and match
that. And again, we can check it by having

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:37.730
the fifth fret of the fifth string and sort
of check it that way. And there we go. I'm

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.370
going to leave this string the same, although
since I did all that stuff it might be a little

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:55.420
bit out of whack. There we go. So now I'm
going to take my B string or my second string.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.620
I'm going to drop that all the way down to
a G, matching this string, so they're going

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:10.749
to have the same tuning.

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:15.819
There we go. Now the first string is going
to remain the same, so now I have my open

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.779
C tuned.
