00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.000
Oh, look!

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.070
There's the... space shuttle flying over the
bridge, under the bridge!

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.460
I know, it looks like it's flying under the
bridge.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.160
It's all a perspective thing.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.990
What you can see is like... Yeah, it's not
really the size of a car.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.930
Cars are nearer than the plane and the
Space Shuttle on its back.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.420
And yeah, um, there are a lot of people on
that pier.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.640
I think, uh, this is seriously damaging the
SOMA tech businesses.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.850
[laughs in background] Productivity
today.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.430
Come on! I want it to come this way!

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.190
Come closer!
So we can see.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.090
Ahh, yes.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.780
So, I guess...
It's got the tail cone so the engines aren't

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.230
causing extra drag.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.060
So, this is Endeavour, this one?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.750
Right, that was the one that uhh...
was rebuilt after Challenger blew up.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.320
And it was the best shuttle that was built
because..

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.560
They built it with the cutting-edge 1980s
technology.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.980
And they had more fuel cells, better
endurance.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.600
Yes! Starting to see this now!
Come closer!

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.080
Oh, dear.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.550
It's a chase plane.
Oh, it's that thing hanging at the back. 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:48.240
Oh, the tail plane has extra control
surfaces. I think.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.340
There we go...

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.540
And it's on its way to L.A. where they're
going to cut down like three hundred

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.470
trees so it can get to the museum.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.510
[Iain] Scott I want you to join with me in a chant of USA
[Scott] USA! USA! 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.750
There we go, flying over a ferry building.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.690
I wonder if they'll make another pass.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.170
[to women] -Cool! You've had enough,
huh? 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.890
[women] -Yeah.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.810
[Scott] Yeah, I'm gonna see if it comes
back one more time.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.260
So what did you think, sir?
[Iain] That was amazing. I-I've never seen

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.080
it before. I think I've seen one at the
Dallas airport.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.850
-You saw one at the Dallas airport? Was
that the Enterprise?

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.610
-Yeah.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.530
-Which the Star Trek fans campaigned to
have it named after the Enterprise?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.390
And they kicked themselves when they
realized it wasn't going into space.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.090
-Yeah. The experimental one?

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.440
[Scott] -Yes. Yeah. Great idea, guys.
