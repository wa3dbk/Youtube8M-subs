00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.580
What's going on internet, it is your boy Eric
Bandholz back again with Beardbrand.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.180
Hope all is going well on the other side of
the internet.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:17.460
Just wanted to have a quick little video again
on how to help you establish your style, get

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.650
started and be more cognisant of your style.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.470
So your style is of course naturally your
clothes, your appearance, but it's also your

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.579
beard, you facial hair, your haircut, and
then your body type as well.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.700
And then, you know, the accessories around
it.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.390
What kind of car you drive, what kind of house
you live in, neighbourhood you're in.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.250
All those are things that kind of make up
your style, who you are, who you display to

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.250
the world.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.260
Now you could look at it with criticism or
you could accept it as how it is, realising

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.820
that people are going to judge you based on
the things that you show the world.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.240
I grew up in high school growing up my mom
just brought all my clothes for me, I didn't

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.229
really have a style I just kind of wore whatever
and that continued through college.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.520
And it wasn't until maybe about 5 years ago
that I started becoming more cognisant of

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.869
my style and what I wanted it to be like and
how I wanted it to work together and pull

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:17.869
together.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.789
How you want to get started, instead of investing
thousands of dollars into certain styles and

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.840
not entirely knowing if that's going to be
the style you appreciate or that you like,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.719
you should try certain items that will give
you a little bit of flexibility to grow your

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.729
wardrobe as you get more confident.

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.709
So what I want to say is make sure you start
with your underwear.

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:50.850
Find a cool pair of underwear that really
defines you of who you are and what you're

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.039
about, and from there branch out into other
undergarments like socks.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:00.439
I think you should be cognisant about what
kind of socks you're wearing.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.749
So these kind of items, they really cheap.

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:10.590
You're talking about 5 to 25 dollars for underwear
and for socks, and you're going to be able

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.730
to really just kind of start small.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.470
And then it's helpful because it can help
you start boosting your confidence because

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:28.080
you're wearing things that no one else is
going to see or if it's a pair of socks then

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.990
they're not going to see it unless they're
really looking for it.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.390
So you can kind of play with something that
you want to do without like just showing the

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.390
world.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.510
So it's kind of like an easy way, it's like
dipping your toe into the water before you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.120
jump in.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:52.270
And then from there what I'd recommend is
maybe you can go from the undergarments to

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.480
your accessories.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.150
So find a cool belt that you like.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.450
Something that you can wear with a lot of
different items or find a cool bracelet or

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.280
a watch or some sunglasses and use these items,
these everyday items, kind of accessories

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.950
to start getting into this style that you
want to go with.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.350
And then from there it's going to be as you
develop your confidence and as you start getting

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.370
compliments about your new accessories, your
new items, it will take time and a gradual

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:29.400
process then you can start to build into more
stable items like of course you pants or your

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.580
tops and your jackets and things like that,
but those are going to be more costly items

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.510
generally speaking.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.820
Like a jacket could run you 200, 750 dollars.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.380
And if you're not entirely sure you're going
to fit into that style, it's good to test

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.220
it on lighter or less expensive items.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.040
But that's about it, just a real quick primer
into style.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.560
From there I would recommend that you find
inspiration blogs and you can find on Pinterest,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.560
Facebook, Tumblr.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.060
We've got a Tumblr blog as well with style
that I find cool, it's pretty much my own

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:13.110
style inspiration, but they're all out there
and I recommend that you invest the time and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.310
find people with similar body types, find
people with the style you want and just start

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.310
emulating them.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.720
Picking off certain items and going from there.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.930
But, that's it just real quick video, hope
all is well on the other end of the internet.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.140
As always, thanks for watching, thanks for
subscribing.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.750
Cheers and beard on.
