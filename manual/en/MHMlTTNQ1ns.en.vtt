00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.905
Hi, this is Brent Pourciau at topvelocity.net,
I’m gonna do a pitching analysis her of

00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:07.165
Casey, going to pair him up with Tim from
when he was a young youth pitcher.

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:16.205
I think this is good footage to use with my
young pitchers so you can see where Tim Lincecum

00:00:16.205 --> 00:00:18.735
was when he was a little kid.

00:00:18.735 --> 00:00:25.245
Let’s take Casey in his leg lift, Tim’s
already in his leg lift when this footage

00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:36.854
starts, both in a good position, doing a good
job of lifting up and then leading forward

00:00:36.854 --> 00:00:42.104
and taking those hips to the target.

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:47.354
As Casey’s going he’s taking that knee
with him, so this is a great first move here,

00:00:47.354 --> 00:00:53.505
you can see Tim’s in a similar position,
as his lift leg comes down both very similar.

00:00:53.505 --> 00:01:00.755
Let’s see what Tim does from here, you can
see he continues to load down as he takes

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:06.544
the ankle to knee as best as he can to his
front hip, takes that force vector into linear

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:07.964
position.

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:11.925
This is tough for young pitchers to get down
and build this much flexion at a young age

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:18.955
because our leg strength doesn’t show up
until we get to High School, College, so to

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:24.805
show some leg strength at a young age is pretty
impressive, it’s impressive that little

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:28.606
Tim is doing this but this is the goal here.

00:01:28.606 --> 00:01:33.894
We wanna make sure that we’re moving down,
building flexion as we’re lining up the

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:39.885
force vector, the ankle knee and staying closed
and this is what Tim’s doing here, not as

00:01:39.885 --> 00:01:42.924
well as he does today but incredibly well
for his age.

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:51.335
We can see here with Casey, this brings up
a great point of what I talk about in my analysis,

00:01:51.335 --> 00:02:03.035
you can see Casey did a great job in getting
to this first move but he doesn’t take advantage

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:10.955
of it and he allows his front leg to open
up, all his weight to go forward and for him

00:02:10.955 --> 00:02:17.015
to land with a stiff drive leg, he never used
the drive leg to build power.

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:28.645
The reason we lead with the hip, we start
our movement early, we take that drive leg

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:39.045
knee with the front hip is because we want
to put ourselves in a position to start building

00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:46.595
speed, preventing the lift leg from opening
early so that we can get into this position

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:48.795
that Tim is in.

00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:54.066
If this lift leg had flung open earlier and
you didn’t lead with the hip and you didn’t

00:02:54.066 --> 00:02:58.955
take that force vector with it, you would
never even be able to have the potential to

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:06.545
get where Tim is so the reason for this is
to get to this – flexion of the drive leg

00:03:06.545 --> 00:03:12.675
knee, force vector, as linear as you can,
you need this knee pointing to that target,

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:16.575
as linear as you can.

00:03:16.575 --> 00:03:20.285
Let me draw lines so you can see.

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:26.665
You want this force vector right there, so
that would be your ankle, and knee, and then

00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:29.735
your front hip out here, that’s where we
wanna get.

00:03:29.735 --> 00:03:35.605
Tim is almost there, his force vector is just
a little vertical because that’s his front

00:03:35.605 --> 00:03:37.405
hip there.

00:03:37.405 --> 00:03:45.785
So we wanna get all the way down her and out
here, that’s why we start with this move,

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:50.025
a lot of pitching coaches talk about his move.

00:03:50.025 --> 00:03:56.605
The problem with this move is, if you don’t
know how to get into the load position and

00:03:56.605 --> 00:04:02.435
you don’t know how to build power out of
it which is the next component, then this

00:04:02.435 --> 00:04:06.295
position serves no purpose.

00:04:06.295 --> 00:04:15.435
This is like putting the cart before the horse,
you’re not focusing on the foundation which

00:04:15.435 --> 00:04:24.725
is this component into the power component
which is 3X pitching, that’s the approach.

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:33.455
Our philosophy in the 3X program is where
Casey could move into the beginners guide,

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:38.645
he could use it using a basketball instead
of a 2 pound medicine ball.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:45.625
He could then start to develop and master
the power component into the torque component

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:49.025
or how we convert that power.

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:58.355
We can see at this point that letting the
lift leg and the head with it really puts

00:04:58.355 --> 00:05:06.415
us in the position where Casey could have
just started like this and just swung his

00:05:06.415 --> 00:05:10.405
arm back and through the ball and probably
threw harder.

00:05:10.405 --> 00:05:21.105
At his age, the best advice for Casey would
be to not spend a lot of time on the delivery

00:05:21.105 --> 00:05:27.405
until he can learn how to do what Tim’s
about to do here, even though Tim’s extended

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:31.865
out with is front leg it’s still closed
off so you can see it starts to open up and

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:36.565
that’s that foot synch I talk about in my
articles, as he drives the back leg through,

00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:42.805
you can see it completely driven through as
he lands and the shoulder completely closed.

00:05:42.805 --> 00:05:49.345
This is the component Casey needs to start
to train from here to here with hat hip to

00:05:49.345 --> 00:05:56.704
shoulder separation, we work on that the whole
time through the 3X pitching velocity program

00:05:56.704 --> 00:05:59.335
and the ace pitcher handbook.

00:05:59.335 --> 00:06:04.895
We also work on this, from here, to external
rotation, to here, look at that external rotation,

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:08.445
it is at this age, is just unbelievable.

00:06:08.445 --> 00:06:16.535
Seeing this I would have said if this young
boy could keep his mechanics as he gets bigger,

00:06:16.535 --> 00:06:24.795
quicker, stronger, faster we are definitely
going to see a D1 or Minor League or Major

00:06:24.795 --> 00:06:32.025
League or one of the greatest pitchers ever
which is pretty impressive.

00:06:32.025 --> 00:06:41.435
Casey here does this right, but from there
on out pretty much just kind of falling or

00:06:41.435 --> 00:06:45.085
whipping the arm or letting the arm go.

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:53.655
He needs now baby steps, work on the load
to triple extension before front foot strike

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:59.014
into hip shoulder separation then external
rotation and the release, and that’s where

00:06:59.014 --> 00:07:03.115
we spend most of our time with the 3Xpithcing
velocity program.

00:07:03.115 --> 00:07:07.484
Casey’s got a great start here, most young
guys don’t work on these kind of mechanics

00:07:07.484 --> 00:07:17.075
at his age so allow him to take this time
to learn about it, move through these drills

00:07:17.075 --> 00:07:21.426
and start to learn what it’s like to move
through these components and in a couple of

00:07:21.426 --> 00:07:26.075
years you’re gonna have a kid who has some
really good mechanics.

00:07:26.075 --> 00:07:31.205
Until then, keep asking questions and keep
us up to date on your progress.
