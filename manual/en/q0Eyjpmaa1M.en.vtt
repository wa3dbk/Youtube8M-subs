00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Let's create a stereo video from
the animation that we have

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The animation is an orbit around the brain

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:37.000
To export a stereo video,
go to File &gt;&gt; Save Animation

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Change the frame rate to 30 and
the resolution to 1920 by 1080

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Change the Stereo mode to Left Eye Only

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We will export the left eye view first
and then export the right eye view

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now change your directory and name your file

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
After it finishes rendering,
we will export the right eye view

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now to export the right eye view,
go back to File &gt;&gt; Save Animation

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Make sure the settings are exactly the same

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Change the stereo mode to Right Eye View

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Name your file and click OK

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:30.000
After it finishes rendering, you have the left
and right eye views of a stereo video
