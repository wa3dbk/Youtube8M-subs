00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:05.311
Sup, YouTube! I've been putting off doing
an unboxing for ages now so I thought I'd

00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:11.530
get round to it now. I've got a new lens,
and it's a Canon 85 millimetre 1.8, USM for

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.220
those who care, which makes it very good for
video but I'm not doing video, I'm a stills

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.509
guy, basically. And I also got a little polariser.
And I got it all from Jessops. Now, the box

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.590
isn't normally this bashed, and I can't fault
the company for doing it, because basically

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.149
this is just an ex-display, so, you know,
the vast majority of their boxes will be in

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.710
pristine condition, but this has been unboxed
before. But like I say this an ex-display

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.379
model, so what can you do? So, just get that
away, start unboxing it the now, if I ever

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:58.179
can! There we go. And now we've got polystyrene,
yaay! And a little book. This will probably

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:04.290
be the instructions, in many, many languages,
telling you how to use a lens. I'm pretty

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.191
sure if you're getting this lens you know
how to use a lens. Or maybe you don't. So

00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:17.200
if you're one of those people, you're gonna
learn. And round here, we've got some more...

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.380
paperwork, basically. I guess this is more
instructions and guarantees and what not.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.020
"Canon Imaging Products", in a lovely font.
Yeah... this is just basically more warnings

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.730
and T&amp;Cs in lots and lots of conditions...
wait, in lots and lots of conditions? In lots

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.570
and lots of languages, such as "Kaere kunde,
Tak fordi du kobte dette Canon-produkt..."

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.910
Don't know what that language is, somebody
can help me with that one. And then, finally,

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:55.180
in the box, is a lump of metal with some glass
in it. Stuck, wedged in a piece of polystyrene.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.640
There we are. It's quite heavy, I thought
it'd be a bit lighter than this, especially

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.430
for a prime, but I guess that's the... wait,
it doesn't have IS, it doesn't have IS at

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.150
all so it's just quite a heavy lens, for its
size anyway. But it is metal-built and...

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:17.310
wow, I like that. This is my second lens if
you exclude the... my kit lens, that I got

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.099
with the camera, so, you know, getting a new
lens is still a new experience for me and

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.530
this is very exciting. But this is quite a...
it feels well made, I mean it... I'm not sure

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.020
if it's metal built, I think it is. But yeah,
we've got the little Canon Annoying Cap...

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.470
I don't know it's just annoying, they should
probably stick to what Nikon and in this case

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.719
Samyang are doing, and pretty much every other
lens brand with the little pinchy ones, and

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.079
I guess they are, they've caught up now, I
guess, but they should have caught on quite

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.439
a while ago. So there's the lens, we've got
its nice... 1.8-ness... it looks more like

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:01.849
1.4 when you look at it this way, but I guess
that's just because it's telephoto. So yeah,

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.019
there's the Canon 85 millimetre 1.8.
