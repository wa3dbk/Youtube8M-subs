Bob: Well here is John Peters,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.390
who is the Executive Director of
the Commission on Native American Affairs

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.449
for the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. Great to see you.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.300
John: Well thank you, thank you. It's a great day to be down here celebrating

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.679
the Fishweir and all the other festivities that go on here

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.250
in June. You know, I like to
think about this

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.329
Fishweir here. 4500 years ago they

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.690
found some sticks down here when they
were doing the

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.300
trolley station over there underground. 45 feet down they found

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.019
these sticks in the ground

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.300
and finally figured out that it was a fishweir.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.289
Bob: So, can you tell us what a fishweir is? John: It is a way of fishing, you know,

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.989
how we caught fish in those
days.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.210
You know, the tide came in, and fish are on cycles and when they

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.430
come in in schools

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.530
we drive them towards the fishweir and push them over the top

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.540
so that we are able to

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.560
clean them later and dry them so that

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.600
they'll last us for a few months at
a time. You know, we're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.780
hunters and gatherers, so when the fish
come you have to be there

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.040
to get them and harvest them and prepare
them

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.040
for the months to come.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.939
Bob: What's life like for Native Americans in Massachusetts now? What can you tell us?

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.770
John: Well, we're like everybody else I would say, except that we're still struggling

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.490
and fighting for our rights here in
Massachusetts,

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.600
and trying to help our future generations
to hang on to the culture that has been here.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.170
Our blood comes from this land,

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.969
we can trace our lineage to before there was an America here,

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.049
right down there where I live in Mashpee.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.539
So, we want to carry on that tradition, it's only been

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.990
400 years, less than. So, things

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.590
have changed in such a rapid pace, you
know,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.810
even in my lifetime things have changed
so dramatically, but

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.780
this is America and that's what it's about.
Bob: Well thank you, thank you for sharing, and

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.430
thank you for preserving this important
part of American history.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.440
John: And this is very important, that everybody has a chance to see that, and you know,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.600
you look at the blue lines out
there and that's where the waterfront

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.180
used to be.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.700
And we didn't have all these
buildings and so forth, they would've been under water.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:39.000
(Native American music)

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.440
Ross Miller: You know if we were walking along here 4500 years ago, there would be a structure

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.250
like this that

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.300
we could see in the tidal area. But it wouldn't
be grass like this, we would actually be

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.680
looking out over here

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.850
at the ocean. But this is a fishweir, a

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.970
rebuilding of a fishweir, that's based on

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.560
some structures they started to discover in
1911

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.560
over here at Boylston St. when they
were digging for the subway.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.880
And they were down 27 to 40 feet
below the surface, they started finding

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.760
wooden stakes,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.900
not little ones like this, but more big
ones, maybe an inch and a half, two inches in diameter.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.330
And they first started finding a few of them,
and then they founds tens of them,

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.260
and then they started finding thousands of
these wooden sticks. And they're thinking,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.100
you know, maybe these were part of a
fence

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.750
for Native Americans or something.
And then with the subsequent

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.700
archaeological work, they start to
understand these were part of

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.200
a seasonal fishing structure. They were
built

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.860
at the time of year within the Wampanoag
culture, the fish return to spawn, when,

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:36.480
they say, the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.360
fish return to spawn when the oak leaf is
about as big as a mouse's ear.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.180
So, if you look around and you see the
oak leaf just beginning,

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.940
at that time that's the same part of
the season when the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.799
fish would return to spawn. Bob: Now, what kind of fish are we talking about?

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.140
Ross: Small things similar to a herring or
a mummichog

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.000
or and what we would think of as a bait fish now. And they would

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.220
come in on the high tide and they would school around in this area on the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.330
up-shore side of the fishweir,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.200
and then as the ocean would go out the
water would filter out through the structure,

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.650
and a certain number fish were left. It
wasn't that efficient; it might catch

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.600
10% of the fish that were schooling around. But for a subsistence culture, if you caught

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.610
five or ten percent of what was there,
that was enough for a daily catch.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.890
And the thought was that these were
built by

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.840
family groups, so maybe 35-50 people in a
family clan.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.240
It'd be the kids, the grandparents,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.790
the parents, everybody would be sort of involved
in making this,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.370
and they would have it for during the
spawning season, so most of May

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.710
into June, and they would leave it, and
the next year they would come back

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.789
and maintain it. And from what we know,

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.370
over here in Back Bay there are fishweir sticks from 3700-5200

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.610
years ago. So the people who were
here were maintaining and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.700
building the things for fifteen hundred
years.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.680
Have we maintained
anything in our Western culture for fifteen

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.710
hundred years, really?

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.390
So that's why I'm so excited about these fishweirs.
