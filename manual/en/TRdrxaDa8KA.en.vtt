Hey, is your hair always loose when washed
and in a ponytail when greasy?

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.430
I have 3 creative ways what to do with them!

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.010
So we washed our hair and
it's everywhere.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.300
What I do is I take a rubber band, 
which I have around my wrist,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.510
and I make a high ponytail, then I make 
a half ponytail again.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.000
With time it loosens up and 
it looks good.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.120
I do this if I'm working or studying.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.960
OK, so day two is here
and the hair is a bit greasy.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now lets make them curly.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.060
Take two rubber bands and make
a veeeery high and tight ponytail.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.700
Now curl everything that is left.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900
If you have heavier hair, like me,
I advise you to use curling mouse,

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.610
and apply hair spray to every curl.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.150
For intense curls use a thinner
curling iron than i have.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
This takes 10 minutes, max.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.070
But there's more, you can combine this with
this tutorial from Jure (AdviseMyStyle) for smokey eyes,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.770
and you're ready for a party
in less than 20 min.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.250
(curling intensifies)

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.660
At the end wait a bit so the curls cool off.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.800
Now just disband the ponytail.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.910
Now you get awesome curls.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.180
Damn, that spray from yesterday 
messed up my hair.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.530
Don't worry!

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.450
You take 2 rubber bands and
make a high ponytail.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.410
Now split it into two parts 
and make a fishtail braid.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.860
Once you learn it it's 
very easy.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.460
Take one strand of hair from the outer part of 1st side
and put it on the inside of the 2nd side.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.920
Now take a strand from the outer part of the 2nd side
and put it on the inside of the 1st side.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.000
When you add a strand 
you can twist both sides a bit.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.500
You could actually make a simple braid,
but this is a nice spice-up of everyday hairstyles.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.350
Now make the braid a bit uneven
 and twist it around and finally fix it with booby pins.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.080
Because the hair is already in a braid you can fix 
it with 2 or 3 pins and it will hold the whole day.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.820
3 pins hold through a pratice of
Jumpin Fitness - TESTED!

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.220
I apologize to you for going out of
the frame everytime.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.530
For next time I will know to
place the camera higher.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.140
So 3 simple hairstyles for everyday.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.030
If you are going to use any of them tag me on 
FB, Twitter or Instagram so i can see them.
