00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.440
OK.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.470
Every once in awhile you get a washer dryer
that is leaving marks on the clothes.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.390
I wanted to show you what is going on there
also how you can clear it up.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.939
What is going on there is if the dryer is
too full the clothes will rub against this

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.939
gasket here.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.870
What you can do is take a clean rag.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.940
What I find works really good is these clean
up wipes.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.771
These type of wipes and put that in there
and rub it along the gasket and you will see

00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:47.771
it.

00:00:47.771 --> 00:00:51.390
See it coming off on the rag there.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.289
Anyway that is what is getting into the clothes.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.730
It just takes really getting in there and
cleaning it up real good because it's just

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.969
some nasty stuff over time.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.820
There's really no way to completely prevent
that.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.890
You can actually replace that gasket but again
the easiest way is just to clean it all up.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.229
Just take some time with it and keep going
along and rubbing it.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.610
A couple different wipes, a couple different
rags.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.800
Show you with a towel here.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.240
If your clothes are going along the back and
they just happen to brush against that it

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.270
is pretty easy to start getting some marks
especially on like a whit T shirt.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.200
Part of it is gonna be minimized by doing
smaller loads of clothes in the dryer.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.680
There is no way to keep it out completely
but that will minimize it and that way the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.869
clothes aren't pressing right up against.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.350
Because if you got a super full load and they're
pressing right up against there all it takes

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.930
is a small touch.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.400
Cleaning this out once in awhile will minimize
it.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.370
So that is what I am doing here.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.790
That is how to get it done.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.819
Good to go.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.150
Yeah so once you are all done cleaning it
up with the chemical make sure you use a dry

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.950
rag and go around and clean it really good
with that dry rag to rub, wipe off the rest

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.450
of it.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.730
Anyway doing this every month or maybe every
other month will just minimize that.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.900
There may not be a way of making it completely,
completely perfect but just doing the smaller

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.709
loads and cleaning this once in awhile will
minimize it.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:03:11.380
That'll keep everything cleaning how it's
supposed to.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:27.830
Listen.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:04:00.719
