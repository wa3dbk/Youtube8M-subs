Hi, I'm Dorian Winterfeld, on behalf of Expert
Village. I've been doing web programming for

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:14.209
about ten years, and today we are going to
cover the basics of HTML. Now I'm going to

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.430
show you how to change the color of your text.
To make it simple, I'm going to get rid of

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:30.570
these tags, and I'm going to go back to our
basic, just plain text just to show you. There:

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.300
Hello Expert Village. Let's say we wanted
to change the color of our text. Well, we're

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.210
going to do it with what's called the font
tag. We're going to open the font tag, and

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.280
we're going to close the font tag. Notice
I'm opening it and closing it just like all

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.350
the other tags. Hopefully, you should be getting
used to this. Now, we have to add an attribute

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:15.520
of color. Color equals, let's say, red. So,
we have our tag, we have the attribute is

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.380
color. Color equals red, close tag. We're
going to save the document, we're going to

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:28.130
reload, and what do you know? Now it's red.
Say you want to make it red, but you also

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:35.870
want to make it bigger. Before, we used the
tag called 'big'. Now I'm going to add an

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:45.630
attribute to 'font' called 'size' equals.
Now, in this case, I'm going to make the size

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.560
equal plus one. Let's reload it; now it's
red and its one notch bigger. Let's say I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.440
made it plus ten. Now it should be ten times
as big as it was originally. There you go.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.200
So you can see, that with the font tag, you
can control the color, the size, and there

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.730
are many other attributes to the font tag
where you can control all the aspects of your

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:24.459
text. Just to show you, you know we can make
this green, save it, reload, and now it's

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.980
green. So there you have it.
