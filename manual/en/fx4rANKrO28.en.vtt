00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:08.410
I used to think it was simple. You were an
F-Zero guy, or a Wipeout guy. And there was

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.330
no wrong answer, really. It was more about
preference, than one being better than the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.019
other.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.910
Actually, one was better. It was F-Zero.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.910
But to be fair...I am an F-Zero guy. No disrespect
to the Wipeout guys. Or gals. Guys is just

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.180
a generic plural term for a mixed group of
people, don't make this weird. Besides, at

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.719
least you're included. I didn't even think
of the Extreme-G guys.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.170
Are there Extreme-G guys?

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.980
It's XGRA: Extreme-G Racing Association.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.980
So, uh...for all us F-Zero and Wipeout guys...the
Extreme-G series started back on the Nintendo

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.350
64. It was followed by two sequels, Extreme-G
2 and 3...and then this one, XGRA. Then Acclaim

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.220
went bankrupt, which kind of took Extreme-G
out of the race. But these were never bad

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.580
games. In fact, for N64 owners who liked F-Zero
X, Extreme-G was a nice supplemental title.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.920
It was a great "me too," if you wanted more
F-Zero.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.090
But make no mistake, it was a clone.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.770
What it was a clone of depends on your allegiances.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.250
So no matter what kind of guy you are, you
know what you're getting from XGRA. The same

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.590
brutally fast, twitch-based racing experience
you know from F-Zero and Wipeout. It's the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.270
same gameplay, the same futuristic aesthetic...but
the game also sets itself apart in two ways.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.870
First, its weapon system, and second, the
most slide-y controls that ever slid.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.570
This game makes F-Zero feel like racing on
glue.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.570
I mean, as an F-Zero guy, my nearest point
of comparison is obviously F-Zero GX for the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.940
GameCube. A game that's notoriously touchy,
and takes a long time to master. This game

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.180
is a hundred times more touchy and sensitive.
You so much as nudge the stick, and you slam

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.500
into walls. You almost have to breathe on
the controller to play it, it's that sensitive.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.930
And I guess some people might like that. I
mean, XGRA is a game I could see some people

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.480
spending months and months learning, and mastering.
But for most people, that means it's a game

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.210
that's too f*cking sensitive, holy sh*t, why
is it so f*cking sensitive?

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:42.210
It's like driving a Norah Jones song.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.420
Fortunately, after a few hours of constant
swearing, and listening to Norah Jones...I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.310
did get the hang of XGRA. Or at least, enough
to win a few races. I felt like I cured a

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.740
disease after that. Talk about rewarding!
But that's where it's like F-Zero. You win

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.300
in F-Zero, it's not because you got a blue
shell at the right moment. It's because you're

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.730
a boss. And it's the same with this crazy,
ridiculous, almost physically stressful video

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.030
game.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.410
You win at this, and you deserve to win.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.380
You might also deserve a psychiatrist. Nothing
is worth all this.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:33.380
XGRA has all the modes you would expect. You
can do individual races, in the arcade mode.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.550
There's also a career mode, where you earn
points that upgrade your bikes. You get the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.069
same futuristic premise, and soundtrack...and
for me, that's always been the issue with

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.160
Extreme-G. This game's just doing the same
thing as two other games, only not as well.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.709
It's a less awesome F-Zero, or Wipeout, whichever
you prefer.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.520
And that's most apparent in its performance.
The game doesn't run near as fast as F-Zero

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.880
GX, and it doesn't look as good, either. I
mean, it's not very colorful. And the colors

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.330
it does have are so muted, everything kind
of smears into this grayish brown blur.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.770
But you know, I hope I don't sound too harsh
on this thing, either. Because I always have

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.720
fun with Extreme-G. And as always, the most
fun I had, with XGRA...is with the weapons.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.780
I love this game's approach to weapons. And
not only are they fun to use, but there's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.710
also a little strategy to them. So you collect
these orbs, right? And each one gives you

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.460
a new weapon.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.070
The more you collect, the more powerful the
weapon.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.370
So not only are you trying to race...you're
also managing your weapons. Trying to figure

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.639
out which weapon to use, when to use it...and
if it might be more prudent to use a lesser

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.930
weapon you already have, just to be safe.
That's the best thing about XGRA.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.419
That part of the game is awesome.

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:48.419
Look, I hate to keep comparing a game to other
games, but...it is what it is. When you have

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.500
something as distinct as F-Zero and Wipeout,
and a game comes along does the same thing,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.870
you can't help but compare them. And in some
ways, that benefits this game. The weapons

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.500
system is different, especially compared to
F-Zero. And there's even a little humor here,

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.130
whereas Wipeout especially plays it a bit
more straight.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.590
But the truth is, Extreme-G was always an
alternative.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.180
Fortunately, it's a good alternative...in
XGRA for the PlayStation 2.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.380
Huge thanks to our friend Max from Ontario,
Canada, for sending this in.
