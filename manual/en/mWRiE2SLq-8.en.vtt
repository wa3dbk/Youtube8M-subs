00:00:01.358 --> 00:00:03.784
FOR DINNER IN MADRID,
IT'S A MOVABLE FEAST.

00:00:03.784 --> 00:00:05.631
DO THE TAPA TANGO.

00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:07.166
IT'S A TIME-HONORED TRADITION

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:08.965
GOING FROM ONE BAR TO THE NEXT,

00:00:08.965 --> 00:00:12.170
MUNCHING, DRINKING
AND SOCIALIZING.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.370
WHEN IT COMES TO VARIETY,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.637
MADRID IS SPAIN'S
TAPAS CAPITAL.

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:20.637
GRAB A TOOTHPICK AND STAB
SOMETHING STRANGE.

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:25.036
WHILE SPANIARDS DON'T EAT
DINNER UNTIL 9:00 OR 10:00,

00:00:25.036 --> 00:00:25.936
WITH A MEAL LIKE THIS,

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:29.637
I CAN EAT EARLY
AND STILL GO LOCAL.

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:31.337
FOR STARTERS,

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:33.637
WE'RE GOING FOR ONE OF
MADRID'S QUIRKIEST SNACKS,

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:37.403
AND THIS SPOT IS NAMED
FOR IT, LA OREJA DE RO,

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.203
SAUTÉED PIGS EARS.

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:40.570
PIGS EARS ARE A FAVORITE HERE,

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.637
AND JAMIE IS A FRANTIC
ONE-MAN SHOW

00:00:42.637 --> 00:00:45.003
WHO SOMEHOW GETS
EVERYTHING JUST RIGHT.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:53.170
[ speaking Spanish ]

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.103
SEE, THIS WINE IS
LIKE HOUSE-MADE WINE

00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:58.637
FROM THE NORTHWEST
OF SPAIN, FROM GALICIA.

00:00:58.637 --> 00:01:00.570
OKAY, AND IT'S CLOUDY
A LITTLE BIT.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.070
YEAH, IT'S
A LITTLE BIT CLOUDY

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.237
SO YOU DO NOT SEE
THE POOR QUALITY.

00:01:04.237 --> 00:01:07.237
[ laughs ]

00:01:07.237 --> 00:01:08.337
YAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:09.503
GRACIAS.

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:10.437
SO THIS IS?

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.637
YEAH, SO THIS
IS PIGS EAR.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.503
THIS IS THE CARTILAGE,
ACTUALLY.

00:01:13.503 --> 00:01:16.470
THIS IS SAUTEED WITH A
LITTLE BIT OF OLIVE OIL,

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.570
SPANISH PAPRIKA
AND PARSLEY.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.570
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY
THE CARTILAGE?

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.870
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.003
MMM.

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.070
CRUNCHY.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.637
YEAH.

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:27.203
WOW.

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:27.637
PIGS EARS.

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:29.637
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE EATING
ACTUAL PIGS EARS.

00:01:29.637 --> 00:01:30.103
YEAH.

00:01:30.103 --> 00:01:33.637
JUST UP THE STREET,
CASA TONI IS RUN BY...

00:01:33.637 --> 00:01:34.237
TONI.

00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:36.637
HE'S POPULAR FOR HIS
REFRESHING GAZPACHO,

00:01:36.637 --> 00:01:39.003
THE COLD TOMATO
AND GARLIC SOUP.

00:01:39.003 --> 00:01:43.637
CARLOS, THE GAZPACHO IS REALLY
REFRESHING IN THE SUMMER, RIGHT?

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:44.036
YEAH.

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:47.637
GAZPACHO IS LIKE A VEGETABLE
SOUP WITH A TOMATO BASE.

00:01:47.637 --> 00:01:48.403
BUT COLD.

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:49.403
AND IT'S
VERY REFRESHING.

00:01:49.403 --> 00:01:50.103
YEAH,
IT'S COLD.

00:01:50.103 --> 00:01:50.936
IT'S NICE,
YEAH.

00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:54.637
AT TONI'S, YOU CAN HAVE
HUEVOS CON CHORIZO,

00:01:54.637 --> 00:01:56.403
PATATAS BRAVAS,

00:01:56.403 --> 00:01:57.637
MYSTERY MEATS

00:01:57.637 --> 00:02:00.003
AND THE HOUSE VERMOUTH.

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:03.437
DON'T WORRY ABOUT PAYING
UNTIL YOU'RE READY TO GO.

00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:06.637
THEN ASK FOR "LA CUENTA,"
THE BILL.

00:02:08.637 --> 00:02:12.637
NEXT, IT'S LA CASA DEL ABUELO,
PACKED WITH SEAFOOD LOVERS

00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:16.503
SAVORING SIZZLING PLATES
OF TASTY SHRIMP AND PRAWNS.

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:20.637
I LIKE "GAMBAS AL AJILLO"
SHRIMP SAUTÉED WITH GARLIC,

00:02:20.637 --> 00:02:24.604
AND "GAMBAS A LA PLANCHA"
GRILLED SHRIMP.

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:28.036
A GLASS OF THE HOUSE RED
WINE, RIGHT OUT OF THE KEG,

00:02:28.036 --> 00:02:29.637
IS INCREDIBLY CHEAP.

00:02:29.637 --> 00:02:31.270
THE LITTER ON THE FLOOR
IS NORMAL.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.903
THAT'S WHERE PEOPLE
TRADITIONALLY

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:35.604
TOSS THEIR TRASH
AND SHELLS.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.337
FOR A SWEET,
LATE-NIGHT FINALE,

00:02:41.337 --> 00:02:45.036
ENJOY PUDDING-LIKE HOT
CHOCOLATE AND CHURROS.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:47.936
CHURROS ARE THE FAVORITE
LOCAL DOUGHNUT.

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:48.903
DUNK AND CHAT,

00:02:48.903 --> 00:02:50.070
RECALLING HIGHLIGHTS
OF THE DAY

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.036
AND LOOKING FORWARD
TO TOMORROW.
