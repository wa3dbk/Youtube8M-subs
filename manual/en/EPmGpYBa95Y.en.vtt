00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:09.400
Okay, so we have Act 1, Act 2, Act 3. This
is your basic story formula. So what happens

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:18.949
in Act 1 that makes it different from 2 and
3? Here's how it works. You have a formula,

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:31.119
let's say it is a boy meets a girl. And in
Act 1 that's what we're going to describe.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.329
The meeting, what happens to them, who they
are and that information. In Act 2 you're

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:48.649
going to have boy loses girl. And here in
Act 2 you are going to describe all the problems

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.629
that they are having in their relationship
and he loses her. He's found her and he's

00:00:52.629 --> 00:01:10.580
lost her. In Act 3 boy gets girl back. That
is the basis of your story. Boy meets girl,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.030
boy loses girl, boy gets girl back. Okay,
I can hear you, what you're saying. You're

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.980
saying to yourself well my story's not a love
story. I don't have any boy meeting girl.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:29.640
It doesn't matter and you'll see how the same
format it used for any situation. Let's say

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:41.830
you're going to write a Western instead. Okay,
so you might say - the farmer buys a farm.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.870
And, following our formula as we did before.
The farmer, what happens here, he's going

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:54.810
to lose the farm, right? And what's going
to happen in Act 3? I can hear you saying

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:05.421
it before I do. The farmer gets the farm back.
So you see, it doesn't matter what your story

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:10.649
is. The idea is the same. The format, this
is how it follows.
