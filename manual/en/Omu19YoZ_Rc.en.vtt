00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.451
So, now we're going to move onto our clown
fish. And, for our clown fish we're going

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:12.599
to start off with a nice white creamy color
here, and a very small brush. Don't like using

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.000
the bigger brushes at this point. So, what
we're going to do is we're going to start

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.800
by filling in the white areas first, making
sure you have a nice thick layer on here.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.870
Starts getting thin, grab yourself some more
paint. Now, I'm going to cheat just a little

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.129
bit cause I want to be able to demonstrate
a couple of things to you. But, the important

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.800
thing is, is that white goes on first, orange
goes on second, black goes on last, it's the

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.780
last color. What's more is that you should
also make sure that you give plenty of drying

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.280
time in between each color, cause it's going
to be joining right up against each other.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.960
So that means you need to have at least a
couple of days here, for your white to dry,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.390
and then your orange dries, and then your
blacks' going to dry. But, first you do white,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.460
I just wanted to demonstrate this. Now, I'm
going to do a quick demonstration of orange,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.740
not exactly adjoining cause again I do not
want to do exactly a join. And, you're going

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.170
to notice right away that the orange pigment
probably will be easier to work with than

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.000
the white, it's stronger, tends to be thicker,
it'll cover up your blue better. But, all

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.450
of the colors on your clown fish may be requiring
two coats, not just one, which I know that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
means that things even take longer to dry,
but hey if you're going to be going through

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.771
all of this effort to put on a nice mural
in your child's bathroom, you want to make

00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:46.640
sure it looks good, don't you? So, now as
you're getting closer to these black lines,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.160
try and have your brush follow the groove
of the line. You want to be able to cover

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.480
up these areas, because now see what I've
done is largely filled in the orange area,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.820
largely filled in the cream area, and this
little space here, this is going to be where

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.600
your black color goes, but only after these
two colors have dried.
