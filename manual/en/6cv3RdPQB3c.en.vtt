00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.879
c agree if i suggest that the recent
wayne of religiosity among the

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.549
population is connected to the
acceptance of marriage equality

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.769
uh... they're listed the pat robertson's
of brian fishes are like hearing about

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.029
the gauge and uh... and how they will
turn out kids get

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.570
adult

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.589
thinks that

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.740
um...

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.170
well i mean okay yes

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.609
hi i had that that's that's possible

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.120
as possible i mean i think we are a
obviously a less

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:33.920
um...

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.580
in some respects with latest culture but
i i a

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.280
by also think that it's just the simply
was a question of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.980
uh... mets a patient movements that took
place in the seventies and then i think

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.640
ultimately

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.540
it was of

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.700
headcount

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.830
don't know

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.270
when this

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090
worm turned

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.150
really i mean i i i really do believe in
many respects

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.890
it has to do with

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.740
uh...

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.060
with t_v_

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.290
i'd just think that

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.350
the younger generation

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.260
just grew up in an age

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.319
where

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.400
you know

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.200
seeing a gay person

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.990
on uh... you know on t_v_ which is the
ultimate validator in our society

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.409
socially with basically that was that it
is that what's big deal

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.210
i mean i could only i mean

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.969
aguilar obviously i'm just sort of you
know i i i can't

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.320
economia maginnis speculate but

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.340
he view our a

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.480
uh...

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.619
agape teenager

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.380
living in uh... the the suburbs

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.650
uh... in

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.370
it states that are

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.100
close to major

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.920
metropolitan city and particularly
million new yorkers san francisco maybe

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.600
l_a_ your

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.350
um...

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.380
and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.920
the difference in your

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.519
or ability to accept who you are

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.150
and therefore

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.669
uh...

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:15.889
the

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.180
uh... you have the confidence to have
other people except you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.969
well for who you are

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.060
and awareness as to who you are

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.320
the difference between you're growing up
in a in a world where you perceive there

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.839
to be no other gay people

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:35.629
verses a world where all you do turn on
channel and chat turn on a_b_c_ or

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.009
whatever was in c like

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:42.249
there's a good person completely

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:44.579
as a person

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:51.579
that the difference in what it must mean
for your psyche i can only a magic

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.199
the difference between those feelings of
complete isolation

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.109
um...

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.169
and

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.769
and then it's just sort of cascades from
there

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.180
you if you literally you have
generations of people who grow up in can

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.969
out themselves

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:07.029
um...

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:09.579
express who they are

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.650
even if it's just so their family

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.779
when this was a process that they could
not due until they were in their early

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:16.729
twenties and have moved

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:21.239
to uh... big city where there was a
community of of

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.369
of uh... of gay people and maybe it in

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:27.239
how big it impossible

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.769
to really sort of

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.169
fully grasp that and i think

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.019
it must have happened

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.319
you know sometime

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.249
i think in the uh... eighties early
nineties

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.399
uh... because the look at the polling in
terms of where kids are in just a rift

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:49.279
at one point he hit critical mass i
think that critical mass is basically

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:51.930
just that com

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.419
you know things like alan i mean

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.819
do you remember i mean i i don't know if
you guys and i i remember the the scam

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.679
when alan kiss the woman i can you know
what was on owner show

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.999
uh... there may have been shows that
proceeded out like it

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.749
i can't remember but that was uh...
certainly the most high profile

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.749
uh...

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:15.529
and

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.110
unit would the changed is like in the
past politically in the past

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.190
ten years has been stuck masonic and i
think in gone that's the religious point

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.710
what's interesting is that in the polls

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.659
one it comes to younger people

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.150
uh... you know

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.220
and all the people one echoes the
younger people the religious younger

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.400
people are also the exact this issue
really significant x akeli

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.970
as if their religious nurses not

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.339
is now make a difference i mean that the
i'd really do think the difference

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:45.919
his age

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:50.399
and uh... this is the biggest change
that we've seen

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:53.569
as far as i can tell but i haven't done
like a deep dive into the demographics

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.530
of this but but my sense is is is what
michael just expressed

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.280
and if it is age then the question is is
a black happened generationally that

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.660
became different

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.530
and

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.300
that would have such a broad impact and
i i i will do that he was t_v_

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.309
uh...

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:16.470
i think it was the day

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.840
out
