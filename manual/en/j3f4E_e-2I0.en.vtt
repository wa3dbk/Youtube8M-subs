00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.480
How'd it go?

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.040
You hurt?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.020
You hurting?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.920
Okay, so what did you just tell me?

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.920
It felt like playing Mario Kart

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.520
Why are you annoyed?

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.740
Why are you annoyed that you didn't feel the teeth come out?

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.740
They did do it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.740
Well, they took them out

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.460
They don't let you keep them

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.580
They were yours, they stole them from you

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.940
I like YOU!

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.840
We'll continue this conversation when I'm not driving

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.020
How you feeling, buddy?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.280
You're cold

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.340
Do you want to put the blanket on?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.540
What do you mean?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.760
Well you do look sad, you're right

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.400
Why do you look so sad?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.120
Well, probably because you're doing like a little... [makes Gavin face]

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.160
Okay, do it!

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.040
[Meg laughs]

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.120
Okay, don't hurt yourself

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.000
Don't hurt yourself

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.660
You can be sad, it's okay

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.040
Not very happy eyes

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.840
Okay

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.160
[Meg laughs]

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.580
Nailed it

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.100
What was it like in there?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.200
What'd you- how did you have "dreams"?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.100
Ohh okay, where you can go up the ramps

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.340
Right, I'm familiar with it

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.920
How many dentists did you have?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.140
A family of dentists

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.620
Well that's good, right? You don't wanna feel any pain

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.980
It's not good? Or you don't wanna feel any pain?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.380
It IS good

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.960
It's gauze that we're gonna replace your gauze with.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.600
There's your ice pack.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640
You can put it on one side, and then in about 15 minutes

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.080
you're gonna put it on the other side.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.160
[Meg chuckling]

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.200
You're cute.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.640
Aww, I love you!

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.840
Seeing you all loopy is so weird.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.000
Cause, I never see you loopy.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.960
You should cut- you should shave your face and then just have that mustache that you had.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.080
Cause from here, it kinda looks like you just have a mustache.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.160
It's giving me weird Lazer Team flashbacks

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.880
I HATED it!

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.760
Alright...

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.600
I'll leave you alone.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.280
Well, you haven't had them yet.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.120
OH!

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.040
Hey...uh... you love your girlfriend, what a nerd!

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.540
 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.040
I DO!

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.200
If..uh...you think Gavin being in pain is funny...

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.000
as funny as I do.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.580
You should SUBSCRIBE to the Achievement Hunter Channel!

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080
It's in my hand,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.640
and watch us play video games,

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640
and maybe he'll get hurt there too!

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.999
Hey guys! I'm a penis!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.500
[Gavin wheezes]
