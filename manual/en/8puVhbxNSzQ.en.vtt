Hey guys, so last week i was really really
busy because my friends came to visit and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.650
we were going out and stuffs like that so
i didn't get enough time to record a video

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.650
and post it in to my channel. Today i will
be going to talk about one of the contact

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.679
lens i have . Its from Fresh Look color blends
the color is grey. I am wearing it right now.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:38.179
So if you want to see the close up .So this
is the color. 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.920
So I will be showing you what

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.240
difference it makes on your eyes. I have jet
black eyes may be a very deep brown . I am

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.190
not exactly sure about my eye color sometimes
it looks black and sometimes it looks dark

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:07.830
brown when light hits. About the contact lens
it comes in a box like this. It is a very

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.390
compact one. There will be you know color
written over here. 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.380
I never had contact lenses

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.630
in my life. This is my first contact lens
i have ever purchased. My first experience

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.780
was not so pleasant to be frank. may be its
because the first time i was putting it on

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:37.420
my eyes and i felt really really uncomfortable.
I was seeing everything as blurred. So i did

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:44.350
some search on YouTube and Google and i found
out that you should wash your hands really

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:51.030
thoroughly and make sure there is no lint
in your hand and stuffs like that. And i did

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.880
take care of that and it made a big difference.
I washed my hands and made sure that there

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.880
is no lint in my hand and oils or something
like that . But still i was not getting used

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.000
to the fact that you know there is something
in my eyes . I was always getting conscious

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that my eyes were watering and it was not
really pleasant at the first time. But when

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.450
i started using more and more , that kind
of feeling started to go down. Now when i

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.970
wear it i don't feel that uncomfortable but
after 6 hours or so my eyes will start pretty

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:42.580
heavy like it will start to become red . I
usually don't wear it more than 6 hours . I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:50.310
wear it only on occasions like if you want
to go for a party so may be i will have this

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:57.409
. I also got a lens solution with this . Its
from Baush and Lombe. So i think it s the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:05.060
basic lens solution you can get everywhere.
I will remove one of the lens and i will show

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.410
how much difference it has got. The reactions
about my contact lenses are mixed. Some of

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.410
my friends like it and some of them don't.
Some of them call me scary like they say that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.720
my eyes looks scary . But some of them really
really like it . You will have a very dramatic

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.930
change in your face. I will show some of the
snaps i have taken with this lens on and you

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.840
will understand how much dramatic my face
get changed when i have this lens on . I prefer

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:50.619
to do heavy eye makeup when i wear this contact
lens because if you don't do good eye makeup

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:59.780
then i think my face look sick. Light colored
eyes. Basically you should be doing good eye

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.330
makeup when you are wearing lenses like this
especially the Indian ladies because unless

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.420
you are doing a very good eye makeup I think
it will not be that you know flattering on

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:22.420
your skin tone. What i will do it I will remove
lens from one eye and you ppl can judge how

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.260
different it is. Let me just remove it.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.020
 So
u can see the difference. there is a dramatic

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.680
difference.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 Your face get changed when you
apply the lens. I will remove both of it.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:21.540
So this is my actual look without the lens
on . I basically love this contact lens because

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:29.620
it gives me a very different look when you
go out or something. So i just love it. That

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:36.940
is basically it about the Fresh look grey
contact lenses. See you guys soon. Rate comment
