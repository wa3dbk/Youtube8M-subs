00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.360
Hey guys, it's me! Harry!

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.180
And it's show and tell time!

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.820
I've got something SO cool to show you today.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.280
This is my pet parrot.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.680
Hello! Pet parrot!

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.160
My parrot is named Polly.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.680
Polly.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.580
I know what you're thinking:

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.120
Thinking.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.120
"Aren't ALL parrots named Polly?"

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.600
Well, this one is Polly the Pirate Parrot.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.240
Pirate Parrot.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.960
Try saying THAT 10 times fast...

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.820
Polly the Pirate Parrot. Polly the Pirate Parrot.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.720
Polly p-p-p. Aw, forget it!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.520
Polly just landed on shoulder one day at the beach and yelled

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.000
"Polly wants a cracker!"

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.280
As luck would have it, I happened to have some crackers.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.160
So I gave her one, and she's been my pet parrot ever since.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.860
Ever since.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.680
Before Polly landed on my shoulder,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.120
she learned ALL about pirate work from famous guys like

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.440
Blackbeard, and Captain Jack Sparrow, and the Dread Pirate Roberts, and One-Eyed Willy

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.340
and even Captain Hook himself!

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.480
Yarg!

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.560
Yarg, yarg!

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.320
Polly, you don't have to repeat EVERYTHING I say.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.820
Don't have to repeat everything I say.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.880
Ugh, anyway.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.440
Turns out Polly and me make a pretty good pirate team!

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.400
We've already found buried treasure,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.020
Buried treasure!

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.000
won an EPIC sword fight,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.520
Sword fight!

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.780
sailed the seas in search of distant lands,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.520
we fought battles and saved many princesses,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.500
and we also found a MILLION gold coins

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.020
Gold--

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.060
Okay, they were made out of chocolate buy STILL.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.980
Isn't that right, me matey Polly?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.100
Polly likes chocolate!

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.280
One day, we came across Polly's old owner,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.480
Captain Hook!

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.320
And he said:

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.320
"Ohh no, it's a scary pirate

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.860
Captain Harry, not you! Ah!!"

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.520
And I said: "'Tis I, Captain Harry,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.440
and we've come to save Peter Pan and the Lost Boys

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.860
and don't you even THINK of trying to stop us! Ha haaaarg!"

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.660
And he said: "Arg, never!"

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.480
Then I made him walk the plank!

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.800
Isn't that right, Polly??

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.020
Correct. Polly likes chocolate.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.000
Yeah, that is right. And that's the story of

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.360
how I saved Peter Pan and defeated Captain Hook forever!

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.540
Forever! Forever!

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.620
Thank you Polly.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.900
Thank you Polly. Polly likes chocolate

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
Heeeey, wait a minute...

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.800
Birds don't eat chocolate!

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.160
