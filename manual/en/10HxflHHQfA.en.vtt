00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:01.576
&gt;&gt; Alright, so
we are going

00:00:01.626 --> 00:00:02.806
into lab three,
which is all

00:00:02.806 --> 00:00:04.026
about microscopy.

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.466
All about the
microscope.

00:00:05.466 --> 00:00:07.476
Alright? So we're
going to start off

00:00:07.476 --> 00:00:08.476
with two main
things,

00:00:08.686 --> 00:00:10.836
just the care of the
microscopes, and how

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:11.726
to handle the
slides.

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.256
So when you're
carrying the

00:00:13.256 --> 00:00:15.516
microscope, you want
two hands on it,

00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:18.096
one on the bottom,
one on the handle,

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:20.116
and you just
really want

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:21.376
to be delicate
with it.

00:00:21.376 --> 00:00:23.256
It's got a lot of
fine, little things,

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.206
pieces that tie
into each other, so,

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:27.556
the more you
jostle it,

00:00:27.756 --> 00:00:28.766
the more quickly,

00:00:29.646 --> 00:00:31.086
the quicker it's
going to kind

00:00:31.086 --> 00:00:31.996
of break, fall
apart.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:35.286
Alright? So,
don't slide it

00:00:35.286 --> 00:00:36.556
across the tabletop,

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:38.786
just pick it
up, put it down.

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:42.036
You know, just
be gentle

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:42.906
when handling it.

00:00:43.456 --> 00:00:44.806
Alright, and,
and that kind

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:46.316
of goes the same
for the slides.

00:00:46.726 --> 00:00:48.466
When you're handling
the slides, slides,

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.106
you can look at that
picture and see,

00:00:50.256 --> 00:00:51.986
he's holding
it on each end,

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:54.286
he's not holding
it over the middle

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:56.456
where the specimen
is, you know,

00:00:57.026 --> 00:00:59.556
when you're putting
it in, into the case

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.266
and taking it out,
just be delicate

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:02.506
with it, be gentle.

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:04.426
Don't put it on top
of the countertop,

00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:06.756
the tabletops,
because that's

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:09.356
where it tends to
be knocked off,

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:12.896
and really
just be gentle

00:01:12.946 --> 00:01:13.746
with all these
things.

00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:14.596
They're expensive.

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.386
You know, an
average slide is

00:01:16.696 --> 00:01:18.996
around 75 dollars
and the microscopes

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:20.966
that we got are
about 7,500,

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:24.336
so you can imagine
it's difficult

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:25.776
to replace them,
or very expensive

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:27.436
at the least to
replace those.

00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:29.326
So, be, be nice

00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:30.556
when you're handling
the microscopes.

00:01:31.476 --> 00:01:33.686
We're going to
cover a bunch

00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:36.116
of structures on
the microscope,

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:37.976
just to get
you up to speed

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:39.666
and make sure that
everyone's familiar

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:41.176
with the pieces
that we're going

00:01:41.176 --> 00:01:42.196
to be using
the most.

00:01:42.846 --> 00:01:44.826
Alright, so, if you
look at the things

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:47.246
in blue, it's
the ocular lens

00:01:47.246 --> 00:01:49.256
and the objective
lens, and this is,

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:51.196
these two things
are what give you

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.176
your magnification.

00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:54.296
So the ocular
lens has a

00:01:54.296 --> 00:01:56.726
10x magnification.

00:01:57.146 --> 00:01:58.576
And the objective
lens,

00:01:58.856 --> 00:01:59.816
it really depends

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:02.116
on what objective
lens you're on,

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:05.096
but they range
from 4 to 400.

00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:06.996
And we also
have a thousand,

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.476
a thousand
magnification,

00:02:09.476 --> 00:02:10.766
or objectification,

00:02:11.276 --> 00:02:12.526
which you shouldn't
use.

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:14.026
It's an
oil-immersion lens,

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:16.396
it's marked in white
on our microscopes,

00:02:16.396 --> 00:02:18.966
and really, if you
use it, you're going

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:19.746
to break your
slides,

00:02:19.746 --> 00:02:20.806
because it's
designed

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:23.956
to be immersed
in oil.

00:02:24.876 --> 00:02:27.416
Alright? So, when
you're figuring

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:28.966
out the total
magnification,

00:02:28.996 --> 00:02:30.106
what you're going to
do is you're going

00:02:30.106 --> 00:02:31.776
to multiply the
ocular lens,

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:33.036
which is 10,

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.276
times whatever
objective lens.

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.426
And, for example,
if you are

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.836
on a 4x
objectification,

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:42.096
you multiply that
by the ocular lens,

00:02:42.096 --> 00:02:42.686
which is 10,

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:44.966
so you have a 40
magnification.

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:48.516
Alright, if you have
a 40 objective lens,

00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:49.706
you're going to
multiply it by 10,

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:51.416
you're going
to get 400.

00:02:51.956 --> 00:02:53.386
If you look at
it in yellow,

00:02:53.966 --> 00:02:54.566
those are the things

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:55.996
that control the
amount of the light

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:56.696
that comes through.

00:02:57.086 --> 00:02:58.176
It's called
the condenser,

00:02:58.176 --> 00:02:59.466
it's the one
that's attached

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.946
to the stage,
and this is going

00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:03.226
to control the
amount of light

00:03:03.226 --> 00:03:05.576
that actually
accesses the stage

00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:06.706
or gets through
the stage.

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:08.756
And then you look
at the illuminator,

00:03:08.756 --> 00:03:10.766
and that's
the actual,

00:03:11.296 --> 00:03:12.636
basically a
flashlight,

00:03:12.906 --> 00:03:14.906
a natural source
of light.

00:03:15.386 --> 00:03:16.346
Alright? So
if you notice

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:18.096
that your light,
you're looking

00:03:18.096 --> 00:03:18.856
through the
microscope

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:20.276
and it's too dark
or it's too bright,

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:22.376
you're going to mess
with the condensers

00:03:22.376 --> 00:03:23.226
or the illuminator

00:03:23.226 --> 00:03:26.016
to control how much
light is accessing

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:26.446
the slide.

00:03:27.526 --> 00:03:28.906
And ones you
use to get

00:03:28.906 --> 00:03:31.856
into focus is
the, in red here,

00:03:32.076 --> 00:03:33.966
is the coarse and
fine focus knobs.

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:36.116
So the coarse
is what you use

00:03:36.116 --> 00:03:37.446
when you're first
starting out,

00:03:37.446 --> 00:03:38.066
because it's going

00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:40.586
to make very
large changes

00:03:40.686 --> 00:03:41.586
as you move it.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:43.196
The fine focus is
once you get it

00:03:43.196 --> 00:03:45.586
almost in focus with
the coarse, you,

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:46.716
you use the fine

00:03:46.716 --> 00:03:48.416
and that really
fine-tunes it

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.206
and makes it
incredible detail.

00:03:50.636 --> 00:03:51.246
Alright, and so

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:52.536
when you're always
starting out,

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:53.386
you want to start

00:03:53.386 --> 00:03:55.316
with what's called
the scanning lens,

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:59.576
which is also the
4x objectification,

00:03:59.576 --> 00:03:59.726
right,

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:00.946
so the
lowest-powered

00:04:01.276 --> 00:04:05.156
microscope, the
lowest-powered lens

00:04:05.156 --> 00:04:06.606
that you can use
on the microscope.

00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:09.876
Alright, and
really that's it

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:12.436
when you talk
about the structures

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:13.246
on the microscope.

00:04:13.246 --> 00:04:14.986
It's really,
they're all designed

00:04:14.986 --> 00:04:17.266
to make it
easy to view.

00:04:17.266 --> 00:04:18.726
Alright? And so,

00:04:18.796 --> 00:04:20.256
for the lab
that's coming up,

00:04:20.256 --> 00:04:21.906
just make sure you
follow directions,

00:04:22.456 --> 00:04:24.836
make sure that you
understand field

00:04:24.836 --> 00:04:25.366
of view.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.376
Alright? So
it's covered

00:04:26.376 --> 00:04:28.076
in your lab manual
in good detail,

00:04:28.076 --> 00:04:29.446
but real briefly,

00:04:29.506 --> 00:04:30.406
basically what
the field

00:04:30.406 --> 00:04:32.206
of view is is what
you're looking for.

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:35.046
So if you increase
your field of view,

00:04:35.296 --> 00:04:37.216
you're basically
able to see more

00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:39.876
of the specimen,
and so to do that,

00:04:39.876 --> 00:04:41.856
you're lowering
the magnification.

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:43.516
So if you increase
your field of view,

00:04:43.936 --> 00:04:45.406
you lower your
magnification.

00:04:45.466 --> 00:04:47.706
Conversely, if you
decrease your field

00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:50.186
of view, you are
increasing your

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:50.976
magnification

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:52.636
because you are
really honing

00:04:52.636 --> 00:04:53.836
in on one particular
part

00:04:53.836 --> 00:04:54.566
of the specimen.

00:04:55.426 --> 00:04:56.986
Alright? And so you
can skip a bunch

00:04:56.986 --> 00:04:58.206
of that, the
reading,

00:04:58.586 --> 00:05:00.156
and make sure you
do the questions

00:05:00.156 --> 00:05:00.986
for your syllabus.

00:05:00.986 --> 00:05:02.106
That guy

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:04.246
in the corner is
really the reason

00:05:04.246 --> 00:05:05.796
we're looking at
microscopes now.

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:07.726
He's probably
in the 1600s,

00:05:07.726 --> 00:05:09.926
really fine-tuned
their microscope

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:11.076
and was the
first one

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:13.776
to really observe
unicellular

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:17.576
organisms, and so,

00:05:17.576 --> 00:05:19.066
Antoine van
Leeuwenhoek,

00:05:20.006 --> 00:05:20.546
you're welcome.

00:05:20.816 --> 00:05:21.996
We're still
doing it.

00:05:23.096 --> 00:05:28.416
Okay. So, one last
thing is we have,

00:05:28.416 --> 00:05:30.376
we have started to
incorporate the iPad

00:05:30.376 --> 00:05:32.736
into a lot of these
slides, alright?

00:05:32.736 --> 00:05:34.176
And so you'll
see us kind

00:05:34.176 --> 00:05:35.746
of reference the
applications,

00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:39.996
and...it's, really
what you're looking

00:05:39.996 --> 00:05:42.566
at are images
that are taken

00:05:42.566 --> 00:05:43.366
with the microscope,

00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:44.546
or a digital
microscope.

00:05:44.816 --> 00:05:46.176
And the
magnification

00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:49.026
basically ranges
from 40,

00:05:49.496 --> 00:05:52.536
at the unzoomed
view,

00:05:52.756 --> 00:05:54.686
to 200x
magnification.

00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:55.816
Alright? And so,

00:05:55.816 --> 00:05:56.906
some of you
got a DVD

00:05:56.906 --> 00:05:58.016
with your lab
manual,

00:05:58.016 --> 00:06:01.186
and that also
matches the same

00:06:01.186 --> 00:06:03.126
images, so these
images, every image

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:05.496
that you see right
now is, or you see

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:07.276
on your DVD or you
see on the iPad,

00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:09.936
are, are from
slides in class.

00:06:10.456 --> 00:06:12.646
And so when
you're labeling it,

00:06:12.646 --> 00:06:14.036
if you were looking
through a microscope

00:06:14.036 --> 00:06:14.686
or you're drawing it

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:15.556
through a
microscope,

00:06:15.556 --> 00:06:16.476
you're going to
label the name

00:06:16.476 --> 00:06:17.936
of the slide
or the tissue,

00:06:17.936 --> 00:06:18.536
and you're going

00:06:18.536 --> 00:06:19.906
to tell the
magnification that's

00:06:19.906 --> 00:06:20.856
associated with it.

00:06:20.856 --> 00:06:21.856
And for the iPad,

00:06:21.856 --> 00:06:23.186
it's a little
less clear.

00:06:23.186 --> 00:06:26.906
So it's okay to out
iPad magnification,

00:06:26.906 --> 00:06:27.726
or if you want

00:06:27.726 --> 00:06:30.666
to say 200x
magnification,

00:06:30.666 --> 00:06:31.926
that's also
acceptable

00:06:31.926 --> 00:06:34.666
if it's zoomed
in all the way.

00:06:34.836 --> 00:06:36.646
So, the takeaway
things

00:06:37.076 --> 00:06:39.276
that you can
build off

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:40.776
from this lecture,

00:06:41.376 --> 00:06:42.906
are that you should
be able to identify

00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:44.596
and get the
basic function

00:06:44.596 --> 00:06:45.376
of the major
structures

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:46.156
on the microscope,

00:06:46.586 --> 00:06:47.336
and you should
know how

00:06:47.336 --> 00:06:48.836
to calculate
magnification.

00:06:49.286 --> 00:06:51.296
Alright? So, if
you're looking

00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:53.216
under the scanning
lens,

00:06:53.466 --> 00:06:55.416
which is the 4x
objectification,

00:06:55.536 --> 00:06:58.096
it's 40 times
magnification.

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:01.476
And then also you
should know what

00:07:01.476 --> 00:07:02.636
happens when you
change your field

00:07:02.636 --> 00:07:02.946
of view.

00:07:02.946 --> 00:07:04.226
So if you zoom out,

00:07:04.226 --> 00:07:05.536
you lower the
magnification,

00:07:06.056 --> 00:07:08.236
you are increasing
your field of view.
