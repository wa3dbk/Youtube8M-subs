00:00:19.804 --> 00:00:21.804
 Chloe: And you use Biofeedback?

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:22.645
Haylie: I do

00:00:22.483 --> 00:00:29.304
Chloe: Now, I’ve always known biofeedback to be something completely different. You know, changing 
 basically your anxiety and your stress levels and your responses to life.

00:00:29.304 --> 00:00:36.104
Chloe: Your biofeedback has nothing to do with that. I did this 
 a few days ago and it was amazing! It’s magic!

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:37.244
Haylie: Yeah

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:38.125
Haylie: Yeah

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:43.113
Chloe: So you hold this thing and it’s really cold and strange and you 
 have to sort of touch your body with it. Sounds a little pornographic.

00:00:43.394 --> 00:00:45.394
Haylie: We try

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:59.264
Chloe: Yes we do. We all do it naked. And then all the information comes up on your screen and you can test somebody for 
 gazillions of things. I’ve struggled with health issues involving my lungs for years that nobody’s been able to diagnose and you then 

00:00:59.264 --> 00:01:15.144
sat with me and as a detective would , you went through everything and found things that I 
 was sensitive to. Basically (looks at camera) she’s a genius.
So explain this different method of biofeedback.

00:01:15.144 --> 00:01:31.496
Haylie: Absolutely. It’s been a cornerstone in my practice for about 18 years and one of the things that we do is we use 
 this type of non cognitive biofeedback to determine different stress and stress responses in the body. All of us have unique stressors.

00:01:15.237 --> 00:02:06.080
Haylie: Absolutely. It’s been a cornerstone in my practice for about 18 years and one of the things that we do is we use 
 this type of non cognitive biofeedback to determine different stress and stress responses in the body. All of us have unique stressors

00:01:15.237 --> 00:02:06.080
Haylie: Absolutely. It’s been a cornerstone in my practice for about 18 years and one of the things that we do is we use 
 this type of non cognitive biofeedback to determine different stress and stress responses in the body. All of us have unique stressors

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:46.380
They can be environmental stressors, physical stressors, emotional stressors, financial stressors… What we do is we use 
 this particular device (a German modality that integrates German medicine, Western medicine and Eastern medicine,

00:01:46.384 --> 00:02:01.870
the philosophy of acupuncture points and things like that) to show different stress responses in the body and kind of create a prioritization 
 that allows the body to determine its mode of care. So it really helps create a unique very body specific protocol

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:06.120
and it’s been a very profound cornerstone in our practice.

00:02:06.122 --> 00:02:07.630
Chloe: How can people remain healthy?

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:18.650
Haylie: Absolutely. I guess the biggest thing that I would say is to live as clean of a lifestyle 
 as possible. None of us are deficient in artificial sweeteners, none of us are deficient in caffeine.

00:02:18.652 --> 00:02:33.660
We might be deficient in calcium or nutrients. I would say, definitely take time every year to kind of cleanse the body. Our company 
 uses a food based cleanse and it’s so important that you not do those cleanses that strip the body without putting anything

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.280
back in. The body finally gives up because it’s desperate.

00:02:36.825 --> 00:02:38.820
Chloe: It has nothing in it.

00:02:37.114 --> 00:02:40.080
Hayile: You need to have the opportunity to nourish and replenish and rebuild.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.350
Chloe: Tell us about your book.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:52.990
Haylie: I have a book coming out in March of next year. The beginning copies will be out in September. 
 It is a 4 week weight loss program. Most of my clients lose about 20 lbs on the program.

00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:55.790
Chloe: Wow!

00:02:54.834 --> 00:03:05.560
Haylie: But it’s food based. It’s all about falling in love with food again. It’s all about using food to enhance the 
 metabolism, to get the body to burn fat and build healthy muscle. It’s kind of like cross training for your metabolism.

00:03:05.562 --> 00:03:07.560
Chloe: OK

00:03:07.064 --> 00:03:18.700
Haylie: So basically within a week, your body eats 3 different ways. Two days of eating like this, two days of eating like 
 that and then 3 days of really good healthy fats. So there’s no limited food group. So that’ll be out in March.

00:03:19.043 --> 00:03:19.900
Chloe: This is a major nutrition book. A hardcore nutrition book.

00:03:20.516 --> 00:03:22.520
Haylie: It is a hardcore nutrition book about taking the relationship that 
 people have with food and making food work for you.
