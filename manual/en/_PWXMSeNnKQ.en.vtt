00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:06.910
Starting out in the same foot positioning,
instead of moving forward into the bag, we're

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.299
going to move on a three sixty circle, spinning
kick. So, we start with just a turn, again,

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:20.270
you've got to focus on a spot on that opponent
or on that bag, in this case. It's kind of

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:26.490
similar to the back kick we did earlier. You
should have your glute forward, make sure

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.610
you're using it. You have to have your shoulder
up, in other words, you cannot be kicking

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.720
like this. You're using your lower back too
much and you also cannot see your target from

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.650
here. It's really hard to look over your shoulder
so bring that shoulder up, make sure your

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.290
butt is sticking up. From here, the leg comes
up just like the side kick we just did. It

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:54.910
extends, it hooks around and you completing
the three sixty spin. It's a full turn when

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.309
you come back to the original position. One
more time, I'm starting by turning. Look at

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.410
that spot, the face of your opponent. Try
to keep your eyes around that level, shoulder,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.410
face, right here where you can see everything
going on. I keep my eyes on that spot, my

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.670
head has to get around fast, right back to
that spot. Keep that shoulder up and also

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.210
lean back. You never want to stand like this
because your opponent can hit you in the head,

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:29.060
that's also one of the reasons we lean away.
Leg comes up to the side, I hook around and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.070
I've got to turn all the way back to original
position. We're going to do that kick just

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:43.990
a little bit faster. I'm doing the turn, tap,
spin, and come back. One more time, medium

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.110
speed. Tap, kick, and come back. Now, we're
going to do it without putting that foot down.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.880
When you feel more comfortable, you can go
through that whole circle without putting

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.990
your foot down. I want to go through, underneath
the middle of my body and I want to kick it.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.979
Again, kick it. Ball of the foot or heel of
the foot, you go through your target. This

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:19.470
kick goes only for the face, to the face.
One more time. We just finished our spinning

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.740
hook kick. In our next clip I'm going to show
a jump spinning hook kick.
