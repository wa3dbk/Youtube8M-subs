00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.680
Aloha, how are you folks doing today?

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.790
I’m Victor Heresa, owner and executive chef
at Sushi Bushido.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.720
Today I’m going to be doing a unique roll
that is only found here at Sushi Bushido,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.740
it’s made out of cucumber, some fresh fish,
and a homemade sweet eel sauce that we create

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.740
ourselves.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.930
I’m going to start off, hopefully you can
find a nice straight cucumber.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.920
What we do is find the sides and make a straight
cut like that there.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:41.030
We start with taking off the skin first.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.100
Very carefully.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:01:00.329
Then we cut the outside skin of the cucumber
so that it’s nice and straight.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.820
So you can see why it takes a lot of practice
and skill, if you want to try this at home.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.509
If you want to do it you can easily hollow
out a cucumber.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:11.830
We do it this way at Bushido’s.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.799
When you get the skin nice and straight like
this, you put down your fish.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:24.430
We use tuna, hamachi, and fresh salmon, which
is the most popular fish that people like,

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:36.159
and you roll it nice and tight back in the
skin.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:43.500
I cut mine into 5 pieces.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.680
You have your barbecue sticks here.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.060
There are no carbs, so for all the heathy
eaters out there, this is a good roll for

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.590
you.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:12.830
With the extra cucumber, cut a nice base.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.940
I like to make mine all different sizes so
that it looks nice in the base.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.550
Careful.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:46.760
There goes another one.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.040
Then this is the sweet eel sauce that we make.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.240
Brush it on.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.150
I used to be a painter, it takes a lot of
skill to paint the unagi sauce on this roll.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:14.760
I use a wasabi coated sesame seed, gives it
that nice color.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.400
Put some obachi on the plate here to make
a little presentation.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.290
So there you have it, the original unique
lollipop roll found only at Sushi Bushido.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.520
Thank you for joining me.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.040
Aloha.
