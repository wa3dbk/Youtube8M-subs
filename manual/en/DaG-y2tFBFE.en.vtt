00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.870
Hi, I'm Kathy Santo for
Iams with Howdini.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.650
And today we're going to discuss
basic puppy obedience

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.100
and behavior training.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.520
Obedience training is one of the
best things you can do for

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.760
you and your puppy.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.600
So this video will focus on
the three basic commands--

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.050
sit, lie down, and stay.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.830
A puppy can learn a great deal,
even as early as seven

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.150
weeks of age, if learning
is fun and presented

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.640
in the form of play.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.540
To establish a positive report
with your puppy and prevent

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.509
many future problems, start
turning a few days after your

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.770
puppy settles in.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.470
A relationship based on
friendship and trust will

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.830
ensure he tries hard to win
you praise and approval.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:42.950
Before giving a word command to
your puppy, speak his name

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.000
to get his attention.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.560
Then speak a one word command,
such as stay,

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.870
sit, come, or heel.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.790
Your puppy won't respond
to commands until

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.910
he knows his name.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.050
Don't get impatient.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.840
The quickest way to teach your
puppy's name is to award him

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.610
every time he looks at you.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.990
Always train when your puppy is
hungry, lonely, or bored.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.700
When all his needs are met,
he won't be as motivated

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.769
to do as you say.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.520
For example, training right
before meals will help him

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.200
associate his meal with a reward
for the training and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.650
also make him more interested
in the treat you use in your

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:13.850
training session.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.730
Also remember to use motivation,
not negative

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.920
reinforcement.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.770
Reinforce desired behaviors by
offering toys, food, and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.860
praise so the puppy
wants to obey.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.020
Different dogs value
different rewards.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.240
Some may think a tennis ball
is the best thing in the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.300
world, while another puppy may
find a tennis ball meaningless

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.430
but would do nearly
anything for the

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.810
chance to have a treat.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.720
Never use physical punishment
on a young puppy as you may

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.150
scar him both mentally
and physically.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.810
Also refrain from calling your
dog to come to you for

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.690
punishment, because this
will teach your dog

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.700
not to come on command.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.670
Dogs can feel human
emotions, so stay

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.240
relaxed, firm, and confident.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.650
Be sure to keep any frustration
out of the tone of

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.590
your voice.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.080
And if you feel yourself
becoming

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.870
frustrated, take a break.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.200
Your dog can sense this and
will start to associate

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.830
training with your
unhappiness.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.860
Most puppies, like young
children, enjoy learning but

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.610
have short attention spans.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.479
Training sessions should be
frequent and short to prevent

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.190
your dog from becoming bored.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.230
10 to 15 minute sessions two or
three times a day is ideal.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.950
The first command I'm going
to show is sit.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.290
Your puppy's on a leash, and
you're sitting on the ground

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.980
with the leash under your legs
so he can't take a field trip

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.040
away from you.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.430
Hold your hand high over his
head with the reward in it.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.670
Your dog will look
up at the reward.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.700
Use your other hand to
gently guide your dog

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.060
into a sitting position.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.570
And say in a clear firm tone
"sit" while still holding the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.760
reward in the air above
the dog's head.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.190
When your dog sits, give
him the treat and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.520
verbally praise him.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.510
The second command I like
to teach is lie down.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.870
Have your dog sit.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.580
Let him know you have
the treat, but

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.840
don't give it to him.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.990
Slowly lower your hand with
the treat to the floor to

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.400
bring your pup's nose
close to the ground.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.680
When he starts to follow
it say "lie down".

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.790
Once he's fully on the floor,
you can give him the treat.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.080
Repeat saying lie down and
rewarding correct behavior.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.690
Now for stay.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.010
Have your dog sit.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.440
Let him know you have
the treat but

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.680
don't give it to him.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.910
Go in front of your puppy, raise
your open hand, and say

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.550
"stay" firmly so your puppy can
associate your open hand

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.690
with what he's learning.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.330
Start to move away from your
puppy while occasionally

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.150
repeating the stay command.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.060
Start with only a few seconds of
staying at a time and then

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.200
move to slightly
longer amounts.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.720
Always come back and reward
your puppy if he follows

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720
instructions.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.360
The last thing I'd like to talk
about is nutrition and

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.430
its implications on
puppy training.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.040
Good nutrition leads to a
healthy dog with higher

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.660
quality of poop and more
predictable and balanced

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.970
behavior so he's easier
to train.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.360
Make sure your puppy is getting
the well-balanced diet

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.710
he needs for optimal
development.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.710

nutrition, watch the video
