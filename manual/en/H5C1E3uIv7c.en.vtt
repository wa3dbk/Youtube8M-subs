00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.740
Welcome to Revelation Unraveled. I'm your
host William Tapley, also known as the Third

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.459
Eagle of the Apocalypse and the Co Prophet
of the End Times. It looks as if I will be

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:18.900
doing quite a few videos on this crisis in
the Middle East. As you know President Barack

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.900
Obama has said that he intends to declare
war against Syria and to bomb Damascus, and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.790
he is seeking congressional approval, because
he wants to do more than just fire a shot

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.790
across the bow, as he previously declared
was his only intention. And I am convinced

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.899
that this will lead to the Daniel 9 war. The
Daniel 9 war is very serious, because in chapter

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.309
9 verse 26, the great prophet says that Jerusalem
will be destroyed. And please don't listen

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:05.960
to the false prophets all over You Tube, who
say that this war is the Ezekiel 38 war. That

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.310
is a grave error. The Ezekiel 38 war refers
to Armageddon. That comes at the end of the

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.159
Tribulation. The Daniel 9 war comes at the
beginning of the Tribulation, and that is

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:28.159
the terrible catastrophe that is about to
occur, and Pope Francis has recognized the

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:36.200
seriousness of this war in the Middle East,
and he has declared this Saturday, Sept 7th

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.200
to be a worldwide day of prayer and fasting.
And I want to show you this headline from

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.200
the Huffington Post. 'Pope Francis calls for
peace in Syria announces worldwide day of

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:57.109
fasting on September 7. 2013. So let me read
excerpts from this article. 'Pope Francis

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.700
on Sunday condemned the use of chemical weapons
but he called for a negotiated settlement

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:13.069
of the civil war in Syria and announced he
would lead a worldwide day of prayer and fasting

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.030
for peace there on Sept 7th My heart is deeply
wounded by what is happening in Syria and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.730
anguished by the dramatic developments on
the horizon, Francis said in an apparent reference

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.730
to the US and France considering a military
strike to punish the Syrian regime for a chemical

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.060
weapons attack. Usually soft-spoken, Francis
raised his voice as he declared war brings

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.620
on war, violence brings on violence. His admonishment
against resorting to arms as a solution recalled

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.650
the repeated emotional implorations a decade
ago. Now listen to this. This is very interesting.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:09.470
'By the late Pope John Paul II in
a vain attempt to persuade the US administration,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.940
then led by President George W Bush, not to
invade Iraq. Pope John Paul II was

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.830
100 percent correct, and Pope Francis is correct
now. We should never bomb Syria. This will

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.760
be a worse mistake than bombing Iraq, and
it is going to lead to the destruction of

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.760
Jerusalem as prophesied by Daniel in 9:26.
And the pope continued, 'Francis invited Catholics,

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.060
other Christians, those of other faiths and
non-believers who are men of good will, to

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.260
join him that evening in Saint Peter's Square
to invoke the gift of peace for Syria, the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.750
rest of the Middle East and worldwide, where
there is conflict. The deteriorating drama

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.020
of Syria inspired Francis to set aside September
7th as a day of fasting and prayer for Syria.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.319
He said the prayer vigil in the Square will
last from 7pm. until midnight and that would

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.009
be approximately Saturday afternoon Eastern
Standard Time; of course it varies around

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:26.009
the world. I personally will be praying a
Rosary for peace in Syria. And that leads

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:33.060
me to my next email, and this is from DanielJohn2300,
and he posted a comment on my last video and

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.210
by the way DanielJohn2300 has some very interesting
videos you may want to watch, and here's what

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.650
he said. "Hi William, I don't know which video
to post this on, but I just listened to Catholic

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.650
answers, and they said that Genesis 3:15 should
say, 'he will crush the serpent'. They did

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:03.710
not deny that Mary along with the rest of
the church crushes the serpent too, but they

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:10.710
did say that no Council ever approved the
translating of that word as 'she' and that

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:17.550
the correct translation is "he". I was wondering
if you had heard anything about this. Well

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:24.550
I have gone over this numerous times here
on You Tube. The correct translation is 'she

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:32.379
will crush the head of the serpent' and this
is found in Genesis 3:15 as DanielJohn2300

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.659
notes. Let's take a look at that critical
passage from the Old Testament. And the reason

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.699
I want to look at Genesis 3:15, is because
there is a reason I am praying the Rosary for

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:52.009
the situation in the Middle East. That's because
Mary is prophesied to crush the head of the

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:59.009
serpent. Of course the serpent is Satan. In
Genesis 3:15, God says, 'I will put enmity

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:08.099
between you', that is the serpent, 'and the
woman'. The woman is Mary. Now this is the

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.779
first struggle in this passage. Now let's
look at the second struggle; 'and your seed

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:20.990
and her seed'. Now I put these in two different
colors, so you can see that there are two

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:27.529
different struggles referred to. And then
God refers back to the struggle between Mary

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:34.529
and the serpent. 'And she shall crush your
head'. He is still talking to the serpent.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:42.089
'And you shall bruise her heel'. There can
be no other way to translate the word except

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:49.089
'she' not 'he'. Now in the original language
it could be either. You had to go by the context.

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:56.389
The context here is very clear. God is still
talking to the serpent and the struggle is

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:03.389
between the woman and the serpent. 'And so
I want to thank Pope Francis for calling for

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.309
this worldwide day of prayer for peace in
the Middle East and we are going to need all

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:16.309
the help we can get. There's no doubt that
President Obama is hell-bent on bombing Syria

00:07:18.339 --> 00:07:25.339
and Mary's Rosary will ultimately defeat the
Antichrist, but not until after Syria destroyed,

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:33.210
and we face the three and one-half years of
tremendous Tribulation. And please don't forget
