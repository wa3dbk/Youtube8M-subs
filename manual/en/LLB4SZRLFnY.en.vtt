00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.280
So talking to customers, a common theme in
our conversations has been protecting their

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280
investments.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.900
When a customer buys an FB7500 or 7600, or
high end digital press, HP is committed to

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.920
protecting the investment for the customers
by adding upgrades that can actually be applied

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.380
to their existing printer.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.699
I’m happy to announce that for the Spring
of 2012, we have two new features that we’re

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.890
rolling out for the FB7600.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.920
The first one is the autoloader for the FB7600.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.350
It’s an automatic sheet feeder that was
designed in partnership with Hostert to work

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.820
with the FB7600 to feed either one-up or two-up
pallet fulls of rigid or flexible material.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.390
The autoloader saves time and makes production
more efficient by allowing a single operator

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.199
to actually run multiple presses.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.839
An operator no longer has to stand in front
of the press and feed sheet by sheet.

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.659
It can actually load an entire pallet full
of material onto a lift table; the loader

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.380
will then grab material from the lift table,
feed it into the 7600, automatically print

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.310
and offload.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.840
The second one is white ink.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.670
Customers have been asking for white ink on
their FB7500s and FB7600s for quite a while.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.240
I’m happy to announce that HP Scitex will
be rolling out white ink in 2012.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.219
The white ink for the FB7600 is unique in
the marketplace because it allows you not

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:35.840
only to use your full color set, but also
allows you to add two additional beams and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.700
up to 104 printheads to utilize white ink
with the color set you already have in your

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.700
printer.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.579
It allows you to efficiently print spot whites
in either an overspot or underspot, you can

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.369
do a five-layer sandwich for backlit material,
or you can print to a colored material using

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.369
white-only application.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.709
With these latest upgrades, HP Scitex is making
the FB7600 even more productive and even more

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:03.869
versatile than what it already was.
