00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.470
While astronomers have identified over 500
planets around other stars, they're all too

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.269
small and distant to fill even a single pixel
in our most powerful telescopes. That's why

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.800
science must rely on art to help us imagine
these strange new worlds.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.510
Even without pictures of these exoplanets,
astronomers have learned many things that

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.380
can be illustrated in artwork. For instance,
measurements of the temperatures of many "Hot

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.490
Jupiters," massive worlds orbiting very close
to their stars, hint that their atmospheres

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.530
may be as dark as soot, glowing only from
their own heat.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.379
While "Hot Jupiters" would be relatively dark
in visible light, compared to their stars,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.930
their brightness is proportionally much greater
in the infrared. Illustrating this dramatic

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.610
contrast change helps explain why the infrared
eye of NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope plays

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.980
a key role in studying exoplanets.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.880
As our understanding evolves, so must the
artwork. Astronomers found a blazing hot spot

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.480
on the exoplanet Upsilon Andromedae b that
at first, appeared to face towards its star.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.250
More data has revealed that the hottest area
is actually strangely rotated almost 90 degrees

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.620
away, near the day/night terminator.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:31.920
WASP 12b is as hot as the filament in a light
bulb, and would be blazing bright to our eyes.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.080
Most interestingly, if it proves to have a
strongly elliptical orbit, as first thought,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.990
calculations show it would be shedding some
of its outer atmosphere into a gassy disk

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.310
around its star.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.720
Computer simulations of HD 80606 b, constrained
by global infrared measurements, are helping

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.890
astronomers to better understand the details
of how its atmosphere circulates. These computations

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.060
can feed back into the artwork helping us
produce more plausible illustrations.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.359
The closest known exoplanet is 10 light years
away in the Epsilon Eridani system. Excess

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:16.359
infrared light found here by Spitzer has led
astronomers to conclude it also has two asteroid

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:23.030
belts, hinting at the possibility of other
small, rocky worlds.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.750
Perhaps the strangest known planetary system
orbits the pulsar PSR B1257+12, the neutron

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:37.019
star remnant of a supernova. Astronomers have
detected three planets that either survived

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.269
the explosion, or formed afterwards in this
region filled with spinning magnetic fields

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.519
and hostile radiation.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.970
Until the day we can explore other star systems
as thoroughly as our own, exoplanet art inspired

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.780
by the real science will help fill in the
gaps in our imagination.
