00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.139
Buddha has exhorted us to examine every thing,
analyse everything before its execution. this

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.139
3D greeting card can be an inspiration for
everyone. you just need a simple A4 size paper,

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.689
print out the Buddha image and cut out along
the lines, the solid lines. Buddha had said

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.070
to believe nothing because you have been told
to or because it is traditional or because

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.210
you yourself has imagined it. do not believe
what your teacher tells you, barely out of

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.440
respect for your teacher. but whatever after
due analysis and examination you find conducive

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.929
to the goal and benefit and welfare of all
beings, that doctrine believe and cling to and

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:56.929
make it as a goal. wonderful inspiration from Buddha. after
cutting it along the solid lines start cutting

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.119
along this line to make an eyebrow. then next
line to make the eyes, the nose and mouth.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.770
this last line is cut out for the whole face.
this is where the image of Buddha will pop

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.140
up. now open this pop up turn it upside down
and fold it in other direction. pull along

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:57.530
the ears so that they are pointing towards
you. pull the nostrils also so that they point

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.140
towards you. below the chin make a small triangle,
hold it on both sides and reverse fold it

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:17.159
inside. this will make the whole head of Buddha
pop out and it will be like a 3D Buddha. now

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.280
turn it upside down put some glue on the ears
and stick it to a wonderful quote from Buddha

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.870
where he says that we should not believe in
anything even what we are saying in this video

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.489
but examine and only after due examination
if you find it to the benefit for all the

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:53.489
human beings should we accept it as a goal. enjoy this Buddha. enjoy making this greeting card and give

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.879
it to all your friends so that all can inspire.
