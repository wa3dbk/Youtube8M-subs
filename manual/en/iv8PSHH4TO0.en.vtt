Moby:
I GREW UP GOING TO THE MOVIES

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:06.528
AND BEING OBSESSED WITH MOVIES.

00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:09.066
I THINK IT'S THE -- THE MAGIC.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.528
AND I KNOW
THAT'S AN OVERUSED WORD,

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:14.132
BUT THE MAGIC OF SITTING
IN A DARK ROOM.

00:00:14.132 --> 00:00:14.726
YOU KNOW,
YOU SIT IN THIS DARK ROOM,

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.594
YOU SIT IN A CHAIR,

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:20.528
BUT YOU GO TO PLACES THAT YOU
OTHERWISE COULDN'T EVER GO TO.

00:00:25.297 --> 00:00:28.693
WHEN THE ACADEMY ASKED ME
TO PICK A MOVIE TO SCREEN,

00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:30.396
RATHER THAN DO
A VERY SMALL SCREENING

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.165
FOR JUST A FEW FRIENDS,

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:34.396
I DECIDED TO INVITE
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:00:34.396 --> 00:00:36.561
YOU KNOW,
SO IT'S FRIENDS AND FANS,

00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:39.033
JUST 'CAUSE
I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH.

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:45.033
Woman: I'M A REALLY BIG FAN
OF MOBY.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:47.132
AND HE PUT IT
ON HIS FACEBOOK PAGE.

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:48.066
AND IT SHOWED UP
ON MY NEWS FEED,

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:50.264
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,
SHOSHANNA, WE HAVE TO GO."

00:00:50.264 --> 00:00:53.033
Woman #2:
I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN -- WE BOTH
HAVE -- FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:54.429
Man: WE THOUGHT WE'D JUMPED
AT THE CHANCE.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.561
IT'S KIND OF NEAT TO SEE A MOVIE
WITH HIM WOULD BE PRETTY COOL.

00:00:56.561 --> 00:01:01.033
Woman #3: I'M GUESSING
IT MAY BE "INLAND EMPIRE."

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.297
Man #2: I'M LEANING TOWARDS
A DOCUMENTARY.

00:01:02.297 --> 00:01:04.693
Woman #4: OR MAYBE SOMETHING
ABOUT ANIMAL RIGHTS.

00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:06.429
Man #3:
SHE THINKS "BLUE VELVET."

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:09.000
I THINK MAYBE "INLAND EMPIRE."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.264
Man #4: I WAS HOPING "JAWS."

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:12.429
Man #5: EVERYONE'S GUESSING
LYNCH, WHICH MAKES SENSE.

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.000
Announcer:
PLEASE WELCOME MOBY.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.033
[ APPLAUSE ]

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:19.264
Moby: WE'RE GONNA SEE
"INLAND EMPIRE."

00:01:19.264 --> 00:01:22.198
I'VE BEEN AN OBSESSIVE FAN
OF DAVID LYNCH'S

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:24.693
SINCE I FIRST SAW "ERASERHEAD."

00:01:24.693 --> 00:01:26.462
AND WHEN "INLAND EMPIRE"
CAME OUT,

00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:29.066
I WENT TO SEE IT IN THE THEATER
IN NEW YORK

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.594
I THINK THREE OR FOUR TIMES.

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:33.330
Woman: BILLY!

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.693
Moby: YOU CAN'T SAY THAT

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.198
THE MOVIE'S ABOUT ANYTHING,
YOU KNOW?

00:01:36.198 --> 00:01:38.693
IT'S A WONDERFUL IMPRESSIONISTIC

00:01:38.693 --> 00:01:42.693
KIND OF NON-COHESIVE,
VERY UNTRADITIONAL MOVIE.

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:46.165
IF YOU HAVE
A PATHOLOGICAL ATTACHMENT TO,

00:01:46.165 --> 00:01:48.363
LIKE, A CONVENTIONAL
THREE-ACT NARRATIVE,

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:50.099
YOU'LL EITHER LEAVE
OR BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT.

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:51.132
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:51.132 --> 00:01:52.627
JUST APPROACH IT LIKE

00:01:52.627 --> 00:01:55.726
A PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCE,
EXPERIMENTAL FILM.

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:58.627
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN,
IT'S WONDERFUL.

00:01:58.627 --> 00:01:59.759
AND AFTERWARDS,

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.198
I THINK WE'RE GONNA HANG OUT
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:04.627
I ASSUME SOME OF YOU
MIGHT HAVE LEFT BY THEN

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:07.165
'CAUSE IT IS PRETTY CHALLENGING.

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:10.561
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE MOVIES ARE GOOD,

00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:12.660
THEY'RE SO OTHERWORLDLY

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.099
AND VERY POWERFUL
AND REALLY SUPREMELY IMPACTFUL.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.594
Woman: I FEEL LIKE THE MOVIES
ARE, LIKE,

00:02:17.594 --> 00:02:19.462
A REALLY GREAT WAY
TO ENCAPSULATE ART --

00:02:19.462 --> 00:02:22.759
MORE THAN PICTURES,
MORE THAN OTHER TYPES OF MEDIA.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:24.198
Woman #2:
I JUST LIKE TO BE

00:02:24.198 --> 00:02:25.528
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S REALITY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

00:02:27.297 --> 00:02:28.693
Woman #3:
IT WAS REALLY WEIRD.

00:02:28.693 --> 00:02:32.429
I UNDERSTOOD IT MORE
AFTER I READ THE SYNOPSIS.

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.165
Woman: VERY HIGH-END ART
THAT I'M PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO,

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:37.462
LIKE, WIKIPEDIA LATER
TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IT ALL.

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:40.099
Woman #3: [ Laughing ] YEAH.
I HAD TO LOOK UP THE MEANING.

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.165
Man: DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.
I ENJOYED IT, THOUGH.

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:44.099
Woman #4: DID YOU LOVE IT
AS MUCH THE FIFTH TIME

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.000
AS YOU DID THE FIRST?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.066
Moby: MM-HMM.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.363
Woman #4: YEAH? MORE?

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:48.033
Moby: I COULD WATCH IT AGAIN
RIGHT NOW.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.297
Woman #4: REALLY?
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:49.297 --> 00:02:50.726
Moby: I JUST FIND IT
REALLY CALMING.

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:51.726
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:51.726 --> 00:02:53.165
Woman #5: JULIE SAID
SHE CHECKED HER PHONE.

00:02:53.165 --> 00:02:55.099
SHE WAS LIKE,
"ONCE I READ THE SYNOPSIS,

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.066
I UNDERSTOOD IT MUCH BETTER."

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:57.759
Man #2:
IT WAS JUST KIND OF NEAT.

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.297
WE WERE IN THERE WITH HIM

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:00.429
AND WATCHING
ONE OF HIS FAVORITE MOVIES.

00:03:00.429 --> 00:03:03.033
Woman #5: I THINK THE MOVIE
FIT HIM BECAUSE OF WHO HE IS.

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:06.033
AND HE'S NOT, LIKE,
NORMAL, MAINSTREAM.

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:09.033
Woman #6: IT WASN'T COMING
FULLY TOGETHER ALL THE TIME,

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:11.462
AND IT ENDS UP BEING
SORT OF THIS IDEA

00:03:11.462 --> 00:03:15.627
THAT DOESN'T EVER FULLY FORM
INTO A COHESIVE STORY,

00:03:15.627 --> 00:03:19.429
BUT THERE ARE ELEMENTS THERE
THAT KIND OF MAKE SENSE.

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:21.693
Woman #7: IT KEEPS YOU TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:25.363
WHAT THE CONNECTIONS ARE
AND HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER.

00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:27.033
Moby: IT'S A REALLY BRAVE,
INVENTIVE,

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.033
VERY COURAGEOUS MOVIE.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.330
I HOPE AS MANY PEOPLE
AS POSSIBLE CAN SEE IT.
