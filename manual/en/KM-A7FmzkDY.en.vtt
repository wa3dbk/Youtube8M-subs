00:00:51.015 --> 00:00:51.943
- Hi there wig lover!

00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:53.954
This is Heather from CysterWigs.com,

00:00:53.954 --> 00:00:55.591
and today I'm bringing you a review

00:00:55.591 --> 00:00:57.477
of a brand new, and kind of darling,

00:00:57.477 --> 00:00:59.193
Rene of Paris wig.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:01.056
This one is called Amal,

00:01:01.056 --> 00:01:03.056
and it's very much a bob

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:06.218
that has some curl added to it.

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:07.631
Pretty simple.

00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:09.706
Now you'll notice right off the bat,

00:01:09.706 --> 00:01:12.094
because I specialize in
right-out-of-the-box reviews,

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:13.890
that she's not poofy.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.684
She doesn't look like the poofy style

00:01:16.684 --> 00:01:18.386
as manufacturer's photos.

00:01:18.386 --> 00:01:19.775
But that's okay,

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:21.830
because you can get it that way

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.028
with just a little bit of
synthetic-safe styling spray

00:01:25.028 --> 00:01:25.945
and your fingers,

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:27.767
just fluff it up with your fingers.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.500
Now I'm gonna keep it the way it is,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.127
just because I'm gonna resell it.

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:33.582
But I wanted to give you an idea

00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:35.063
of what this looks like
right out of the box,

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:37.243
so you can kinda see its potential.

00:01:37.243 --> 00:01:40.481
Now the color on Amal is Macadamia-LR,

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:41.687
which is one that I really wanted

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:44.543
to showcase in the sunshine.

00:01:44.543 --> 00:01:46.294
As you can see in direct lighting

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:50.729
it is very much a light
golden brown overall.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.284
It does have the longer root here,

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.453
but that longer root
isn't dramatically dark.

00:01:55.453 --> 00:01:57.557
It's basically just like an eight,

00:01:57.557 --> 00:01:58.940
whereas the rest of this is probably going

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.952
to be more like a 12 or a 14.

00:02:01.952 --> 00:02:04.148
I have shown other wigs in this color,

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:05.617
but I definitely wanted to show you

00:02:05.617 --> 00:02:07.462
what this one looked like.

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:10.348
Just because it's in
the manufacturer photo

00:02:10.348 --> 00:02:11.766
and because so many people get this one

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.682
and the Banana Split-LR confused.

00:02:13.682 --> 00:02:16.718
Banana Split-LR is basically like

00:02:16.718 --> 00:02:20.635
if Creamy Toffee-R and
Sandalwood-H had a baby,

00:02:21.587 --> 00:02:22.503
like it's that color.

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.594
It's got the gold of
the Sandalwood-H in it,

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:27.033
but it has you know,

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:28.780
overall more of like a Creamy Toffee

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.074
sort of appearance with the
highlighting and what not.

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:35.203
But this one is not like that.

00:02:35.203 --> 00:02:37.736
This one is definitely more of a brown

00:02:37.736 --> 00:02:40.690
and it's very, very pretty.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.364
The fringe on this is 7.5",

00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:44.924
so it's definitely meant to be

00:02:44.924 --> 00:02:45.780
swept off to the side,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.306
and it's that way in the
manufacturer pictures.

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:51.596
The crown is 10.3", so
quite long, quite long.

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:53.477
It ends right around here.

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.483
The nape is 4.2", so it's short,

00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:56.716
I'll show you when I turn around.

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.222
It gets shorter because of the curl too.

00:02:59.222 --> 00:03:02.764
And the overall weight is around 3-1/2 oz.

00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:04.539
So this is what Amal
looks like from the side,

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:06.073
and again I have not styled this wig,

00:03:06.073 --> 00:03:08.092
I have basically just ran
my fingers through it.

00:03:08.092 --> 00:03:12.259
It can be kind of swept off
to the side of the face a bit.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.849
But, either way, it's
got a lot of potential.

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.030
Very adorable length, very on trend.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.966
Here's the back,

00:03:20.966 --> 00:03:24.966
and as you can see, very
short here at the nape.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:27.907
Hair's a little thin in the back,

00:03:27.907 --> 00:03:29.725
but it's a Rene of Paris wig,

00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:32.392
they all kind of come like that.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:36.640
Plenty of hair here on the sides though.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.107
And it is symmetrically cut,

00:03:38.107 --> 00:03:39.752
and it has a permatease top,

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:42.584
so you can part it in
different directions,

00:03:42.584 --> 00:03:43.584
if you like.

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:51.145
Hair might need to be trained a bit,

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:52.812
but still very cute.

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.982
This is an adorable little wig.

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:01.743
So yeah, so super on trend, super cute.

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:02.808
I'm gonna go ahead and take this off now

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.097
so I can show you the cap construction,

00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:05.212
but I like this wig.

00:04:05.212 --> 00:04:06.881
I think it's really cute.

00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:10.230
Here's what Amal looks like on the inside,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.024
this whole rose lace
portion is permateased.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:15.869
The sides stretch a little bit,

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:17.454
I mean Rene of Paris
is a little stretchier,

00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:21.151
in general than say Noriko or Amore.

00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:22.811
It has a slightly extended nape here,

00:04:22.811 --> 00:04:24.554
nothing to really write home about though,

00:04:24.554 --> 00:04:27.152
but it's felt which is nice and soft.

00:04:27.152 --> 00:04:29.477
So here's what the top
of this one looks like,

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.477
with all the permatease.

00:04:32.591 --> 00:04:36.059
You can see all that permatease there.

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.976
That color.

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.774
Up close and personal,

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:43.775
of all these beautiful,
big voluminous happy curls.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.197
They're very, very flirty,

00:04:45.197 --> 00:04:46.947
feminine kind of bob.

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:49.375
So now I'm gonna go
ahead and put it back on,

00:04:49.375 --> 00:04:52.375
so you can see what Amal looks like.

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:55.545
She's been fussed up a bit.

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:04.260
See how that just went
right back to where it was?

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.542
Even though I changed the part.

00:05:05.542 --> 00:05:06.814
So yeah, it'll need to be retrained

00:05:06.814 --> 00:05:07.827
if you want to try to get that

00:05:07.827 --> 00:05:08.836
to go somewhere else.

00:05:08.836 --> 00:05:09.786
But other than that,

00:05:09.786 --> 00:05:11.018
super cute wig,

00:05:11.018 --> 00:05:12.477
super easy to wear.

00:05:12.477 --> 00:05:14.761
So I really like it.

00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:16.362
This, again, has been the Amal wig,

00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:18.441
and the color Macadamia-LR.

00:05:18.441 --> 00:05:21.440
So hopefully this has been helpful.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.667
And again, I'm Heather,
from CysterWigs.com.

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:24.596
Check out my website.

00:05:24.596 --> 00:05:26.140
I sell wigs, I don't just review 'em.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.129
Thank you for watching
and have a great day.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.962
Bye bye.
