00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.850
In this short video we are going to show you
the safest way to pack long stemmed glasses

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.930
to protect them from damage during your move.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.320
Before you start you're going to need some
packing materials - Most kitchen items will

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.769
be loaded in a medium carton, a pack 2, you'll
also need some packing paper, tape and a marker

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.890
pen
Start by taking a couple of sheets of packing

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.429
paper and rolling them into a tube.

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.150
Don't roll too tightly or fold flat as the
idea is to form an air cushion within the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.150
paper.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.470
Wrap the tube around the stem and base of
the glass to bring the width of the stem area

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:43.710
to the same width of the bowl of the glass
to form a cylinder.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.300
Lay the glass down flat in the corner of your
packing paper, gather a couple of pieces and

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.280
roll it across, wrapping and tucking as you
go.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.730
Remember not to push any paper inside the
glass as this can actually cause damage - the

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.390
vacuum created between the glass and the paper
will cushion the glass far more adequately.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.826
Repeat this process once more to ensure the
glass is fully covered and well cushioned.

00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:08.640
Stem glasses are much safer on the top of
a box than on the bottom, remember, load your

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.960
heavy items in the bottom and lighter ones
on top.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.689
Start your top layer by creating a layer of
padding above the bottom layer, use scrunched

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.530
up rough paper covered with a flat layer of
packing paper to create a cushion from any

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.530
movement.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.430
Stand your glasses upright on top of this
cushion -- glasses are much stronger in an

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.590
upright position rather than lying down and
can withhold more pressure if it occurs.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.210
Once you've filled your layer make sure to
fill in any gaps with more scrunched up paper

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.229
to stop movement -- technically you should
be able to shake the box with no rattling

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.409
around.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.039
Before sealing your box create a final layer
of cushioning on top with scrunched up rough

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.600
paper and then close the top flaps of the
box and seal with tape.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.420
Don't cross fold the flaps in place -- this
is not secure and could cause damage if the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.219
box is dropped or held the wrong way up.
