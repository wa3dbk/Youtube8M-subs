Joseph: We started NeONBRAND back in 2011.
At that point, Kenny and I had just been

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.250
building websites for our friends and family.
But we started to get a lot of requests from

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.500
other people outside of our group of friends
and we realized that we needed to move somewhere

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.890
where we could run our business like a business
instead of out of our house. So that’s when

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.669
we started NeONBRAND.

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:23.820
Kenny and I realized we really wanted to have
a fun atmosphere in our company. We wanted

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.960
to make sure that there was always a lot of
fun going on but also a lot of hard work.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.390
So we made sure we brought in lots of games
for employees to play and our clients when

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930
they would come in and meet with us. We knew
though that we couldn’t just have a whole

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.200
lot of fun and not actually get some work
done. So we made sure that as we worked hard,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.140
that we were providing websites at an affordable
price, but also high quality websites so that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.830
nobody was getting something that they couldn’t
use 10 years from now.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.370
Kenny: One of the things we focus on at NeONBRAND
is transparency. We want to make sure our

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.540
clients know exactly what we’re doing at
all times. As a business owner myself, I hate

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.550
it when I buy something and I have no idea
what that person is doing for me. You have

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.030
log-on permissions to our backend where you’re
able to see in real time the things that we’re

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.860
doing on your behalf. You can see consistent
updates on the websites we’re building for

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.400
you and have email notifications come to you
every time we complete part of your project.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.820
McKay Whitney: One of the great things about
their office and their team is they went in

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.430
with kind of a vision of the website and through
my explaining to them, they put together exactly

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.790
what I thought of. They’re a great group
of people. We meet often and we keep on surpassing

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.290
our goals.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.909
Kenny: One of the things that sets us apart
from our competitors is that we really have

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.360
a passion for our work. We really do want
you to succeed. We really want to see your

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.450
website grow and gain a lot of visitors and
convert those visitors into customers. That

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.590
is success for us. That’s where our passion
lies.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.760
We really want you to take a second, browse
around the website, check out the plans and

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.240
different prices, give us a call and set up
a consultation. We will play a game of ping-pong

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.170
or foosball and we will get you set up with
a package that meets your needs and fits your

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.720
budget. We will help you get your business
started and succeeding online.
