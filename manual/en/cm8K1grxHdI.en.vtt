00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.033
- WHAT'S UP, RYAN SEACREST?
- WHAT'S UP?

00:00:02.033 --> 00:00:03.800
- I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A LITTLE WHILE.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000
AND HOW ARE YOU?
- I KNOW; I'M GOOD.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.833
I'M EXCITED THAT SPRING IS HERE,

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:11.433
AND THERE'S BEEN A BIG DATE
ON MY CALENDAR

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:12.700
FOR A WHILE NOW.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.266
- THAT'S WHAT--THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE.

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:17.666
SO YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT
THIS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:20.066
- ABOUT A DECADE.
- ABOUT A DECADE.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.600
SAYING YOU'RE GONNA GET A DOG.
- YEP.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.100
- YOU SAID BY MAY 1ST.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.500
- I MADE A DEADLINE
WITH MY OTHER ELLEN,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.133
ELLEN K, WHO'S ON THE RADIO
WITH ME,

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.666
BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T BELIEVE
THAT I WOULD DO IT.

00:00:29.666 --> 00:00:32.366
I'D HAD DOGS IN RELATIONSHIPS,
AND THEN THEY AND THE DOGS GO,

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.266
AND SO I DECIDED THAT...

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:35.433
[both laugh]

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:36.500
THOSE DOGS!

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.633
[laughter]

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:40.233
- AND THEN THEY BRING THEIR PETS
WITH THEM AS WELL.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.466
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
- EXACTLY.

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.866
- IT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE
THAT'S YOU WERE SAYING.

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.100
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.
- I KNOW IT.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.866
- OKAY, SO...
[both laugh]

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:48.433
- SO I DECIDED, ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA MAKE THIS DEADLINE

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:49.500
WITH ELLEN ON THE AIR,

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.066
AND I'M GONNA MEET THE DEADLINE.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.866
I'M--THIS IS MY FIRST DOG,
MY VERY OWN DOG, SO...

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:56.666
- SO--SO YOU GOT A DOG?
- I GOT A DOG.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.133
I'VE BROUGHT A PICTURE
OF THE DOG.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.233
- IT COULD JUST BE A STOCK PHOTO
OF A DOG

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:02.600
YOU BOUGHT, LIKE, SOMEPLACE.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.533
- YES.
- IS THIS REALLY YOUR DOG?

00:01:04.533 --> 00:01:06.266
- ROW SIX, SEAT SEVEN,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.133
FOR LETTING ME BORROW
YOUR DOG PICTURE.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.200
THIS IS REALLY MY DOG.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.766
THIS IS THE FIRST ANYONE'S EVER
SEEN A PICTURE OF MY DOG.

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:15.900
- YOU'RE ANNOUNCING YOUR DOG.
- I'M ANNOUNCING MY DOG.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.366
THIS IS MY DOG.
SHE...

00:01:18.366 --> 00:01:20.700
- SHE IS ADORABLE.
SHE'S A BLACK LAB.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.066
- SHE'S A BLACK LAB.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:23.933
AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL I KNOW
ABOUT DOGS.

00:01:23.933 --> 00:01:26.166
- AND...
- THAT'S SHE'S A BLACK LAB.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.600
- WHAT'S--TELL ME ALL ABOUT IT.
WHAT'S HER NAME?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
WHERE IS SHE?

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.000
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.366
BUT HER NAME IS--THE NAME--I HAD
THE NAME BEFORE I HAD THE DOG.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:36.366
SO I CAME UP WITH THE NAME,

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:37.700
AND I WAS SO EXCITED ABOUT
THE NAME THAT I FIGURED,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.000
OKAY, I HAVE TO FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH THIS DEADLINE,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.666
AND GETTING THE DOG.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.766
SO I'M FROM THE STATE
OF GEORGIA,

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.633
SO I'VE NAMED HER GEORGIA.

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:45.233
- UH-HUH, GEORGIA.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:48.166
AND SO SHE'S--THAT'S CUTE.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:50.166
AND I'M SO CONCERNED ABOUT YOU
HAVING A DOG.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.466
I REALLY AM...
- WHY?

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:52.600
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SO BUSY.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.900
- THIS IS ALL--
YOU ALWAYS SAY TO ME,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.566
"YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE A STEP
IN LIFE.

00:01:55.566 --> 00:01:56.566
"YOU'RE TURNING 40 SOON.

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:58.133
YOU'VE GOT TO COMMIT
TO SOMETHING."

00:01:58.133 --> 00:01:59.500
- A RELATIONSHIP,
IS WHAT I MEANT.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.800
- THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP.
- NO, YOU'RE NEVER HOME.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.166
WHO'S GONNA RAISE THAT DOG?

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:04.433
- I'M GONNA BRING THE DOG
TO WORK.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:05.433
- ARE YOU?

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.400
- GEORGIA IS GONNA COME TO WORK
WITH ME SOMETIMES.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.366
NOT ALL THE TIME, BUT SOMETIMES.

00:02:08.366 --> 00:02:11.533
- OKAY, WHERE IS GEORGIA?
IN L.A.?

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:12.800
- YES. SOON.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.100
NOT YET.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.833
- SHE'S BEING--
SHE'S BEING SHIPPED TO YOU.

00:02:15.833 --> 00:02:17.033
- SHE'S NOT BEING SHIPPED,

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:18.733
BUT I DON'T HAVE HER
IN MY POSSESSION YET.

00:02:18.733 --> 00:02:20.366
- NOW, WHO'S GONNA TRAIN
THE DOG?

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:21.833
- I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO KNOW ALL
THAT STUFF YET.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:22.966
I MEAN, I WAS JUST HAPPY TO MEET
THE DEADLINE

00:02:22.966 --> 00:02:24.000
AND COME UP WITH THE NAME.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.300
- DO YOU--

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.166
OKAY, YOU'VE HAD...
[laughs]

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.200
YOU CAN'T JUST START WITH A NAME
AND GET A DOG.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.733
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:32.766
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD'VE JUST
GOTTEN A PIECE OF FURNITURE

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:33.866
AND NAMED IT GEORGIA,

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.366
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T--
I'M TELLING YOU--

00:02:36.366 --> 00:02:37.900
- YOU REALIZE THIS IS
A MAJOR STEP FOR ME.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.366
- I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT.

00:02:39.366 --> 00:02:41.166
SO HERE'S THE THING.
- YES.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:44.133
- BECAUSE THE GIRLS THAT HAVE
COME INTO YOUR LIFE WITH DOGS

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.733
WERE NOT--THEY DIDN'T
HAVE PUPPIES.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.200
THEY HAD TRAINED,
WELL-BEHAVED DOGS.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.933
- YEAH, THIS IS--
IT'S A CINCH TRAINING, YEAH?

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:50.966
- [laughs]

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.600
THAT DOG IS GONNA--
- WHAT?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.566
YOU RUN AROUND IN CIRCLES,
PLAY WITH A BALL, GO TO SLEEP.

00:02:54.566 --> 00:02:56.966
- NO, THAT NICE HOUSE
YOU LIVE IN THAT I SOLD YOU,

00:02:56.966 --> 00:03:01.533
THAT'S GONNA--SHE'S GONNA CHEW
UP EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.833
EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE'S GONNA
BE CHEWED UP IN THAT HOUSE.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:06.166
- UGH.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.833
HERE I CAME HERE EXCITED
ABOUT MY BIG REVEAL,

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:09.533
AND NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:10.533
- I'M JUST SAYING.

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.266
- YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY I WORRY
ABOUT COMMITMENT.

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:13.700
- YEAH.
- NOW YOU KNOW WHY I FEAR IT.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.800
- RIGHT, NOW YOU NEED
A GIRLFRIEND

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.200
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT DOG.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.900
THAT'S--'CAUSE DO YOU THINK--
DO YOU FEEL LIKE--

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.800
ARE YOU READY FOR A GIRLFRIEND
COMMITMENT NOW--

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.533
- WELL, I THINK--LOOK.

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.766
THIS IS ALL HAPPENING
AT THE RIGHT TIME, RIGHT?

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:27.933
I'M TURNING 40 IN A FEW MONTHS.

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:29.233
I'VE GOT THE DOG.

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.566
I THINK MY MOTHER'S
EXPECTING GRANDKIDS SOON.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:34.000
AND SO I'LL HAVE THE GRANDKIDS
AND THEN FIND THE WIFE.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.233
- I SEE, I SEE.
[laughs]

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.333
OR NAME THE GIRL AND FIND
THE GIRL TO MEET THE NAME.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:38.733
- THAT'S IT.
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

00:03:38.733 --> 00:03:40.200
- SEE?

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.833
- THINK OF YOUR FAVORITE
GIRL NAME.

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.100
[laughter]

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.000
AND THEN FIND A GIRL.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.466
- OH, THIS DID NOT GO THE WAY
I PLANNED IT

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.666
WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.133
- NO, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU
AND YOUR DOG.

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:49.266
- I CAN TELL YOU'RE THRILLED.

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:50.533
- WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK,

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.466
AND WE'LL COME BACK
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THINGS

00:03:53.466 --> 00:03:55.633
THAT I WILL NOT
CRITICIZE YOU FOR.

00:03:55.633 --> 00:03:56.733
- [laughs]

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:58.733
- WE'LL BE BACK.
