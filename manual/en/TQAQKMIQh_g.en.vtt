Daddy Owen: Now that’s a good book. Oh,
Hello. I did not see you come in. Welcome

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.620
to the Reading Nook. Would you like to hear
a story? I can’t hear anything your saying

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:26.949
I’m just on your computer. 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:33.219
Today’s story is Germs Are Not For Sharing
by Elizabeth Verdick. When I say her name

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:40.690
it makes me tingle in my lap. “Achoo! Achoo!
What do you need to do?” Oh it’s a rhyming

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.239
book. “Say, ‘Tissue, please! Or reach
for one yourself’…” It’s not a rhyming

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.929
book. It’s not. “Blow. Wipe. And Toss”.
Hmm, sounds like a night at home with the

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:59.750
Internet. “Cough, cough. What do you need
to do?” You need to get the hell out of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:08.050
there she’s sick. “Why? Because germs
are not for sharing”. Look a haunting image

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.770
of what healthcare reform has done to our
country. In the future all doctors will be

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:22.760
bears. Glen Beck was right. “Oops! I dropped
a cookie. What do I need to do”? Just eat

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.340
the cookie. You know a recent study shows
that public bathroom floors covered in fecal

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:38.770
matter and blood are still 50% cleaner than
most Luby trays. That’s not true. “F-L-U-S-H!

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.750
What do you need to do?” Well you need to
get your mom to take you shopping for some

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.810
new cloths. Cause I don’t know if Joske’s
was having a sale on purple clogs and green

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.110
roll-ups but, man your not going to get a
chance to share anything with anybody. Oh,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:02.230
there school has bi-gender bathrooms. They
must be in France. So remember wash your hands.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:09.610
Stay away from germs and we’ll beat polio.
We will. “Smooch, smooch! Kisses are nice

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.910
to give and to get”. But, they are sinful
in the eyes of God. Especially, if you got

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.110
gropey hands like this kid there. That’s
why we think just blowing a kiss is better.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.780
Its sort of abstinence only that we believe
in firmly hear at the reading nook. Unless,

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.590
you’re of the age of consent and really
hot for each other. Been drinking lots of

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.000
Bartles and Jaymes wine coolers. And. Germs
are Not for Sharing. So where something on

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.190
your didly-do.
