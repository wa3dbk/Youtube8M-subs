Hey there, it's J-Wro here, on the J-Wro Show,
bringing you guys another

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.340
delicious and simple vegan recipe on the show
today.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.670
If you take it way
back into family traditions and celebrations,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.480
usually there are one or two
really key things in each tradition or culture.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.700
And today, I'm doing the
vegan version of a traditional Mexican drink.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.240
I'm going to be doing
horchata.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.710
Now, normally they drink this on Cinco de
Mayo for celebrations,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.892
but this recipe is so simple and delicious,
you can make it any time of the

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:33.640
year hot or cold.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:43.100
So first thing we've got to do is grab a blender
mug, and our base is going

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.969
to be simply one cup of room temperature filtered
water.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:50.289
Now, the key to
horchata is not just the taste of it, trying

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.949
to mimic that authentic flavor
but, getting the right texture.

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.389
So in this case, we're going to be using a
half cup of soaked hazelnuts.

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:02.890
Now to get a little bit more creaminess, you
want to add a quarter cup of cooked white

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.890
rice.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.799
It can get kind of sticky
in there.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:10.549
For the sweetness factor, you can do an agave,
you can do maple syrup, in

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.390
this case I'm going to go a little bit unique
here and do a raw coconut

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.200
nectar, two tablespoons.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.420
Next up we're going to do full teaspoon of
ground

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.960
cinnamon.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.320
Little bitty pinch of salt.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.590
And then last, we're going to bump up
the protein and the creaminess in this recipe

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.009
by adding a half-scoop of our
warrior blend protein.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.340
Now it's time to rev it up and give ourselves
some

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.439
vegan horchata.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:49.109
As I mentioned, you guys can do this hot or
you can do it

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.109
cold.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.369
I like a little bit of coldness today here,
it's a little hot.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.859
So, I'm going to add right around a cup of
ice cubes, which is about four

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:58.950
to five big ones.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:11.000
So let's add a handful of ice cubes.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.282
Smells good, lets
give it a taste, pretty darn good.

00:02:15.282 --> 00:02:19.930
The flavor of the hazelnuts is really
interesting here because it has like, kind

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.870
of a smoky undertone, but
definitely authentic.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.591
The cinnamon, the sweetness, it's right on
par with a

00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:27.170
traditional horchata.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.000

Let me know in the comments below and I'll
try and make a version

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.390

The real thing to do would actually
be like, take a blender full of this and go

out to like Echo park in east
LA and give it to all the Mexican people down

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.090
there.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.060
Be like, "Yo, I made
some vegan horchata, you guys like this?

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.060
Muya Rico".

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.570
I think I might do
that.

Stay tuned for that possible video.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.470
