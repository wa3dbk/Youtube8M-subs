Hi, my name is Dave Andrews, today I'm going
to tell you how to get Windows mail to work

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.881
with wireless internet. Let's go to our computer
screen. And the first thing we're going to

00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.680
want to check is first of all that we are
connected to the internet. Basically make

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.130
sure that you have an icon down here that
says you're connected to a wireless connection,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.619
this is, it's called Tims here, and it has
that little globe on it which is telling me

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.320
that we are connected to the internet. That's
what that globe means. I go to connect to

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.729
a network, you can see here that these are
the wireless networks that are available.

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:43.301
And you can tell how good a signal that you
have for each of those wireless networks.

00:00:43.301 --> 00:00:48.699
So now that we have verified that we are connected
wirelessly, let's open up Windows mail, by

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.920
clicking on our start button, go to all programs,
let's find Windows Live, and we're just going

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.609
to launch Windows Live mail. Now, I don't
have any accounts currently set up in Windows

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.380
Live mail so I'm going to set one up. What
I'm going to do is I'm going to hold the alt

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.950
key on my keyboard, and I'm going to press
T, and that brings up the tools menu. From

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.840
there I'm going to click on accounts. Now,
I'm going to create a new account just by

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.530
saying add. It's going to be an email account.
And then I'm going to type in my email address

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:34.240
here.
As well as the password for my email address.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:45.920
And what I would like it to appear as in the
Windows Live mail screen. Now, as you can

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.990
see, I have a Gmail account now set up in
Windows Live. And if I close this screen that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:59.689
allows me to set up accounts, there is my
Gmail account right there. It's my default

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.189
account. It says Gmail and it's followed by
my email address. I click on my inbox, I don't

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:14.790
currently have any emails in there. So let's
do a send and receive. And then go to new

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:27.060
to make sure that we can send an email. Let's
just send an email to somebody,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.000
just by clicking on send. Now, down here it
says it's sending mail and that email went

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.060
through just fine. My name is Dave Andrews
and I've just showed you how to connect Windows

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.120
Mail over a wireless internet connection.
