00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:21.689
I 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.070
live every day of my life like it's 1997.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.590
The only show I watch is Seinfeld; I don't
who you are, where you're from

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.850
or what you did, as long as you love me...My
Best Friend's Wedding is a great movie.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.530
I don't care who knows it.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.530
And I

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.329
still prefer getting "jiggy" to offline multiplayer.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.870
Like on the Wii, the game my friends and I
played the most was

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.050
easily WarioWare, specifically the darts game.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.040
So to have a similar game on the 3DS?

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.660
Sign me up, Jerry.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:58.120
It's Darts Up 3D for the 3DS.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.820
So, uh...this is a game of darts.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.550
In which you throw darts.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.330
Unlike 1997, there's not a whole lot to it.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:09.330
There's a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.140
classic one-on-one mode; there's an arcade
mode, which has you progressing through levels;

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.300
and you can also play the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.110
darts game 501.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.349
Which I'm, freaking...I don't fully understand.

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:23.220
Nonetheless, there's also download play, which
is

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.580
awesome, or you can play with four players
locally, using a single 3DS.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.390
So there's a sweet amount of options and modes,
especially for such an inexpensive eShop game.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.860
The question is...how

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.290
does it play?

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.500
Another question is...why was My Best Friend's
Wedding so good?

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:49.310
Neither answer has anything to do with Cameron
Diaz.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.200
I expected Darts Up 3D to use the stylus.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.880
Just a little flick, to throw the darts.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.200
Seems obvious, right?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.239
Uh, turns out

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:01.090
the gameplay is designed around the 3DS hardware,
but it's not the touch screen.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.890
It's the gyroscope, the motion

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:03.890
sensor.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.470
You play Darts Up 3D by...tilting your system.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.610
And surprisingly?

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.610
It's not as bad as it sounds.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.480
So here's how it works.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.890
You physically move the 3DS to aim your shot.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.060
Once you're lined up where you want, you just

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.110
give the control pad a little flick.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.610
Pull it back, let go, darts go flying.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.330
Now, here's the thing.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.330
I'm usually very

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.700
critical of tilt anything in video games,
but it works pretty well in Darts Up 3D.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.640
And again, it feels good, too.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.890
But there's one problem with this kind of
visually based control scheme.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.480
Once you find the sweet spot, you've kind
of...found the sweet spot.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:51.030
See, in a 
game like darts for WarioWare, you had to

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.530
replicate your shot every single time.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.600
You had a little reticule,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.990
sure, but...it was more about your throw.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.060
If your throw was bad, it didn't matter where
you were aiming.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.060
With Darts Up

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.000
3D, that's not the case.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.850
This one's all about where you're aiming.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.070
So if you can just hold the system still,
you can

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.200
basically rattle off as many bull's eyes as
you want.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.690
Do the controls work?

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.310
Absolutely, they work great.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.400
But they almost work too great.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.840
It's not a matter of execution with

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.100
Darts Up 3D.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.380
It's just a matter of concept.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:35.440
So honestly, that kind of makes single-player
play pointless.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.510
The real reason to check this thing out is
the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.510
multiplayer.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.740
Once you're passing the 3DS around, you at
least have to relocate your sweet spot.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.550
So that's better.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:46.550
And

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.170
again, the game plays so well and is so enjoyable...it
really is worth a look for fans of darts.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.569
Plus, any game with Mii support gets bonus
points from me.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.700
And Mii.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.700
I like Miis.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:11.680
And at least with friends, I like Darts Up
3D, too.
