On behalf of Expert Village I'm Laura Banford.
I'm going to teach you how to make baked Penne

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.150
with sausage. In this clip we're going to
prep our onions and our garlic for the tomato

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:22.109
sauce. I'm using a nice red onion and a head
of garlic, the way we dice our onions is cut

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:35.320
off the root end and other end. I'm going
to score it, it makes it easy to peel

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:45.500
and the way I like to do it for this dicing
is slice the onion in half and slice thin

00:00:45.500 --> 00:01:00.510
even professional strips of onion and that
is going to make it easy to go through with

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:17.530
your knife. You don't want big chunks of onion
in your sauce very uniform so they all cook

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:29.390
at the same time. As far as our garlic this
is a whole head of garlic get some cloves

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:42.961
off there, pull the outer layers of skin and
then you take the bulb of garlic and hit it

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:49.060
with your knife (back of your knife) like
that. When you hit it the rest of the skin

00:01:49.060 --> 00:02:06.030
should come right off and then you're going
to hit it again, dice it up and that is how

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.030
you get a clove of garlic out of it's skin.
When we come back we are going to saute all

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.060
of our vegetables in butter and olive oil.
