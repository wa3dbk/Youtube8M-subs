00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.670
Hey everyone!

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.590
Jaystepher here with Series 13 Lego Minifigures.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.790
Set number 71008.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.140
Recommended building ares are 5 and up.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.540
So let's see what is inside of the package.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.300
Let's hope I get a non duplicate minifigure.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.600
I've already ran across that problem one time.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.980
Let's hope it's not a second problem.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
Here we go!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.160
Whoa this one has a lot of parts.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.340
So here is the possible sixteen.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.060
Yes!

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.200
This one has a lot of parts.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.680
Nice print work on the pants.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.140
Oh no capes!

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.660
Oh there's two of them.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.980
Oh. [Laughs]

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.020
Wow...

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.460
This is not fun at all.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.620
Y'all know how I feel about putting on capes

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.320
because they just take forever.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.350
Okay so far so good.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.810
That's one.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.740
I'm hoping I'm putting everything on correctly.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.720
Looks like I am.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.900
Whoops!

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.160
Yep.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.480
This is taking a long time.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.160
Okay.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.160
I think I got it.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.400
Now I got to put the stash on.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.000
Just getting hit hard with accessories.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.160
I hope there's enough room to put the head on.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.580
It's a one-sided head

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.060
or single-sided.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.900
Okay.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.320
Let's see here.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.100
Come on get your head on straight!

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.860
Got to screw it on all the way.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.660
Looks pretty good.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.830
Nice crown.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.180
so this must be the Classic King.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.160
Nice golden sward.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.160
Let's take a closer look.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.900
So his torso and pants are printed.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.540
I like the crown.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.430
He's wearing all these extra capes.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.820
One nice minifigure.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.120
Still can't get the beard and stache on straight.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.040
Looks good.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.540
So yeah.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.540
This is the Classic King.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.540
Thank you all for watching!
