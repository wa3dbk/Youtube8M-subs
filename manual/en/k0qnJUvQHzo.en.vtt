00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.310
Hello, I’m ROBwithaB and this is
101 ways to make fire;

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.309
the show that takes you to the cutting...
ouch

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.610
to the cutting edge of ...
ouch

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.470
That’s sharp.
...to the cutting edge of science...

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.619
... and survival skills
... and sibilance

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.929
and also
some scatological, gratuitous sexual innuendo.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:37.510
Mostly thanks to his seriously unsexy assistant.
Now, if you are out in the bush,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.280
you may have forgotten your lighter
or run out of matches.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.520
But hopefully you’ll have one of these:
a knife.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.840
Now, a lot of people seem to prefer the $400
stainless steel alloy mamba-slagter of a knife.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.739
I prefer something a lot simpler:
Small, simple, easy to carry, easy to sharpen,

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.340
even on a rock
and it’s a folding knife,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.469
so it stows in the handle.
It’s called “Opinel”.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.250
Borrowed it yesterday from this French chap
I met here in the camp grounds.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:15.080
(calls out) Hello Robert.
(French) $#!%. Somebody stole my knife!

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.280
Good for pruning vineyards
and slicing baguettes, and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.930
cutting cheese... (queef)
Oops, excuse me.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:38.130
... and even starting fires.
Opinel: the knife that might save your life.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.869
Right, so here we have our little French fire
lighter

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.840
or as I like to call it,
le firelighter français.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.920
But we are not going to use it like that for
two reasons:

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:57.450
1. Its sharp and you can cut yourself.
2. It’s a knife and it’s useful

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.850
for cutting things,
which doesn’t work if you’ve been beating

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.320
that with a rock.
So, we are going to close it into the handle

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.369
and use that
as our striking edge.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:14.110
Now, we just need a sharp rock.
I found this one down by the stream.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.550
Sharpened using stone-age tools.
I just took a big rock and dropped it and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.450
the
thing broke, leaving a nice sharp edge.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.310
Yes, so this is quartz, you can use any hard
rock that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.890
you can get a sharp edge on:
obsidian; chert; flint would work especially

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.500
well.
We don’t have that here.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.250
I’m using quartz, it’s abundant.
And then the last thing we need; some smigtin,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.140
Some smouldering ignition tinder,
and for that I’m going to use

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.100
a little piece of charred rope.
I always carry a bag of this stuff around

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.920
with me.
Thin cotton rope that’s been charred.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.350
Now, some people might say:
“Dude that’s so fake,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.160
you have 3 things and only 2 hands.”
And to them I say;

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.170
“I’m going to use my middle finger.”
What I’m looking for, is a little indentation

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.870
like that...
I hope you can see that

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.280
... in one of the sharp edges of the rock...
and that’s going to help me align the blade.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.100
I’m going to position this just underneath
that.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.940
I’m going to hold all of this so that my
fingers are out

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.040
of the way and can’t get slammed by the
knife.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.480
So, I’m going to grasp this firmly by the
handle

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.330
and turn it slightly so that we are shaving
the corner

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.000
over there.
Okay, here goes.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.750
There we go,
one time baby.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.780
Cool. You rock, brother.
And you can see why we had to do all that

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.050
talking just now,
because this would have been a very short

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.510
video otherwise.
Right, then all that remains

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.260
is for us to drop our little ember
into the birds nest.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.670
Today I’m going to use an actual birds nest.
(shouts) Sorry!

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:57.730
We are going to get that smoking
and then do our fire dance;

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:08.420
(singing) Unga bunga, unga bunga,
unga bunga, unga bunga.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.590
And we have fire!
Oonga Boonga baby,

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.510
just in time for braai-vleis.
Bloody Caveman.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.250
Savage.
