00:00:02.605 --> 00:00:04.197
- I like to engage the entire student

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:05.385
in the learning process.

00:00:05.385 --> 00:00:07.382
I consider myself a constructivist

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:11.117
and I like to see learning
actually happen in the classroom

00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:14.131
through engaging the student
with all their senses

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.209
and looking at the visual arts.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.294
My name is Jim Daichendt.

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:18.914
I am a Professor of Art History

00:00:18.914 --> 00:00:20.578
in the department of Art &amp; Design

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:23.576
at Azusa Pacific University.

00:00:23.576 --> 00:00:27.868
My research area focuses in
a few different categories

00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:31.174
and the most traditional is how
art's been taught over time.

00:00:31.174 --> 00:00:34.499
I wrote a book called Artist
Teacher which basically tracks

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:36.793
the history of art education

00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:38.855
from the classical civilizations

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.961
up into the modern and contemporary area.

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.579
And to me that's exciting because students

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.558
often don't realize why they're
being taught what they are.

00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:49.257
And I feel we can understand
the art of the time

00:00:49.257 --> 00:00:51.857
by studying the instruction of that time.

00:00:51.857 --> 00:00:54.421
So art in the 21st century
looks a lot different

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.378
than it was in the 19th century.

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:59.021
And I feel like that type
of research helps equip me

00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:01.638
in the classroom but also
helps equip our students to be

00:01:01.638 --> 00:01:03.845
better artists, better
teachers themselves,

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:06.283
better scholars in the future.

00:01:06.283 --> 00:01:08.703
I like to provoke students with questions.

00:01:08.703 --> 00:01:12.752
Get them to see and look
deeper into visual objects.

00:01:12.752 --> 00:01:15.470
I often start off with what do we see?

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.295
And then once that is given I dig deeper.

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:19.789
Why do you say that?

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.570
And get them to provide evidence

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.442
for the things that they're looking at.

00:01:23.442 --> 00:01:27.359
The faith aspect at APU
is central to who I am,

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.450
my world view for how
I understand the world.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.573
And so having a consistent model

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.651
for what truth and beauty is

00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:40.944
is embedded in my classroom
work and how I engage students

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:42.645
but also how I write and teach.

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:44.842
And it's a place where we can share them.

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:48.900
I want students to be able
to be critical lookers.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.680
I want them to be able
to engage and think about

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.981
visual imagery in a very
deep and meaningful way.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.187
That's not something that
we are prepared to do

00:01:57.187 --> 00:01:58.545
in our society.

00:01:58.545 --> 00:02:01.151
We often look at things
at a very surface level

00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:04.871
and we don't go into the deep
looking that I want students

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:07.894
to be able to facilitate
with their friends and family

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:09.811
but also on their own.
