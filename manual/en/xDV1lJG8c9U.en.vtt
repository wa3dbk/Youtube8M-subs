JENNIFER CROW: Hi, this is Jennifer and I'm
the owner of wedgiewear.com, and we're here

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:10.960
with Expert Village. Now that we have changed
machines, what we're going to do now is where

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:21.440
the elastic part is you're just going to turn
it over to make a nice smooth area. You pretty

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.630
much want the elastic to come all the way
up here. You don't want any gaps or anything

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.710
like that. In this part, probably, it would
be a good idea to use a little bit of needles

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:41.900
because as you're sewing, it's going to want
to change. So I'll just maybe put one in the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:48.900
bottom, one in the middle, and since you're
going to start off at the top, there's really

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.981
no need to put one on top. And then we're
just going to start sewing again on this part.

00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:03.910
What you probably want to do--this seam right
here looks a lot cleaner--is to kind of follow

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:15.540
the top line that you have already set.
Let's stick it on there. In this part, you

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.750
do not want to pull it all the way to make
your stitch because then it's not going to

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.549
re-gather back; it's going to stay out that.
So you kind of just want to pull it a little

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:38.869
bit to make it kinda go along, but not anywhere
to hurt your stitches.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.119
In this part, you do want to take your time
on it because this is what you're going to

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:55.630
see.
And then just cut it off and now you have

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:09.689
your first side. And you just want to do the
same thing to the next one. Strings.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:13.480
This part up here is going to be a little
bit tougher and this is where you're going

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.900
to sew in your strap, so you probably just
want to start off at the bottom.
