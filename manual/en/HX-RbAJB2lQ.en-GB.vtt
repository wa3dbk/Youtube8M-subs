00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.419
{intro Music}

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:16.390
G'day Drinking Buddies, Scotty Boxa here for
www.drinklab.org and unlike the DJ at the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.600
club we are taking requests, yes one of our
Drink Buddies Johno has requested we make

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.370
one of his favourites the Long Island Iced
Tea Cocktail.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:28.750
Its a popular one on our website, and this
is how to make it.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.189
In a cocktail shaker filled with ice,
add 1 oz Sours or Sweet and Sour mix

00:00:33.189 --> 00:00:37.400
1 oz of Vodka
1 oz of Tequila

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:47.779
1 oz of White Rum of Bacardi
1 oz of Gin

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:51.180
1 oz of Triple Sec or Cointreau or Orange
Liqueur

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.359
This drink dates back to the 70's named after
the Long Island in New York City.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.559
Shake

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.620
And strain into your glass filled with ice.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.370
Top with Coke or Cola

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.180
And I present you the Long Island Iced tea
Cocktail.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.340
Now this was originally made back in prohibition
to make it look like they were making Iced

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.900
Tea instead of illegal alcohol.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.730
