00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:18.300 line:-13%
NARRATOR: Today, about 98%
of the atomic matter

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:22.533 line:-13%
in the Universe consists
of hydrogen and helium.

00:00:22.566 --> 00:00:27.433 line:-13%
But thanks to threshold three,
that other 2% is made up

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:31.000 line:-13%
of all the other elements
in the periodic table.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.133 line:-13%
That makes some amazing
things possible

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.633 line:-14%
because these different elements

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.600 line:-13%
can combine to form
an almost infinite number

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:39.700 line:-14%
of different types of matter.

00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:41.833 line:-13%
Objects that are
much more complex

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.933 line:-14%
than stars could now form.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:46.033 line:-14%
Objects like planets,

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:50.900 line:-13%
and that was the
work of threshold four.

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:52.600 line:-14%
Here's how it works.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.566 line:-14%
When new stars are formed,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.266 line:-13%
they're surrounded
by huge clouds

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000 line:-14%
of chemically rich matter

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:00.266 line:-13%
our ingredients
for this threshold.

00:01:01.466 --> 00:01:04.333 line:-13%
These clouds spin
in different orbits

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:08.333 line:-13%
around the newly forming star,
creating Goldilocks conditions

00:01:08.366 --> 00:01:11.033 line:-13%
that are just right
for elements to combine.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:13.266 line:-14%
Some atoms combine chemically

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.400 line:-13%
to form a variety
of different molecules,

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:18.133 line:-13%
but also, atoms
and molecules often

00:01:18.166 --> 00:01:22.033 line:-13%
clump together to form bigger
and bigger lumps of matter.

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.466 line:-13%
This process
is called accretion.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.733 line:-13%
And eventually it goes
on to form entire planets.

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:29.033 line:-14%
Now, since lighter elements

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.766 line:-13%
are much plentiful
in the Universe

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.166 line:-13%
many planets consist mainly
of hydrogen and helium

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.800 line:-14%
like Jupiter and Saturn.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.966 line:-13%
But because hydrogen
and helium atoms are so light,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.266 line:-13%
intense radiation
sometimes blasts them away

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.633 line:-13%
from regions close
to the new star.

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:48.300 line:-14%
Those regions then contain

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:52.066 line:-13%
a relatively high concentration
of other heavier elements.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.733 line:-13%
And eventually, these elements
may clump together

00:01:54.766 --> 00:01:58.700 line:-13%
through accretion to form solid
planets such as our Earth.

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.433 line:-13%
In our planet's crust
for example,

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:05.700 line:-13%
the most common elements are
oxygen, silicon, aluminum,

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:09.633 line:-13%
and iron,
not hydrogen and helium.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:15.666
Our earth formed about
4.5 billion years ago,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.666
but the very first rocky
planets may have formed

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.733 line:-13%
within a billion years
or so of the Big Bang.

00:02:22.766 --> 00:02:26.233 line:-13%
These planets represent
new forms of complexity

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.933 line:-13%
because they contain a
much greater diversity

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:32.733 line:-13%
of chemical substances
that had ever existed before,

00:02:32.766 --> 00:02:36.700 line:-13%
and that could create
even more complex entities

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:41.266 line:-13%
such as the first
living organisms.
