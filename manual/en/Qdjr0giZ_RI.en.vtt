00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000
[soft piano music]

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:27.121
There's nothing quite like a good, loving mother-daughter relationship.

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:31.765
And this is nothing like "a good, loving mother-daughter relationship"

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:35.304
[off] The fella up and murdered the poor oul woman in Dublin...

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:37.338
...and didn't even know her.

00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:39.671
[off] The news that story was on, did you hear it?

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.814
Strangled! And didn't even know her.

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.739
Sure, that would be a fella it would be better not to talk to.

00:00:46.858 --> 00:00:49.830
That would be a fella it would be better to avoid outright.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.174
Sure, that sounds exactly the type of fella I would LIKE to meet...

00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:57.678
...and then bring him home to meet you. If he likes murderin' oul women.

00:01:00.047 --> 00:01:01.647
[off] Of course me mother wouldn't be that keen... 

00:01:01.672 --> 00:01:04.672
...on me seeing any man at all... selfish oul...

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.277
What need has she of a man anyway?

00:01:07.338 --> 00:01:09.474
Doesn't she have me to think about?

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:14.456
Interfering with my life again? Isn't it enough that I've had 
 to be on beck and call for you... 

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:19.877
...every day for the past twenty years? Is it 
 the one evening out you begrudge me?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Young girls should not be out gallivanting with young fellas

00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:26.581
Young GIRLS? I am forty years old for feck's sake!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.155
What have I ever done but kissed two men the past forty years

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.576
Two men is two men too much!

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:38.563
[off] Maybe one day. When I'm dead and gone I suppose.

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.978
Huh!

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:42.400
But she'll have a long wait!

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:45.700
Maybe one day.

00:01:48.344 --> 00:01:51.600
I have a dream of you there sometimes dressed all nice...

00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:58.840
...and white, in your coffin there. And me all in black looking 
 in on you. And a fella beside me there, comforting me.

00:01:59.072 --> 00:02:01.070
[off] The smell of aftershave off him

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:02.660
His arm around me waist.

00:02:02.694 --> 00:02:04.310
At me FUNERAL?

00:02:04.413 --> 00:02:07.900
At your bloody wake sure, 'tis even sooner.

00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:14.820
But that's just me... the Beauty Queen of Leenane

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.320
[off] Oh aye?

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.990
The Beauty Queen?

00:02:19.041 --> 00:02:22.240
Take a look at yourself.

00:02:25.403 --> 00:02:40.400
[soft piano music]
