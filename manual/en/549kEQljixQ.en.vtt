00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.370
Below by Capybara Games puts you in the shoes
of a tiny warrior taking on a mysterious remote

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.490
island in environments that are randomly generated
per player.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.920
The game is expected to come with a multiplayer
mode and will apparently be high difficulty

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.660
with permanent death.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.890
The player will be introduced into this top-down
perspective with tilt-shift photpgraphy to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.169
make this very unique looking game.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.390
It may not capture your heart as the most
amazing graphic masterpiece but it's certainly

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.590
beautifully artistic.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.570
We haven't seen much from the Kinect yet and
Kinect Sports Rivals was meant to be the killer

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.450
app to get with your Xbox One at launch, unfortunately
it got delayed.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.199
It'll scan up your body and then capture and
mimic your movements in no way ever seen before.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.670
The game will store your data and create you
digitally to play against other players over

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:01.210
and over again.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.070
Quantum Break is a mix of live action videos
and gameplay which will work alongside a tv

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.970
series that will 1) impact the way the show
is by how you play the game and 2) the show

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.720
will help you learn how to play the game.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.150
You'll get yourself some time manipulation
powers which looks pretty nifty.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.120
It's all mean tto be a new entertainment experience
for Xbox One.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:30.100
The Crew is an upcoming racing game set in
an open world recreation of the United States

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.700
apart from unlike real America it'll only
take you 90 minutes to drive coast to coast

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.860
in the game.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.360
With a 20 hour campaign you can choose to
play alone, with friends or with matchmaking.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.080
Like the name suggests you can also form a
crew with other players to compete in races

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.280
and other game modes.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.080
This game got itself delayed until later this
year but it looks like it could be a lot of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.080
fun.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.170
Reports and rumours are pointing towards early
next year for Konami's Metal Gear Solid V:

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.460
Phantom Pain release.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.880
Ground Zeroes is already out giving players
a prelude to the main instalment to the franchise,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.500
a mere glimpse at what is to come.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.729
Players who register Ground Zeroes also get
hold of a DLC that will come for Phantom Pain

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.830
hinting that if you come back early 2015 you
can download it.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.070
Creator Hideo Kojima has revealed a new day
and night cycle running in real-time and a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.209
new game design allowing the player to decide
how the story goes and in which order.

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:29.459
Halo is coming to next gen with Halo 5 but
unfortunately it won't be coming until next

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.430
year despite getting itself a massive reveal
at E3 last June.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.319
The voice actor who plays Master Chief revealed
that players shouldn't expect anything until

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.980
2015 but that an anniversary edition of Halo
2 will be coming so there's something to tide

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.010
you over.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.780
Not much is known about the game so far but
hopefully more news will come soon alongside

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.120
an official release date.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.079
The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt from CD Projekt RED
looks set to be incredible but where ambition

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.590
comes, so does a delay bringing the game in
for a February 2015 release.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.939
Set to be 30 times larger than the previous
Witcher games and with approximately 100 hours

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.620
of gameplay it seems it'll be worth the wait
and the devs say "We believe The Witcher 3

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.379
Wild Hunt will be an exceptional RPG, one
of the best, providing many hours of wonderful

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:20.529
entertainment."

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:25.290
With day and night cycles, realistic AI and
responsive and dynamic environments, the force

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.769
is strong with this one.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.400
Far Cry 4 is set for an E3 June reveal but
so far we only have this little teaser image

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040
and some information worth mentioning.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.739
It has been confirmed that the new game in
the Far Cry franchise will be set in the Himalayas

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.939
and new features will be introduced such as
the chance to saddle up and ride elephants.

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:52.189
We'll have to wait and see what else comes
out but we'll definitely be keeping an eye

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.029
out.

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:59.650
Arkham Knight is the next in the Batman franchise
and this time there's a drivable Batmobile.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.450
The shining beacon of light in Arkham Knight
has to be the integrated driving experience

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.340
of the batmobile said to mirror the movements
of batman himself in order to really get itself

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.659
into the groove.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.300
Batman even has a new look, a suit more armoured
than anything we've seen before so each side

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.940
works together to create new experiences.

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.250
This time round, Gotham is 20x bigger than
that of Arkham Asylum and will create distinct

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.460
areas so you know where you are such as neon
glowing Chinatown.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.570
Your villain Arkham Knight is mysterious.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.169
This trailer should get you wanting more.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.430
Destiny.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.990
From the guys behind the incredible Halo series
comes this game set in a post-apocalpytic

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.460
world seven hundred years from now.

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.639
You'll fight the enemies to take back control
of our solar system and it looks like you're

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:45.819
in for a real treat.

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.889
It's been described as a game that is 'allive'
and events can happen within your game that

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.281
have not been promted by the developer, creating
a ridiculously dynamic experience and one

00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.259
with individuality like no other.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:05:00.330
It's a mash up of genres and it will also
use Bungie's hopper technology which you'll

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.690
know about if you're a halo fan.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.560
It wuill allow better matchmaking so your
coop and competitive multiplayer modes will

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.389
be a very enjoyable time.

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.650

a beta testing phase this summer to get involved

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.300

big launch.
