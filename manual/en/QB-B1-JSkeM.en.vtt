00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.981
- Leading in, we ask the question, "How many
times has this happened to you?"

00:00:05.981 --> 00:00:13.309
You open the incubator only to find nothing
but frustrating blue colonies.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.470
Repeated failed attempts to clone you know
a large fragment puts you weeks behind in

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.470
your research.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.460
- How long does that process take?

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.490
I mean is one attempt meaning weeks behind?

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.530
- So, if you do PCR and you might be able
to do the cloning reaction in the same day

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.230
and then you plate.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.149
Now day two I have a plate of colonies, I'm
picking a colony, I'm doing a mini prep to

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:53.750
identify - this is the fastest way to identify
the positive transformant - I find it; I inoculate

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.730
another culture; end of day two.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.690
Start of day three; day three I will do my
plasmid preparation.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:09.960
Day four I am sending my sample off for sequencing.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.450
So I would propose that in the fastest scenario
you are getting your experimental result in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.820
one week.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:31.100
- You are burning at least a week if it doesn’t
go the way you want?

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.100
- Right, Now…

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.409
- How often does that happen?

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.860
- For a large fragment, for a redo?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350
Is what you're asking?

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.649
I would say it's probably - with our TOPO
technology - it's probably about 50% of the

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.649
time.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.649
- And with others?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.479
- Even more
- So what does the GeneArt solution do to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.560
reduce that?

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:08.030
- So gene synthesis is you type your sequence
onto the computer and send it and if it's

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:18.780
less than 2 kb you get 100% accurate - maybe
optimized if you want it - sequence in basically

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.150
a week.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.819
You don’t have to sequence….

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.879
- Why isn't everybody doing this?

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.900
- So there's two factors, the first is that
scientists are resistant to change.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:40.849
So even though this is an imperfect solution
right now, it's what everybody else does,

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.220
it's what I'm used to.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.879
I'm gonna stick with it.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:52.099
And then, there's the charge; so- the charge
to do gene synthesis, the incremental expense

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.099
over cloning.

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.099
- But how much are we talking about?

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.340
I mean a week of time…

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.319
- So a week of an undergraduates time is almost
zero

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.280
- That’s sad..

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.871
- A week of, you know.

00:03:05.871 --> 00:03:14.170
an industrial bench scientist at Amgen is
significantly more.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:15.170
- OK.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.360
But you didn’t answer…

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.909
So how much more is the synthetic biology
alternative?

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:35.750
- So probably about 500 dollars to get to
a finished cloned sequence with gene synthesis

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.150
and that 350 dollar range with traditional
cloning.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.150
- OK.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.319
So the difference is not 3 of 4 times, it’s
like.. it’s an extra 150 bucks or so?

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:56.590
- If everything goes right, and you strip
labor costs out.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.689
The higher labor costs are associated manual
cloning; so when you push that into the equation,

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:06.150
then they balance out basically.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.580
- OK
- But the labor is always highly debatable.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:20.090
- What is the primary motivation for people
to do, to use gene synthesis, is it the, kind

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.659
of the confidence that I know I’m gonna
get it right, and I’m not gonna end up with,

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:31.650
you know, a 50% chance that my results are
going to be dead when I open the incubator?

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:41.030
- Across the board the acts of the 100% sequence
accuracy and basically freeing up my time

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.440
to go do something else; that's the main crux.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.659
- I see…

00:04:51.659 --> 00:05:02.650
- So this one is... this has to do with the
increasing need through systems biology for

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.500
people to take multiple gene fragments and
assemble them into a single construct.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.411
So the problem that happens with traditional
experiments is you end up you know with a

00:05:13.411 --> 00:05:21.330
crazy sequence of events to try to assemble
one at a time each one of these pieces; that

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.190
I need to get into my construct.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.240
So here we have, you know, basically a whiteboard
with many different enzymes.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.060
- A great way to illustrate the complexity
that everybody has experienced..

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.060
- Right.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.259
SO, you know, people still attempt it, they
say "Okay, yeah, I'm gonna give this a shot.

00:05:41.259 --> 00:05:48.370
It's gonna take a week for me just to try
and do the different assemblies, if everything

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.430
goes right."

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.930
So, we're saying end this sort of craziness
of the complex experiments and then this is

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.240
the gene optimization component.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.800
So you could do everything right and get your
gene into the vector and then you put it into

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.699
a cell and it doesn't express.

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:07.720
So, that’s the…

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.419
- Is that with both techniques?

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.330
- No, this is with traditional cloning.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.839
- So why isn't that the case with gene synthesis?

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:17.740
- Because of gene optimization.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.380
So, this is the example of a human gene being
expressed in a bacterial cell sometimes it

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.380
just won't work.

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.520
It could be toxic, there are a number of different
reasons.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.520
But…

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.940
- Just when you thing you are over the hill!

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:31.320
- Right
- Safe

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.030
- Then you find out it is not going to express.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:40.600
What if there was a way to get the exact sequence
you need with 100% reliability, optimized

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.500
to express in your host system in 5 working
days?

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.500
- Yeah…

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.229
- Would you be interested in that?

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:54.400
- Now you can, with GeneArt Gene Synthesis
and optimization, so then we're basically

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.960
reiterating the points about gene synthesis
gives you freedom from the burden of cloning,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.430
no more screening and disappointing results.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.330
It's 100% accuracy every time.

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.380
Confidence in your results, you don't need
to sequence.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.080
And you have the option to have your sequence
cloned into your vector.

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.569
- Our technology goes beyond just gene synthesis,
goes into this realm of optimization - so

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:24.720
it's proven to increase protein expression
levels.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.990
It does this, one of the ways it does this
is by stabilizing mRNAs, optimizing codon

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.630
usage, etc.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:38.900
- So we have now speed, no longer spend long
hours waiting to get your construct.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:44.180
We have a SuperSPEED production option that
can deliver 1200 base pairs in 5 days, 1800

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.680
in 7 days, and if you're in an emergency situation...

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.350
- What’s an emergency gene?

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:56.759
- So if there's a flu pandemic in the U.S...
emergency genes available on request.
