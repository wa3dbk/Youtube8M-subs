00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.002
 

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:04.071
Dr. Larry Jacobs: The things
that a civil engineering student

00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:06.673
typically likes is they can see
what they’re doing.

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.875
You build something.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.943
This is the structure
that I built.

00:00:09.943 --> 00:00:11.044
This is the bridge that I built.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:12.579
This is the component
that I built.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.214
And you can see it.
You can feel it.

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:15.582
And you feel good about it.

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:16.817
There’s a nice sense
of accomplishment

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.285
associated with that.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:25.459
[music]

00:00:25.459 --> 00:00:27.494
Watkins: Civil engineering
is the people’s engineering.

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:30.030
It’s the engineering branch
where we’re concerned

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.100
with society and making
the infrastructure

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.370
around us work well,
so that people can live

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.372
their lives
in the best possible way.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:41.074
Falak: Civil engineering
is a very general field

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:43.677
of engineering.
We design all large things.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:45.412
But in order to design
large things,

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:48.148
you need to understand
how the small components,

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.018
every single little component
in that system, behaves.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:53.787
Nortey: It’s much more
than just building

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.622
a tall building
or building a bridge.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:57.691
I mean, civil engineering
is really what keeps us

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.027
together as a society.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:01.895
I mean, it’s the framework
for all cities,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:04.064
it’s the framework
for development.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.035
Falak: What makes
the Georgia Tech

00:01:08.035 --> 00:01:10.304
civil engineering program
very unique is, first,

00:01:10.304 --> 00:01:12.272
the faculty members
that we have.

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:16.209
We have experts in basically
every single sub-discipline

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:17.344
of civil engineering.

00:01:17.344 --> 00:01:20.280
The caliber of students
interacting with them

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.083
elevates your research
and elevates your thinking.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:26.520
Bradley: One thing
that has been

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.755
extremely beneficial about
working at Georgia Tech

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.657
is the facilities that we have.

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:33.427
This is a particularly
state of the art facility.

00:01:33.427 --> 00:01:37.064
Even just the magnitude
and scale of it enables tests

00:01:37.064 --> 00:01:39.499
on full-scale specimens,
full-scale projects.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.234
Falak: If you
can dream of a test,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.769
you can run the test here.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.342
Jacobs: The kinds of problems
you’ll solve will be

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:49.509
all over the world.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.313
We send a group of students to—
let’s say, to Africa, to Angola

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.083
that work with a village there
that will be working on how

00:01:56.083 --> 00:01:58.418
to provide clean water
for that particular village.

00:01:58.418 --> 00:02:01.121
Or somewhere in—
let’s say, in Latin America,

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:03.890
in Guatemala, again looking
at how do you provide

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.159
energy efficiency
for this particular village

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.061
to build the electricity
that they need.

00:02:11.365 --> 00:02:14.267
Watkins: There’s science
involved in the analysis

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:17.804
that we do and the decisions
that we make.

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:21.708
But there’s a lot more
that’s involved in it as well:

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.512
public meetings, outreach,
talking to politicians

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.547
so that they’re making
the right decisions.

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:30.050
That’s one of the best parts
about civil engineering

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.787
is that we work
with all kinds of people.

00:02:33.787 --> 00:02:36.890
Nortey: If you are interested
in the betterment

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.860
of your society or, you know,
infrastructure.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.762
If you’re interested
in developing

00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:43.196
better transportation systems

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:46.299
and developing better waste
management systems,

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.769
building more energy
efficient buildings,

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.571
definitely civil engineering
is where you want to go.

00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.039
