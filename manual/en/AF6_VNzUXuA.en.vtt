Hi.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.240
I'm Jeanie Tse, and I'm here to talk to you
about the prognosis or expected outcome for

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.900
people with schizophrenia.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.450
The prognosis is very variable so some people
do very well and some do not do so well.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.179
We know from the international study of schizophrenia
that at least half of people have a favorable

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.010
outcome over time, which is very encouraging
for people who are really struggling with

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.189
the illness initially.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.080
We know too that the course in the first two
years of the illness predicts how the course

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.530
will be over time.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.809
Risk factors for better functioning and better
prognosis in schizophrenia include being female,

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:54.030
having a more sharp onset, so instead of a
long, what we call, prodromal period of deterioration

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.100
of functioning.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.109
If you suddenly develop a lot of paranoia
or hallucinations all at once, that's actually

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.710
a sign for better prognosis in schizophrenia.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.530
So, some of the strengths that can be protective
for people who have schizophrenia include

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.970
having good, what we call, premorbid functioning.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:22.530
So, before you were ill; if you were able
to work, being able to have good relationships,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.210
if you have a higher IQ.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.610
Those kinds of things can be protective.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.420
Having a support network is a very important
strength.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.960
Being able to develop and maintain that support
network is a very important strength that

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.070
bodes well for someone with schizophrenia.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:46.540
We know that people who have schizophrenia
have up to a 25 year earlier mortality compared

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.510
to the general population, which is a frightening
figure, actually.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:02:04.140
That's looking at mortality rates closer to
those in developing countries.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.759
From the media, we would think it'd be due
to the mental illness itself, or to suicide

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:18.040
or violence, but in fact the increased mortality
happens due to heart disease, diabetes, and

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.370
lung disease, just like for the general population.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.320
So, what we know is that people with schizophrenia
and other serious mental illnesses, like bipolar

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.640
disorder and major depression, are more at
risk for developing those illnesses.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.640
There's a lot of reasons for that, including
difficulties with self care, some of the medications

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:43.299
cause weight gain and higher cholesterol,
and a risk for diabetes, not having access

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:51.060
to resources, like healthy foods.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.519
The negative symptoms that make you more likely
to not want to exercise, to not want to be

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.519
active.

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.639
All of those thing contribute to the increased
risk of mortality.

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.780
And there's a high rate of smoking, too, among
people with schizophrenia and a higher rate

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.700
of substance use as well, meaning people try
to self medicate using substances and so those

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.370
present risks to physical health as well leading
to the early mortality.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:26.620
There's estimates that at least 60 percent
of the increased mortality and, what we call,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.500
morbidity or illness burden of schizophrenia
can be treated and prevented, and so working

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.940
with treatment providers and taking care of
yourself are ways of addressing that risk.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.910
The risk of suicide in schizophrenia is serious.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.930
About five percent of people with schizophrenia
do die by suicide and about 20 to 40 percent

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.930
attempt.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.790
So, that's higher than the general population,
still a minority of people with schizophrenia.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:05.720
It does tend to occur among younger people
around their first few episodes.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.010
When, generally, it's the people who were
doing best before they became ill who had

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.410
the most insight into the fact that they've
lost a lot because of the illness, who are

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.500
most at risk for suicide.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.010
It's that sense of despair and hopelessness
when they feel like they cannot achieve the

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.680
goals that they had had for themselves and
have lost their quality of life.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.170
That's the biggest risk for suicide.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.880
And so, that's why that's a sensitive period.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.660
And we really need to support young people
who have schizophrenia, to feel like there's

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:44.320
hope and to get back on track with their goals
and to learn about their illness and what

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.630
they need to self manage their illness.
