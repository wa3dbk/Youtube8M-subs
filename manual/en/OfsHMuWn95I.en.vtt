00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.613
Willie, gather all the elves and meet me
in the Workshop right now. Let's go.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.219
Look, guys...

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.339
...we gotta make as many presents
as we can in the next 10 hours.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.774
Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.014
It's impossible. We just can't build
that many toys in that time.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.694
The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.933
So, what would be the easiest toy
to make? One for boys and one for girls.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.216
- A baseball bat.
- A Hula-Hoop.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.894
Well, baseball bats
and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.134
Charlene, do you think it's possible we
can make enough gifts to meet our quota?

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.292
Baseball bats, lose four seconds, 55...

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.931
Yeah, it is possible.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.257
It is, but, Fred, that's not what
the kids asked for.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.737
Yeah, but all that matters is that each
of the kids get a toy.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.779
That they have something that they can
open when they wake up in the morning.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.774
Most importantly, they all know there's
somebody who's thinking about them.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.573
You guys have never missed
a Christmas before.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.099
If you guys are gonna go out this year...

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.736
...you're gonna go out trying.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.731
Okay. We're on it.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.651
- I've never seen him...
- That's because he's...

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.334
...thrown his back out.
- No.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.695
- Hey, Annette, how you doing?
- Fred.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.495
Nick, I think we're gonna make it. I got
elves in the Workshop making presents.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.855
We're cutting corners,
but I think we can make it.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.057
You'll still be able to save Christmas.
We don't have a lot of time.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.690
That's impossible. The man
can hardly carry his own weight.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.652
I can't move.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.816
I can't, Fred.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.652
You can do it. It's Christmas, come on.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.893
- The kids are out there, counting on us.
- Oh, boy, I wish I could.
