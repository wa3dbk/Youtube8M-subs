00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"Heterocyclic Amines in Eggs, Cheese,
and Creatine Supplements?"

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.559
More than 20 heterocyclic amines
have been reported in cooked meats,

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.750
fish, and poultry prepared under
common household cooking conditions.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.680
To reduce one’s exposure to these
cooked meat carcinogens,

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.869
one could, of course, eat vegetarian—
or, even just refrain from eating meat

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.210
for 24 hours, and the levels of the two
chief heterocyclic amines drop to zero.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.940
So, if you practice meatless Mondays,
by Tuesday morning, the levels of PhIP

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.129
and MeIQx (one of the most potent
mutagens ever tested),

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.829
become N.D. (non-detectable).

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.120
Now, for a third cooked meat
carcinogen, they actually did find some

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.809
in a few folks—even though they
hadn’t eaten meat in 24 hours.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.109
That perplexed the researchers.

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.059
Now, the four subjects that
“had quantifiable amounts of IQ[4,5-b]

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.490
in their urine after refraining
from meat consumption”

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.690
(which is an isomer of a powerful
animal carcinogen, IQ)—

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.340
they had each eaten cheese and/or
boiled eggs as part of their diet,

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670
while abstaining from cooked meats.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.510
IQ and several other
heterocyclic amines

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.260
have been reported in
fried eggs, so it’s possible

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.940
“that IQ[4,5-b], which forms at
temperatures well below 100° C,

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.130
may be present in
boiled eggs

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.930
or possibly other foods containing
creatinine, such as cheese.”

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.470
That brought up an interesting
side note, though.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.270
What about all the “[d]ietary
supplementation of creatine

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.180
by sports enthusiasts” as a supplement,
which turns into creatinine?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.660
They speculate that “high consumption
of creatine” supplements

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.350
“could result in [the] formation of
“genotoxic [heterocyclic amines]”

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.480
in the body”—a cautionary note for both
the vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.420
Another finding of cooked meat
carcinogens in a vegetarian was

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.510
reported in a study comparing the levels
of PhIP growing out in people’s hair.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.910
It “was detected in hair samples of all
six [of the] meat-eaters” they tested,

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.060
“but was…detected in one
out of [the] six vegetarians.”

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.610
Now, it was low, just above the
kind of level of detection,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.670
so they kind of dismissed it, suggesting
that “exposure occurs primarily through

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.670
the consumption of cooked meats or
poultry, and that nonmeat-derived

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.590
sources of exposure…
are probably negligible.”

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.980
But, not if you smoke.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.620
Remember, these carcinogens are
“found in cooked meat, poultry, fish,

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.120
and cigarette smoke.”

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.690
Even if you ate meatless Mondays all
the way through meatless Sundays,

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.800
you can still be exposed,
smoking cigarettes.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.010
Here’s a measure of
PhIP exposure in

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
smoking meat-eaters,
nonsmoking meat-eaters,

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.580
compared to smoking vegetarians,
and nonsmoking vegetarians.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:19.829
So, it’s not enough
to just eat healthy.
