00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.330
SPEAKER: We'll look at Drawing
a Squiral with Iteration.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.810
First we'll review
the iteration pattern.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.570
Here I have three scripts that
use the iteration pattern.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.910
This first one sets the
variable My Note to 60.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.510
Then it repeats 10 times.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.790
And each time it plays the
note My Note for half a beat

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.950
and changes My Note by one.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.660
Let's watch the variable
My Note while we run this.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.540
[NOTES PLAYING]

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.450
So each time through the loop,
it changes the variable My Note

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.400
and also plays My Note.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.370
Here's another example where
we set My Number to 10.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.730
My Number is a variable.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.320
Then we're going to
repeat this time 11 times.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.900
Then we're going to say
My Number, and each time

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.940
will change My Number by negative 1.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.380
So this will count down from 10.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.520
And actually it'll say 10 through 0,
because we're going to repeat 11 times.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.070
Let's watch how my number changes
and see what the cat says.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.530
Two seconds might be a
little longer than we need.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.120
Let's have it play for half a second.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.150
And look how My Number
ends at negative 1.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.540
Because after we say the
last number, which is zero,

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.970
it changes My Number by negative 1.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.170
This next one doesn't look as much like
the iteration pattern, but it also is.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.040
So here, just like I set the
variable My Note, I set the tempo,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.510
and tempo is a provided variable.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.950
Then I repeat.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.980
And here on the bottom I change
the tempo, so that's my variable,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.060
I change the tempo by 20.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.160
In the other examples of
our iteration pattern,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.740
it was easier to see
how we use the variable.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.510
Here we play the note My Note, and
here we said the number My Number.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.470
But here we're going to
play a drum for one beat,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.140
and one beat is determined by the tempo.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.960
So here we're actually
using that variable tempo.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.540
Let's listen.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.820
[DRUM BEATS]

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.910
Cool.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.600
I made a reset script that I
can use to clear the screen.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.800
And I've also made two
scripts that are hidden

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.500
right now to draw a squiral, which
is like a spiral but square-shaped.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.350
Look how size changes
in this first version.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.820
Could you see how it would
get smaller and smaller?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.470
Now I'll clear it again, and now
I'll draw a different version.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.560
Check it out.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.960
Could you tell what was
different about these two?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.610
Let me do the first one again.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.870
Here I started on the outside of the
squiral, and on the second version

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.949
I started on the inside of the squiral.

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:44.740
When you're making the
squiral, you'll need

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.670
to make a decision about which
direction you want to go.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.760
Let's watch one more time and see
how the variable size changes.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.290
So there.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.270
Size kept getting bigger, and size
is how long each of these sides is.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.910
What about the other version?

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.690
Here sides keep getting smaller.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.630
The squiral is another
example where you're

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.430
going to use the iteration pattern.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.140
It'll just be a little bit trickier.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.830
Good luck.
