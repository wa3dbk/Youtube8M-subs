00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.170
Yo, what's up.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.760
Okay, so there's this hot new dance that's
out right now.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.550
It's hilarious but it's (?). I like it.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.540
It's called Gangnam Style, alright?

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.840
So Gangnam Style just from watching it, it's
like they're adding their own style with it

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.810
but they're doing certain dances like you
can do like a smooth dance like...Alright?

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.000
And then you have another one where you can
go- It's fun.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's hilarious.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.660
It's like they're riding a pony or something.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.910
They're like...Like that, alright?

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.229
Then you have the basic one where you can
just go...just slow mo.

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:56.229
Slow mo.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.720
But when you in a groove it's like...It's
like you're playing the drums or something.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.900
You just kind of get in the...

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.900
Alright?

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.550
So, I'm going to show you how to break some
of those down so that when you go in the club

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.932
and you hear that song come on you go Gangnam
Style.

00:01:11.932 --> 00:01:13.369
You're going to be like, "Hey!"

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.369
Alright?

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.369
So here we go.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.570
I'm going to start off with the basic one.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.030
Of course, you know how to do the pony ride
so you're basically just going to hold your

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.530
forearm like this, like you're blocking somebody,
like you're swinging a rope, alright?

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.640
So you're going to just basically do like
this until you get a bounce going.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.530
It's like a walk.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.560
Add like two steps, two steps, two steps,
two steps.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Alright?

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
So it's nothing complicated.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.720
Just something new, alright?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.530
So you've got your forearm here.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.500
You're swinging a rope, alright?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.620
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.620
Alright?

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.210
Another one that's more of a, it's like a
step slide but it's kind of like a groove.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.600
Like you just, like you're doing something
like this.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.780
Boom.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.810
Alright, but the same time you're going- See
how I move my feet?

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.460
Alright, it's kind of weird how I move my
feet.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.120
It's like a step, boom, step, boom.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.050
Step, it's a motion.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.630
It's more of a motion.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.220
Like I said this all comes with understanding
your body and knowing how your body moves.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.500
So like I said once you get a beat you're
just going to hop, step, hop, boom.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.110
It feels like a kind of a wave with it.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.489
So kind of think about where you're coming
from the top to the bottom so you can just...Alright?

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.640
So like I said, you can [put] it different
ways.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.270
You can put your hands behind your back, bring
it forward, bring it up top, do whatever.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.270
Alright?

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.310
So like I said, get creative with it.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.371
And then the other one you're basically going
to go like you're playing the drums.

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:39.420
You're playing the drums from here.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.420
Alright?

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.490
So any way you want but you're going to add
a step, alright?

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.440
So you kind of get like a bounce going.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.440
Boom.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440
Boom.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440
Boom.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.440
Boom.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.440
Boom.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.440
Boom.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.440
Boom.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440
Boom.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.440
Alright?

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.580
So it's kind of like adding like a house dance
with it but you just step, step, step, step,

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.580
step.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.580
Alright?

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.580
So try it out.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.580
Have fun with it.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.280
Do your own thing.
