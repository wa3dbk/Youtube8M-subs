00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.160
Welcome to Recall Roundup.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.830 position:58%
Check to see if you have any of
these recalled products in your home.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.850
Dunecraft is recalling Water Balz,
skulls, orbs and flower toys.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.560 position:61%
When this marble-sized toy is ingested,
it can grow up to 400 times its size.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.990 position:67%
You can see just how large they can become.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.680
These do not show up on an x-ray.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.490
This is a serious ingestion hazard.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:37.950 position:69%
An eight-month-old child swallowed a Water
Balz and suffered an intestinal obstruction.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040
This had to be surgically-removed.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.780
So take these away from children
immediately, contact Dunecraft

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.960
and Dunecraft will send you
a free replacement toy.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.890 position:67%
These high-powered magnet sets sold under
the DynoCube brand name are being recalled.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.790 position:69%
When two or more magnets are swallowed, they
can link together in a child's intestine

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.980
and cause intestinal obstructions,
blockages, sepsis and even death.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.700
These particular ones were
sold on Amazon.com/DynoCube.com

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.000 position:70%
for about $20 as desk sets and novelty items.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.840 position:69%
If you have these, contact the company Reiss
Innovations, that's the importer, right away

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.890 position:61%
and they will give you your money back.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.420
And finally, Enesco is recalling
Shelly's Diner collectibles.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.840 position:59%
The diner's power adapter can overheat

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.910
and that can melt the plastic
housing and that is a fire hazard.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.570
The power adapter lights the
exterior lights of this diner.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.190 position:70%
Shelly's Diner was sold as part of Department
56 Original Snow Village for about $120.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.600 position:59%
So if you have this there are certain
date codes involved that you will need

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.250 position:70%
to check for, but you want to contact Enesco.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.310 position:59%
You will either get a free replacement
adapter or you can get a full refund.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.010 position:72%
