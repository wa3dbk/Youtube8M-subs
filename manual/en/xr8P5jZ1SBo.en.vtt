00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.080
You still don't believe me?

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.540
During the fire...

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:11.660
Twist the right part continuously...

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.780
Until the left part tightens

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.100
The right part will loosen

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.700
How did I loosen the rope?

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.560
I taught you...

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.320
It's because I already knew

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.660
You already taught me when we we're children...

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.180
So we can escape from father

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.380
Go... faster...

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.900
There you go!

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.420
I did it!

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.320
Now you remember?

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.000
You're JR?

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.260
You're JR?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.500
You believe me now?

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.640
Because you left in my heart an anger too deep...

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.960
And not just here...

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.260
You ruined my whole being...

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.180
And I've asked myself again and again how much I am worth

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.360
Because that's what you left me Gael

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.780
That whenever someone leaves me

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.800
I don't know my worth anymore
