Hi, my name is Glen.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.470
I'd like to take a couple minutes here and
demonstrate some of the features of our pin

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.900
registration system.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.490
We call this registration system the SSR Simple
or the Simple Registration System.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.390
It's very easy to use and it's adaptable to
pretty much any kind of frame you want to

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.390
use.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.480
You can put this micro-pin system on wooden
frames, you can put them on the Newman Roller

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.690
frames and you can also put them on the aluminum
frames.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.480
What I'd like to do is give you a brief idea
of how this system works.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.740
So basically what we're going to do is we're
going to pre-align the artwork onto the screen

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.981
in the prepress area so that everything is
already in a registration system so that when

00:00:55.981 --> 00:00:58.370
we take it out to the press everything is
already lined up.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.270
How we do that is, first of all we have these
pin bars.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.330
These pin bars actually mount to the bottom
of your screen whether you use a wooden screen

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.800
or an aluminum screen or a Newman Roller frame.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.740
These will actually attach to the bottom of
the screen.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.080
I've got a couple of screens here and I'm
going to show you that the pin bars have been

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.950
attached by three screws to the bottom of
the screen.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.990
You can actually order these bars already
pre-mounted to the frames if you'd like, or

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.000
you can mount them yourself.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.570
It's very easy to do.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.600
What's nice about this system here is, if
you can zoom in a little bit, you'll notice

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.210
there's a hole and a slot on the bottom of
the pin bar.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.330
This slot and this hole will actually attach
themselves to the pins that are located on

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.540
the bottom of the registration system.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.270
So basically when I take this screen here,
stand in front of the registration system,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.510
slide it over and it will literally just pop
into the pin and into the slot allowing me

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.409
to position the artwork exactly where I want
it on the screen.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.440
I'm going to do that real quick for you.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.170
After the screen has been coated you want
to take the artwork.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.719
Here I have one of the designs we're actually
going to be using later on in our demonstration.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.430
Now on the artwork we have the registration
marks in all four corners.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.790
Now what I have basically done is stuck a
little bit of tape or double sided tape to

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.060
the back side of my design.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.769
One of the features of the SSR is that this
backboard is vacuumized.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.980
It has a foot pedal down here, and when I
press on this foot pedal these vacuum holes

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.560
that are mounted on the board will literally
suck the artwork, securing it to the backboard.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.870
I'm going to do that right now.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.340
So I'm going to position my registration marks
exactly in perfect alignment with how you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.209
line up on this grid pattern here.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.670
I'm going to press of the vacuum pedal now.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.650
It takes a second or two for the vacuum to
engage, but now you can see that artwork is

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.709
held there, literally with no tape, just being
sucked by the vacuum.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.340
Now I can take my silkscreen frame with my
pin marks mounted onto it, and all I need

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.780
to do is stand in front of the system, pop
the pin into the slot that you see down here

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:33.540
and you basically touch the artwork where
my tape was applied, and then you can release

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.019
the vacuum.

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.140
Now at this time this artwork is actually
stuck, mounted to the back of the screen.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.220
I can remove it here and you can see the artwork
is attached exactly where I want it to be

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.469
using the registration system like you see
here.

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:55.659
At this point all I need to do is put it inside
my exposure unit and expose it.

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.090
That's another nice feature about this system;
you don't need a second attachment that goes

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.089
into your exposure unit like a lot of other
systems out there.

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:08.220
You just basically put it into any exposure
system you have and expose the screen.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.790
Once the screen is exposed you wash it out
and repeat the steps again for each color

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:16.790
you might have.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.729
If there's a second color, you line it up
to the second color marks.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:24.379
One of the things that I like to do is I like
to use a little bit of a dry erase marker

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:28.660
and circle the location of where I have put
that artwork previously.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.260
So when I do use the second color, I can position
the second color exactly where that first

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.400
color was.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.330
Now, as all registration systems work, they're
only as good as the operator.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.290
So if you wear glasses, put your glasses on.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.340
If you have a little headset that will help
you focus better on the location, do use it!

00:04:47.340 --> 00:05:07.940
The more accurate you are in here, the more
accurate you will be out there.
