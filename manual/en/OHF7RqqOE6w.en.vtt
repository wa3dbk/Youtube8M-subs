00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.060
Space.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.640
The final frontier.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.320
For some 60 years now we've been skimming
the stars and sending robots and astronauts

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.600
up into orbit and beyond.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.860
But we've always used rockets.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.359
And they're rubbish!

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.050
Eye wateringly expensive, almost always wasted
after one shot, dangerous, unreliable, polluting,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.619
and because it takes a lot of fuel to get
into space and more fuel to get that fuel

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.130
into space, really inefficient.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.250
Surely, there must be a better way.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.260
Well, actually, there are several.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.670
Here's our top five ways of getting into space
they actually tried...

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.350
5.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.030
Skylon

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.920
Skylon is far more than just a CGI dream.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.380
It's actually pretty close to flying.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.630
This vast, thunderbird esque plane is a rocket
jet hybrid.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.270
It takes off like a normal plane, flies into
space, delivers a cargo of up to 11 tonnes

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.400
to the ISS or other stations, then flies home
to land, refuel and take off again.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.240
The secret to Skylon is the sabre engine.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.659
Most planes have big heavy engines which operate
at limited power to control their temperature.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240
Skylon doesn't.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.520
An innovative cooling system in the nose freezes
air from 1000C down to -150C where it is burned

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.080
with an onboard hydrogen fuel, allowing the
engine to be lighter and run at far higher

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.470
loads, accelerating to 5.4 times the speed
of sound at 16 miles high.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.340
Once there, it shuts off the now very thin
exterior air supply and uses onboard oxygen

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.070
to rocket the plane into orbit.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.860
If it works, It'll be seriously cheap to mass
produce, cheap to run, very efficient (it'll

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.259
use less than a fifth of the fuel of a comparable
rocket), won't require much in the way of

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.409
infrastructure - because it can just use airports
- and should be very reliable.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.729
And it's being built.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.090
The engine precooler, by far the most difficult
part of the engineering project, works and

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.200
has been signed off by the ESA, freeing up
millions of pounds in European and British

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.920
funding.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.149
Millions isn't nearly enough, though.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.459
If they get the probably billions they need,
Skylon could be flying within just a few years,

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.064
offering cheap, regular,reliable flights for
tonnes of cargo and up to 30 passengers into

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:15.064
orbit.

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:16.064
4.

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:17.064
Lightcraft

00:02:17.064 --> 00:02:18.064
To get into space you need thrust.

00:02:18.064 --> 00:02:21.400
But what if you had a way of beaming thrust
from the ground rather than creating it from

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.189
fuel carried on board?

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.750
A much lighter and therefore cheaper and more
efficient ship.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.780
That's what.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.819
Lightcraft have a special mirror on their
underside which focusses laser light beamed

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.540
from the ground to a point in the air directly
beneath the craft.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.319
Their air is heated to 50,000C, ten times
hotter than the surface of the sun.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.349
The air explodes, and the shockwave pushes
the ship up.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.900
All the way back in 2000, a group of private
and government bodies used a 10 kilowatt laser

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.390
to lift a 1.8 oz ship 233 feet off the ground.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.590
It's estimated that with a 100 megawatt laser
and a 1.4m mirror, supply and satellite payloads

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:08.750
of up to 100kg could be sent rapidly and very
cheaply to the ISS and other platforms.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.930
3.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.310
Space Elevator

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.459
Most of the problem with getting things into
space is that it takes loads of fuel.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.180
Partly because a rocket needs to be going
really fast to escape the Earth's gravitational

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.780
pull, partly because fuel is heavy and needs
even more fuel to lift it up.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.950
So how about a system that actually gets you
into space very slowly, and picks up all its

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.280
fuel en route?

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.340
Enter the space elevator.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.140
Which does exactly what it says on the tin.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.170
A cable, up into an orbital platform, upon
which ships and satellites can be lifted and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.609
sent off on their way using only the tiniest
amounts of fuel.

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.459
Either the cable can be electrified to provide
power, or it can be transmitted from the ground

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.590
via lasers, which overcomes several engineering
problems.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.069
There are some problems though.

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.319
To work, the cable would have to stay in the
same position over Earth.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.749
That means that the end platform has to be
above geostationary orbit- some 36,000 km

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:05.209
from Earth.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.730
Then, to make sure the lift car doesn't bring
the whole system crashing down with it's weight,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.650
the cable has to extend further - twice as
far - to act as a counterweight at the other

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.650
end.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:16.650
That's over 70,000km of cable.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.650
You could use a large counterweight closer
to the orbit, but it would have to be huge

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.650
- we're talking either capturing an asteroid,
building a VERY big space station, or collecting

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.650
the first cars that ascend the structure.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.650
But the main problem is that cable.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.990
At least 36,000km of it, which has to be strong
enough to take its own weight and the force

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.400
of the counterweight, car and cargo, and flexible
enough to withstand weather conditions en

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.400
route.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.400
That's no mean feat.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.020
In fact, until recently, there were NO materials
on Earth which fitted the bill.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.949
Carbon nanotubes show promise, being extremely
light, strong and flexible - but as yet no

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.680
one can produce them in nearly long enough
strands to even test the theory.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.310
The system has its champions though, Japan
holds regular space elevator competitions

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.580
and has pledged to be a leader in any scheme.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.970
2.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.770
Project Orion

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.230
To space on nuclear bombs!

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.370
Sounds like dodgy 1950s science fiction?

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.890
Well check this out.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.101
The department of energy tried it.

00:05:04.101 --> 00:05:07.120
It was called project Orion.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.699
The idea was simple, a ship dropped a bomb
behind it, the bomb exploded, and the ship

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.940
rode the shockwave, potentially reaching speeds
that would put Saturn, and possibly even Neptune,

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.009
Pluto and beyond, within easy reach of astronauts.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.669
The theory was sound, as you can see from
these early tests, which used conventional

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:25.900
explosives.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.840
The real thing would have been vast, several
times the size of a Saturn V rocket for a

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.440
long trip and weighing up to 10,000 tonnes.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.910
800 bombs weighing anything from hundreds
to thousands of tonnes would heft the craft

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.650
into orbit, but that created a problem.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.120
A lot of bombs equals a lot of risks.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.800
If you want to avoid killing a lot of people,
you have to make sure it's safe, and a long

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.419
way from humanity.

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.170
Having said that, each launch would be, relatively,
not much more polluting than single early

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.830
nuclear bomb tests.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.570
The most incredible thing, though, is that
it could have been built.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.680
Keen for more funding from the military, the
team behind Orion designed a missile armed,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.190
bomb powered battleship and presented it to
the Air Force, who eventually bought into

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.190
the idea.

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.520
Fairly quickly, though, the US Government
decided there was no military purpose for

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.290
the Orion battleship, that they actually had
no need for any spacecraft so large and powerful,

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:26.280
and that it would put an unecessary strain
on nuclear relations with Russia.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.660
The project was pretty much dead in the water
when nuclear space propulsion was eventually

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:40.750
banned by the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963,
putting an official end to Orion's dreams.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.750
1.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.750
Aclubierre Drive

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.180
This one is ambitious.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.180
Really ambitious.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.220
We're talking warp drive.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.550
The idea is that you can cheat Einstein's
Theory of relativity by creating a sort of

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.389
space time pressure dip in front of a spacecraft,
and a wave behind it, pushing the craft along

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.449
in a bubble in the middle at speeds which,
to us mortals, appears faster than light.

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:05.509
Mathematically, it works.

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:06.509
Mathematically.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.789
It's also pretty efficient.

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:11.099
Initially, the amount of energy required to
form a bubble that could transport a ship

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:16.800
accross the milky way would have been greater
than in all the observable universe combined.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.129
Which was a problem.

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.697
Later calculations and streamlining got that
down to less than three solar masses to move

00:07:20.697 --> 00:07:21.697
a few small atoms.

00:07:21.697 --> 00:07:22.697
More streamlining, and the journey could be
done with a Jupiter's worth of energy.

00:07:22.697 --> 00:07:24.340
The latest calculations by Nasa's Professor
Harold White suggest that a Voyager -1 sized

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.340
spacecraft could suffice.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.979
Interesting, but so far, purely theoretical,
right?

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:29.330
Well, not quite.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.360
Professor White has, with support from Nasa,
been trying to warp time in the lab and prove

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.409
that it can be done.

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:40.440
They are using a device called the Michelson-Morley
interferometer, which measures space time.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.990
If one of the legs of the sensor appear even
very slightly longer than the other, that's

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:49.069
proof that the system works, and that the
drive is possible.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:53.030
Once you've got that, scaling up is *relatively*
easy.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:58.140
Of course, even if we could build a ship,
trying to start, steer and most importantly

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:03.280
stop something that exists as a bubble within
known reality would be quite tricky.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:04.939
But I'd give it a go.
