00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:12.650
Fishing the Alabama Rig

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.060
Hey I'm Bass Master pro Jimmy Mason and I
want to talk to you today about one of the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.320
hottest techniques out there. You've been
hearing a lot about the Alabama Rig lately.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.410
It's a really neat deal. I've been throwing
it since, probably about June of this year

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.579
which is about 4-5 months kind of before it
came out nationally and got real well known.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.559
It's been a lot of experimenting and a lot
of fun trying to figure this out. It's turned

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.769
into an awesome fish catcher.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.100
This one right here I've got rigged with Yum
Mud Minnows. These are actually almost like

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.760
sassy shads. There fairly small, I use this
a lot when the bait is small and when you

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.350
kind of match the hatch size. I rig this usually
with a 1/8 oz. to a ¼ oz. swimbait heads.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.199
Most of the time I'm using Buckeye Lures,
J-woolhead, sometimes I will use one a little

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.020
bit smaller but I always want to throw these
with a really stout hook. Most of the time

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.890
you are throwing this on 65-80 lb. Vicious
braid so you want to have a stronger hook

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.390
not your typical shaky heads solid jig even
though these are 1/8 to ¼ oz. you must have

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.950
a strong hook in it. Because when you set
back with that heavy braid, a weaker hook

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.710
is going to flex and you're going to lose
a lot of fish so that's one of the most important

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.899
parts of the rig is to make sure you've got
a heavy hook.

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:41.820
The other baits that I throw are the yum muddy
minnows, the 3 ½ or the 5 inch. What I have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.319
found in using this is when I'm fishing real
deep, deep water, deep structure; the hollow

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.909
belly baits work a little better. The 5 inch
muddy minnow when I'm fishing deep structure

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.569
of the ledges on Pickwick, the ledges on Guntersville,
I'm going to use this bigger bait. But when

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.380
I fish in the grass, for whatever reason,
it's real weird; I seem to get more bites

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.530
on the solid plastic like this mud minnow.
I don't know if it's just in my head but I've

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.860
seen it happen more and more and time and
time again so it's something I have a lot

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.671
of confidence in doing is changing up. But
this is the Alabama Rig, play with it; it's

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.830
something that's going to be real exciting
over the next year seeing all of the different

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.550
baits and the ways people adapt to fishing
this. And this is definitely a bait you can

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.610
use your imagination and keep an open mind
when you are throwing and putting a lot of

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.030
different baits on it.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.340
Equipment wise, when I'm throwing this, you
want to use a long rod. The 2 rods I use depending

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.569
on how heavy of jig heads I'm using is either
a 764 Dobyns light flipping stick or a 795

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.790
Dobyns Swimbait Rod. If I'm using over a ¼
oz. heads on this, then I'm going to go with

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.250
the swimbait rod. That will handle up to a
4 oz. swimbait and it's going to work you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.100
all day throwing this. By the time you get
it all loaded up with those heads, you're

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.650
talking about a 3 ½ to a 4 ½ oz. bait, this
whole rig so you definitely need that longer

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.280
rod with kind of some give in the mid-section
where you can lob it out there and just fish

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.950
it slow and play with the retrieve. One thing
that I found is that some days they want it

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.030
where you reel it real fast and kill it off
the bottom than let it fall back to the bottom

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.920
and reel it real fast and kill it again. Other
days they want just a slow steady retrieve

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.739
almost like you're slow rolling a big spinnerbait.
It's one of those deals if you're not getting

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.879
the bite you expect, kind of vary the retrieve
and experiment and you will find what they

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.349
do want that day.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.159
Good luck with it!
