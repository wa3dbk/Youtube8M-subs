Hi, this is Dow at Fire House Detail Shop.
Today we're teaching you how to detail your

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.290
boat like a professional. Now, an important
part is your trailer. We talked about cleaning

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.830
the wheels and tires on today's boat, and
these wheels are so fancy, you'd think we're

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.130
on a high performance car. But, what we're
going to do is, with chrome wheels, which

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.500
is coming on so many boats, you want to make
sure that these are protected. Any wheel is

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.929
going in and out of the water, it can sit
there sometime, they're submerged. And, water's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.680
difficult on metal, and creates rust. So,
what we're going to do is not only keep it

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.899
very clean. We're going to wax it up, put
a protective coat on it. So, we're going to

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.989
get an applicator pad. This is basically a
piece of sponge with terry cloth over it.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.001
And, we're just going to work wax all over
this wheel, and you can see. I'm going to

00:00:48.001 --> 00:00:53.969
go in the nooks and crannies. We're just going
to get that thing all waxed up. Just like

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.520
you would with your wax and part of your vehicle.
Just, you don't need a lot of wax, but you

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.100
want to make sure it's on there. And after
that's had a chance to sit on there, and you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.250
get the whole wheel, you come back with a
micro-fiber towel and you bump that right

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.610
off. "Nothing's" going to make the wheel look
better, but more importantly, you're really

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.550
protecting your chrome, and the wheel from
the harsh conditions of a boat going in and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.310
out of the water, as frequently as it does.
So, that's going how, that's going to be how

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.340
you protect that chrome. You can see how that
just comes right to life, as we polish it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.130
up there, with that micro-fiber towel. Now,
micro-fiber towels are easily available. Of

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.120
course, what you have at home, cotton, will
work. But, be careful not to use a towel that

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.340
has metal, you know, an old golf towel with
a metal grommet or something. Anywhere on

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.190
your boat, or your vehicles, because they
can cause scratching, and make sure you always

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.630
work with a clean towel. If you drop it on
the ground, go get another one. Make sure

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.260
they're washed. And you want to have plenty
of towels around, when you're doing any work

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.330
or detail, detailing to your vehicle or your
boat, because it's one of the key tools to

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.290
make it look good. The other thing we're going
to do to protect this, this rubber on this

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.860
tire, and mostly to make it look beautiful,
is we're going to put a silicone dressing

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.970
on it. Silicone and rubber are best friends.
Silicone keeps the rubber soft, makes it look

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.640
good. So, you can see, as we come around this
tire, when we've finished it, the difference

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.810
between the dressing side, the non-dressing
side, where we polished the chrome and protected

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.250
it, and where we haven't yet. And, that just
makes it pop, it makes it look great. And,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.200
with the kind of investment most of us have
in boats, we want to make sure they look great,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.310
and they perform to their maximum capacity.
