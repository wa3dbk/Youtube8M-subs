00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.467
I'm so excited that you're back to join us!

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.219
We're here in Hawaii -

00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:10.962
right in the middle of the Ring of Fire -
and ready to learn!

00:00:10.962 --> 00:00:11.950
Ms. Twinkle!

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.878
That mountain is on fire!

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:16.366
That mountain is actually a volcano.

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.725
What's a volcano?

00:00:17.725 --> 00:00:21.004
A volcano is an opening in the Earth's crust

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:25.340
from which molten lava, rocks, ashes, dust, and gases

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.543
are released onto Earth's surface through eruptions.

00:00:28.543 --> 00:00:30.180
Why do volcanoes erupt?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.133
Great question!

00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:32.664
Come on class.

00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.652
This one's due to erupt soon!

00:00:37.405 --> 00:00:40.970
Deep below the surface of the Earth

00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:43.784
where rocks will melt as heat will rise.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:47.091
The mantle flows and churns -

00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:50.362
Earth's layer of largest size!

00:00:50.362 --> 00:00:54.361
Riding on this lake of magma

00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:57.431
float the plates that make Earth's crust.

00:00:57.431 --> 00:01:01.342
These plates of land fit snug together,

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.691
moving when they must.

00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:04.878
What happens when they move?

00:01:04.878 --> 00:01:07.308
The pressure is so strong that a 
plate of Earth's crust moving

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:09.662
a few inches can cause a huge release of energy!

00:01:09.662 --> 00:01:10.830
So along the edge of each plate

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.472
are areas prone to major geological events -
like earthquakes and volcanoes!

00:01:14.472 --> 00:01:16.136
That's why it's a 'RING' of fire!

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:17.980
It's the edges of a very large plate!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.819
It's the Ring of Fire!

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:23.779
Circling the Pacific!

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:25.122
Following the land!

00:01:25.122 --> 00:01:28.786
It's the Ring of Fire!

00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:30.259
The most active zone

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.794
yet known to man!

00:01:31.794 --> 00:01:33.113
What about Hawaii?

00:01:33.113 --> 00:01:35.663
Hawaii is in the center of the plate lined by 
the Ring of Fire,

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:38.351
so it's usually included as a part of the Ring of Fire.

00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:41.528
Regardless, Hawaii's volcanoes 
still work the same way!

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.197
When the mantle's magma boils,

00:01:45.197 --> 00:01:48.475
the pressure builds so high, at last

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.912
it squeezes up between the plates

00:01:51.912 --> 00:01:54.592
which makes volcanoes blast!

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.424
Volcanoes are scary!

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:57.883
They can be.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:01.284
But volcanoes make new land and 
relieve pressure from deep inside the Earth!

00:02:01.284 --> 00:02:03.550
If we plan for and respect the might of nature -

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.562
we can observe and appreciate 
just how amazingly it works!

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:12.873
It's the Ring of Fire!

00:02:12.873 --> 00:02:14.761
Circling the Pacific!

00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:16.217
Following the land!

00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:19.993
It's the Ring of Fire!

00:02:19.993 --> 00:02:21.378
The most active zone

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:23.198
yet known to man!

00:02:26.306 --> 00:02:27.497
Look over there, class!

00:02:27.497 --> 00:02:30.289
After magma comes to the surface, we call it lava.

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:32.273
Do you see the lava coming out of the vents?

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:34.926
Is everyone wearing their goggles and safety equipment?

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:35.910
Alright then!

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.094
This volcano is about to erupt!

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:38.096
