-Hi, guys.

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.140
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.949
Today Brooklyn's
helping me out and we're

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.240
going to show you guys how
to do a hairstyle that we're

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.682
calling the Viking braid.

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.140
Now the good thing
about this braid

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.040
is it's just a really simple
braid into a ponytail,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.500
but you can kind of lean in
more towards a Viking warrior

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.020
princess or you can lean it more
towards the Boho side, which

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.075
is very fun when it
comes to one hairstyle,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.449
because it really
can go either way,

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.490
depending on what you're
wearing-- which is cool.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.037
Now to begin, we're
using second day curls,

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:50.370
so we're just using the curls
she had in from yesterday.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.130
I've taken her hair pretty
much from the temple over

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.380
and flipped it to
the side and then

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.000
I pulled out just
one little piece

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.760
that we're going to leave
for softness around her face.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.520
I'm going to go
right here by her ear

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.410
and pick up a section
of hair, and I'm

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.580
going to begin a Dutch braid.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.650
So we're just going to
do a regular Dutch braid

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.040
and we are going
to add in pieces

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.123
on the top and the bottom.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.530
And it's just a very true
Dutch braid right through here.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.120
This would be simple to do on
yourself since it right here,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.480
working on the side of
your head so you can still

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.540
see what you're doing in a
mirror, anything like that.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.240
And as we're going
back we're just

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.020
following kind of
the natural hairline,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.750
so we're going at a
slight downward angle

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.110
and we're just still picking
up hair on both sides.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.950
And we're going to go back.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.750
I'm going to probably have
five or six braid sections

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.120
before I'm finished with this.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.550
And when you get
done with this part,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.160
and I'm just going to finish
up with a normal three-strand

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.460
braid at the bottom.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.389
Now before I get
too far down, I'm

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.040
going to go back and pull and
pancake this hair while I still

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.574
have loose ends.

00:02:14.574 --> 00:02:16.490
You could braid it all
the way down and do it,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.340
but it's harder to pull the hair
all the way up at the top then.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.010
So I'm going to go
back and do it now.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.520
You can see I'm just
grabbing the outside edges

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.559
and pancaking the braid.

00:02:32.187 --> 00:02:35.740
When I get to the
bottom I'm going

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.770
to still leave probably a good
three, four inches at the end.

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:44.660
And then I'm going
to go back and just

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.830
pancake this part, too.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.070
And then you can secure
the ends with an elastic.

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.780
I still like to leave some ends
hanging out because it's just

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.140
a little more natural look,
it's not quite so structured,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.550
which I think comes off
feeling a little more Boho

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.610
or also like a Viking
warrior would wear it,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.746
a little more loose.

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:21.305
You can go back and tweak
anything that you want.

00:03:21.305 --> 00:03:23.820
Make sure it's all pancaked
really nice and full.

00:03:28.161 --> 00:03:28.660
OK.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.790
And then you've got
your braid all set.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.730
Now with the rest
of the hair you're

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.535
going to take it and flip
it so it's straight back.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.760
I'm going to flip
part of her hair

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.064
forward just right here
in the front section

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.980
and then I'm going to
take these back sections

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.146
and I'm just going to add
just a little bit of tease

00:03:54.146 --> 00:03:56.540
to her hair just to
add some fullness

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.810
on the top and some volume.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.290
You can skip this step if
you don't want to tease.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.140
That's fine, too.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.440
If you're teasing,
not ratting your hair,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.985
it shouldn't be too
hard to comb out.

00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:24.300
Then I'm going to flip
the whole thing back over

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.510
and really just pull it into
a very unstructured ponytail.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.110
I am going to pull just
another piece of hair

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.825
out on this side to match
the one on the other side.

00:04:38.825 --> 00:04:41.740
So I'm just gathering
up the rest, really just

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.290
even finger combing it
all into a ponytail.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.990
I'm going to do it sort of
like right below the crown.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.560
The only trick here
is that you just

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.730
want to make sure you have some
hair covering up that part line

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:57.815
where the braid is.

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:01.272
And when you kind of get your
hair placed where you want it,

00:05:01.272 --> 00:05:04.110
pull it to soften it a little.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.200
Then you're going to add the
braid in so you just reach

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.410
and grab that, too,
and then you can

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.234
take an elastic like this
one and go ahead and secure

00:05:14.234 --> 00:05:14.900
the whole thing.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.150
OK.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.770
Now at this point
you can pull and tug

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.072
and tweak to your content.

00:05:31.072 --> 00:05:33.530
So if you want it really soft,
this is where you'd do that.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.267
If you want it really tight and
slick you can do that, as well.

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:38.350
I'm just gong to make sure
that's tight and secure

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:39.880
on her head.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.380
So again, you just
want to make sure

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.620
that you have hair that
covers the part line.

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.840
You can even kind of
reach down and tuck it

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.240
underneath this brad and pancake
it just a little bit more

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.670
so it's on top of
that part line.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.667
We really want the braid to pop.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:56.750
And then what I'm going
to do to finish it all off

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.620
and to cover our not so pretty
elastic is take a piece of hair

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.910
from underneath and just take
it and wrap it up and over,

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.000
around and around, until
that hair completely

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.840
covers the ponytail holder.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.440
Than take a bobby pin and
go ahead and just bobby

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.395
pin that end piece
up so it's hidden.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.760
And there you've got your
elastic all nicely hidden.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.650
And this is what's fun
about this braid is

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.440
it's just-- it kind of looks
like a normal hairstyle

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.710
from the front, then
you turn it to the side

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.030
and it's this fun
accent braid just

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.610
running through the
ponytail that really pops.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.660
But it adds a lot of dynamic
to the hairstyle, which I love.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.200
Let's do the final spin.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.120
So we have this kapow
factor with the braid,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.360
and then it just becomes a
memorable looking ponytail

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.130
on the other side,
which is so fun.

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:01.010
And guess what's going
on over at Brooklyn

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.230
and Bailey's channel.

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:06.097

-You can pull as much or
as little as you like.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.135
I really want to
overemphasize the top braid

00:07:44.135 --> 00:07:46.760
so I'm just trying to make sure
that they're really pulled out.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:56.730
-Are you checking your phone?

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:00.704
Hey, are you
checking your phone?

00:08:00.704 --> 00:08:01.678
-Yeah.

00:08:01.678 --> 00:08:03.140
Texting warms my hands.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.730
-Texting warms your hands?
