Ciao everyone here it's Marchettino,

00:00:02.034 --> 00:00:06.120
today I'm at Lamborghini miami and since the guys of the dealership

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.295
have been kind enough to give me access to all their cars,

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:13.380
today I wanna take you for a tour around this gorgeous Lamborghini Aventador.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.980
What you see here is a 2015 Lamborghini Aventador 50th Anniversary Roadster

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.680
Finished " Rosso Efesto " with black wheels,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.220
allow me to say that this is one of the most beautiful Aventadors that I've ever seen!

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.340
As you can see through here, this car is a limited edition.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.160
Just 100 of these have been produced but as you can see this car is not stock,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.320
it has several modifications made by the german tuner Novitec Rosso

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.860
As if it wasn't mean looking enough,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.360
the modifications include many components made in carbon fibre such as the side skirts

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.000
and a massive rear wing that generates even more downforce.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.820
The factory wheels have been replaced with a set of custom 21 inch ADV.1 wheels

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.920
whose design reminds us the wheels of the Reventon.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.420
Here's the key, let's open it!

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.320
Hey it's Miami, let's remove the roof!

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.640
The roof is composed by two manually removable carbon fibre pieces

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.020
that get stored in the trunk. Let's start the procedure!

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:09.607
As the roof drops, the sun finally shines and enhances the shade of the paint

00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:12.387
and the thickness of the carbon fibre all around the car.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.220
Just amazing and now let's take a look at the interior of the Aventador!

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.320
The owner has opted for a black interior with a red Q-Citura rhombus style stitching

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.220
that makes a lovely contrast.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.260
The central console separates the cockpit in two sections. Perhaps too many buttons to play with.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.040
One thing that I've noticed is that inside the Aventador there's not room or pockets to keep your stuff!

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.360
Also the button to open the engine bay is unpractical

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.490
but honestly, you cannot complain with a view like this.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.980
So here's the magnificent engine bay of the Aventador 50th Anniversary, full of carbon fibre.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.600
There it is, the 6.5L V12 engine that produces 720hp.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:17.020
The modifications of Novitec Rosso include also a new exhaust, so let's go and fire it up!

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.360
I'm not sure whether the camera can give you a proper idea of the paint but seriously,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.120
this is one of the best looking Aventadors that I've ever seen!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.180
Once again, what a truly epic looking Aventador!

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.540
I wanna say thanks to Lamborghini Miami for making this possible.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.580
