00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.689
are the kids anything communal

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.759
during beer pong did you bring one ok

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.889
won't be penal

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.889
wipe that smile days lol on what the
flick

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.270
I'm Christie this is Alonzo just the two
of us today

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.029
we're gonna move shit whether my I set
it on fire

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.430
i know i RUV you care this is a remake
well get those days based on a Stephen

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.269
King but but it's raining at the
department pretty much yeah

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.150
and back to the Lawrence the Coen who
wrote the home aversion to take a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.460
screenwriter credit with

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.660
I Roberto aguirre-sacasa who but yet
maybe work on Big Love &amp;

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.530
he's written Fergie and when I think
he's doing that Archie comics zombie

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.940
thing that right now

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.649
are but yeah you know you could pretty
much if you're trying to a blind taste

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.860
test you two screenplays

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.570
apart from some references to YouTube in
homeschooling this is pretty much

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.579
the same movie check it out the plywood

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.180
needed any on cut you

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:04.479
Taupin

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.610
good

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.189
it is also it Tim Tebow joke in there
alright

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.939
texting yes and there's an important
plot point where

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.189
in the tampon throwing seen the au jus
ridicule her

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.360
they take it on their patients IPO in
the post on YouTube yeah I'm

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.820
this same movie a lotta ways for better
for worse

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.470
it's really really say and and

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.009
fateful to the original needs goes back
shed at the end

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.920
yeah I mean I it we're yeah it's not as
good as anything wrong as much as does

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:39.979
it need to exist

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.060
you know I don't feel like it departs
enough for material

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.750
I don't feel like Emily Pearce brought
enough to win I thought okay well

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.270
are interesting woman director very much
like a queer feminist director

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.509
maybe she'll have some sorta take on the
gender issues or something because you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.090
certainly

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.640
there are people that they're accused
the Palmer being kinda the massages

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.350
but not really that I could tell me but
the big difference for me I think was

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.750
that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.149
Chloe grace Moretz as Carey are kinda
rebels in the fact that she discovers

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.709
her telekinetic powers where's

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.180
says he's basically seem kinda put off
by suicide horrified

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.270
by her own power yeah rightly choosing
to dig in cannabis practicing and you

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.660
know

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.090
good it's almost like she's a WordPress
a one-man x-men you know she's gonna be

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.920
helping her

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.340
herders spearsville I was gonna ask if
that was actually pondering this morning

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.680
while planning on making the game a to
come into and out fast

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.739
you guys honoree Kimberly pierced yeah
here and I was thinking about

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.290
did she bring any different sensibility
to it as a queer filmmaker she possibly

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.420
understand

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.980
liked the office is a shiner being
different

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.489
somehow I mean I don't know that she
does it not that had nothing to do with

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.989
them believing manifest in the film and
I think that the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.209
the the novel and the depalma version
very much speak to queer audiences

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.420
because the whole notion

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.870
love being an outsider and and you
legally

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.190
your exact being bullied maybe even
having like being with with crazy

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.190
religious parents in some cases you know

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.430
when I wrote about Carrie for for my
book 101 must-see movies for gay men I

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.360
pointed out that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.430
the lot was made that trip to the
library but you know we was in

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.050
telekinesis we were looking up in like
card catalog

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.940
um so I think if anything I think the
existing those movies or two

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.959
a cements this story as

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.280
this kind of like archetypal myth those
that that it was gonna tell over over

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.950
again it's going to be like a Christmas
carol

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.560
I the Passion Play I think there's going
to be more versions a carey as we get

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.940
older and I know when they're like times
I'm going to do it again

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.730
I think because the beats we know every
single one of them we know

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.879
she's gonna get a period we know she's
you know locked in a prayer closet as

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.000
you like about the the judge can
discover her powers that you can make

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.209
the kid on the bike fall over the you
know the prom date in the pig's blood

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.970
and I get the we know all the steps

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.060
arm so I think it's just bits become
this sort of universal

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.260
Mitt that said this movie is not

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.610
different enough from the previous
versions to really pop on its own

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.620
and I thought I don't know quite why it
exists 31

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.069
a recent story to a whole new generation
necessarily a bad thing is

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.530
still here away in a lot of ways but
when it gets right that the first one

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.360
that right to you

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.660
and I felt so sad in at the way

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.060
felt the first time too because she's
like this wounded animal

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.800
sure right before she realized she had
her powers she's just like this will get

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.080
scared little creature

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.470
and even when she last saw a smidgen and
happiness

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.699
yeah nature cell volume of these people
in the slightest way it all comes

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:35.199
crashing down one's coming right
literally comes crashing down on her and

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.590
that is what is so heartbreaking

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.580
right although this it works both ways
insurer me not to get into spoilers this

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.660
movie does

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.660
I allow for our

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.610
pat or even say this without saying it I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.720
there's a safe landing didn't know that
that the ending and the prompting both I

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.889
think there's a sensible absolve

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:58.990
almost nihilistic injustice me original
one where this one's a little softer

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.310
but I that's also a she gets more

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.520
have a net era then I'm I want to get it

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.090
I want a guy like you would buy bread
but near the end is bigger screen it is

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.620
prepared and yeah and her powers are are

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.080
bigger I'm a she can stay per foot and
cause a crevice

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.350
minoso thats Astri in a scrap to cars
going to

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.590
it's pretty amazing I'm but you know i
IIIi like lawyers more it's a lot i mean

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.919
I don't buy her as the Wounded Bird as
much as this is basic but she's

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.970
she still terrific Julian more

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.630
not quite a patch on on you know Piper
Laurie I mean that such a

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:39.400
incredible performance and I don't think
she has the just the the force

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.030
I love will too kind have a to trip to
make a res horrifying or disorder

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.350
represent the kinder almost crazy
religious ecstasy that

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:51.400
the the piper laurie would have a
certain point that made her all the

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.070
scarier

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.639
anybody there they were both creepier in
the original the perhaps your

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.650
has there was novelty to it that look at
this with the true he read it existed

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.150
drew

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.830
have the comparison to make yeah I think
they would see more than

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.710
sufficient US I do question the Castaic
Lake respuesta because

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.870
is really hard to make her look dumb P
yes exactly beautiful girl the day after

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.250
this and and and

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.310
kick-ass 2 I wish somebody would write
her

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.610
I heather's or a mean girls cuz I think
she's though these bitches

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.880
this these are the clothes she's come a
kind of high school movies at this point

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.039
and she doesn't really well and I think
you'll be fun to see her can't play

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:28.650
against type and do something with that
an edge to work I will say that the

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.199
other kids are

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.660
kinda forgettable I mean you watch
Federer is a movie in in nineteen times

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.770
according to his work

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.000
generally speaking seeing Amy Irving and
John Travolta and William Patton

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.600
PJ soles and Nancy Allan for the first
time in the really register

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.229
and these guys all look like II could
not become a lineup they all look like

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:48.210
they could be on some CW shopping at the

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.270
the blonde girl the one group playing
sue no

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.990
like strikingly beautiful could be never
cry me a bitch model or whatever yes and

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.110
but they do what they have to do is
service and the story and

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.669
know they're they're fine I'm just
saying they don't you know where my

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:03.000
review I actually site

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.220
you know sunset boulevard they had faces
the Hamaoka

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.370
these kids II got another you know I'm
noncombatant all day and get the yes

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.509
although they pointed out that Porsche
doubleday was pretty good as the

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:17.889
as the villainous is Chris because she
has resting bit race

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:21.840
week how you did dressing which faces
were everywhere were even in repose at

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.729
like

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.919
not and her name is pushed a double go
through president I get what youre

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:27.490
number

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.349
I given if straight up five penn it
going down the middle its it is well

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:32.430
done for what it is

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.400
I don't know that it needed to be made
at all I can look better than you did I

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.620
give it a sec sorry I just 5.5

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.240
there is no 2-minute tomato meter score
yet cuz they just showed it to us last

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.800
night

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.879
yes it is an alleged embargo I don't
know why they didn't have taken as a

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.470
delegate

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.840
care no it's not terrible and and and
believe me in the

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.759
scale and scope classic horror movies
being remade in the last five or 10

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:54.430
years it's a

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.629
were really good one but it here anyway
so by the time this goes up there will

00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:59.449
be a tomato meter

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:00.190
so go check it out I
