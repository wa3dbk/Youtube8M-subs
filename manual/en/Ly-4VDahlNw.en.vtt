00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.440
Welcome to this short video review about Viper
Tank knife,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.180
this knife is made by Tecnocut under the brand
Viper in Maniago in Italy,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.600
and is meant for tactical and outdoor use.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:24.970
It is a survival knife meant for situations,
where the knife,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.080
has to be a tool also, not only a knife;

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.300
this is why it is really robust, reliable
and really tough.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:42.030
Like we said, it is made in Maniago in Italy,
it also carries the Maniago logo,

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.500
that means it is a high quality product and
it was designed by Tommaso Rumici.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:55.010
On the other side you can see Tank name, Viper
logo and material mark D2;

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.550
it is a tool steel, from which the blade is
made.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.479
This knife comes with a really nice Cordura
sheath, which is MOLLE compatible,

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:13.579
which means it has a multiple points to fixing
it to your gear or clothes;

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:22.529
it also has a sling, belt hold, etc...

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.399
This sheath was made in Italy by Vega Holster,

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.319
it is also a high quality product.

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:35.619
It is very reliable and has many possibilities
to upgrade.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.159
It has one safety,

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.850
which holds the knife securely in the sheath.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.890
The knife comes with a full sheath of paper,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.950
with explanation how it was made, with general
explanation about D2 steel used, etc...,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.299
but it is all in Italian,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.329
it also carries all the basic information
about dimensions.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:12.700
You also get a standard Italian and English
warranty sheet,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:20.350
where you also get some guidelines for proper
use, for maintenance and care, and also some

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.761
precautions how to use it.

00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:28.840
It also carries warranty information and Maniago
quality explanation.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.810
Now the knife itself, it is really robust.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.471
It is quite heavy and you can even chop wood
with it;

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:43.780
it is not only a knife, but can be also used
as an axe.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.400
It is roughly 30.0 cm long, and the blade
is a little bit more than 15.0 cm; 15.5 cm.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.510
The blade thickness is 5.8 mm, and has a full-tang
design.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.040
It is really robust;

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.650
you can also see that the blade is really
high;

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.840
thus great for chopping, but you can still
use as a normal knife.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.070
It is made of D2 tool steel,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.730
and is heat treated in vacuum;

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.030
a unique technology used by Viper.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.220
This particular model has ASPIS coating in
black,

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.850
and you can also get a stone-washed finish
of this knife.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:45.690
The hardness of the blade is 58/60 HRC.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.860
The handle material is cotton canvas,

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.990
which is impregnated with Phenol resin.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.350
It is really unique, you can see the pattern
of the cotton canvas inside the handle;

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.209
and you can also see the layers.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.920
Like the knife in total, this handle is also
very robust,

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.590
and can be used in any kind of situations,
any kind of weather, etc...

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.510
It also gives good grip,

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.459
and is really big, even for those with really
big hands,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.600
it still can be normally usable.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.270
It is in light brown color and you can remove
scale,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.849
which are fastened with 3 hexagonal screws
for the knife.

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:37.560
It also has a sling hole,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.900
three in fact, thus you can use it in many
different ways and you can always attach the

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.379
sling either to your hand

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:55.990
or you can even make a bow with this knife,
if you attach it to a stick.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.099
The handle has a surface which offers some
kind of texture for better grip,

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.380
and also has an ergonomical shape of the handle.

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.830
It also protects your fingers,

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.499
that they do not slip onto the blade.

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:17.779
The handle itself is really curved,

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:19.889
it is just unusual,

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.090
but offers better handling, when you chopping

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.350
or use the knife in any other way.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.639
