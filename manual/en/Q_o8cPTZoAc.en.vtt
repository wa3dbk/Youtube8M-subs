00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.880
Now we cover a baseball cap with some icing.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.710
Finish off by giving it some decorations.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.990
You can decorate a baseball cap any way you
like.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.240
I'm gonna make some lines across the baseball
cap.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.400
So I'm gonna strike at the center and go straight
across.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880
And I'm gonna use this tool.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.070
I'm trying to get a ride in its center.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:42.910
And I'm gonna impression it right across the
middle.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.600
And I'm gonna use this tool which has little
ribbony at the tip.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.370
And go further striking a little pattern.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:01:05.360
And 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:25.550
I'm gonna do another line at the back and
two more lines down.So 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
we can add a name.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:47.880
And 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.210
now what we want to do is to create a little
toff at the top.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.710
So just gonna take some toffonder and can
give it a little roll and we can just roll

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.569
it into a ball.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.550
Right in the palm of your hands.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.500
And press it in.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.220
Round it off just a little bit.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.369
And its gonna be its center.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.890
And I'm just gonna add little water.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.950
And just apply that.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:34.360
And we finish it off by giving a name on the
front.
