00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:32.050
You’ve probably heard a lot about Nintendo
lately.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.079
About how they’re doomed.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.670
About how the Wii U’s terrible, and it’s
probably gonna be their last console.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.969
You’ve probably heard your money is better
spent on a real system, with real games.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:41.969
And power.

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.769
You’ve probably heard Nintendo is irrelevant.

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.559
Well, forget what you’ve heard.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.909
Forget the blogs, forget the critics, forget
all the bros who are so quick to shrug off

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:50.909
Nintendo.

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.920
Because they’ve forgotten something, too.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.609
They’ve forgotten that fun will never be
irrelevant.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:03.399
And fun is something these bros…still do
better than anyone.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:12.590
There’s something intangible that sets this
game apart from just about everything else

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.690
I’ve played this year.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.260
Maybe even in years—it’s really that good.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.080
Super Mario 3D World displays a level of game
design that’s, just…light years ahead

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.490
of virtually everyone else.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.830
And then there’s the execution, which is
even more incredible.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.100
Every coin, every corner, every Koopa…there’s
not a single pixel that doesn’t shine with

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.850
polish, and care.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.830
In fact, this is a game that makes other games,
even other good games…almost seem kind of

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.830
amateur.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.440
Mario’s just playing in a different league
these days.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:52.220
And it’s stunning that, after 30 years,
he’s somehow getting better.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.980
And I think part of it is that…Nintendo
is totally rethinking the Super Mario series.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.440
It used to be easy, right?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.040
You had the 2D games, and you had the 3D games.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.220
They were two different things, and they actually
started moving in two different directions.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.100
3D World pulls them back together.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.329
It takes 2D and 3D Mario, and reworks them
into something that’s…a little bit of

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.329
both.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.579
And it’s never as artificial as, just…mixing
some 3D levels with a few 2D levels.

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.730
The point is, those divisions don’t exist
here.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.909
It’s a new kind of Mario, built from all
the old kinds of Mario.

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:30.409
And it starts, surprising as it may be, with
Super Mario Bros. 2.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.709
You can play as one of four characters.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.030
There’s Mario, Luigi, Toad and Princess
Peach, just like Mario 2.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.720
And each of those characters has their own
specific attributes, just like Mario 2.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.870
For a moment, Peach can hang in the air.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.269
Luigi can jump higher than his brother, but
Mario is more sure-footed.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.939
And the thing is, they’re all available
right from the start.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.780
So you’re free to play each level with whichever
character you want, as often you want…and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.500
each time, it feels different.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.920
There’s a freedom to that that seems obvious,
but it’s actually pretty brilliant.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.299
Why limit fun, right?

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.629
Why give the player arbitrary restrictions?

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:21.870
Super Mario 3D World never does that.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.379
Of course, once you’re in the levels…the
gameplay is just incredible.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.670
If ever there was a guidebook on how a platformer
should play, this is it.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.400
Every time you touch the analog stick, you
move with a tightness and fluidity that’s

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.620
both precise and natural.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.620
It just feels right.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.670
I mean, that’s what the Mario games have
always been about.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.540
The joy of movement.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.159
Despite all the game’s new ideas, that simple
joy is still behind everything that makes

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.889
3D World so wonderful.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.650
The controls almost disappear.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.309
And Mario just becomes an extension of yourself.

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:55.980
Provided you like to…dress like cats.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.379
I mean, whatever you’re into.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.669
Speaking of which, it wouldn’t be a Mario
game without power-ups.

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.930
This time around, the main attraction is the
Cat Suit.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.450
There’s a little mushroom shaped like a
bell, and it turns Mario into this spunky

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.430
cat that can climb walls, whack enemies with
his paw…even shoot forward like a feline

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.430
missile.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.639
The Cat Suit is this game’s Raccoon Leaf,
or Bee Suit…it’s the headliner.

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:23.750
But the coolest new power-up might actually
be the Double Cherry.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.389
Each one sort of…clones Mario.

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.860
You can have up to five running around at
once, and some of the game’s most ingenious

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.270
levels revolve entirely around the Double
Cherry.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.830
And keeping all your Marios alive.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.870
And you know, I mentioned Mario 2, but…one
of the things that’s immediately apparent

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.210
in this game…is that Nintendo is really
embracing their three decades of Mario masterpieces.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.110
Because though they’re moving the series
forward, they’re also incorporating its

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.110
past.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.930
And it’s not just the playable characters.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:03.610
Mario 2’s slot machines are also back, music
in tact.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.680
Mario 3’s item houses are back, music in
tact.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.600
Even Mario 64’s sliding levels are back.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.320
Yes, with the music in tact.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.729
And it’s clear that…one of the benefits
of forging this new mixture of 2D and 3D is

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.840
that it allows 3D World to embrace all the
series’ history.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.251
It becomes a celebration of Mario’s past,
while also pushing him into a new era.

00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:29.729
And that combined with the creative level
designs and inventive gameplay ideas…is

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.270
why 3D World is such a brilliant piece of
design.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.690
Of course, all the brilliant ideas in the
world wouldn’t matter if the execution wasn’t

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.690
there.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.760
It’s there, in this game.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.289
Mario’s world looks absolutely stunning,
and where HD really benefits this cartoony

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:46.289
look…is in the details.

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:52.889
The snow sparkles, grass blows in the wind,
things like clouds and even places in the

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:54.700
distance have this subtle haze.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.229
And the weird thing is that, that polish actually
gives the game a sense of realism.

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:10.909
It’s a remarkable effect, and Mario’s
whimsical world has never looked better.

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.599
In fact, I’m not sure Mario’s ever played
better, either.

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.630
This isn’t just the killer app the Wii U
was still lacking.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.400
This is a stunning piece of game design, and
a triumph in game making.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.509
And I think it underscores something that
way too many of us forget.

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.849
In an industry where priorities have changed,
video games are still at their best…when

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.039
they’re fun.

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.940
Nintendo may do a lot of things poorly, but
fun isn’t one of them.

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.580
And once again, Mario proves it.
