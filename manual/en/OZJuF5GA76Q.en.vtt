00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.180
Nintendo has started claiming ad revenue on
user-created Youtube videos featuring its

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.570
games, according to reports from the Youtube
users themselves.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.710
Nintendo does not want to block these videos
from appearing on Youtube (as many film and

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.490
music publishers have), but it does want to
place ads at the beginning and the end of

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.380
videos featuring Nintendo games, such as Let's
Plays, with that revenue going to Nintendo

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.970
as opposed to the creator.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.640
Youtube channel owner Zack Scott posted his
thoughts on Nintendo's demands, saying: "I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.230
think filing claims against LPers is backwards.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.370
"Video games aren't like movies or TV.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.100
Each play-through is a unique audiovisual
experience.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.570
When I see a film that someone else is also
watching, I don't need to see it again.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.020
When I see a game that someone else is playing,
I want to play that game for myself!

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.080
Sure, there may be some people who watch games
rather than play them, but are those people

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.650
even gamers?"

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.170
Nintendo has issued the following statement
to GameFront on the matter: "As part of our

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.870
on-going push to ensure Nintendo content is
shared across social media channels in an

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.890
appropriate and safe way, we became a Youtube
partner and as such in February 2013 we registered

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.049
our copyright content in the Youtube database.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.500
"For most fan videos this will not result
in any changes, however, for those videos

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.240
featuring Nintendo-owned content, such as
images or audio of a certain length, adverts

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.530
will now appear at the beginning, next to
or at the end of the clips.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.729
We continually want our fans to enjoy sharing
Nintendo content on Youtube, and that is why,

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.969
unlike other entertainment companies, we have
chosen not to block people using our intellectual

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:28.979
property."

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.229
It's interesting that Nintendo chose to claim
all ad revenue on these videos instead of

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.109
adopt a revenue sharing model with the creators.

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.260
Nintendo's right to protect its copyright
is enshrined both in law and in Youtube's

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.700
copyright guidelines, which state that just
because you purchase something, it doesn't

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.920
mean that you have the right to upload it
and share with others.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.039
But this does set a difficult precedent for
Youtubers who have grown accustomed to sharing

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.840
their Let's Play videos with the world and,
in some cases, making money off of them.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.109
These content creators may be less likely
to feature Nintendo games going forward.

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.469
If other publishers were to follow suit, the
Let's Play video phenomenon could be crippled.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.600
Sony is, of course, encouraging people to
share gameplay videos with its upcoming PlayStation

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.600
4.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.349
So far, the company hasn't mentioned anything
about monetizing those videos with ads.

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.030
We'll continue following this story here at
IGN.
