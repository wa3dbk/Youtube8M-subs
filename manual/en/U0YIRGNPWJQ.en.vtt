00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.601
Today we are going to install part number
70534 from Hidden Hitch, and we are going

00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:08.210
to install this on a 2003 Mitsubishi Montero
Sport.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.192
Before we begin our install, it is a good
idea to take down the spare tire to give us

00:00:11.192 --> 00:00:15.120
more working room and plus you can see what
is going on a little bit easier, too.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.140
First off, we will show you where the hitch
mounts onto the frame.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.160
It is going to mount onto the bottom of the
frame where this tow hook is.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.230
That tow hook is going to have to come off.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.240
It also is going to attach to the side of
the frame using these two bolt holes on the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.240
drivers side.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.310
This has got to go, and we will be using these
two existing holes, too.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.060
Next, we will clean out our threaded holes
in the frame.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.380
We are just using a battery terminal brush,
and we are just going to run it in the threads

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.440
to help clean it out.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.490
Keep running the brush in and out and spraying
it until you get it good and clean, and then

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.580
take your bolt and run it in a few threads
at a time until you get it to go all the way

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.580
through the nut.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.870
You are going to have to do this for all four
bolts.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.240
All right, now we will start taking down these
tie-down hooks.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:07.070
All right, at this point we can go ahead and
start installing the hitch.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.370
What we are going to do is install the hitch
by the bolts and leave them loose so we can

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:21.680
move the hitch around as needed to get the
other bolts in.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.990
Once you get the bottom bolts installed, either
tighten these up or loosen them as needed

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.230
to help balance up the hitch.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.560
OK, once you have all the bolts installed,
go ahead and snug them all down.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:51.030
Now we can go ahead and torque down the bolts
as specified in 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.030
the instructions.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:02.550
Then we will go ahead and move on to the original
factory bolts.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.830
All that remains left is to go ahead and reinstall
your spare tire, and all that will do is sit

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.310
up against the back side of the hitch.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.140
And that covers our install of part number
70534 from Hidden Hitch.
