00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.778
Hey, guys! So growing up, I was a huge gamer.

00:00:01.778 --> 00:00:03.899
I know, I know, it's hard 
to believe being that I was

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.269
a very skinny, small 
and nerdy Asian kid growing up,

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:07.853
but, really, I was a big gamer.

00:00:07.853 --> 00:00:10.965
I mean, every single free second that I had,
I was either on a gaming console

00:00:10.965 --> 00:00:13.100
or a computer or a Gameboy of some sort.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.626
I would say about 50% of my childhood 
was me playing video games.

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:18.680
25% was playing sports, 
the other 25% was making videos,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.133
and the last remaining 5% was 
me neglecting my math homework.

00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.547
Don't get me wrong, I definitely 
don't play as many video games

00:00:23.547 --> 00:00:25.742
as I used to because, you know, 
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:27.460
I'm a mature adult, so...

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:29.722
(Flappy Bird sound effects)

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:31.268
F*CK!

00:00:31.268 --> 00:00:33.466
Anyway, if you play or played 
as many video games as I did,

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.905
you definitely heard this before.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.465
It's one of the most irritating things 
you could ever hear as a gamer:

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:39.127
(whining) Why are you wasting your time?

00:00:39.127 --> 00:00:41.150
If you have someone like 
that in your life, get rid of them.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.746
Not 'cause of what they say--
that voice is so irritating!

00:00:43.746 --> 00:00:45.857
It's usually coming 
from your parents or girls.

00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:48.185
I'm not trying to be sexist, I know 
a lot of girls play video games too,

00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:49.629
but let's be real--it's more guys.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.566
It's a fact.

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.022
Although there's a lot 
of guys that will question

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:53.224
your video game playing too.

00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:55.661
But, I mean, those are just the losers 
that don't play video games

00:00:55.661 --> 00:00:58.213
because they have no lives.
Right guys? (chuckles)

00:00:59.797 --> 00:01:01.303
(singing) Ryan has friends!

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:04.283
There are three main reasons why 
I think people say that video games

00:01:04.283 --> 00:01:05.217
are a waste of time.

00:01:05.217 --> 00:01:07.151
One, they're not good at them, 
so they don't like playing them.

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:09.199
Two, they like playing them, 
but they have no time,

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:10.459
so they don't want you to either.

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.764
Or the worst of all: Three!

00:01:11.764 --> 00:01:13.337
They judge you because you 
have an interest in something

00:01:13.337 --> 00:01:14.527
that they have no interest in.

00:01:14.527 --> 00:01:16.863
Which is so judgmental and makes 
absolutely no sense to me.

00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:18.604
That's like saying, "Hey, mom? 
Why do you paint your nails?

00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:19.371
That's a waste of time."

00:01:19.371 --> 00:01:21.170
Or, "Hey, dad! Why do you watch football?
That's a waste of time."

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.169
Or, "Hey, Arnold! That's 
a great show. I missed that...show."

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:25.269
I feel better now.

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.852
You get the point.

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:28.535
I actually believe that video games 
are good for kids--or anyone.

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:30.551
Video games aren't a waste 
of time, they're good for you!

00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:31.560
They teach life lessons.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.192
And I think it's about time that 
our society starts to appreciate that.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.397
So for all the gamers, the geeks, 
the nerds, the so-called losers,

00:01:37.398 --> 00:01:39.718
I'm standing up for you!
The next time somebody says,

00:01:39.718 --> 00:01:42.389
"Gaming is a waste of time"--
like a friend or a parent

00:01:42.394 --> 00:01:44.221
or a boyfriend or girlfriend,
probably not the last two

00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.597
because you're a nerd, hah hah.

00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:47.908
I'm gonna stand up for you 
and let them know the truth

00:01:47.908 --> 00:01:49.756
and tell them all the reasons why...

00:01:50.437 --> 00:01:52.523
I'm so close to the camera I'm out of focus.

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:56.604
All the reasons why...gaming 
is actually good for you.

00:01:56.862 --> 00:02:00.169
(video game music)

00:02:00.225 --> 00:02:01.687
First, let me start off 
with the most obvious one:

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:02.919
Hand-eye coordination.

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:04.755
A lot of video games require quick reflexes,

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.625
especially first person shooters 
like Counter Strike, Gears of War,

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.906
Halo, Modern Warfare, ETC.

00:02:09.908 --> 00:02:11.948
I can't think of a better way 
to teach hand-eye coordination.

00:02:11.948 --> 00:02:13.943
I mean, how else would I be able 
to do something like this?

00:02:13.954 --> 00:02:14.809
Candy.

00:02:20.904 --> 00:02:21.919
Too easy.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:23.369
Ah!

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:24.117
Problem Solving.

00:02:24.117 --> 00:02:26.845
If you don't run into any difficult 
problems, it's not a real video game.

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.022
And that's just like life.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:30.343
If your life has no problems, 
you're not really living it.

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:31.987
That is deep. I just made that up!

00:02:31.987 --> 00:02:35.277
That is a straight-up annoying person's 
caption for their selfie on Instagram.

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:37.387
Anyway, I'm off topic.

00:02:37.387 --> 00:02:39.744
In both video games and life, 
you're gonna run into problems.

00:02:39.744 --> 00:02:40.841
And a true gamer never gives up.

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:42.623
He problem solves until he 
figures out how to win.

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:45.906
Trial and error, looking for patterns, 
keeping at it until he gets better and better.

00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:47.904
For example, in real life, 
if you're taking a Calculus class

00:02:47.904 --> 00:02:49.505
and you're failing, 
treat it like a video game!

00:02:49.505 --> 00:02:52.013
Try to problem-solve, never give up, 
and eventually you will succeed.

00:02:52.013 --> 00:02:54.072
And if you know you're not ready 
and you can't beat that level,

00:02:54.072 --> 00:02:55.325
well then, lower the difficulty.

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.286
Take ceramics.

00:02:56.286 --> 00:02:57.495
Camping. Don't be a camper.

00:02:57.495 --> 00:02:59.527
For all you gamers out there, you 
already know what a camper is.

00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:01.442
But for those of you that don't, 
a camper basically is someone

00:03:01.442 --> 00:03:03.825
that will wait around and hide 
until their victims come to them,

00:03:03.825 --> 00:03:05.350
rather than actually playing the actual game.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.790
This is such an important life lesson!

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.928
Yeah, sure, be a camper 
and enjoy the safe route.

00:03:08.928 --> 00:03:10.764
Hide behind a bush 
or a coach your whole life.

00:03:10.764 --> 00:03:12.704
But if you want to have an exciting life, 
don't just be a camper

00:03:12.704 --> 00:03:14.689
who just waits around 
until opportunity comes to you.

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.261
It's not just lame to people, it's irritating.

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:17.594
You get out there and you get it!

00:03:17.594 --> 00:03:18.806
Go after what you want in life!

00:03:18.831 --> 00:03:20.285
Camping is boring. Rush!

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:21.867
Storm the front! Go, go, go!

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:22.881
Counter Strike references.

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:24.537
Hackers. Hackers aren't respected.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.865
Sure, you can be a hacker in life 
and cheat your way to the top.

00:03:26.865 --> 00:03:29.268
But you and everyone else around you 
knows that you hacked to get there.

00:03:29.268 --> 00:03:31.372
And the thing is technology is 
so good now that if you're hacking,

00:03:31.372 --> 00:03:33.024
you're gonna get caught.
And dare I say it...

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:35.827
Banned.

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:37.491
So we'll make her dance.

00:03:37.515 --> 00:03:38.762
Dance, make her dance.

00:03:38.784 --> 00:03:40.031
Nobody likes a rage quitter.

00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:41.982
You know those guys that quit 
the game out of frustration.

00:03:41.982 --> 00:03:44.877
Go! Go! Go! SON OF A [BLEEP]!

00:03:44.884 --> 00:03:46.127
MAN, I [BLEEP] QUIT!

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.378
I [BLEEP] QUIT!

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:49.549
(screaming)

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.951
If you play games, especially online, 
you know the feeling

00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:53.584
of wanting to rage quit.
Don't even lie!

00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:56.544
And as irritating as a rage quitter is, 
it still teaches you a life lesson.

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.188
Sometimes you get so upset 
and frustrated that you just have to stop.

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:01.082
When you're in a place in life 
when you're so unhappy

00:04:01.082 --> 00:04:02.619
with the way things are going, take a break.

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:04.679
Take some time to cool off 
and come back even stronger.

00:04:04.679 --> 00:04:05.614
Money management!

00:04:05.614 --> 00:04:07.969
Whether it's coins, dollars, 
minerals, or whatever,

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.450
video games teach you how to spend it wisely.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.041
For example, if you're gonna buy 
an AWP, you have to remember

00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:12.914
to save money for ammo
because ammo's pretty expensive,

00:04:12.914 --> 00:04:14.936
not to mention your secondary weapon, 
Desert Eagle or something,

00:04:14.936 --> 00:04:16.317
and we didn't even get 
to the part about the equipment,

00:04:16.317 --> 00:04:18.537
like your kevlar helmet, your frag grenade, 
your double flash bangs

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:19.849
and/or smoke grenades and stun--

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:20.761
damn, I really am a nerd.

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.483
If you get any of those references, 
you're awesome.

00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:23.366
Micromanaging.

00:04:23.366 --> 00:04:25.168
When you have a bunch of units, 
you don't just auto-attack

00:04:25.168 --> 00:04:26.528
like some NOOB!

00:04:26.552 --> 00:04:28.531
You assign different units 
to do different things.

00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:29.540
Yet another life lesson.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.313
Each person has their own specific purpose.

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:33.259
Micro-manage each person 
to do what they're best at.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.123
That's efficiency.

00:04:34.123 --> 00:04:36.873
Biology. Every first person shooter
will teach you that you're more likely

00:04:36.873 --> 00:04:39.308
to die if you get shot in the head
than the arm or the leg.

00:04:39.308 --> 00:04:41.508
Okay, maybe that one might seem
obvious, but if you think about it,

00:04:41.508 --> 00:04:43.901
it's probably obvious because you 
learned that from a video game

00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:44.931
or a movie!

00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:47.661
It's true, though. If you get shot 
in the head...GG, bro.

00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:50.347
Multiplayer. To me, this is one 
of the most valuable life lessons

00:04:50.347 --> 00:04:51.492
you can learn from video games.

00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:53.554
Most, if not all, video games 
these days are multiplayer.

00:04:53.554 --> 00:04:55.927
Multiplayer teaches you that if you have 
a bad team and you don't work

00:04:55.927 --> 00:04:57.553
together, you're probably gonna lose.

00:04:57.553 --> 00:04:58.931
You can't always do everything by yourself.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.584
The bottom line is there's no I
in the spelling of teamwork,

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.252
just like there's no I in the spelling 
of multyplayer...with the bottom line.

00:05:05.252 --> 00:05:06.016
(ding)

00:05:06.016 --> 00:05:06.728
There it is!

00:05:06.728 --> 00:05:09.524
And the sooner you learn that, 
the sooner we can all work together

00:05:09.524 --> 00:05:13.174
like a multiplayer unit and convince people
that video games aren't a waste of time!

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:14.763
Video games are important to teaching people

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:17.372
how to really start living life 
by not setting up camp,

00:05:17.372 --> 00:05:19.234
but going after the things they really want,

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:20.837
without having to cheat 
their way to the top.

00:05:20.837 --> 00:05:22.502
Even if they have to rage quit 
every now and then,

00:05:22.502 --> 00:05:25.420
they'll learn to problem solve 
and never give up until they get there.

00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.611
And once they do, they'll already 
have passed any problems

00:05:27.611 --> 00:05:30.937
that come along their way with the quickest 
reflexes the world has ever seen.

00:05:30.937 --> 00:05:33.050
Because gaming is more than just a game.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.365
It's life.

00:05:34.365 --> 00:05:36.227
And like I always said 
since I was a little kid,

00:05:36.237 --> 00:05:39.401
"If your life has no problems, 
you're not really playing the life."

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:40.379
Wait...no.

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:44.064
If life has no problems, the game 
is not really playing the l-life.

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:44.787
What?!

00:05:44.787 --> 00:05:47.212
When the life is like...problem.
Games are problems--

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.268
If life is a game, the problem is--

00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:51.489
If your game has problems, 
take it back to the store

00:05:51.489 --> 00:05:52.381
that you got it from.

00:05:52.381 --> 00:05:54.585
Life is like a Xbox of chocolates.

00:05:54.585 --> 00:05:59.001
Okay. If your life has no problems, 
you're not really living it.

00:05:59.371 --> 00:06:01.978
And that...is the bottom line.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.040
(ding)

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.285
SON OF A [BLEEP]

00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:06.704
I QUIT! I QUIT!

00:06:06.714 --> 00:06:08.828
I [BLEEP] QUIT! ARGH!

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:09.565
Oh, dude.
