00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.200
The University of Maryland's Solar Decathlon
2011 entry, entitled WaterShed, is inspired

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.910
by the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The home
interconnects architecture, engineering, and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.869
landscape features, creating a holistic design
that responds to challenges of both energy

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.779
and water consumption.WaterShed's constructed
wetlands are at the heart of the design. The

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:34.510
constructed wetlands store storm water and
filter pollutants from grey water. Once filtered

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.649
by plants, the water can be reused on site
for irrigation, decreasing demand on municipal

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:47.420
water supplies and wastewater treatment facilities.The
home's two shed forms feed this natural system.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.170
WaterShed's solar array also benefits from
the shed forms as the angled roof elegantly

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.430
allows the solar array to efficiently create
power.Unwanted solar gain from high southern

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.039
and harsh western sunlight is prevented using
overhangs and outdoor elements such as the

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:09.060
solar thermal wall. The modules are offset
along the constructed wetlands axis and connected

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.000
by the bathroom module. This creates a rich
variety of spaces for the widely varying daily

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.700
and seasonal changes of the Chesapeake region.Flexible
space planning in the living module lets residents

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.060
cook, eat, entertain and relax. General illumination
is provided in the soaring space through translucent

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:43.829
clerestories.The kitchen deck creates a covered
outdoor area and provides access to the gardens.WaterShed's

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.170
bathroom module bridges between the living
and working modules and is part of the constructed

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:55.070
wetlands axis. This module features a glass-enclosed
shower reinforcing the resident's impact on

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.939
and connection to the environment.The working
and sleeping module accommodates both personal

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.729
and professional needs using transformable
furniture. The bed can transition to a conference

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:15.030
table while the desk space provides a permanent
area to work.WaterShed's envelope is an integrated

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.370
system of layers protecting the house against
energy loss and water infiltration. Heavy-stick

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.060
framing is covered in tongue-and-groove sheathing.
Two layers of rigid foam insulation on the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.040
exterior as well as a liquid-applied air and
water barrier create a tight seal against

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.709
the elements. A ventilated rain-screen helps
ensure that no water vapor gets trapped in

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.980
the walls. Spray foam insulation in the wall
and roof cavities brings the total insulation

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.980
value of the envelope above R-40. High efficiency
windows and doors complete the envelope, providing

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.989
ample natural light to the interior.Thermo-treated
wood siding and decking is bug and rot resistant,

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:03.480
without using harsh chemicals.Through integrated
architecture, engineering, and living systems,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.050
WaterShed creates inspiring spaces which bring
delight to every day activities.WaterShed

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.490
is a house as ecosystem, an answer to today's
many questions about how to build a more sustainable

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.849
future.
