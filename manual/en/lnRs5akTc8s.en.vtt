Hi, I'm Trevor Bending from OpticsPlanet, and I'm here today to show you the Steiner 10x50

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.990
Merlin Pro Binocular. Usually when
you think 10x50 binocular, you're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.289
thinking a pretty large binocular.

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.470
Picking this up in my hands right now, you can see this is a nice, sleek, roof-prism design

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.900
binocular that has 10x magnification,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.810
and the 50mm objective. And with 50mm objective, you're going to

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.890
get a lot a of light in, so if you need something to glass a little bit further,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.460
see those birds a little bit farther away,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.970
this 10x50's going to be the right choice for you.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.500
Now, Steiner's known for optical
excellence, and the Merlin Pro really

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.699
lives up to that.

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.529
You have nice twist-up eyecups, so you really can get that customized fit. And

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:44.949
a nice feature I really like is a side shield that you can fold down or pull up as

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:45.589
you need it,

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.049
block out any distractions, light, or anything you might have coming in from

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.830
the side.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.950
Complete rubber body, which is a really
really nice feature, having that full rubber

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.100
armor on there.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.420
The objective lenses have really nice coatings on there as well, that give you high-

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.799
contrast lenses, Steiner actually calls them, so you're going

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.699
to get the best and most crisp picture available. The 10x50

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.630
Merlin Pro's gonna give you about 18mm eye relief,

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.820
also has a close focus of about 6.5ft which is a very nice

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.370
feature. Steiner gives you a very very nice, comfortable, rubberized strap on the inside,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.170
elastic on the outside, but it has a lot of give to it, so it's gonna move with you. So

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.380
it's not going to be uncomfortable at all, just a very very comfortable strap.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.229
You have tethered objective covers, so flip them down, you're not gonna lose

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:25.640
them.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.259
You also have your eyepiece covers as well. It
is tripod mountable, so you can unscrew

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.539
this cover here and attach it to any standard tripod adapter. It also has a very very

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.689
smooth center focus on here. It just glides right across with the finger.

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.410
Even the case that Steiner gives you for the Merlin Pro

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.860
is a very nice case.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.149
It's really a hybrid design, so it's gonna protect your binocular, it's going to have that little

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.200
bit of rigidity, and

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.750
it's gonna protect your binocular. So you're gonna invest in a nice binocular,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.189
and you're gonna be able to protect it.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.050
So you have the Steiner Merlin Pro 10x50,

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.200
perfect for birding, going to the range, hunting, general viewing.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.700
Whatever you need to do, the 10x50 Merlin Pro can do it. 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.069
You can find these at OpticsPlanet.com. I'm Trevor Bending, thanks for watching.
