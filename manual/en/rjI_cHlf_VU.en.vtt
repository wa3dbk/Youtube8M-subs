00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.710
So, I'm going to show you how to use a flat
iron on naturally curly hair.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.020
What I've done first, was we did a nice blow-dry
before we got started.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.560
So we got the majority of the wave out that
way.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.170
So you can do that a couple of different ways
without blow-drying it.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.480
If you wanted to, you could always experiment
with pinning it all back, and letting it air-dry

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.900
, all pulled back so that the top was really,
really straight.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.010
Then you would just have to go in and define
the bottom.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.679
The flat iron is a really powerful tool, so
you just really want to use it to touch up

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:41.649
anything that you missed.

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.480
So what I'm going to do, is we're going to
take a small section, here on the side, and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.949
just quickly pin the rest of the hair up.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.160
Brush it through with our fingers.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.030
Iâ€™ve already put a heat protectant over
this, and the one that I used, was a gloss-based

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.649
heat protectant.

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.879
Be sure that whatever you're using as a heat
protectant says "heat protectant."

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.159
Some of the things that we think are protecting
our hair actually aren't, so just make sure

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.850
it has that little label on it.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.600
Then what I'm going to do is, I always use
a comb, when I'm flat-ironing.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.770
The reason I do this is, it's just going to
straighten the hair before it even goes into

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.020
the flat iron.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.719
What I'm doing is, because we already blew
the hair dry, I'm skipping this mid-point

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.770
here, because I want to have a little bit
of volume.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.789
So, what I'm really using the flat iron for,
is just to define and smooth the ends of the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:35.829
hair.

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:40.560
The only time I would not do that is if you
had something around the face that maybe needed

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.350
a little bit of smoothing.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:50.390
So, if you can see, when I'm using my comb,
my comb just sits right in front of my flat

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.010
iron and it goes right along with it.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.619
If you take just a little bit of time, take
nicer sections, then you don't have to make

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.720
so many passes with the flat iron.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.790
It usually takes just as much time to do it
this way, as it does to just go through and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.020
grab big chunks and just whip through with
your flat iron.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.180
But you get a prettier result, and its healthier
for your hair.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.850
So, if you are somebody that habitually flat-irons
your hair, then you might want to take it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.490
slow, and do it right.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.890
And then these pieces right by the face, I
always like to move away from your face, so

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.950
they don't just hang down, they kind of come
up over the top of the rest of the hair.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.970
So, I'm just going to continue doing this,
throughout the rest of the head.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.730
So, just to recap, what I did was I started
with a blow-dried or straightened set.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:55.140
Then I started at the sides, worked in smaller
sections using a comb, and then followed my

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.370
flat iron right behind it to get this beautiful
smooth look.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.680
I did that all the way up each side of the
head, and then I went around to the back and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.930
finished that.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.980
Right around the face, I moved the direction
away from your face, so that you get this

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:22.400
nice soft piece of hair here, that just lives
on top of everything else But I think the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.820
flat-ironing is a great, every-so-often way
to straighten your hair from natural to straight.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.150
So, this is how I would flat-iron naturally
curly hair.
