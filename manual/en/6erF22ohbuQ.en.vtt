00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.530
 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.780
Atmosphere 300 Front Street West
Signature Suites

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.510
are located on the 44th floor to the
49th floor.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.850
They are impeccably designed to showcase the beautiful views.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.130
We'll be touring two suites to show you
just how versatile

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.430
the homes and finishes can be, with Tridel Lead Designer, 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.050
Stella Salvador.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.340
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.340
 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.810
Stella, you have designed a beautiful
kitchen.  It's 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.760
dark and deep, rich, bold. Tell me about it.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.110
Well this kitchen has built-in European
appliances.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.860
It has a sink that is over-sized,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.080
extra-deep under-counter.  Love this.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.890
And the counter is granite and it has a coordinating slab back-splash. 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.950
It's really quite
something.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.140
I feel like we're in the middle of an
art piece.  What is it about granite that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.540
we find so appealing?

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.640
Well, granite is a natural stone, and being
a natural stone

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.070
every piece of slab is unique. Now, it's
also a stone that doesn't depreciate in

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.680
value

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.850
and with a protective sealant its
relatively low maintenance.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.220
And stunning I might add.  

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.640
Now this is a statement bedroom.  Tell me about it.  Well, 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.610
the suite was designed so that the
master bedroom and the second bedroom

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.090
are at opposite ends, affording more
privacy.  And this, 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.690
the view, it's incredible! Yes, a standard feature
of our signature suites

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.020
are the expansive windows. Well, really, it
makes the city

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.040
a feature of the suite, doesn't it? Yes.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.750
This is one tranquil Master Ensuite.  I love the feeling in here.  The glassed in shower is

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.610
gorgeous,

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.760
so airy.  And that tub, it's so

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.920
beautiful.  Tell me about that. Well, the
tub is deck-mounted and it's surrounded

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.080
by natural stone.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.620
The natural stone is also on the floor and
it's on the walls.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.709
It's really stunning, just adds to that feeling of 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.709
relaxation, doesn't it. Yes.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.600
Oh, Stella, this is such a different
feeling from the other kitchen.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.640
Look at the cupboards and it's so light.  Well, this suite features an L-shaped kitchen

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.930
and a quartzite countertop.  Oh, it's lovely.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.410
Now, we chose quartzite because it's a lighter stone

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.700
but it still has the durability of
granite.  But Moe, my favorite feature,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.170
you're gonna love this, come look here behind me.  Okay.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.640
It's a large pantry room, right off
the kitchen.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.690
Oh my goodness!  

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.440
Oh Stella, this is a equally stunning. I mean the
views

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.730
are all gorgeous.  And this Master Bedroom also has a walk out balcony.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.700
Oh, I love that.   Now Moe, you've seen this Master Bedroom, 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.130
you've seen the other Master Bedroom.  Now tell me, what's your favorite? 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.070
Now that is too hard to decide.  Well, let
me help you.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.410
Come, let's check out the his and hers
walk-in closets.  0h! Okay.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.260
Oh, this is a girl's dream come
true.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.600
Look how many shoes I can fit in here.  And I don't even have to share this with

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.480
him.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.980
He's got his own closet.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.380
Stella, I am so impressed with the
Atmosphere Signature Suites that you've 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.740
designed.  You can choose bold, rich

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.320
dramatic, light, airy, relaxed.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.870
Is that something that Atmosphere
Signature Suites are known for?

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.310
Well, Tridel has the versatility to
incorporate your inspirations and your

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.170
aspirations.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.970
Oh, you design for me?  Exactly. (laugh)

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.020
Atmosphere at 300 Front Street West.  Your life will never be the same.
