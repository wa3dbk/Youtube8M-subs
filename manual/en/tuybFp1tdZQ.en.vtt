00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.750
It seems I can't cut a break on Fridays and
despite my best intentions I've been running

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.180
around all day trying to make sure I don't
get stressed over the weekend.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.290
On the positive side I'm all geared up for
the local yearly Zombie Walk and I now own

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:25.200
pants that aren't falling apart (sorry ladies,
I'm already taken).

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.330
But enough about my life, we're here to talk
iOS and we've got you covered in the Friday

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.140
News Wrap-Up for October the 21st, 2011.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.550
Last week Rockstar dropped a little bomb as
they announced that a version of the 10th

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.120
Anniversary Edition of Grand Theft Auto III
would be making its way to iOS and Android

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.870
devices as well.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.250
This is all well and good, but there's a catch
- only iPad 2 and iPhone 4S' with the A5 processor

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.329
will be able to take part in the initial release.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.129
Thankfully Rockstar aren't so heartless as
to leave things there and singe core iOS devices

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:02.500
are going to see a release 'later', though
given the initial restrictions it's likely

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.830
to be limited to iPad and fourth generation
devices.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.350
The game is slated for this autumn, so it'll
be out before you know it!

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.530
Back in 2003 the popular Franco-Belgian comic
series XIII saw a release on the PC, PS2,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.490
Xbox and GameCube as a fun, if quietly received
shooter.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.290
The fact that it sported vocal talents from
actors like David Duchovny shows there was

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.119
a real vested interest in converting the then
19 year old comic with as much flair as possible.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.820
Now French publisher Anuman Interactive is
teasing a new game based on the series for

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.451
PC, Mac, iPhone and iPad, but alas all other
details peter out there as there's only the

00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:42.470
single image to work from.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.700
While it may be a bit much to expect anything
like the footage of the original game being

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.920
shown to you here, it will be interesting
to see what the developer releases.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.880
The App Store has seen its imitators, but
Level-5 have finally decided to throw down

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
and bring Professor Layton to iOS.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.670
It gets even better as it's an entirely new
game dubbed Layton Brothers: Mystery Room.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.340
Details are sparse at the moment, though the
story does revolve around aiding two special

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.259
agents in solving 'unsolvable crimes'.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.040
We do have a contact floating over in Japan,
so we'll pass on any updated news as soon

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.129
as we can.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.909
If you missed out on all the bombast from
Gameloft, the third installment in their modern

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:22.939
warfare shooter series 'Modern Combat' will
be hitting the virtual shelves in the App

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.499
Store on October 27.

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.950
Aside from the usual notable improvements
in graphics and gameplay, the game has also

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.260
pushed the multiplayer limit up to 12 players
(as opposed to 10 in the last game), so clans

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.610
may have to expand their roster if they want
ot remain competitive.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.290
The game is optimized for the iPad 2 (and
hopefully iPhone 4S as a result), but is also

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.480
a universal app - pricing is yet to be announced.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.599
If you exist on the Internet; have a Facebook
profile; and haven't at least tried or know

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.669
about Mafia Wars style games then you can
consider yourself in the proud minority.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.109
It's not that these sorts of games are bad
- far from it, they can actually be quite

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:05.230
addictive - but there's a stigma that comes
from its rather lackluster day on Facebook.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.219
Please Stay Calm - Zombie Apocalypse tries
to rectify this by adding the social element

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:13.330
in to the game itself, getting players to
work together in establishing Safehouses around

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.620
their cities and fighting back the zombie
tide while scavenging various local sites.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.089
I say 'their cities' and 'local sites' because
the game tries to add a realistic touch by

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.799
pulling locales from FourSquare and modifying
the zombies and loot accordingly.

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:31.390
Bonuses are awarded for traders who establish
outposts nearby (penalties apply if you try

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.989
to collect from too far away), but most importantly
you'll want to find other players nearby.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.769
Sadly this isn't always easy even despite
the availability of a global chat board and

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.139
unless you're lucky enough to find a group
of survivors your journey in to the world

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.079
of Please Stay Calm (cool storyline or not)
is going to be limited.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:53.330
Still, Massive Damage have done a great job
at pushing the boundaries of the already very

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.999
limited genre and hopefully updates encourage
players to keep coming back for more.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.519
I had thought that giving away the top game
of the week prize to Mage Gauntlet was a bit

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.959
premature, especially given some of the great
titles that launched aside it - however we'll

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.049
cover those titles on Monday... for now Rocketcat
Games' latest game gets the number one slot.

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.329
Despite being a huge departure from the time-trial
rope-swinging days of their Hook games, Mage

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.389
Gauntlet is still an incredibly fun Action-RPG
that shows the maturity of a developer comfortable

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:24.490
with the iOS platform.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.370
Sporting their usual 16-bit retro-visual appeal
with modern effects, the game tries to side-step

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.460
the usual tropes while poking its tongue out
and having fun at the expense of other RPGs.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.620
Definitely worth grabbing if you're after
a game you keep coming back to (especially

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.629
thanks to its unlockable 'master' mode).

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.680
Given that I'll be making use of public transport
almost all weekend I know I'll be busy playing

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.990
a whole tonne of games to kill two birds with
one stone.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.051
In particular you can look forward to reviews
of Galaxy Pirate Adventure, Whale Tail, Bring

00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:57.069
Me Sandwiches!!, and Dark Incursion at the
start of the week (along with a good handful

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:58.729
dropped in from Dave).

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:06.339
Enjoy your weekend, I know I will!
