00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:08.850
Hey, what is going on guys?

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.380
It's me, Vikkstar123 with some gold crossbow
gameplay on black ops 2.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.990
This camo took about 5 hours to get in total,
I'll get on to that later.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.270
On the video I'm using the red dot sight on
this game, which was really good fun.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.480
I like the attachments, I like what they've
done with it.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.939
They've basically toned down the blast radius
a lot, so you literally have to put it underneath

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.700
someone, like that guy to get the kill.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.890
Oh and here's some regular scope gameplay
and basically the fire rate is massivly up.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.090
So it's good fun, a lot of fun to use.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.800
And it looks really really nice in gold.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
It got a little spirit level.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.710
Oh and here's some triburst attachment gameplay.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.590
So as you can see, you can get it so it shoots
three bolts at once with the triburst attachments.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.940
You do eat ammo up pretty fast, but you can
kill people with a direct impact pretty much

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.140
instantly.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.399
And you get a pretty big blast radius just
from the three as you can see there.

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.600
I only hit him with two of the three.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.519
If there
woudld've been someone behind him, they would've

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.519
been taken out.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.680
And I'm just gonna reload it, and go around
to pick up one more kill in a second.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.680
DUBSTEP YEAH!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.500
So right, we're gonna head outside, pick up
one more kill and then, oh is that a cheeky

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.680
diamond knife I see there?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.290
Hold on a second, was that?

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.750
Anyway I'm gonna explain how you get the gold
crossbow right now.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.870
So guys, this is the class I used to get the
gold crossbow with the tribolt as you can

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.500
see, it got scavenger to resupply bolts, lightweight
just to running around, flack jacket to protect

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.230
me from explosives and tac mask to protect
from stuns, and then extreme conditioning

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.340
for some more running about.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.830
So there wasn't really too much to that.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.420
And now I'm gonna show you what exactly you
need to do to get this.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.810
So there's the gold camo.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.280
First of all you need to get three hundred
kills with the crossbow, that takes a long

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.570
time believe me.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.070
Then one double kill using the crossbow, not
too difficult, then five revenge kills, not

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.070
too difficult.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.700
One car
kill, that took a little bit of time, just

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.490
because no one was sitting behind cars.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.150
One bloodthirsty medal, that's a five killstreak,
didn't take too long.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.520
And then get a kill with every round in your
clip.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.520
Didn't take too long.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.980
It was the three hundred kills that took the
most time.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:53.980
Then you get the golden.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.420
Oh is that diamond I see there.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.720
Guys stay tuned for my video in twenty minutes
or so, maybe even ten.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.310
Because I believe I am the first person in
the world to get the diamond camo, so you

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.060
