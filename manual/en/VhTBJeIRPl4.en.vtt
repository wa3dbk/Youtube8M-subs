Hi, everyone. This is Matt from Kenhub! And
in this tutorial, we will discuss the origin,

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.820
insertion, innervation, and function of the
brachialis muscle.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.029
The brachialis is a long, strong muscle of
the upper arm. For the most part, the brachialis

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.180
is buried under the biceps brachii and is
therefore not easy to palpate from the surface.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.780
The muscle does have superficial parts found
at its lateral border and distally.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.339
Even though it is located deep in the upper
arm, the brachialis muscle still contributes

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:45.319
indirectly to the surface anatomy as its large
belly makes the biceps brachii look much larger

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:51.280
on the surface than it actually is. You know
how the old saying goes, “Behind every great

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.260
biceps brachii is a great brachialis,” or
something like that.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.280
The brachialis originates at the distal half
of the anterior side of the humerus. In addition,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.020
the origin tendon attaches to the medial and
lateral intermuscular septa of the arm, two

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.180
dividing membranes separating the flexor from
the extensor muscles.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.710
Distally, the muscle inserts at the tuberosity
of the ulna, where its fibers are also connected

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.670
to the joint capsule.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.399
The nerve supply for the brachialis comes
from the musculocutaneous nerve. However,

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.399
in 70% to 80% of people, the muscle has double
innervation with the radial nerve.

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:44.649
The brachialis is the strongest flexor of
the elbow joint, stronger even than the biceps

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.560
brachii because it is closer to the joint
access, and furthermore, only stretches over

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.979
one joint. A small contraction of the muscle
consequently leads to a larger flexion in

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.119
the elbow.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.020
Another function of the brachialis is helping
with maintenance of tension found on the joint

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.020
capsule, and as a result, working to prevent
damages to the capsule during hyper extension.

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.220
This video is more fun than reading a text
book, right? If you want more videos, interactive

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.590
It is time to say goodbye to your old textbooks,
and say hello to your new anatomy learning

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.040
partner, Kenhub. See you there!
