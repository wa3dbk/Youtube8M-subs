Hello everyone, welcome to The Cool Friendship
Show! Nice, just in case your curious we used

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.369
to be The Cool Drug Show. Things have changed,
get used to it please. Alright, now an important

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.640
thing about friendship is to remember that
sometimes it's really weird and obsessive

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.829
and other times you feel like you're being
used and you probably are. So be weary of

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.339
friendship and by weary I mean wearie. Today
on the show were discussing the eight most

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:36.329
gruesome Disney animated deaths, right? The
first up we have Beauty and the Beast, wow

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.469
what a lovely film. There's some candles,
there's some other cheery crap. But oh what's

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:48.469
this? Gaston plunges to his death at the end
and in the film it looks so nice and cuddly,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.440
oh he just falls off the castle you don't
really see much but in reality he plunged

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.190
to his miserable demise and bursts all over
the sidewalk. As you can see in this illustration

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.010
his ribs are sticking out and you can barely
tell what his head is and the blood is everywhere.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.010
Cool. And next we have The Lion King, oh yes
a lot of death happens in The Lion King good

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.110
people die, bad people die. Scar especially,
Scar is the of course the lion who betrays

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.380
just about everyone possible. That's pretty
much his role in the film is to betray people.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.380
And at the end, oh the hyenas turn on him
and they eat him alive. That's really sad

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.460
even though he did a lot of shitty things
to a lot of people. That's one of the worst

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.230
ways you can go. And of course in usual Disney
fashion they barely show you anything. Well

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:51.600
hey, next time I watch a Disney film I want
to see people being killed for real. Obviously

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.600
that won't work for children. Who cares? Goodnight.
This one happens at the beginning of Aladdin.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.480
You see Jafar, who is very evil of course
and he's sending this thief who cares nothing

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.560
but himself into the cave of wonders. What
happens in the cave of wonders? Well things

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.980
go wrong and he tries to escape and he gets
buried alive. That's right. This poor son

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.980
of a bitch just gets trapped by sand and I
imagine he even ingests sand gasping for air.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.250
It's really a nightmare come true. And here
we have Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, a

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.250
lovely film with dwarfs and princesses and
death, right? All these films contain at least

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.700
one gruesome death. In Snow White, near the
end, again, spoiler alert. I am probably ruining

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.210
all these movies but everyone's seem them
whatever. The witch is forced onto a cliff

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.610
edge by the dwarfs who, I guess, are just
going to shake their fists at her until a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.920
lightning bolt strikes the rock she is sitting
on or standing on and it knocks her to her

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.780
miserable demise. And as you see with my illustration
the rock clearly lands directly into one eyeball

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.780
while a stick penetrates her bowls. Gross.
Isn't it fortunate for the dwarfs that they

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.190
did not have to kill the witch with their
own hands. Of course, nature did it for them.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:25.190
Lame. How about in the next seven dwarfs films,
the dwarfs just tear her apart. It's probably

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.569
what happened in the original story, I'm not
going to look it up you can do that on your

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.610
own time. Now were moving onto Pinocchio.
Oh Pinocchio, what's wrong with Pinocchio?

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.680
There's a cricket there's a wooden boy what
could go wrong? Oh, Ill tell you. There's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.190
a disturbing scene where a ton of boys they
all turn into donkeys and are forced into

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.620
slavery, right? And although they don't die
in the movie they certainly die, what, ten

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:55.620
years later. Given a donkey's life span. And
they die with a donkey body with the consciousness

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:03.239
of a human. That's horrifying. How bored would
you be in a donkey's body? All those boys

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.239
died a miserable death. It makes me sick to
think about. At least they had those sweet

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:15.239
cigars though huh? Whatever I'm out of here.
Next. Ah Mulan, what a classic from the late

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:22.690
'90's? Mulan Shan Yu attempts to assassinate
the emperor. But Mulan interferes by murdering

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.349
him and how does she murder him? By sending
him up in fireworks where upon he explodes

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.939
all over a crowd. Of course you don't see
the crowd getting rained on with guts. You

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:41.939
just see a delightful explosion. That's cute
Disney you disgusting people. Great film.

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:53.569
In here we have Tarzan, a very forgettable
Disney film. Near the end Tarzan and Clayton,

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:59.439
the villain, are in an intense struggle and
Clayton accidentally hangs himself with the

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:05.830
very vines that Tarzan swung on. And as you
see here in the illustration it's a very gruesome

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.830
death and Clayton is bleeding from his eyeball.
That might of been my touch, Just to get the

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:20.099
point across, right? How haunting this death
is. Next one. And lastly the most recent example

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:27.439
on the list, The Incredibles. The villain,
Syndrome, is sucked into a plane turbine.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:34.439
His cape gets caught and then he is just smushed
and grinded to a disgusting pulp. Oh so colorful

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.490
and fun in the Disney film but the reality,
as I have drawn it, is disturbing. And those

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.020
were the most gruesome Disney deaths. If you
can think of anymore please throw a clip in

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.719
the comments and we'll have a little watch,
have a little fun. I hear the one from the

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:01.020
little mermaid is not so great either. So
check those out and anyway I wanted to pose

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.710
this question to you. What's better? That
we show children horrifying deaths and their

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.710
scared of death and murder or that we make
death really fluffy like in these Disney films.

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:18.789
I wonder? Better bring in a psychologist or
something. Alright guys, before I go if you
