Hey guys today I am going to show you, product called WakaWaka Light. So lets unbox this up

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:21.029
opening box

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.570
So the WakaWaka Light company was kind enough to send me a sample of the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.250
product to review

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.930
 I am absolutely blown away by this product!

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.920
the WakaWaka Light was made for third world countries

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.409
many of these ares rely on things like
kerosene lamps

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:46.380
which are great

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.300
in and of themself

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.630
But do carry a risk of fire and injures

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.150
the solar panel can provide a fully charged
battery

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.720
in as little as four or five hours

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720
near the equator

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.220
a bit longer the further North or South you go

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.130
The light has five settings

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.670
1) 120 lumen

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.200

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.270
2) 60 lumen

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.030

3) 30 lumen

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.799
plenty bright enough for reading.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.970
4) 6 lumen

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.750

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.749
80 hours

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:18.379
if you hold down the button

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.669
about three seconds

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:23.239
it lights SOS

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.619
the hole is meant

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:26.540
to

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.169
to put on top of the bottle

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.759
as a stand

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.859
when you charge WakaWaka

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.029
you can see in the top, there is a 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.479
green light

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:39.300
that blinks

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.049
in sometimes

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.279
so... here I opened WakaWaka Light

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:52.479
and as you see here there are three AA batteries, which provide it to

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.429
get the light in

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:58.579
80 hours, 16 hours or 8 hours

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.429
the motherboard and the solar light connector

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.319
We are in the complete darkness

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.269
and now I am turning on WakaWaka

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.529
as you see

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:17.529
it is really really bright

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.109
it is my basement

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.209
if I lower it down

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.659
it lowers down ... Complete darkness again
