Hi. I'm Frank Simpson for Neotech and I'm
here to tell you about our Sax Practice Harness™.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.760
The Sax Practice Harness™ represents a new
approach to supporting a horn to alleviate

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.270
pressure on the neck and shoulders. It features
soft memory foam shoulder pads over internal

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.680
aluminum supports that conform to the contours
of your body for a truly custom fit. The strap

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.620
and hook portion offer incredibly fast adjustment
of length and complete freedom of movement,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.620
both from side-to-side and front-to-back.
The Sax Practice Harness™ is slim enough

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.449
that it can even be worn under a jacket. No
one would ever know that you're not simply

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:59.039
wearing a neckstrap. The Sax Practice Harness™
secures around the torso at the base of the

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.320
ribcage. The webbing strap adjusts easily
to fit nearly any body size without restricting

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.250
breathing and airflow, and the quick release
buckle gets you in and out of the harness

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.940
in a snap. The benefit of fastening the harness
in this fashion is it keeps the length of

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.550
the strap consistent, regardless of how you
move about. It also allows you to sit back

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.420
comfortably in a chair while using the Sax
Practice Harness™. Other harnesses that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.810
fasten at the waist change length as the shoulders
move up, down, forward or backward. But the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.220
Sax Practice Harness™ maintains a constant
length, helping to ensure a consistent embouchure.

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.700
Before use, the shoulder pads of the Sax Practice
Harness™ will need to be bent to conform

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.530
to your body shape. Often this is more easily
accomplished without a strap portion attached.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.780
So simply squeeze both sides of the quick
disconnects to release the strap and hook,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.100
which can be placed aside until needed later.
We find that the best way to start to form

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.540
the shoulder pads is to position the middle
of the pad across your leg and bend it around

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.840
the leg to create the basic hook shape.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.740
Once
this is done, drape the harness across both

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.310
shoulders. At this point, the pads can be
fine-tuned for a truly custom fit. You may

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.340
find this easier to do with the help of a
friend. Remember that the aluminum goes all

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.490
the way to the base of the leather backpiece
and even this portion can be bent to fit your

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.810
body. Once the shoulder pads have been formed,
place them over your shoulders and wrap the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.660
torso strap around your body. You will want
the strap to go around the base of the rib

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.820
cage. This will help to ensure a proper fit.
Fasten the quick release buckle and then pull

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.770
the loose end of the webbing to take up the
slack. You'll want the torso strap to be snug,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.400
but it does not need to be too tight. Take
a few test breaths to make sure that it remains

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.490
comfortable and make any adjustments that
you may need. The extra webbing can be taken

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.960
up with the triglide buckle. If there's too
much extra webbing left after fitting the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.180
Sax Practice Harness™, the excess can be
trimmed with a pair of sharp scissors and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.760
the ends seared with a lighter to prevent
fraying. Now it's time to put the strap and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.290
hook assembly back onto the harness. Making
sure that pull tab ends of the webbing are

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:26.990
to the front, simply snap the quick disconnects
back together. Place your instrument onto

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:32.460
the swivel hook. To adjust the length of the
strap, simply grasp the webbing loop on either

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.020
side and pull to shorten the strap. The adjustment
can be pulled from either or both sides. To

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.180
lengthen the strap, simply place a finger
beneath the ladder-lock connector and lift

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.640
it, and then pull gently on the hook. The
Sax Practice Harness™ allows a full range

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:55.120
of movement for unprecedented freedom while
playing. The hook freely adjusts from side-to-side,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.760
and since it wears like a neck strap, you're
free to bring your horn upward and forward

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.540
as well. Don't forget that since the Sax Practice
Harness™ conforms to your body, you'll be

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.180
able to play comfortably while seated. Go
ahead and sit back in your chair--you won't

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.680
feel like you're in traction and unable to
relax.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.340
Part of the beauty of the Sax Practice Harness™
is its compatibility with Neotech's Neo-Hook

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.210
system. Neotech's Universal Strap allows musicians
to change hook styles and lengths, simply

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.430
by changing to the Neo-Hook Connector of their
choice. Choose from swivel hooks, open PVC-coated

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.150
metal hooks on webbing or cord, or Neotech's
exclusive Loop Connector. All you have to

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.610
do is unfasten the Sax Practice Harness's
strap and hook assembly and replace it with

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.180
the Neo-Hook of your choice, and you're ready
to play.
