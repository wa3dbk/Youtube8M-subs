00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.240
Lee Miller, he met when she came to Paris

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.900
She was a model and photographer

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.440
She wasn’t much interested in modelling

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.380
and someone suggested to her that she should meet Man Ray

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.320
She sort of walked into a room and picked
up Man Ray

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.740
She basically got up to him and said

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.280
I’m going to be your student

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.640
Although there are different stories

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.960
she was last credited for being the one that opened the studio door and let the light in

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.980
and basically affected the photos, and then his style was created

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.660
It looks very slightly nautical, do you know what I mean?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.560
It looks a bit sinister

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.394
Do you think?

00:00:54.394 --> 00:00:55.094
Yeah

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.400
I think it’s like it’s washed up on the beach

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.780
Reminds me of jetties with rusting metals

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.560
It’s the white

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.300
It’s the white, yeah

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.160
It looks like it’s been in the sea, and it’s got salt on it

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.000
That’s funny, because I’ve got a bit of lead and it hasn’t gone like that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.360
Do you think he did something?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.620
I’d say, well, perhaps it is salt air

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.820
The sea is always about separation and departure, isn’t it?

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:19.320
Yeah

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.360
Knowledge of departure, somehow

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.420
People say that that romantic, sensual period lasts anything from a year and a half to three years

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.800
but it’s, kind of, in your memory bank, so it’s like that sensuality has been banked

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.160
but it’s dead

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.480
The bits of rope

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.020
I wonder if it’s like…

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.780
A noose

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.020
Yeah

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.760
Apparently, the break-up nearly sent him mad

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.660
I think he took a photograph of himself, like, pretending to hang himself

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.080
With a gun, and a noose

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.360
Oh…with a rope around his neck

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.600
Well, that’s what’s in his head. In my head, it’s, I want to carry these lips around with me

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.000
Well, this…well, he did do that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.680
He did a painting that took him two years

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.460
He would wake up every morning, and it’s her red lips floating in the sky

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.960
Those lips, like that love can be freeing, it’s like the sky, it’s limitless

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.940
She’s as beautiful as a mackerel

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.340
She’s as beautiful as the mackerel

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.900
Yeah

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.300
In the instance before I wake up

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.480
when I detach myself from my body

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.660
I meet you in the neutral light

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.020
I kiss you with everything that is still left of me

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.780
my own lips

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.420
He knew that he would see those lips again

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.640
maybe not in the same way

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.320
but maybe it was to remind him that

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.280
the lips once made him feel like that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.020
That’s super-sweet to be able to remember what you had

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.740
and be friends with it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.940
They actually remained friends until the end of their lives

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.580
Well, if you do a piece of art like that, it, kind of, seals the deal for friendship, at least

00:02:50.774 --> 00:02:51.274
Hmm

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.500
It looks quite still in a way, but almost like a mausoleum

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.780
there you go, I’ve put the thing that I absolutely adored about her, and probably obsessed about her

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.140
But it’s peaceful

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.560
Do you think we’re like that, still?

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.360
Well, no we haven’t put it to bed yet, have we?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.860
Okay

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.080
Can we go somewhere else, now?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.580
Sure

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.080
Okay

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.400
But I was being Lee Miller

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.980
Well, no

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.720
No, no, no, you’re Man Ray, I’m sorry, you’re Man Ray

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.880
you’re not Lee Miller. I’m Lee Miller, you’re Man Ray
