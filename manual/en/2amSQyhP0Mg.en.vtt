00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.840
Here's an idea.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.470
Animated GIFs are
an important part

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.230
of the presidential election.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.935
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.520
Before we get started, I want
to get one thing out of the way.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.500
I say "giff."

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:12.690
Maybe you say "jiff."

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.692
That is just fine.

00:00:13.692 --> 00:00:15.400
If you want to argue
about pronunciation,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.400
you can do it on this other
video that we've made.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.660
But here, we have more
important things to talk about.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.826
Things like animated fire,
under construction signs,

00:00:21.826 --> 00:00:24.864
and waving flags, the ancestors
to the modern, full frame

00:00:24.864 --> 00:00:25.905
GIFs we're used to today.

00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:26.170
[MUSIC - CHER, "BELIEVE"]

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.940
Much like Cher, the GIF has
had many a makeover, many

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.530
waxes and wanes in popularity.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.040
It's matured quite a bit to
get to where it is today.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.070
As technology has grown
up to better accommodate

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.802
sharing and making GIFs, we've
found more uses for them.

00:00:37.802 --> 00:00:39.260
We use them as
emotional shorthand,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.910
in blog post banners, as
movie posters, wedding photos,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.370
and of course, as tools for
making well-informed decisions

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.411
about electing the next
leader of the free world.

00:00:46.411 --> 00:00:47.930
OK, let's rewind a little.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.835
GIFs in the news
aren't exactly news.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.960
If they were, we probably
would've seen GIFs of it.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.780
If you spend your evenings,
lunch breaks, or math class

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.499
on the internet-- looking at
you, Mr. Monfre's class-- then

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.790
you almost certainly saw
animated GIFs of the Olympics,

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.450
the Mars landing,
the NBA finals,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.560
or Felix jumping from space.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.180
Like most animated
GIF subject matter,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.640
these things were cool
and fun and terrifying and

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.150
heartbreaking and dreamy.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.650
Then we started
seeing animated GIFs

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.550
from a decidedly
different kind of event--

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.330
from political
conventions, events

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.600
not usually considered fun or
cool, though maybe terrifying.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.740
The animated GIF began
edging its way into capital

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.040
P, Political, capital N,
News, and it edged its way

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.410
all the way to the debates.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.121
Tonight on capital P, Political,
capital N, News, Political

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:29.620
News.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.935
Animated GIFs are everywhere.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:34.420
GIFs of just, well,
dudes saying things.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.989
No one flipping around or
busting a move or anything.

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:39.030
I mean, some of them are
funny, but a lot of them

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.980
are just these two
guys, saying stuff.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.520
The GIF is normally some
small piece of visual popcorn.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.380
A debate seems like an
awful candidate for GIFing,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.700
Unless Mr. GIF is involved.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.870
We want information
from a debate.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.450
I mean, we also
want to subject it

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.408
to the endless meme-ification
of everyday life,

00:01:54.408 --> 00:01:56.660
but that is another "Idea
Channel" episode entirely.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.110
Is the GIF even capable
of delivering information?

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.700
I mean, like useful information.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.200
Maybe.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.230
We've come a long way
since the first televised

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.585
presidential debate in 1960
between Richard Nixon and JFK.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:09.960
That marked a turning point
where presidential candidates

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.962
not only had to sound
smart but also look smart.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:14.920
Since then, the importance
of these two factors

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.530
seems to have shifted.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.240
The focus of debates has moved
from politics to performance.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.570
Gaffs, reactions, one-liners.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.290
The news media presents us with
quotes and video clips that

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.040
are disembodied from the
speaker or from context

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.680
reduced to sound bites.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.700
And that's exactly
what a GIF is,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.520
a thing to be repeated
and taken at face value

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.830
without a relationship
to other ideas.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.040
But a GIF is also more
complete than quotes on paper

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.870
because the words
are again reunited

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.550
with the actions and attitude
of the person who spoke them.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.220
It's more context
than no context

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.260
and is infinitely rewatchable
in comparison to video,

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.239
so it's sort of the cause-of
and solution-to a bunch

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.530
of really interesting problems.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.080
Being the president is maybe
the most complicated job,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.400
one which is certainly
not reducible to a set

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.110
of lo-fi moving images.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870
In a way, the GIF is
helping to chip away

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.950
at context where we need it the
most, electing the person who

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.600
sits behind the big red button.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.580
Get off my plane.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.190
Now, can you really say
that the animated GIF will

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.770
have an effect on the election?

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.099
You could, but you'd probably
be exaggerating a lot.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.390
Every piece of information
in an election is important,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.600
and GIFs are clearly
not the most important,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.270
unless undecided voters in Ohio
said they were, in which case

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.020
they would then become
the most important.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.580
But you can definitely say this.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.500
We've watched the
animated GIF grow up

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.790
from this jovial tyke
to this young man

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.519
to this fellow to this
powerful gentleman.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.060
And while GIFs used to be made
by the leet haxors in the days

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.434
of Usenet, they're now made
by employees of "The New York

00:03:39.434 --> 00:03:41.540
Times" and "The Atlantic,"
reported on by "Forbes"

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.789
and "The Wall Street Journal."

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:45.720
The time where there is an
official campaign GIF-maker

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.940
doesn't feel too far off.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.620
This is a decidedly
lofty and uncertain turn

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.440
for our old pal, the GIF,
meant for quick consumption,

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.872
easy sharing, and
simple messages.

00:03:53.872 --> 00:03:55.330
And whether animated
GIFs are going

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.110
to do politics any favors when
it seems to need them the most,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.140
I don't know.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.640
We'll see.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.598
What do you guys think?

00:04:01.598 --> 00:04:04.030
Are animated GIFs useful
for capital P, Political,

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.100
capital N, News?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.592
Let us know in the comments.

00:04:06.592 --> 00:04:08.800
And if you haven't rage-quit
from my pronunciation of

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.680
GIF-- "giff," "giff."

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.440
Please subscribe.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.852
I am still trapped in Brooklyn,
but that didn't stop me

00:04:14.852 --> 00:04:15.870
from reading all your comments.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.930
We'll see what you guys had to
say about CSS as [? fashion.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.260
Ben Chong makes a really
interesting point about code

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.060
not necessarily being an art,
but being more of a component

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.200
to an art, which makes
sense, especially

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.830
given his comparison of paints.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.500
We don't call paint an art work.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.166
But some people might take issue
with this, because there are so

00:04:31.166 --> 00:04:33.240
many different styles
and brands of code

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.440
that you might be able to
call certain kinds of code

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.280
more artful.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.860
I don't know.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.890
It's a really interesting
distinction to make.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.570
To Salmon Synth.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.230
I actually used to
live in Vermont too,

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.190
and they were everywhere.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.820
Maybe you live in the town
with the "no weird windows"

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.580
ordinance.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.280
Noveltyent talks about the fads
and fashions of user design

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.460
and how a lot of the modern ones
are influenced by technology

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.300
like mobile phones.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.660
And this actually makes me
think, what are websites

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.550
going to look like once Google
Glass is a thing that everybody

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.620
has and we're looking at
websites at the same time

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.804
as we're looking
at the real world?

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:06.459
Who knows.

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:08.000
Besides making the
very salient point

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.050
that markup does not
technically count as code,

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:12.320
mindvise makes a really
interesting distinction

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.660
between fashion and
marketing and kind of wonders

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.550
whether or not brands
can have fashion.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.300
I'm sure there's
some sort of way

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.460
that you can spin it
through, like, sort of ideas

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.820
of adornment and expression.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:25.370
And now that
corporations are people,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.870
I'm sure that complicates the
whole thing, but I don't know.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.390
It's an interesting--
it's an interesting thing

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:30.131
to think about.

00:05:30.131 --> 00:05:31.880
Give me a second before
I answer this one.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.020
I just need to use
my GPS system to find

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.545
the nearest ATM machine, where
I will enter my PIN number.

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:38.920
On a slightly more
personal note,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.920
I just want to say
thank you to everybody

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.397
who has voiced their
support and concern for me

00:05:43.397 --> 00:05:44.980
and the rest of the
Idea Channel team.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.680
It really actually
does mean a lot.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.940
You have given me many feels.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.092
So thank you for being awesome.

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:53.550
Idea Channel updates
might still be

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.130
a little slow over the next
week and week and a half.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.430
Hopefully not, but
we'll keep you updated

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.329
on Twitter and through YouTube.

00:06:00.329 --> 00:06:02.120
And of course, if you're
on the east coast,

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.420
stay safe and good luck.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.830
Thank you.
