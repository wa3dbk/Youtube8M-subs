00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.220
Hi Guys.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.870
I’ve got something special today.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.019
I’m going to be unboxing Samsung’s latest
superphone, the Galaxy S3.

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.430
So, this is the Galaxy S3.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.380
The version I’ve got here is the marble
white one.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.070
There’s also a pebble blue, basically a
dark blue.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.289
It comes in this nice, simple white box.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.269
There’s the Samsung Galaxy S3 logo on the
front.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.390
And on the back you get some specs for the
phone.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.929
This is the 16GB model.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.260
4.8 inch HD Super AMOLED screen
GPS and GLONASS based navigation system

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.020
8 megapixel rear camera with autofocus
1.9 megapixel front camera

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.060
2100 mAh battery.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.980
And it’s going to be running Android 4,
Ice Cream Sandwich.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.170
You also get this introduction right at the
top.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.920
It sees, listens, knows, shares.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.160
Stays awake when you do.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.550
Responds to your words.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.210
Keeps track of loved ones.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.829
Lets you re-live every moment.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.870
Samsung Galaxy S3.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:02.870
Nice box.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.610
Let’s see what’s inside.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.420
So the first thing you see is that 4.8 inch
Super AMOLED screen.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.540
It’s slim and light.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.500
You can see the corners are rounded, which
is a change from the S2.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.540
The back’s nice and smooth,
But not much grip.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.830
The back cover is removable, just like in
the Galaxy S2 and Note.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.070
Okay, so let’s see what else is in the box.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.740
Everything else is sort of tucked away underneath
this flap.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.590
First we’ve got a standard warranty card/booklet.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130
the quick start guide, with some basic instructions

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.850
There’s the microUSB to USB data and charging
cable.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.070
A power plug;
Standard earphones.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.460
You also get different sizes of earphone buds
— small , medium, and large.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.060
The 2100 mAH battery
And that’s everything in the box.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.060
Back to the phone.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.869
I’ll just take this screen cover off
The large screen really stands out on this

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.580
pebble-like body.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.840
On the top, we’ve got all the sensors and
the front camera.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.290
Below the screen there’s the physical home
button, which is thinner than the one on the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.290
S2.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.090
There’s also the two capacitive buttons,
menu and back.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.349
We’ve got the volume rocker to the left,
And the power button to the right.

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.250
The microUSB port and primary microphone are
at the bottom.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.670
And at the top there’s the 3.5mm headphone
jack, and noise cancelling mic.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.590
There’s also this little section here to
help open the back case.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.500
There’s the 8 megapixel camera, LED flash
and speaker all in a row.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.850
The camera is really flat, nearly flush against
the back casing.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.910
I’m going to open it up now and see what’s
inside.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.209
Again, the back cover is a little thin, just
like on the S2 and Note.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.489
We’ve got the battery slot there.

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.130
You get a 2100 mAh battery with it.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.580
And here you can see the slots for the microSD
card and a microSIM.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.810
It can take up to 32 gigabytes on a microSD
card.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.300
So on the 16 gigabyte model like this one,
you’ll end up with 48 gigabyte total onboard

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.940
storage.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.319
That screen’s looking quite nice.

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.099
So that was just a quick overview of the S3.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.269
I hope you liked it.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.451
I’ll be uploading an in-depth comparison
between the S3 and the HTC One X soon, so

00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:33.150
stay tuned for that.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.710
I’ll also be doing a full user experience
review for the S3, to give you a better idea

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.610
of what the phone’s like.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.440
So don’t forget to subscribe for that.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.430
And if you liked this video, press the like
button.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.930
I’ll see you in the next one.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.340
Bye.
