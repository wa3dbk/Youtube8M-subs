Hi, my name is Cindy Krum

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.359
and I'm the CEO of Mobile Moxie. 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.939
We offer a number of mobile marketing tools, but
one of the most popular is the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.210
mobile phone emulator tool.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.669
Like all of our tools instructions are available

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:25.989
at the top either 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.490
in text, or under

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.109
a plus box.  In general though simply

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.390
in a URL, then decide which phones you
would like

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.740
to see that website displayed on. We have of 
about 50 phones (WAP phone, feature phone, mobile phone)  

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.360
and you can choose 3 at a time.  For this
example we will look at

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.240
the mobile MTV site, which is 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.830
m.mtv.com.  And we'll see what

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.650
it looks like on an Apple iPhone 3G

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.350
on a Blackberry Curve, and on

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.350
a Droid Incredible. Once you've entered the URL
and chosen your phones hit the compare button and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.570
just wait for a second. There is a lot of 
computing going on

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.570
in the background. Results will show up below the phone
options, so just scroll down. You can see that the 1st 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.220
result is the Apple iPhone 3G. On the left is the phone

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.350
and on the right are a lot of vital statistics

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.850
that your developers might need to know how to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.970
build a website for this phone. You can scroll up 
and down on the page

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.030
and use the on-site functionality, but you can't click
any of the links or it will 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.340
take you off the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.020
emulator and to that page. You can see how different
the site looks on

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.300
these 3 phones.  If you ever need to know

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.340
more about any of the phones or

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.660
they work, you can click on the phone name to get a
full spec list and all the information what will

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.570
and won't work on that particular phone.  To try
