00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:08.707
Are you sleeping or are you awake

00:00:09.706 --> 00:00:10.471
I was sleeping, man

00:00:10.721 --> 00:00:12.725
Yes I saw it, you were sleeping

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.233
A nice nap in the car

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:16.208
A nice nap? Are you having a nap every afternoon?

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.691
When it's possible, I do

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.389
I'm tired

00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.108
Oh, you're tired

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:20.410
Yes

00:00:20.952 --> 00:00:23.615
So this is how a tired Royston Drenthe looks like?

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.358
Yeah

00:00:29.257 --> 00:00:29.907
Well, this is it then

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:30.836
Yes

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:33.506
Everton

00:00:34.132 --> 00:00:35.410
This is now your club, man

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:36.850
This is my cluppy yeah

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:39.079
What do you think of it?

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:40.611
It's quite a beautiful stadium

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:42.120
Royston look at it man

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:42.492
It's top

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.070
This alone ey

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.882
Only this alone, Royston

00:00:46.432 --> 00:00:50.363
You'd have wanted this too eh, I see it
- Feel this

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.548
(...)

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:55.147
This is so..that you think like

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:56.239
-..whoppa, go

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:57.469
Yes, wanting to go for it

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.860
Good noise coming from this stadium

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:01.347
When it's going down here?

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:02.067
Yeah, it's not normal

00:01:02.578 --> 00:01:03.622
It's really not normal

00:01:04.202 --> 00:01:05.968
There's coming a noise...

00:01:12.377 --> 00:01:14.838
Are we going to see you again in the Dutch team or not, what's up with that?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.393
I would like to know that

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:18.089
I'm going to do my best

00:01:18.089 --> 00:01:18.948
Here's where it's going to happen.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.155
Here it's going to happen?

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:21.827
You're going to show it here?

00:01:21.942 --> 00:01:22.408
For sure, I hope so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.241
And then Van Marwijk can't ignore you anymore?

00:01:24.846 --> 00:01:26.750
-That's how it's going to be?
-That's what I want yes

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.166
Here

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.371
-Our true blue
-Our true blue

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.485
Here, lifelong Evertonian

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.151
So when you have died, they scatter your ashes here

00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:39.126
And you'll get a plate

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:42.725
And then you're sitting at the field of Everton, forever

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.326
This is something you've taught me, I didn't know this, seriously

00:01:45.279 --> 00:01:46.278
I think this is something beautiful

00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:51.292
After the game I immediately said this was the Feyenoord feeling that I've always had and have missed for so long

00:01:51.292 --> 00:01:52.176
I missed that at Real Madrid

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.289
Really that..real supporting

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:55.728
And you've got that here?

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:58.212
The real hooligans who stand at your side

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:59.838
Good or bad times

00:01:59.838 --> 00:02:01.487
Good or bad ball

00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:03.483
Good or bad pass

00:02:03.692 --> 00:02:04.320
It doesn't matter?

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:07.617
- They go through the fire with you
- Through thick and thin
- Until the final whistle
