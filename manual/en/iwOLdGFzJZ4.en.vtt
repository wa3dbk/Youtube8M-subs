00:00:32.067 --> 00:00:35.333
 Today we're going to be talking
about the Celli Spader, which is

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:37.000
an implement from Italy.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.500
It's designed for primary and
secondary tillage, and it's

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.700
considered a conservation
tillage tool, because it is much

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.900
easier on the soil.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.700
You don't end up with a
compaction layer, because of the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.800
way that it tills the soil.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.200
The way that the Spader works
is: it's a series of these small

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.933
spades, or shovels, that
are mounted on an eccentric.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.700
So instead of spinning like a
roto tiller, they actually just

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.433
pivot, and the spade will take
a bite of soil and then kick it

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:17.467
back to this flap,
where it shatters.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:20.700
When you're setting this up,
it's really important that the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
Spader be level
from side to side.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.933
And then it's also important
that you have the tilt adjusted

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:31.000
with your top link so that your
gearbox, which is right here, is

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.867
level when the spader is
engaged with the ground.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.300
The depth can be adjusted.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.200
It has these shoes on both sides
of the spader, which regulate

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.733
how deep the implement
goes into the soil.

00:01:43.733 --> 00:01:48.367
It's important when you're using
the spader, to make sure that

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.400
you engage the PTO while the
spader is up off of the ground.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.333
If you engage the PTO with the
spader in the soil, you're going

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.433
to put a lot of pressure on
the equipment and you could

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.900
potentially damage the
spader or your tractor.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.267
This spader is
sized for our tractor.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:10.800
So our wheels are on 72- inch
centers, and that's the size of

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.067
our spader, because you want
the spader to cover up

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.833
your tire tracks.

00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:20.400
After the initial pass with the
spader, you're going to wait a

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.067
week to even two weeks to allow
your residue to break down, and

00:02:25.067 --> 00:02:28.733
then you'll go in for a second
pass for your secondary tillage.

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:32.167
This second pass, you can lift
the shoes up a little bit, so

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:34.700
that the spader's not
going quite as deep.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.700
And the goal to create a finer
bed for transplanting or direct

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.767
seeding into.

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:44.400
You may have to go in for a
third pass, if you're doing

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.467
direct seeding and you
need a finer seedbed.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:50.933
Advantages of the spader are
that it's better for your soil,

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.700
and that you can get in when the
soil is a little bit wetter than

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.700
you could if you were using
traditional tillage tools, such

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.633
as a moldboard plow and disks,
or even a chisel plow and disks.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.600
Disadvantages are that it's
more expensive, and that

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.233
it's also slower.

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.967
If you figure the fastest that
you can go is a mile and a half

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:11.200
per hour, then you're going to
be taking more time to cover the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.267
same amount of distance
that you would with

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:16.800
traditional tillage tools.
