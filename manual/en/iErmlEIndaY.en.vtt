00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.620
[open logo]
Hello everyone, this is meteorologist Dave

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.799
Snider at the Anchorage Alaska National Weather
Service Forecast Office TV Desk.

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.120
[wrn]
This is a 6-10 day outlook for Alaska based

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.049
on climate connections and changes we're seeing
for the first week of November.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.110
[recap]
Alaska has been working through an unusual

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.860
weather period brought to us by sharp change
in the jet stream pattern like what you see

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.910
here from 3 weeks ago.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.860
The period was full of warm, wet weather making
it feel more like mid-September rather than

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.860
mid-October.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.270
[outlook jet]
We're looking forward now to something a bit

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.610
more "normal".

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.430
The jet stream pattern for the first week
of November should look more like this, a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.070
flatter storm track flow that keeps weather
moving along.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.940
[precip anomaly]
For expected precipitation... amounts should

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.350
generally be typical or at least not excessive
for the season.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.530
We see a decreased chance of big Bering Sea
storms during this period, but it's a progressive

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.149
weather pattern with more day-to-day variability
than previous weeks.

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.930
And we're still watching an active typhoon
season in the West Pacific.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.600
[temp anomaly]
Temperatures should be closer to what you'd

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.140
consider normal in your area for early November.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.330
Keep in mind...

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.900
most areas will therefore be much colder than
the weather of recent weeks... in other words

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.369
...Winter's chill should be setting in if
it hasn't yet.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.039
The one place where temps may be a bit off
the beaten path would be along the Chuckchi

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.530
Sea Coast, where the lack of sea ice is playing
a role in the sensible weather right now.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.170
[impacts]
With this storm track and general trends,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.579
we expect that the winter snow pack over much
of mainland Alaska will begin to be established.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.860
Exceptions would be for Southcentral coast
and lower terrain of Southeast that don't

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.399
have good snow chances in the coming days.

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.899
This is good news for subsistence activities
and the Alaska way of life in Winter.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:40.899
[sst?]

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.250
Freeze up in the interior should be working
toward completion... and be well on the way

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.369
for Southcentral and Southwest Alaska.

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.259
With the length of daylight decreasing rapidly...
sea surface temperatures are dropping rapidly.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.450
And sea ice formation is progressing... including
in the protected waters south of the Bering

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.450
Strait.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.639
[close office shots]
Remember, this is a broad look at a developing

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:02.009
weather pattern 6 to 10 days in advance.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.889
This information is not meant to be specific...
you should continue to monitor information

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:09.509
from the National Weather Service offices
in Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau in the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.379
coming days for watches, warnings and advisories.

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.330
You can do that by going to weather.gov, using
your NOAA weather radio... or tuning into

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.760
the Alaska Weather show or your favorite local
tv and radio stations.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.700

Thanks for sharing this message with your

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.549
Alaska friends and letting us know about the
impacts you're seeing in your community.

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.709
This is NWS Meteorologist Dave Snider... thanks
for watching.
