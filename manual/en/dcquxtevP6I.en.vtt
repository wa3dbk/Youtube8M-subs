00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.400
VO: If you like catching fish

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.400
on Missouri trout season’s
opening day

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.400
you’d better like something else,
too: company, and lots of it.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.400
At Missouri’s four spring-fed
trout parks in the Ozarks,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.400
anglers are often shoulder
-to-shoulder that first day.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.400
Following weekends
are busy, too.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.400
The daily reward though,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.400
is the possibility
of several take-home trout.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.400
- I got them lures
in the truck.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.400
VO: But if you enjoy
more casting room

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.400
and the quiet that comes with it
you might want to fish

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.400
during catch-and-release season,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.400
weekends from mid-November
through mid February.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.400
You won’t be leaving with
a stringer full of fish,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.400
but the easy-going experience
might more than make up for it.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
- You don’t have to fight
the crowds.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.900
Nobody’s down here
this time of year,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.900
especially on Super Bowl weekend.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.900
The fun’s really in catching
the fish and the stalk, I guess.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.900
I have as much fun

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
coming down here letting ém go
as I do eating ém.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
- There are a lot of anglers that
even during the regular season,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.100
when they could keep fish,
choose not to.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.900
They enjoy the sport that much

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.900
that they’d rather
release that fish

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.900
with the possibility of catching
him again later

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
rather than taking him home
and putting him in the freezer.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.900
- You get long periods of boredom,
then you catch a fish,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900
and that’s what it’s all about.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.900
The five minutes of having
a fish on the line

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.900
is worth a couple of hours
of freezing,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.900
chipping the ice off your guides
and standing all day.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.900
Of course it’s pretty, too:
trees on the ground,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.900
you can see up in the woods.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.900
And you don’t have a lot
of people getting in the way,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
kind of the solitude, I guess,
that makes it all worth it.
