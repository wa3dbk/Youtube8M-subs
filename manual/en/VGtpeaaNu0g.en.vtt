00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:20.240
Long-awaited, major reconstruction of the Interstate 694/Highway 10 interchange at Snelling Avenue (Highway 51) and Hamline Avenue in Arden Hills began Monday, Sept. 19, 2011.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.190
The project includes reconstruction of the surrounding roadways between Interstate 35W and Victoria Street. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.240
In addition to rebuilding the surrounding highways, the project will rebuild bridges in the corridor, 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:42.280
separate the two roadways and replace left entrances and right exits to conform to current standards and improve safety and mobility.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.250
Weâ€™ll start our westward journey just east of Victoria Street in Shoreview. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:57.200
Two new bridges are being built to carry interstate 694 traffic over the Island Lake Channel. They will open to traffic by late fall of 2013.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.080
Continuing west on I-694, we reach Lexington Avenue. 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:11.080
The Lexington Avenue bridge will be widened on the east side to allow for for the creation of two new left turn lanes onto both directions of I-694,

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.100
and an improved bicycle/pedestrian crossing.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.200
Motorists traveling on northbound Snelling Avenue will find two new loops at the roadway's interchange at I-694.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:31.150
The loops will allow traffic traveling west on either roadway to remain in the proper lanes, thus eliminating weaving movements.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:40.130
Motorists traveling Eastbound on I-694 or Highway 10 will be separated from each other to lessen congestion and improve safety.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:48.150
Eastbound traffic on Highway 10 will be able to exit on southbound Snelling Avenue or continue onto I-694.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:59.280
Two new bridges are also being constructed to carry I-694 traffic over Ramsey County Road 76/Old Highway 10.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:09.240
Ramsey County Road 96 will be lowered approximately 22 feet to allow Highway 10 to travel over County Road 96 at a new partial interchange. 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:20.050
The new interchange will only allow movement between westbound County Road 96 and westbound Highway 10 and from eastbound Highway 10 to County Road 96. 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.030
A new intersection at County Road 96 and old Highway 10 will allow local access at a new signal system.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:41.020
During work on the Highway 10/County Road 96 interchange in 2013, mndot will place a new nine inch unbonded concrete surface on the highway 10 diagonal providing a smoother longer lasting surface.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:52.260
At Interstate 35W, two new bridges will carry Highway 10 and County Road 10 traffic over the interstate. They will be built and open to traffic by the fall of 2012.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.250
Completing our journey in Mounds View, the bridge at County Road H will be rebuilt during the 2015 construction season.  

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:14.000
Additional information on the I-694 North Central projects, including staging and layouts, is available on the web at www.mndot.gov.
