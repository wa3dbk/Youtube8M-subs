Hey guys, How is it going? Juan Arango here I just want to make a quick tutorial video

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.070
about what I think it's the right way to
play a whole lotta love by Led Zeppelin

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.470

I've seen people play this review bunch

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.199
of times

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:30.610
and you should people who play like this
I love

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.750

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.230

I am

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.770
this one little thing did you paged us
on the recording

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.870

really makes a difference

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.260
when he played the deal don't on the
rest up on love is not right here lol

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.090
he didn't display you know fifth during
the 5th fret home

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.460
he actually played that with the force 3

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.030

like

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.570

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.140
an what he did was he actually

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.160
bed the stream a little bit I

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.810
while still playing the open the stream
I

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.460

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.830
hear that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.830
