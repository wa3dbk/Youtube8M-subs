00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Intro music]

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.230
The paysanne cut is not a very

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.120
sophisticated cut.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.210
Depending on the vegetable, the shape of

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.250
the cut can be either square, triangle,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.060
half-moon shape, circle and so on.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.210
So the idea really is to have everything small,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.140
up to 2 millimeters for the rectangle

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.180
or for long shapes, and it can be square

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.260
up to a centimeter.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.080
Now the idea really is to have everything

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.060
fitting a tablespoon when you eat your soup.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.280
So here I have different types of vegetable cuts.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.210
Let's have a look.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.190
Green beans, so they're cut into circles.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.100
Celery, triangles and squares.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100
Same thing for the carrots.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Green cabbage, long rectangles.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.010
Leeks, same thing.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.130
Square of turnips, with a few triangles.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.100
And potatoes, same shape.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.070
To cut the carrots into paysanne,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.070
you want to have many small pieces.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.220
So cut them in half.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.290
Cut the thinnest part lengthwise

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:31.000
into four pieces. [cutting sounds]

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.090
Then put them together.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.240
Position your finger, claw position.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.110
And cut it into little triangles.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.030
Cut the other part lengthwise into

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:53.280
three pieces. Put them all together.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.030
Position your hand in a claw position.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.000
And cut it. [cutting sounds]

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.040
So as you can see a paysanne can be

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.290
square or triangle for carrots.

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.230
So repeat the operation

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.000
with the remaining carrots.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.250
To cut your turnips into paysanne

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.040
you need to cut them into a square of

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.020
5 millimeters, which is exactly the same

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.290
size as macedoine. Let me show you.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.140
Cut your turnips into 5 millimeter slices.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:49.110
[cutting sounds] Then cut your slices

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:57.280
into 5 millimeter sticks. Rotate.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.220
Don't worry about the trimmings or the corners.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.110
Then cut each sticks into 5 millimeter squares.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:14.040
And repeat the operation for all the slices.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.000
[cutting sounds]

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.190
To cut your leek into paysanne

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.010
you will need to wash it first.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.120
And then because you have split it

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.190
in order to wash it, then you're going to

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.000
go through and you're going to

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.110
divide the larger leaves.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:42.020
Like this one for example or that one.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:53.090
[slicing sounds] And this one. Good.
57
00:03:53,090 --&gt; 00:03:35,010
Put them all together. Hold it.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:57.100
Position your finger very well on the

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:13.270
claw position. And slice it. [slicing sounds]

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.180
I like the smell of leeks. it's very fragrant.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:25.210
And then the white part. [slicing sounds]

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.240
And then cut it into four pieces.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.280
And divide it. [slicing sounds]

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.000
And cut almost to the root end

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.180
and discard this.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.060
If the recipe calls for the white part of the leek,

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.130
you will have to use this part.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.030
But if a recipe calls for the green part of the leek,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.090
then you will have to use this part.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.040
Now, if the recipe doesn't precise,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.270
it's because you have to use both.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.210
That simple.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.230
To cut the celery into paysanne,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.220
first of all there's something I like to do

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.060
before using celery ribs is to peel them.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.130
So with a paring knife I am going just to

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.170
get the strings. So like so.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.230
There I'm picking up the strings

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.130
and this is pretty tough.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.200
I like to remove it all the time.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:29.140
Let's take another one. Good.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.000
And remove the leaves too.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.260
Cut the celery in half.

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:40.290
Then cut it into little sticks lengthwise.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:45.260
And finally into little cubes or rectangles

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.030
about 4 millimeters, 4 - 5 millimeters pieces.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.110
And if a rib is bigger, just divide it in two.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:12.230
There we go. [slicing sounds]

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.250
Do the same with the remaining ribs.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.060
To cut a green cabbage into paysanne,

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.250
so take a quarter of the cabbage

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.290
that has been cored and washed.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.240
Cut the cabbage into a centimeter and a half

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.270
section or about half-inch sections.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.170
And as you see the cabbage is so tight.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.150
Okay. So it's going to stay together

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.200
and it's going to cut into many small pieces.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.020
The pieces seem to be big for paysanne,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.040
but the cabbage is going to shrink

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.180
while cooking. So it's going to reduce.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:59.200
So make sure you keep your fingers into a

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.070
claw position and you watch what you're doing.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.010
A green bean paysanne will be something

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.100
you will be using as a garnish in a potage,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.030
such as Potage Cultivateur

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.280
So the shape of the paysanne will be round

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.000
because of the shape of the green beans.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.180
So take a few green beans,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.210
maybe a couple green beans at a time

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.130
and place them together

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.050
and you're just going to slice them

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.170
into about 2 to 3 millimeter slices. Okay.

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:41.210
[slicing sounds]

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.100
To hold your green beans position your

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.260
index finger and thumb on each side

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.090
and position the rest of the fingers

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:57.040
on the claw position over and slice. [slicing sounds]
