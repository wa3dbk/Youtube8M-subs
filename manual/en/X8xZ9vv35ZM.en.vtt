What’s going on?

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.280

Today we are learning juggling tricks; a very
fancy, advanced way to start juggling with

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.040
your feet.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.160
This is what it looks like.

[Freestyle Football]

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.520
You probably will never attempt this soccer
ball juggling trick in a game.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.470
This is just a fun way to learn soccer, challenge
your skills and show off in front of your

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.110
friends at training.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.040
Key Points:
Key Point 1.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.090
Line the ball up with the upper inside part
of your foot, about where the base of your

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.210
toes are.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.410
The ball should be 7-10 inches away.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.090
Key Point 2.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:57.290
Toe studs on the ball, your heel turned away
from your shin.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:07.170
Key Point 3.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.990
Roll ball across quickly to make it ramp over
your plant foot.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.699
Key Point 4.

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:19.130
Bring kicking leg around plant leg with the
inside of your foot facing up to make contact

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.130
and start juggling

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.970
You need a Soccer Ball.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.269
Soccer Exercise Player Can Do:
Start off practicing the motion of this trick

00:01:30.269 --> 00:01:32.140
first without the ball.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.240
Once you feel good about your technique the
next step is to break this move into two parts.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.680
First part is to roll the ball across your
plant foot and get the ball to ramp up over

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.050
your foot.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.380
Once that is going smooth, then do the first
part and add in the second part of bring your

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.420
kicking foot around your plant leg to start
juggling the ball to complete the trick.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.400
Repeat until you have mastered it.

What Football Player Could Be Doing Wrong:
If the ball is popping straight up or going

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.249
in the opposite direction of where you want
it to go on the pop you are hitting the wrong

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.339
part of your foot.

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:39.529
If you hit closer to your heel that’s like
the ball hitting a wall.

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.819
You want to hit the ball near the base of
your toes so that part of your foot acts like

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.539
a ramp and causes the ball to pop up and go
over your foot.

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:49.199
Bonus Tips!

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:54.709
Mastering this trick is easier in tennis shoes
on concrete because you get a better bounce

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.800
off your foot.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.770
If you do this move in the grass make sure
you are not in thick grass because if you

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.429
are your foot will be buried in the grass
and you won’t get that ball ramping action

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:06.429
going!

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.569
This trick is very difficult so don’t get
discouraged.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.020
Keep practicing and have fun trying it!

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:18.130
Of course, Believe in it® that you can do
it and when you do it, don’t be surprised!

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.990
You should expect it to happen because you
are practicing hard to make it happen!
