00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:06.030
All right.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.750
So let's draw a figure.One thing I always
start out with a pencil, because you can always

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.000
erase it, and it's a good way to just get
the basis going.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:25.180
So I always start with the head.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.250
Just think about proportion as you're doing
it.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.220
The head, then the neck.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.140
We do a straight line under the neck.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.210
A good trick is to make an X here for the
body.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
And it's great that we're doing this in pencil,
as I said before, because all of this can

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.550
go away later.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.329
From here, we work with a lot of elongated
triangles.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.250
I'm going have this girl have her hand on
her hip.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.510
So I'm doing these elongated triangles, even
a little triangle for the hand, because you're

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.729
going to smooth it out later.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.989
We'll give her a little arm, hanging down.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.860
It can even cross into the hand, as I just
did.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.030
We'll give her some legs, and you basically
segment the legs into triangles.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.890
This is how you establish the kneecaps, you
do like little inverted triangle that way.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.509
And even a little inverted triangle for the
foot, as well.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.130
All right.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.539
Now we go in and we smooth it all out.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.000
She kind of has a short neck, but I'm not
that concerned, I can always erase that and

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.600
fix it, so whatever.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.450
Basically drawing her outer silhouette now.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.729
I'll give her some bust, give her some hips.

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:58.649
This 
is such a great trick because everybody knows

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.300
how to draw a triangle, and then you're just
smoothing over, smoothing over.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.460
She's turning out on the curvier side, but
I can always fix that later as well.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.129
I'll give her her feet.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.670
Which I probably want her in high heels.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.150
All right.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.811
So, once you've gotten this process down,
you've gotten it all smoothed out, you're

00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:35.440
happy with this, you're happy with that, and
in fashion illustration you always elongate

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.470
the form.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.840
And the reason why is you have more room to
render the clothing.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.480
And that is why we make them so tall and lanky.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.860
It gives us more space to render details.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.390
Okay, now I go in with my pen.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.269
I like a nice roller pen, you can use felt
tip, whatever you like.

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.250
And I ink it all in.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:10.560
I hate drawing hands, but I will give a good
attempt for you.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.580
I'll just give her like a weird mitten, but
whatever, you can fix that later.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.580
That's why we have White-Out.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:24.569
It's never a bad idea just to put her hands
behind her body, because it's all about the

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.340
clothes, it's really not about her hands.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.090
And even if I'm doing these lines kind of
feathery, you can always go over it again

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.310
later with a thicker pen and really tighten
it up.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.799
I'll give her some calves, a foot, and I'll
have her have some high-heeled shoes on.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:46.799
She's pivoting her foot out.

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.870
I'll lose this calf on this side and give
her a calf on that side that tells me that

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.680
her foot is being pivoted out.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.440
I'll give her a crotch.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.120
All right, so I've done the basic structure,
so now I go in with my eraser and I get rid

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:17.250
of all of the pencil.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.410
That arm is not pretty, but whatever, I can
fix that later.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.440
So after a few little corrections, she'll
be good to go, you can scan her into your

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.810
computer.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.160
And that's how you draw a figure.
