00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.760
What a wonderful opportunity to see almost
like flowing water.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.760
Look at these.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.160
I don't want them to be exactly the same as
this because it's complimenting contour.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.870
These are a little different.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.869
It's almost like grains of wood.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.320
And you'll see this--it's just a little bit
more evident with him because he's got a little

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.320
bit darker skin.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.400
You know, people are just like this.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.849
Everybody is so different and you might see
this on one person and not on another.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.000
But look at these wonderful swirls and pay
attention to the direction they're going.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.149
And even though these are lines, they still
have those variances.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.840
And so this becomes a great thing too because
just like with material or whatever, I don't

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.609
want to come in and just draw--I don't want
to just draw lines like this and try to say,

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.120
'Ok, well that represents my skin'.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.969
And maybe I'll have a few polka dots along
the way.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.510
I can come in more in like something like
this and I can create something that's more

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.860
general.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890
And this is something I can build on.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.230
I don't have a line, but I'm allowing for
the texture and all the different facets of

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.260
the skin.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.360
And then, believe it or not, this is exactly
like we were addressing a little bit ago.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.000
It's the same thing as this where I have a
facet, and I actually have enough a dimension

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.990
to each one of those facets that there's a
light direction.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.860
There's a place to where the light is hitting
it more intensely on that side.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.250
On the other side, it's more of a shadow.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.640
And there are actually little shadows within
any one of these facets.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.560
And so it's really important for us to be
able to realize that when I'm doing these

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.830
things and I want to come up with something
that shows an arc.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.530
Oh, I guess I went way over here.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.840
I'm showing something that has an arc to it,
that it's random enough that I can allow for

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.580
skin texture and pores and all those things
in there.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.120
Some of them might be a little larger but
if I get some value on here then I can start

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.150
doing the same thing I was talking about here,
the same thing I'm talking about here.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.170
I can come in and have some fun with my kneaded
eraser and lift off a little bit of it.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.090
I don't have to get every little thing to
begin with.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.840
I just want to get something on the paper,
initially, so that I can start developing

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.060
enough of a facet that I can start seeing
what is the shaded side and what is the bright

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.060
side.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.140
Am I going to have to separate these with
clean lines?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.010
Boy, some of these are pretty clean.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.850
Some of these are pretty definite here.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.760
But, on the other hand, I don't want to get
so carried away that I just have a bunch of

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.030
lines again.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.430
So I want to be very careful.
