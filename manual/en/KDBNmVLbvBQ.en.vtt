00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:09.417
Be it Morning breakfast or evening snacks.

00:00:09.624 --> 00:00:12.708
Also if it's a marriage alliance meeting..

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.208
..so then, 'Kande Pohe' (Popular Maharashtrian snack)
 is a must be served dish.

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.565
But it becomes boring to eat them
again and again.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.266
So, today I will show you all
another recipe of Poha (rice flakes).

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:23.097
'Dadape Pohe'

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:26.315
First, take some finely chopped onion.

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.609
Next, add salt to taste..

00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:37.099
..and add 1 tbsp of sugar, approximately.

00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.842
Finally, add a dash of lemon.

00:00:47.767 --> 00:00:51.657
Crush the onion using hands
so that it releases water.

00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:57.094
Take 3 to 4 green chillies.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.766
Next, add some coriander.

00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.491
Now, mix everything well.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.472
Keep it aside for 5 minutes.

00:01:11.473 --> 00:01:13.298
Meanwhile let's prepare the tempering.

00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:14.799
Switch on the stove.

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:17.831
Add 1 tbsp of oil.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:23.147
Add some mustard seeds once
the oil heats up.

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:24.989
Oil is hot enough.

00:01:25.778 --> 00:01:28.671
Now, add 1 tsp of mustard seeds.

00:01:30.237 --> 00:01:32.586
Add 10 to 12 curry leaves.

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:36.395
Finally, let's add peanuts.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.753
Let's stir these.

00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.587
Let the peanuts turn golden brown.

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:46.901
Meanwhile...

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:48.044
Take the Poha.

00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:51.593
You can take thick or thin Poha.

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:53.810
You can avoid stickiness 
if you opt for thick Poha.

00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:57.181
Whereas thin Poha will make it sticky.

00:01:57.382 --> 00:01:59.007
So, here I have taken thick Poha.

00:01:59.008 --> 00:02:02.597
Now, let's sprinkle some water.

00:02:07.042 --> 00:02:08.573
Take little water at a time.

00:02:10.162 --> 00:02:12.937
Sprinkle the water and mix it slightly.

00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:19.824
Or else, coconut water
can also be used to sprinkle.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.275
This is mixed well.

00:02:23.598 --> 00:02:25.495
Peanuts have turned golden brown.

00:02:27.488 --> 00:02:31.206
Let's add the peanuts to this mixture.

00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:38.553
Now, let's mix them properly.

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:45.024
Let's add Poha sprinkled with water
to this mixture.

00:02:54.262 --> 00:02:55.408
Let's mix it well.

00:03:01.672 --> 00:03:04.704
Poha has blended well
with the mixture.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.299
Now let's take plate and serve them!

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:24.160
Garnish the Poha with some grated coconut.

00:03:27.655 --> 00:03:29.955
And now some coriander.

00:03:35.128 --> 00:03:36.685
You will be definitely having Poha.

00:03:36.886 --> 00:03:38.492
Also, peanuts..

00:03:38.793 --> 00:03:41.416
..and coriander! I mean
 everything required will be handy.

00:03:41.517 --> 00:03:43.044
So don't waste even a minute!

00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:45.533
Make it quickly and let me know.
