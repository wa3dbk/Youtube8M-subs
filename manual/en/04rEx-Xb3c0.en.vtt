00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:02.329
Catch-22, a la Shmoop.

00:00:02.329 --> 00:00:03.329
WarÉ sucks.

00:00:03.329 --> 00:00:04.329
But unfortunately, sometimes itÕs necessary.

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:14.140
If we'd let the Nazis steamroll their way
across the planet during World War Two, Hitler's

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.800
little mustache might still be a fashion trend
and we'd all love Wagnerian opera instead

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.970
of Twilight.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.660
More often, however, war just blows for pretty
much everyone concerned.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.820
Some of the most famous books of the twentieth
century, fiction and non-fiction, dealt with

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.449
this topic, including Joseph Heller's satiric
Catch-22.

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.479
Captain John Yosarrian and the other airmen
of the 256th squadron are stationed on a Mediterranean

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:46.690
island during World War Two.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.690
Sounds awesome, right?

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.690
Sunshine and seafood for all!

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.530
But instead of spending their time on the
beach, Yosarrian and friends are busy trying

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.810
to stay sane and survive the war so they can
get home.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.200
ThereÕs an attack on an undefended Italian
mountain village, the despair felt by various

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.200
soldiers, and the deaths of many of Yosarrian's
friends.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.340
So, yeah, not a lot of positives here.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.100
But is Catch-22 really as cynical as it seems?

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.190
Heller's characters certainly don't have a
lot of control over their lives, and they

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.270
often come to a sad end due to circumstances
beyond their control.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.330
Nately, for example, dies during a pointless
mission, when his plane crashes into another

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.330
American plane.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.410
So much for his dreams of marrying his hooker
girlfriend and sending her kid sister to an

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:24.410
American college.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.730
The characters also tend to make choices and
do things that negatively affect the people

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:28.730
around them.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.890
While Aarfy is perfectly willing to protect
well-connected women from the sexual advances

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.890
of other menÉ

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.750
Éhe ends up raping and murdering Michaela
because he's never had to pay for sex and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.240
doesn't see why he should have to start.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420
Some stellar logic right there.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.610
But maybe what Heller's trying to say is that,
even when things are at their worst, even

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.700
when men are stuck in a terrible war that
they want no part of, there's hope to be found

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
in humor.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.000
BecauseÉ there's a lot of absurdity in the
256th squadron.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Colonel Cathcart is so determined to become
a general that he keeps raising the number

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of missions his men have to fly, meaning that
they can get really close to doing enough

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
work to get them home, but they never quite
make it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.550
Milo Minderbender is so anxious to turn a
profit that he starts contracting missions

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.190
for the Germans, going so far as to fight
on both sides in the same battle and bomb

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.190
his own squadron.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.942
The world Heller describes in Catch-22 is
sad but ridiculous, and it's the utter silliness

00:02:11.942 --> 00:02:13.500
of it all that allows Yosarrian to stay sane.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.500
Edwin Starr, the Temptations, and Bruce Springstein
and the E Street Band have all told us that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.500
war is good for absolutely nothin'É

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500
Éand Catch-22 certainly seems to demonstrate
the truth behind that extremely catchy song

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.500
lyric.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.840
But is Heller's novel completely cynical in
its take on warÉ

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:26.959
Éor does he think itÕs bearable as long
as youÉ send in the clowns?

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:36.810
Shmoop amongst yourselves.
