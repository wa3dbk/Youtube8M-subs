When decorating the living room, and you're
arranging your furniture you want to make

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.410
sure that you have a comfortable area for
seating.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.320
It doesn't make sense, if it looks pretty
if it doesn't feel right.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.630
So a great sectional is always important for
me.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.949
I love sofas, but I'm really a sectional type
of girl, only because it creates a natural

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:24.960
conversation zone.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.640
You have people facing each other if it's
an L-shape or a U-shape.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.220
But at the same token, it's very sleek.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.230
It's comfortable and you get more bang for
your buck.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.690
Now if you go for sofa, that's great too,
just make sure that it's deep enough that

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.410
people feel comfortable.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.970
Then the rest of your seating can be what
I call satellite seating.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.200
So if you have your armchairs or side chairs
or ottomans they kind of zone around the sofa

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.970
or the sectional that you're using.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.790
What's easy about that is that if you have
to move them out of the way, you have more

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.500
people, you have less people, it's not really
going to be cumbersome to lift and move and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.300
do all these different things.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.869
Also be aware of your table sizing.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.290
For instance a cocktail table should be about
12 to 14 inches away from the sofa.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.720
It should be about maybe a little bit more
than half of the size so that it's easy to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.720
move around.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.860
You can walk around it.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.940
You don't want to stuff all your furniture
in a room, but at the same token you don't

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.390
want to feel like it's a desert wasteland.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.600
Then when you're done make sure your surrounding
areas are addressed.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.570
Meaning that, you have maybe a side console
or a chest, where you can put some beautiful

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.280
decorative items, maybe a bookcase.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.190
Then your TV unit, make sure that your TV
is low enough that basically, you have an

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.030
easy sight line when you're watching from
your sofa.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.760
But not too low that you're looking down on
the TV.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.450
Make sure your TV unit is directly underneath
the TV.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.810
It'll save when you're having to wire everything
that you need to get it hooked up and started.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.110
I think if you stick with those guidelines,
you should be fine at the end of the day.
