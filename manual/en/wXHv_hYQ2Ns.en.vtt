Hi! I’m Jim Dowd with Zoar Outdoor. I’m
here on behalf of expertvillage.com to talk

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.059
with you about fly casting and fly fishing.
In this segment, we will talk a little bit

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.670
about timing and loop control. Timing is what
refers to allowing the line to straighten

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.739
out in front of you or behind you after you
have made your speed up and stop. Good timing

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:30.819
is just when the line straightens out before
you initiate the next part of the cast. So

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:37.960
forward straight, back straight, forward straight.
Good timing means that the line and the leader

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.370
has straightened out in front of you. Bad
timing results in a bad cast, so if I start

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.150
too soon all the line jams up in the air and
it doesn’t go very well. If I start too

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:59.829
late, the line falls to the water behind me
and results in a poor cast. So good timing

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.140
again is just waiting for the line and the
leader to straighten completely before you

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.310
before you initiate the next part of your
cast. Loop control has a lot to do with timing.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:19.049
Loop control uses timing to initiate your
stroke, and the arc of your stroke determines

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.780
how big your loop is going to be. So if you
start at a 45 degree angle going forward to

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.409
a 45 degree angle going back, you get a fairly
narrow loop. If you drop your hand on either

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.729
the forward or the back cast, you will get
a big wide open loop. So make your stops precise

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.200
45 and you’ll get a nice tight loop. There
is one more loop you should know about which

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.969
you will recognize when you see it; it is
called the crossed or a tailing loop, and

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.999
that’s from an unsmooth application of power.
You start too soon, you start too hard, and

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.520
what happens is it throws a sine wave in the
line, and it results in a big old tangle like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.170
you see here in what is called by some people
a casting knot or a wind knot. The knot happens

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.390
when you throw your loop in a cast; it goes
underneath the trailing line. So the key is

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.400
good timing, wait for the line and leader
to straighten out in front or behind you,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.860
and precise stops and your cast will improve.
Practice this. You will be amazed to how much

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.920
it improves your casting.
