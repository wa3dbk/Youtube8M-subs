Pottery barn Party Planner
Barbecued Oysters

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.320
Hi I'm John finger, founder and an owner here
at Hog Island Oyster Company with Pottery Barn,

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.419
and today we're going to talk about once you've 
purchased oysters,

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:14.849
how to care for them,

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.100
how to open them, and then a few different ways of preparing them.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.240
If you purchased oysters the next thing you need
to be aware of is how to care for them to

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.630
make sure that they're gonna stay alive. Cold and damp,
those are the two things, so either in a cooler with

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.300
some ice or

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.199
in the refrigerator. You want to make sure they have
a damn cloth over the top of them and preferably

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.170
you have them in some kind of shallow bowl,
cupside down.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.030
A quick lesson on shucking oysters - you are going 
to use some sort of kitchen towel on a flat surface.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.630
An oyster knife is of course a very necessary
tool in all of this. At the pointed end the two

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.950
shells come together,

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.790
and there's a little bit of a gap or a ligament,

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.750
and that's where you're going to insert the knife.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.060
So what you're going to do is using a kitchen towel
as a nest and over the top of it

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.370
is you're going to insert the knife at that hinge point

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.520
and you're gonna apply pressure and twist at the
same time back and forth until the point of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.550
the knife engages in there.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.030
And you're gonna twist

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.920
and there's a pop.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.850
So then what you're gonna do is sliding the knife
against the top shell you're gonna reach across

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.990
that muscle there

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.210
and slice

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.450
that muscle

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.869
and then you're gonna pull

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.020
the top shell off

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.190
and the last thing is here's that muscle, loosen
that muscle so the meat

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.530
is all nice and loose in their. If you're 
gonna have them raw

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.390
you're gonna serve them on ice for 
instance in these great Pottery barn bowls here.
So now we've got our

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.660
oysters sucked,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.730
I'm going to show you a quick little sauce
that we do that's very popular called hogwash

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.159
for raw oysters.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.010
We start off with rice vincegar, we use half seasoned, half unseasoned,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.320
then we use chopped up cilantro,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.150
the lime juice

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.020
some jalapeno peppers, and some shallots.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.790
That's it.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.940
It's just real simple, here it is we have some here

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.450
In another great Pottery Barn bowl,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.540
um

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.239
Hogwash all made up here.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.970
You just want to spoon a little bit on your oyster,

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.050
um

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.549
and the best way if you don't have an oyster
fork to do this is

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.190
you hold it by the pointed end

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.529
with your thumb and middle finger, leaving your index
finger free to push the oyster out.

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:18.339
What's really popular in northern California that
a lot of people don't do in other parts

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:23.799
of the country is barbecuing oysters. When you barbecue
oysters you want to use a slightly bigger oyster.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.689
You want to do that because they tend to shrink down when 
they cook a little bit.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.290
We have two sauces here to try today. This first
one is a real traditional recipe. This is

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.449
casino butter

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:34.859
here.

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.629
Uh so obviously it has butter in it,

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.079
um

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.679
it also has paprika, and bacon

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.059
and shallots.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.199
A nice traditional shellfish recipe.

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.749
And another one that's real popular 
that we make in our restaurants

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.180
is, um,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.389
harissa

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.639
which is a kyu pepper blend

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.869
a little olive oil, 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.060
cumin, and coriander in it as well.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.289
You don't want to put too much on there that you 
totally overwhelm the oyster.

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.899
What you want to watch for

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:12.059
is for the sauce to start bubbling and and the
oyster meat to start bubbling around the edges.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.919
Some people like theirs a little more well done
than other people but three to five minutes.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:21.319
Okay, so now our barbecue oysters are done

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.849
you can see they're bubbling the meat's
plumped up a little bit, I don't like mine too overly

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:26.379
done.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.219
We're gonna take them off

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.339
and put them on this great Pottery Barn 
platter with some rock salt,

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.199
and just nestle them in there like that.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.829
These are our casino - you can see the little bits of bacon in there.
And if you really want to keep it hot for

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.099
a longer period time you can preheat the rock
salt.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.679
And then these are our Harissa.

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.349
And of course you can always put a little dash of lemon on there

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:53.419
uh, as you're having them to augment the flavors.
Whatever I'm barbecuing oysters I want to make sure

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.719
I've got some great crusty France bread around,
to sop up that sauce. It's too good to go to waste.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.329
And some lemons. Just all simple, simple complimentary
things.

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.219
I like an ice-cold Pilsner, or Sauvignon Blanc, or dry Muscadet, some
good simple clean

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:08.429
beverages to go with it.

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:11.789
That's it. I mean you don't want to overdo it,
so have some family and friends over and have

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:12.979
a great time. Thanks.
