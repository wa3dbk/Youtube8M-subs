00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.470
Daddy Clay: Yesterday my 5 year old comes
up to me and asks, "Hey dad, can I play soccer

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.819
at the field two blocks away, by myself?"
Come right on back and I'll say to you what

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:20.680
I said to him.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.090
Today's episode of Quality Time is brought
to you by BabyBjorn. Talk about taking the

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:36.910
big step towards independence. This BabyBjorn
potty is the way to go.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.890
I said yes. Of course, I took certain precautions.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.350
We're just gonna put this right here on you.
This is a GPS unit. Now if you get lost, what

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.140
I want you to do is push the power button,
walk to a street, and go wherever the nice

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.309
lady on the machine tells you. Because you're
gonna be out on your own, and you're gonna

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.969
be completely independent, here's what we
want you to do. Just keep that cell phone

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.030
and daddy will be on the other end talking
to you the whole time.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.030
At this point, I should probably disclose
that I live on the campus of a private boarding

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.880
school, which is a gated and guarded community.
Lots of athletic facilities and fields. A

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.390
residential populations of students and adults.
So it's a relatively safe place for a child

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.590
to have independence and to be out on their
own. Which is something we've always allowed

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.670
our kids to do. But because I live in this
unusual circumstance, I'm curious - What do

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.689
other families do? So, of course, I went on
the Interwebs. From my unscientific survey

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.000
or surveys online, about two-thirds of parents
say it's okay for kids to be outside alone

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.740
somewhere between the ages of 6 and 11. Two-thirds
of parents online surveyed also reported that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.079
they would never in hell let their child between
6 and 11 years old go out by themselves. Which

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.400
means essentially parents online think it's
fine for dumber, worse, less responsible parents

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.509
to send their kids outside alone, but of course,
the respondents never would. The general consensus

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.180
among parents seems to be it was okay when
we were kids. We could ride our bikes across

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.569
town, get a sack of candy, shove it down out
throats, three or four thousand calories at

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.579
a time, and come on home and that would be
fine but now, things are different.

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.870
Actually, things are different these days.
Things for kids are a lot safer than they

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.579
were when we were kids in the 1970's and 80's.
Look at the crime statistics. All crimes against

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:27.569
children have decline steadily since the 1970's.
And the big daddy, the great fear of all parents,

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.159
abductions. Abductions have gone down steadily
as well. According to the National Center

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.459
for Missing and Exploited Children, only about
115 children were abducted by a stranger last

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.599
year. 115 may seem like a lot. It isa lot.
I don't mean to sound callous. But statistically,

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.159
it's still extremely rare. Why are we so scared?
Duh, I mean there's so many SVU reruns on

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.889
TBS they might as well call if the Child Abduction
Network. I mean, a small child in danger is

00:02:54.889 --> 00:03:00.959
the most effective form of melodrama known
to man. Just ask CNN.com.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.739
So, what's really dangerous to kids? Potentially
fatal to kids? Swimming pools, guns in the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.980
home, and worst of all, cars. Traffic accidents
pose the greatest danger to kids in our society.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.980
So anyone who tries to preserve their child's
safety by putting them in a car may be fundamentally

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.719
misunderstanding the stats.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.959
Not surprised to hear of a parenting movement
afoot based on trying to produce more independent

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.799
kids. If you want to know more about that,
you want to check out "Free-Range Kids" by

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.559
Lenore Skenazy. Obviously, allowing kids to
play on their own outside the home is not

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:36.580
right for every family and not right for every
circumstance. We want to hear from you. Leave

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.760
us a comment on our video. Go to DadLabs.com
and join a conversation. We want to thank

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.359
our sponsors, BabyBjorn. Great way to promote
independence early on. Potty training with

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:54.079
this great potty from BabyBjorn. We'll see
you next time on Quality Time.
