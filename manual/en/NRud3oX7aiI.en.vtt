00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.713
My first love of photography
is probably wildlife.

00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:16.983
When I was a young photographer
that's really what I concentrated on

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.018
was shooting pictures
of wildlife.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.820
But really as my career
has evolved

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:24.890
I'm becoming more known now
for capturing the Texas culture.

00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:27.760
You know and trying to capture
those people and places

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.163
that really epitomizes what it's
like to be Texan

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:31.950
and what it means to
be a Texan.

00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:34.066
The neat thing about living
in this country

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:36.035
is you not only have
the wildlife component

00:00:36.076 --> 00:00:37.916
but you have this wide
open country that

00:00:37.958 --> 00:00:41.406
when a lot of people from outside
the state think of what Texas is like

00:00:41.448 --> 00:00:43.441
this is the kind of area
they think about

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:47.113
and it's really neat and really
gratifying to be able to wake up

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.515
and be amongst this kind
of culture

00:00:49.556 --> 00:00:52.335
and this kind of landscape
on a day-to-day basis.

00:00:52.378 --> 00:00:55.921
This country was built on the
backs of cowboys

00:00:55.963 --> 00:00:58.591
and Comanche Indians and
bison hunters

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:03.411
and early on I learned about all
the history of all 3 of those groups

00:01:03.453 --> 00:01:05.531
and how they tie in and
how they really

00:01:05.573 --> 00:01:08.435
interweave into the tapestry
of this country

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:10.980
and the Texas rolling plains.

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:13.706
and because of that I
became enamored

00:01:13.748 --> 00:01:16.740
with the history of the buffalo
hunter and the history of the bison

00:01:16.781 --> 00:01:19.211
in Texas and on the south plains.

00:01:19.253 --> 00:01:21.615
And I can recall

00:01:21.656 --> 00:01:24.316
I was at Caprock Canyon State Park

00:01:24.358 --> 00:01:26.018
early one evening

00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:28.655
shooting pictures of the buffalo
and the buffalo herd there

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:29.555
at the state park.

00:01:29.598 --> 00:01:31.423
And this one single bull

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.860
was grazing and then at the
very last minute,

00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:36.728
very last light, he turned and
looked towards the sun

00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:39.965
and I was able to capture a
moment

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:41.440
that's really become iconic.

00:01:41.481 --> 00:01:43.811
I know when a lot of people
talk about pictures I've taken

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:46.271
they talk about that 1 photo
that was taken probably

00:01:46.313 --> 00:01:47.973
12 years ago.

00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:51.210
When people ask me the secret
to taking great photographs

00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:53.080
I tell them it's really
not a secret at all.

00:01:53.121 --> 00:01:56.533
It's really about if you can
think of anything

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.920
that you want to be. You say
I want to be good at 'blank.'

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.590
If it's basketball or if it's baseball
or if it's making quilts

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.146
or if it's photography,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.528
it all boils down to doing
a few key things right

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.856
every time and understanding the
elements within that discipline

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.000
so your results become
predictable.

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:17.036
Like in photography I tell
people a couple of things

00:02:17.078 --> 00:02:18.238
they need to think about all
the time.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.340
They need to think about light
first and foremost

00:02:20.381 --> 00:02:22.166
whether it's natural light
with the sun

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.776
or artificial light if you're
introducing some strobes.

00:02:24.818 --> 00:02:29.048
Composition is a key component
of it in my mind.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.486
You know, composition is one thing
if you learn it and learn it well

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:36.816
you can transform mediocre photos
to great photos almost overnight.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.693
It makes a huge change the way
your photographs look.

00:02:40.735 --> 00:02:43.230
I get asked a lot about
what kind of equipment

00:02:43.271 --> 00:02:46.080
someone can buy that'll make
them a great photographer.

00:02:46.123 --> 00:02:48.100
You know really being a
great photographer

00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:50.170
is a little bit about the
equipment

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.506
but it's a lot about inspiration.

00:02:51.548 --> 00:02:53.473
It's a lot about understanding
your subject

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:55.810
and understanding how to
interact with that subject

00:02:55.853 --> 00:02:58.211
whether that subject's a
landscape or whether it's

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:01.246
people in the outdoors or
whether it's wildlife.

00:03:01.288 --> 00:03:04.308
It's just taking the time to
do all the background information

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.955
and understanding what it is
you're taking pictures of.

00:03:06.996 --> 00:03:09.188
I spend as much time
researching a subject

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.858
or twice as much time
researching a subject

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960
as I do actually photographing it

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:15.545
because when I go into
a situation,

00:03:15.588 --> 00:03:17.496
I've got a finite amount of time

00:03:17.538 --> 00:03:20.233
and so I want to know all I can
about what I'm taking a picture of

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:22.538
Whether it's--whether I'm
traveling to the Big Bend

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.761
to shoot pictures of
great landscapes

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.973
or whether I'm traveling to

00:03:27.015 --> 00:03:29.841
to the northern panhandle to
shoot pictures of prairie chickens

00:03:29.883 --> 00:03:32.978
or whether I'm traveling to someone's
farm to shoot a picture of

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.513
their hard earned labor

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:37.883
and their hard work and what
it means to be a farmer in Texas,

00:03:37.925 --> 00:03:40.970
I try to know as much as I can
about the subject and to me,

00:03:41.011 --> 00:03:42.355
more than equipment,

00:03:42.396 --> 00:03:45.558
that's the secret to being
a great photographer.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:56.703
-Whoa! You didn't get that did you?
-Yeah, actually I did.
