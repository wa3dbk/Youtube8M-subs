00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.560
Why do some automotive aftermarket products
start trends?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.630
What is it that sets them apart?

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.330
Magnum Bumpers by ICI are known for style,
innovative design and uncompromised quality

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.680
in manufacturing.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.820
Magnum is the fastest growing brand of premium
custom bumpers in the USA!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.509
We’ll show you what sets Magnum Bumpers
apart from the rest and why YOU should choose

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.759
a Magnum Bumper for your truck.

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.810
Our skilled team of engineers begins the process
of creating a new product by asking ‘how

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.480
can we be different?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.830
What would we want if it were our truck?

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.640
What are customers asking for?’

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.360
An example is the way we designed our rear
bumper so customers can easily transfer rear

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.270
sensors from the factory bumper, into their
new Magnum bumper.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.160
This feature yields a precise fit, and, more
importantly, it resolved customer concerns

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.390
regarding ease of installation.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.520
Once the design and engineering phases are
complete, our engineering and production teams

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.040
meet to discuss how to manufacture the bumper.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.049
Production begins with the finest material
that will provide the best possible surface

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.370
quality: premium heavy-duty, cold rolled steel.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.800
Design files are sent electronically to the
plasma cutter, ensuring each component is

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.510
cut precisely for a perfect fit.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.310
We bend and form the steel because our engineers
have specifically designed our bumpers to

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.200
minimize the amount of seam welding required.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.510
This provides more stability and structural
integrity in the finished bumper.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.010
Magnum Bumpers are designed around the truck
body to fit just like the original factory

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.010
bumper.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.530
Welding is the next step.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.650
Then we measure.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.490
For quality and consistency in manufacturing,
each member of our production team uses their

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.270
company issued tablet to verify the bumper
measurements are accurate.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.650
The next stage is the finishing process!

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.170
Magnum Bumpers are hand finished by the finest
metal fabricators in the industry.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.340
Their attention to quality and detail is second
to none!

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.810
Each bumper is measured and cross measured
once more.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.380
Preparing the bumper for powder coating is
a two-step process.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.140
Before the bumper is assembled, each individual
steel component passes through a surfacing

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.140
machine.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.690
Then, once assembled, we sandblast the bumper
to prepare the surface for powder coating,

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.849
resulting in a longer lasting, more durable
finish.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.099
This type of attention to detail and quality
is how we offer our industry leading warranty.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.220
After sandblasting, the bumper is ready for
our unique three-stage powder coating process.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.420
To begin, we dip each Magnum Bumper in a cleaning,
degreasing and sealing solution.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.930
This solution reaches the hard-to-access areas
of the bumper and helps pull the primer and

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.330
powder into those areas, reducing the potential
for corrosion.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.770
After dipping, the bumpers are stored for
24 hours to ensure that the sealant has properly

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.930
cured.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.800
Once cured, we heat each bumper to 400 degrees.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.680
The heat prepares the surface for the primer
and powder coat.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.050
Stage two of the powder coating process is
applying the zinc primer and reheating the

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.050
bumper.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.300
This provides more protection against corrosion
and creates a more receptive surface for the

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.410
final powder coat.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.209
The third and final stage is applying the
textured powder coating and reheating the

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.800
bumper for an hour to cure.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.450
The result is a beautiful, durable, matte
black finish that resists corrosion.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.300
The cured, finished bumper is then thoroughly
inspected.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.680
You will notice the Quality Control tag that
accompanied the bumper at each step.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.470
This tag originates when the order for the
bumper is placed.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.940
At each of our Quality Control checkpoints,
every employee who has a hand in crafting

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.240
your bumper, puts their employee ID on the
tag.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.739
Their mark signifies that they are standing
behind their work!

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.160
The bumper is now ready for packaging.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.800
Our team inspects the final result and ensures
that all measurements meet our standards,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.470
and that the correct brackets and hardware
are included for installation.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.180
To reduce the risk of freight damage, we ship
each Magnum bumper in a custom built wooden

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.349
crate so the bumpers arrive in perfect condition.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.910
Once again, we go above and beyond!

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.580
Now that you’ve seen what goes into the
creation of every Magnum Bumper, who do you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.720
want making the bumpers for your truck?

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.050
Isn’t it time you stepped up to Magnum?
