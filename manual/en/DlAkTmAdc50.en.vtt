I'm Carol Fox. You can find me at

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.090
Matthews North Carolina is a lovely small
town near Charlotte. A two-mile greenway

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.309
winds through the historic downtown and
some of the adjacent neighborhoods.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.849
The trail connects with Squirrel Lake
Park.

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.980
On a beautiful day in April, Matthews
held a grand re-opening of the recently

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.189
renovated park and dedicated a new
fountain and seating area at the

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.789
greenway.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.789
Come take a walk with me along the
greenway and into the park.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.250
The greenway follows Four Mile Creek.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.070
The wide paved path is perfect for
running, walking or bicycling.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.940
The town has created a spot to stop and
relax with stone benches and a fountain

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.650
where water cascades over large rocks.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.110
At another spot along the greenway path
you can discover and enjoy rustic

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.110
artwork.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.190
Town residents enjoyed the April grand
opening activities at the twenty nine

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:17.190
acre Squirrel Lake Park.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.510
A fishing pond with pier is the
centerpiece of Squirrel Lake.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.650
The park includes two shelters with
picnic tables, a playground, restrooms, a

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.940
horseshoe pit,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.570
and twelve hole disc course.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.340
The park is a certified wildlife
habitat area.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.650
