00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.630
In the fall of 2009 I decided to spend a day trying to locate and photograph White-tailed Ptarmigan.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.079
And the best place near where I live to try is high up on Washington's tallest Mountain, Mount Rainier

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.840
In order to get up to the alpine areas where the Ptarmigan live, you have to work your way up these rugged Rocky Ridge lines

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:36.008
until you're basically beyond the last of the trees and in areas of alpine tundra; these birds are not easy to get to.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.829
The weather up there can be pretty fierce and is constantly changing.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.329
It's a really dynamic environment.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:51.128
It's exhilarating to be up there and see these clouds rolling by below you and fog pouring over ridges and through the valleys.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.509
Every now and then you'll get a break in the fog or clouds and suddenly see this massive icy mountain looming above you.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.399
So as far up as you are you still see this really incredible terrain farther up...

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.218
Once I got up to an altitude high enough

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.379
I began searching for Ptarmigan. I hiked through the terrain for 3 or 4 hours without finding anything.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:22.449
But finally I came over a small rise, and there was a group of these glowing white birds foraging on the ground.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.858
They were really beautiful to watch as they walked around in these low alpine plants and these purplish volcanic rocks.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.639
These birds were almost completely in their white winter plumage which they attained in late fall.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.059
You can see a few grayish brown feathers on this bird still left over from the summer plumage which is primarily brown.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.508
After seeing this bird sitting camouflaged in the snow I

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.529
realized how easy it would have been for me to miss one when I was searching for them.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.130
All you could really see where the dark bill, and eye and the bright red eye comb which isn't always exposed.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.950
At one point these birds bedded down in the snow to rest they each dug their own little hole and just sat in it.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.140
The one shot that turned out to be my favorite from the day was this shot of four Ptarmigan standing in the snow.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:38.089
They'd just gotten up from the resting spot to resume foraging and each bird took a turn standing on tiptoes and stretching its wings.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.589
To me this photo captures a bit of the hardiness of these birds;

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.110
they look totally at ease in their environment despite the snow and fog rolling in in the background.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.319
They almost seem optimistic in this rugged, inhospitable environment they inhabit.
