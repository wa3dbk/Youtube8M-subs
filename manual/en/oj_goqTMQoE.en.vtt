00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.449
Biologics Production Facility is a multifunctional
laboratory.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:21.070
It is a production facility, which means our
main purpose is to manufacture cellular therapy

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.480
products that will be given to patients.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.130
We can assist researchers in scaling up their
research ideas into a useable product and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.110
we can manufacture other things for a biotech
company.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.182
We also process fairly routine products that
we give to patients every day in the myro

00:00:41.182 --> 00:00:43.350
and stem cell transplant program.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.260
Jointly operated by The Nebraska Medical Center,
the region’s largest hospital, and the University

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.480
of Nebraska Medical Center, the state’s
health science center and an international

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.840
leader in health research, the Biologics Production
Facility opens new frontiers in research and

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.360
patient care.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.290
In just a few hours this liquid, known as
storage media, will be part of someone’s

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.290
cancer treatment.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.290
We’ll put a little bit of this storage media
in there and then we’ll take it over to

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.290
the patient.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.479
Then they will get those cells as part of
their treatment for their cancer.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:29.170
It’s a pretty neat little system.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.189
The methods used here bring the concept of
personalized medicine to an entirely new level.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.270
This laboratory makes that kind of bench top
to bedside translation possible because we

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.869
can take what is essentially a research product
and make it, according to good manufacturing

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.009
principles, so that we can actually safely
administer it to a patient.

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.950
The vaccine or the cellular product can be
manufactured just for you so it can be targeted

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.340
just against your malignancy for example or
the kind of problem that you have.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.590
It’s no ordinary laboratory.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.650
Every room and every piece of equipment here
was specially designed, built and installed

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.700
with absolute cleanliness in mind.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.150
The air in a standard laboratory wouldn’t
necessarily be controlled because the standard

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.150
laboratory tests that you do, don’t really
require you have particularly clean air.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.920
The air in this facility, in some portions,
is a hundred times cleaner than in an operating

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.920
room.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.180
There are filters at each entrance to every
room.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.230
If we have any open steps in processing, we
do those under a biological safety cabinet

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.600
which is very clean.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.180
The reason for that is these are all products
that patients are going to get.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.410
They are going to get an infusion or an injection
and we have to be very certain that nothing

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.120
contributes to contaminating these or cross
contaminating one product with somebody else’s

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.120
product.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.019
All these products are unique.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:18.880
One product for one patient, so it’s not
like a bank or a laboratory, where you would

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.720
have many units of blood for example in a
blood bank, and you would just cross match

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.160
them and give them to an appropriate patient.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.530
These are specifically designated, one product
for one patient.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.840
As a facility that has various classifications,
we have class 100 thousand, we have class

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.129
10 thousand, our two million processing suites,
there is unique materials that are used.

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:48.409
The GMP guidelines state that we have to have
materials in place from the lights, paint,

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.599
flooring and they are all cleanable and prohibit
contaminations.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:59.180
There is nothing that can get in from exterior
spaces, from the wall space to the ceiling

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.769
space, it is completely sealed.

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.659
The only thing that is supplied to this room
is the air from the HEPA filtered air handlers

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.110
and then of course the exhaust.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.400
Right now, patients undergoing stem cell and
bone marrow transplants, for certain types

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.329
of leukemia and lymphoma are directly benefiting
from the biologics production facility.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.960
I think this facility takes us to the next
level in all of those areas.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.409
It takes myro and stem cell transplants to
the next level of being able to use not only

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.149
the transplant but the immune therapy and
the other things that go with it, to make

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:42.289
outcomes better, decrease complications or
to treat diseases that were resistant before.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.909
New ground is being broken in the area of
solid organ transplant as well.

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:51.890
Not every organ that is available for transplant
is suitable for transplant.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:58.250
Some of those could be used for making a suspension
of the cells that are important in that organ

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.690
and that’s really the next step.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:10.460
It would also allow, if we could grow these
things up, to split an organ because we had

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.969
a small recipient or other ways to manipulate
things.

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.630
It allows us to take that next step.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.089
When it comes to the future, the sky is the
limit.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.190
Hopefully in the future we can do more new
things.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.480
I think the standard products that we have
been making for a long time are very helpful

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.789
for many patients but that’s not really
the future of transplantation or immune therapies.

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:44.840
I see that there will be a lot more diseases
that could be treated with products or vaccines

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.630
that could be manufactured here.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.940
It’s pretty much limitless.
