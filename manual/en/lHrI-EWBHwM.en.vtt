How to Ask for a Raise.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.370
Here's a helpful hint: if you can prove you've
earned one, a raise is in your future.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:20.909
You will need A reasonable salary goal A list
of your accomplishments and good timing.

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:21.909
Step 1.

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.839
Find out what others in your position make.

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.230
Try asking others in your field and checking
out websites that compare salaries around

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.509
the country.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.590
Step 2.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.710
Write down your strengths and accomplishments.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.470
Be specific.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.000
The best way to convince your boss you deserve
a raise is by verifying your hard work.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.940
Step 3.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.120
Make sure the timing is right, like just after
your biggest accomplishment.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.680
When the boss compliments you--that's your
cue to proceed.

a raise are best if you're doing about 20%

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.500
more work than when you first got hired (or
received your last raise).

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.500
Step 4.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.220
Book an appointment to see the boss so he'll
be completely focused on you.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.159
If possible, ask to meet on a Thursday.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.210
That's when most people get raises and promotions.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.430
Step 5.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.610
At the prearranged time, armed with your written
list of strengths and accomplishments, explain

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.749
to him all the reasons you think you deserve
a raise.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:40.569

studies show that forward body posture conveys

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.359
confidence and power!

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:45.509
Step 6.

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.829
Close by asking for the raise in a percentage
term (such as, "I believe that I deserve 300%

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.969
more than what I make now").

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:57.969
Step 7.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.181
If the answer is no, simply ask your boss,
&amp;#8220;What can I do to make this happen?&amp;#8221;

00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:07.209
This shows you won&amp;#8217;t give up, you respect
his opinion, and you&amp;#8217;ll work even harder

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:10.099
to get what you want!

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:20.310

wear lipstick are more likely to get a raise

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.170
