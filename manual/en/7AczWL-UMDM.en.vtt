00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.149
How to Make a Transformers Costume.

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:11.610
There's no denying it: transforming robots
are the coolest things in the universe.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.660
Here's how to become your very own robot in
disguise.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.500
You will need Cardboard boxes of varying sizes
A utility knife or sharp scissors Spray paint

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.940
and tempera paint Duct tape Tires from toy
trucks A hot glue gun Super glue A turtleneck,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.390
sweatpants, and gloves that match your Transformer's
colors Dark or black shoes A friend and two

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.019
ping-pong paddles.

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:44.219
Children under 10 should not use a utility
knife or sharp scissors, and an adult should

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.859
help older children.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:46.859
Step 1.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.969
Find a tall, rectangular moving box that will
fit over your upper body.

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.549
It should be long enough to reach to your
waist and wide enough to go from armpit to

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:55.549
armpit.

00:00:55.549 --> 00:01:00.100
Cut off the open flaps; then, cut circular
holes on each side for your arms and a hole

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.639
on top for head.

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:04.619
The armholes should fit snugly around your
arms.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.160
Ask your local grocery store, bike shop, appliance
store, or furniture shop for boxes.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.290
They're often willing to give them away.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.290
Step 2.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.960
You'll need two small boxes for each arm:
one for the shoulder and bicep, and one for

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.300
the forearm (use just one box on a small child).

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.510
Shoe or tissue boxes work well.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.690
Cut holes in the tops and bottoms so your
arms can fit through.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.680
Again, make sure the armholes are snug.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.780
Step 3.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.230
For the legs, choose two long and narrow boxes
â€“ one for each leg.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.520
They should cover the distance from your knees
to your ankles.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.000
Make holes on opposite ends that are just
big enough to fit your feet through when you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.090
pull them on.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.660
The cardboard should sit firmly against your
calves and ankles.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:47.660
Step 4.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.770
Find a box that is just large enough to fit
around your head.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.130
Remove the bottom of the box and try it on.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.000
The headpiece should almost reach the torso
box resting on your shoulders.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.810
Take it off and cut out holes for the eyes.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.140
Paint two ping-pong paddles in a solid color
and glue them upside down on each side of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.250
the head box.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.170
They make great antennae.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.259
Step 5.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.120
Spray paint the cardboard boxes in colors
that correspond to your favorite Transformer.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.530
Use the tempera paint and duct tape to add
patterns and decorations, and glue the plastic

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.910
wheels from a toy truck to the outside of
your leg boxes.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:21.980
Step 6.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.109
Put on a turtleneck, sweatpants, and gloves
that match your character's colors.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.109
Step 7.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.969
Put on the costume, starting with the leg
pieces while you can still bend down.

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.489
Then, put on some dark or black shoes.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.080
Have a friend lower the torso box onto your
upper body, and place the arm boxes over your

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.120
arms, affixing them firmly into the armholes.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.409
Finish by putting the headpiece in place.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.819
Now all that's left to do is transform and
roll out!

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.810
Did you know In 2009, engineers completed
the first test flight of the Transition Roadable

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.310
Aircraft, a two-person plane that can transform
into a car in less than 30 seconds.
