00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:18.859
The ESSEC's life is extremely fun and
invigorating. Not only do we learn a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.769
lots about business and how to manage
corporations but the student life

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:27.649
at ESSEC is extremely rich and there's
a lot of activities to do. I guess the

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.699
first few days and i was here i was
really busy.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.750
I was involved in a lot of activities with
ESSEC integrating so many

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870
international students so it was

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.550
actually a really good experience for me
initially when I came here. 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.870
And it got really good
because i got to know many people. There are a

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.350
number of associations at ESSEC that you
can be a part of,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.959
both academic and

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:49.780
sports and co-curriculars.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.359
I played basketball in India so I chose
to play basketball here as well.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.720
I am also part of ESSEC transactions which
is the finance club.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.370
You get to meet a lot of people

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.720
who are doing similar things in
finance, you get to grow your network

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.410
which is very important when you are 
in a business school. Along with that you get to

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.240
meet a lot of Alumni who keep coming to
give  lectures on

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.700
what's in what's out in the market.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.770
ESSEC India is another really good
association. At ESSEC, you find

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.430
associations for all the different
countries so ESSEC India is one of them.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.480
It's really good to
work with them because you organize many

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.770
events, recently we organized
the Diwali event.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.620
You really need to integrate with many
people and you need to show them your culture and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.130
learn their culture as well. So

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.600
the associations are really good and I
appreciate the effort taken by ESSEC

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.620
about this thing.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.600
About Junior ESSEC consulting,
it was a good experience for me because when I arrived

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.240
here, I didn't have anything to finance my 
expenses, so I used to work with

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.270
them and I used to earn on my own and
finance my expenses so it's a really nice

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.569
association. And it's a good consulting firm

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.280
which has been started by ESSEC Ventures,
so

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.590
I think ESSEC

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.150
has a really
good flexibility and options for 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.830
students who want to be entrepreneurs.
When i got to ESSEC last year, I 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.180
actually started courses in September
instead of October.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.750
I actually got here a month earlier because 
there's a French intensive course offered to all

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.209
international students.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.040
For me was, it was definitely a good thing
to do because even though I spoke French

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.040
already, there was an opportunity to get
a high-level French course that helped me

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.979
improve in certain parts
of my

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:26.199
grammar and my language in
general and another thing, it was the perfect

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.249
moment to get integrated with all the other
international students and actually get to

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.749
know them before getting into class.

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.069
When you come to ESSEC and you have no
idea what you want to do,

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.919
the tutor is the best place to start.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:41.339
What you need to do is to 
go through the 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:44.589
CVs of various professors and then

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.779
find the one

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:48.079
who you believe

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.709
is in the same field as you want to be in
future.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.229
You approach the professor...

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:56.749
It's a two way process, the professor chooses you
and you choose the professor.

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:01.089
And if things work out, from then on, it's
a synergy between the two.

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.829
The tutor will guide you through
what

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.640
you should be studying, what you should be
focusing on,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.769
what subjects you should take, what kind
of internships you should do.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.089
Tutors basically are professional guides.
For me, my tutor is actually in the 

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:16.649
the luxury industry,

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:20.849
She has a lot of experience, so we have the 
opportunity to exchange. Well

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:22.449
basically her career

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:26.979
experience and what I really wanted to
do. So together we get to build a

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.209
program

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.859
studying wise and also at work.

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.549
That gives you a clear path of what
to do

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.429
to get where you want. I'm living in the
residence at Cergy Le Haut.

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:42.229
I chose to live in an ESSEC
residence because coming from abroad

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:46.389
it's much easier just to sign papers to
have a studio,

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:50.649
than to actually look for an apartment
elsewhere that's not affiliated with ESSEC.

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:55.059
The residence is actually pretty nice
compared to American

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.769
dorms. It's like a palace.

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.749
Everyone has their own studio
with a kitchenette and bathroom.

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.819
It works out really great, it's close to ESSEC, so
that's convenient. For me learning at ESSEC

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.119
was

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:09.889
through associations,

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.789
through the different experiences I've had
at competitions, meeting

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.749
different students 

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:21.349
at different points, different stages of their
life. Some are doing internships

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.829
some are working full time for
associations, some are working

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:26.050
at their own ventures.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:32.259
So you really have to manage all
that so learning is more through

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:35.210
meeting these different people
different type of

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.990
really creative and brilliant people
at ESSEC.
