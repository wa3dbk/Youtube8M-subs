On behalf of ExpertVillage.com, my name is
Michael Sohaski, and I'm here to tell you

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.510
about nicknames. For this section, I invited
some of my best friends. I have here Elaine

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:20.029
to my left. To Elaine's left is Brian. To
Brian's left is Mary. And to my right, my

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:30.999
immediate right is Crystal. Nicknames. Nicknames
are a lot of fun in poker. It genders camaraderie

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.480
and it shows you, or at least displays to
the opponents that you know something about

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.480
the game and they should fear you. These are
some of the most common hands and we will

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.930
tell you what the nicknames are. Starting
up here. The ten-two, it's known as the "Doyle

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.260
Bronson". Doyle won two main events with that
starting hand. You would never guess it, but

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.450
that is the hand that he started with. Next
off, I think I would pick the "Jackson Five"

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:11.159
and I think that speaks for itself. Yes it
does. The "Dolly Parton" nine to five. And

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:19.509
the "Connectors" four-three is Connectors.
And seven-six suited is "Suited Connectors."

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:26.319
Yes, that's correct, Crystal. On the next
line here we have the two and the ace, that's

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:32.889
also known as Acey Deucey. And Elaine, what's
the next hand? That's definitely "Big Slick"

00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:40.130
[Ace-King] and you can win or lose with that
hand. And that would be "Pocket Rockets" or

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.810
known as "Bullets" [pair of Aces]. And Mary,
what's the next hand? She knows that the Kings

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.020
here are also known as "Cowboys." Next up,
we have, as you had mentioned, "The Ladies"

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.009
or the Queens. I think the pocket Jacks are
referred to as the "Fish Hooks." That's correct.

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:09.599
And then on the final line here, the eights
are also known as "Snowmen." What do you call

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:15.820
a pair of sevens, Brian? "Walking sticks"
of course. And the "Speed Limit" 55, you've

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:23.439
got that one. And the deuces are "Ducks."
So these are some of the major hands, here,

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:30.170
and now you know some nicknames. And, indeed,
you can impress your friends and scare your

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.450
opponents at the table.
