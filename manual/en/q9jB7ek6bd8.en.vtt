00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.190
This time last year, Dimitri Bergé was tearing up the French grasstrack scene,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.980
and preparing for his first taste of Longtrack World Championship action.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.100
An FIM Longtrack World Cup silver medallist with the French national team at Swingfield in Great Britain,

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.080
Bergé was quickly offered a return to the country

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.660
to appear in the British Premier League with the Glasgow Tigers.  

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.820
He summarises his 2014 season so far,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.540
and gives us the lowdown on the incident that brought his progress to a halt.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:42.360
Let's say it was pretty difficult to adapt at first, the first few meetings were pretty hard

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.160
but before my crash it was starting to go better and better.  

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.300
Unfortunately, I had my accident just when I was starting to ride really well.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.600
It was on the last lap, with Lasse Bjerre.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:12.720
On the penultimate corner, I hit a patch of grip, which sent me towards the fence on the exit of the bend. 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:22.800
I tried to avoid him, as he was on the outside, but my handlebar connected.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.620
We got stuck together for about five metres, and I was sent over the other side.

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.599
That's what means I'm away from the tracks for three months

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:59.080
I am going to miss the Grand Prix of Marmande, and I've already missed the Herxheim round.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.900
Having already missed two GPs is annoying, but that's how it is.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.380
The Longtrack World Championship was at the core of Bergé's most impressive performances,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.040
including some incredible rides at the close of 2013.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.140
But now, as his rivals continue to compete for the 2014 crown, Bergé can only watch on

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.540
well aware that they are gaining the advantage of vital track time week on week.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.520
It's pretty frustrating to watch the others riding and not being able to ride

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:48.820
But that's part of a career, unfortunately.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:58.160
I am going to try my maximum to get back up as quickly as possible, even if that will be pretty difficult,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.140
but I'll see how it goes.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.920
Bergé enthusiastic, then, about his eventual track return

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.900
But his own personal fans, as well as followers of the Glasgow Tigers,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.520
will be keen to know how his recuperation is progressing.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.320
and most importantly when he will be
back on track

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.300
Until the 12th June I couldn't do any kind of sport, but now I can take it up again

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.800
so I've already started getting back my fitness. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.920
I have my last doctor's appointment on the 22nd,

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.720
and the doctor has already said that I should be able to race afterwards.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.640
So that means I will be back on track at the end of July.
