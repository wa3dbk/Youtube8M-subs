00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.700
I am Joe Marshall with Expert Village.com
and today we are going to learn how to win

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.370
at poker. We are going to quickly go over
the basic hands. There are ten hands. No matter

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.050
if you are playing seven card stud, Texas
Holdem or just regular draw poker, you need

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.849
to known these hands to be able to play the
game. The best hand is the royal flush. It

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.751
consists of the ten, Jack, Queen, King and
Ace of any suit. In this example it’s all

00:00:24.751 --> 00:00:31.309
of clubs; that’s a royal flush; it’s the
best hand you can have. The second best hand

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.129
is the straight flush. It’s all the same
suit. All the cards are in numerical order.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:44.059
This one is Ace through 5. The third best
hand is the four of a kind. In our example,

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.251
we have the four sevens. Next best hand is
a full house that consists of three of a kind

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:56.699
and a pair in one hand. In this case, they
are two 2s and three Jacks. That is the full

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.920
house. Then over here is just the flush. The
numerical value is not taken into consideration

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.439
here. It is the five cards all of the same
suit. In this example, we have clubs. Then

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.670
there is a straight where it does matter about
the numerical order but the suits themselves

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.290
do not matter. It’s any five any six, seven,
eight or nine. Moving on, it is three of a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.520
kind. It is any card that has… in this case
we have three queens and we have two of a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.090
kind over here, two kings and two Aces and
then like one of the worst hands you can get

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.759
is the pair. In this case, we just have a
pair of sixes here and nothing else to play

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.520
with and if you don’t even have a pair as
good as it gets is like the high card out

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.090
of any other five that you have in your hand.
In this example we have king high we have

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.159
nothing else but the king. That is the worst
and that is a terrible hand. But those are

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.450
the ten basic hands you need to understand
to play any of the games of poker.
