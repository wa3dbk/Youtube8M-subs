Hey guys Keaton here from TechSmartt and today
we're going to be talking about physical buttons,

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.930
their kind of purpose right now and if we
really need them.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.540
So without further adiu, lets go ahead and
get started.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.080
For starters here, why do we even have physical
buttons?

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.080
Well we use them to go home, to power on/power
off our devices and to toggle volume up and

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.280
volume down on our devices.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.660
That has been really it.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.070
When the iPhone was released, it was really
popular for one of these reasons alone which

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.140
was just the fact that it amounted to having
such few buttons.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.950
It was really crazy and that's comparing to
a Palm or even a Blackberry which had tons

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.950
of keys.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.530
That really just includes the QWERTY keyboard.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.079
So what kind of button variations can we find
on popular smartphones to date?

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.930
Well with the iPhone 5s we have our home button,
followed by TouchID, we have our volume rockers,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.579
mute switch, and then power on/power off key
at the top.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.660
With the Samsung Galaxy S5 we have our physical
home button which also acts as a finger reader

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.990
and then we have some capacitive buttons on
the right and left hand side of the fingerprint

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:47.540
reader which act as 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:03:19.989
multitasking 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:36.839
and 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:04:51.940
going backwards.
