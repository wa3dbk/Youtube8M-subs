00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.980
It's time for scottykilmer.com.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.090
Can we fix it!

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.362
Can we?

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:22.685
[ENGINE STARTING]

00:00:22.685 --> 00:00:24.880
I found a problem
with cars that make

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.630
stooges of even good mechanics,
and here's what it is.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.570
So cars are just like people.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.060
They have to breathe in, so
make sure the filters are clean,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.040
but they also have
to breathe out.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.670
[BLOWS AIR]

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.000
Your carb breaths out
through the tailpipe.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.670
If the exhaust system is
clogged up, it won't run right.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.870
And in modern day cars, it's
usually the catalytic converter

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.550
that clogs up, so I'm going
to show you how to check 'em.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.187
Since the catalytic converter's
on the bottom of the car,

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.020
we're jacking it up so
we can see it better.

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:00.550
Well, here's the
catalytic converter.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.160
[TAPPING]

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.630
But it's a sealed unit,
so how do you check it?

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.277
Well, I'm going to
drill a hole and measure

00:01:06.277 --> 00:01:08.110
the exhaust pressure
with this little gauge,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.260
and it'll tell us
if it's clogged up.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.484
First, you drill a little
1/4 hole in the pipe.

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:14.380
Hey, hey!

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.130
Scotty, what are
you doing to my car!

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.360
I've got these little metal
plugs to fill the holes up

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.170
when I'm done.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.670
Then you stick the
gauge in the hole

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.580
to measure the pressure behind
the catalytic converter.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.785
We'll start the engine and
see what the pressure is.

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:32.160
[ENGINE RUNNING]

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.075
Well, the pressure behind
it is less than 1 pound.

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:37.670
It's in the green,
so it's fine behind.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.745
Now I'm going to drill a
hole in front of the cat

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:41.036
and measure the pressure there.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.610
Now when I hook the
hose up in front

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.980
of the catalytic converter, it
has almost 15 pounds pressure.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.780
That means that the
pressure is building up

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.238
in front of the
catalytic converter

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:54.480
because it's clogged up.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.350
It needs a new
catalytic converter.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.380
And here's a couple
mechanic's tips.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.200
If your car has less
than 70,000 miles on it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.060
or is less than seven
years old, there's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.460
a federal warranty covering
the catalytic converters.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.870
You get one for free.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.479
If it's older than that
or you have more mileage,

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.220
go to a discount
muffler store, and they

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.200
can weld a universal
cat on and save you

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.340
a whole bunch of money.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.280
So don't let your mechanic
make a simple job complicated.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.760
Now you know, this looks like
a simple job for simple people.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.530
It only takes a couple minutes
to check a catalytic converter.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.100
