Vegan Basic Meat Loaf Recipe - Food, Cooking, How to 

00:00:01.254 --> 00:00:07.918
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today is Day 
 6 of my journey to vegan-ize Paula Deen's Southern Cooking Bible.

00:00:07.918 --> 00:00:12.214
And today on the show we will be making a basic meatloaf, vegan.

00:00:12.214 --> 00:00:15.859
It is more like a mushroom nut loaf. Hope you enjoy. Here we go.

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:22.198
Vegan Meatloaf (Meat Loaf) Recipe for a Mushroom 
 Nut Loaf - Food, Cooking, How to

00:00:22.198 --> 00:00:27.492
We are going to start this recipe with 
 a large skillet over medium high heat.

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:34.389
We are going to add olive oil, onions, and celery. 
 And let the saute until the onions become translucent.

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:41.889
Next we are going to add a little garlic. Clear out a 
 small spot, add in you garlic for about 30 seconds,

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:49.203
before adding in your chopped mushrooms. Then with you 
 chopped mushrooms, add in a little vegetable broth.

00:00:49.203 --> 00:00:54.683
And let that mixture simmer until most of the 
 liquid is absorbed, but it is still moist.

00:00:54.683 --> 00:01:04.431
To the food chopper we are going to add in 
 pecans and walnuts. Those are my nuts of choice,

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:07.152
because they are inexpensive, and flavorful, and everybody can find them.

00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:13.979
So this is a nut loaf. Your going to give that a quick 
 pulse until your nuts are finely chopped, but not a powder.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.761
Now we are going to mix some flax seed, 
 ground flax seed, in with some water.

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:23.708
Stir that until it is thick and glutenous and set that aside.

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:29.397
Now for the fun part. We are going to mix everything together.

00:01:29.397 --> 00:01:36.096
To a large bowl, you are going to add in your rice, oats, to 
 the left I have poultry seasoning to the right I have parsley.

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:41.400
And then you are going to salt and pepper 
 to taste. That was a beautiful shot.

00:01:41.402 --> 00:01:45.740
That was so artsy, Oh my gosh, love it. 
 It is just food, calm down Tasha.

00:01:45.744 --> 00:01:53.060
Then add in the nuts and give that a 
 quick stir, add in your mushroom mixture.

00:01:53.058 --> 00:01:56.750
And this smelled up the whole house in the best possible way. 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.120
Oh my gosh, it smelled like Thanksgiving was happening, right 
 in my house, in the middle of July.

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:09.610
It was so good. So then you are going to add in your flax 
 seed mixture and it is acting as an egg replacer mixture. 

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:15.700
Once you have all of it mixed in together, put it 
 in a loaf pan, make sure it is evened out,

00:02:15.697 --> 00:02:21.220
and bake that at 375 degrees F, for about 45 minutes to an hour.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:25.910
I did an hour and I think I over 
 baked it. It was a little bit hard.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:34.110
But it tasted delicious. i would do 45 minutes in the oven, then 
 I would either add in soy sauce from the beginning, or

00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:38.940
top with a little soy sauce, because it 
 was a little bland. I must admit.

00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:44.540
I did not taste like meat and I think I like my 
 faux meats that don't try to taste exactly like meat.

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:50.830
They come out more flavorful period and more delicious. But 
 overall, great recipe. That's it for today. Bye
