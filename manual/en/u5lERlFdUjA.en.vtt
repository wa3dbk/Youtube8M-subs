00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.850
pull this off and they totally do arm

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.710
I you know I I would not say it's as
good as good fellows but it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.580
touch my pleasure buttons on the way the
Goodfellas does in terms of just being

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.110
this

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.700
really bowl piece of cinema and
storyteller you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.299
I went out with their room you do

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:36.860
clown

I am NOT you know great great
performances Christian Bale

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.229

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.740
everything that he didn't get to eat
we're getting ready for the machine is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.930
yeah

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.299
Amy Adams by Bradley Cooper Jennifer
Lawrence history began as an end Jeremy

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:58.979
Renner

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.149
a lot looser and funnier than we
expected because you for your call he

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.590
was one of the stiffest Jose ever seen
on sarnoff

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.890
other house I live you mentioned
goodfellas little tired what thing as I

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.450
was thinking

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.300
this is David O bustles course any film
yeah he he P cribs big time but

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.569
he never liked his own roommate pushing
at the moment a great intensity alright

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.580
anything you mention the narration you
have the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.220
the near leaders in those radioed in
goodfellas tell right period specific

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.420
my the pop music and just the clothes
and how decade and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.709
in lab dishes and everyone's out for
themselves and they're all ties with her

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.450
other but

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.660
you know what he does it so beautifully
getting so

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.330
ridiculously entertaining but yet
beneath the flash

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.269
beneath all the hair on the back make up
whatever I just ate a great character

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.220
study conducted

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.260
people who are so desperate that they
they will do everything must to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.319
surviving they're trying to make
something of themselves with the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.890
actually end up feeling for them you did
not love it as much as we did

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.300
I like this movie a lot I don't know
that I loved as much as you would partly

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.220
because

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.970
I'm coming this after we see more of a
wall street for all white for all as

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.670
we're all the talk about like oh this is
a great script is a very

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.300
you see what walter is like a weight
that of course and you know i i suppose

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.099
any film that well right yeah

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.170
story I I would start off on a tangent
about

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.319
I don't know I this one part is I felt
like

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.390
where Goodfellows &amp; Casino

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.400
have a similar vibe to this Goodfellas
casino what people's

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.489
lives are at stake in a way that
American hustle

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.560
doesn't quite get to I felt like like

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.610
at the United Dec like a life-and-death
like it you know the violence that shows

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.049
up in Goodfellas and casino

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.290
can be really shocking because you got
these guys kinda

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.510
perpetuating the tail that they're just
like any or not just like anyone else

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:46.310
but they have

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.180
normal lives and you see them going to
their day-to-day routine so when the

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.900
violence it's

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.769
it's really shocking and I felt what are
the problems with using

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.780
come to the scorsese bag Atrix is you
start to think

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.080
okay at some point somebody's area
knifed and yes there's

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.090
there are couple little tiny seems %uh
violence a mess but not enough that I

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.269
really felt that

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.269
that the characters were quite

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.760
up to the states that you would see a
good for us and

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.590
if I know if they're impressed now don't
get me wrong I like I'm splitting hairs

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.060
here

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.139
I'm really like this not only I think
it's it's a it's a helluva fell

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.139
the performances are amazing US jennifer
Lawrence is hardly got any scenes with

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.410
cheese abstaining

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.050
if it only commentator is playing really
well yeah I didn't want to give it away

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.650
but yes who is it is hysterical and I

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.310
the whole running gag with Louis CK
Bradley Cooper you know i i white a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.550
movie where it

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.720
because we also know we've got anchorman
2 coming out soon it's so easy to do

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.460
seventies detail

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.930
as a joke and this movie kinda gets the
idea of seventies

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.310
fancy you know the flocked wallpaper and
the the evening gowns everything

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.380
in a way that I mean he it may be absurd
on its face but its you never feel like

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:54.990
the movie going

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.550
at seventies wacky like it's it peels

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.340
honest and true to the story they're
telling you don't like no

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.490
I see where you would think that was my
and yeah it's kinda ritual used at the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:06.330
same time also

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.810
it informs who they are and forms who
they want to hire more police themselves

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.610
out right

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.120
like Amy Adams the pic so much Amy Adams
sideboob

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.560
you still compact but bad holy shit she
sexy

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.190
oh my god I don't know why I'm never
seen her you see her

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.820
surprising as animal like Mike the
master your sheets expecting parents

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:27.389
John

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.900
but that is who she wants to be that
that that person in

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.370
the world she aspired to forget is that
averell darlene okay actually I really

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.530
like a lot of work left

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.380
I can take it %um like that some I'm
rather I'm

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.880
I do I do think it's more than just
catch mmm no yeah I definitely and I

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:45.270
just

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:51.350
I A it was it was exhilarating was one
of those movies where you know i i was

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.800
the I would like to see them to my top
10 list and I i realize that the movies

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.069
that

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:58.130
I think I respond to the most are the
ones that really

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.800
go out on a limb and try something
difficult where they can hold up a cot

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.100
ok can you do ever you're literally
holding your breath they can make it to

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.960
the finish line

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.440
without blowing a time how and when they
pull that off its just

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.750
it's exhilarating interesting to idea to
russell has cultivated this little party

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.139
is little is alright you have had to the
stars a

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:20.419
supplying playbook and Bradley Cooper
and Jennifer Lawrence get to the stars

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.120
at the fighter indication bail on Amy
Adams

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.590
and we all knew these were hugely
versatile actors

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.069
but the mud together in different places
but the same director and don't give a

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:31.130
sh 80,000 I

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.600
he's a great director about actors yeah
working with him

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.870
yeah I mean if you talk too late to go
here that was the one day

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.880
you know but Lily Tomlin said you were
told they were then again even after

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.919
they had that blow up on the senate
huckabee's

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.729
I think that way you know and it to the
point where even the minor characters

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:51.789
you could almost see a movie about that
like I could I could totally watch a

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.960
movie about like Jeremy Renner's wife

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.500
that you know on what she's got going on
there in Berlin Jeremy Renner

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.740
earlier because I think that getting
that level of humanity

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.080
and character at a rather i think is no
mean feat right I mean

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.500
runners a great actor but I think a lot
of times he if people allow him to just

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.380
be stoic

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.250
and that's an easy note to do yeah and
he's very good at it but let us to read

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:13.810
into

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.099
right where is saying where's you know
you get real

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:21.300
a motion out of combine in this very
alarming crime but you actually feel for

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.520
him yeah absolutely I'm really like that

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.630
I mean yeah some good candy or you know
yeah

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.800
transport yeah I justice on the most
likely okay looking II 9.8 this is the

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.530
number two on my list and if you are no
number one is not to come back we will

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.539
do our best to the year

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:42.139
in a couple weeks will get it now I am
almost a nine-point a is

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.330
of a number two on my list and
shockingly we did not do a rather

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:46.940
rapidly

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.580
we share a brain as usual not yet know
after I love it too

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.020
just fine and that the ninety-six
percent certified fresh ninety-six

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:54.919
percent

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:57.990
what r average 0 9.4

00:07:57.990 --> 00:07:59.090
hi go see it back
