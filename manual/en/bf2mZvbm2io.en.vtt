00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Hi babes!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.149
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.420
Today, I am going to do my August Favorites.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.579
I have a lot here, so I’m just going to
jump right in with a setting spray by Nyx

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:09.650
cosmetics.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.659
This is a Matte finish spray?

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.869
Setting Spray?I don’t know it says matte
finish setting spray.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:16.869
Yeah!

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.300
That’s what it is!

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.070
I heard a lot of negative reviews actually.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.890
I didn’t think I was going to like it.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.660
A lot of people said that it didn’t work
for their skin.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.830
They had oily skin.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.330
I also have oily skin, and I didn’t think
it was going to work, but surprisingly, It

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.330
actually does!

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.020
I don’t really use it as a setting spray
though, I like to use it get rid of the powdery-ness

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.910
of my setting powder.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.750
And speaking of primer, I had to mention this
Nyx Angel Veil Primer.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.980
It’s an ultra-velvet finish type of primer.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.890
I don’t really rely on this to stop oil
even though this is what it’s supposed to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.890
do.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.570
I like to use it to fill in my pores.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.240
I’m wearing, actually these on my face today.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.080
I love the way that it looks, so I wanted
to mention these two.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.250
Another face product is hylamide photography
foundation.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.180
This is a base tint and on one of my tutorials,
I used it after foundation which you could

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.950
definitely do.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.430
But I find that it works better if you use
it under foundation.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.090
Basically, what this is supposed to do discolor
correct your skin while you are on camera

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.500
or taking pictures.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.530
It has an illuminator which is why I thought
I could use it right after foundation.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.860
Which again, you can!

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.950
But it corrects everything so when you are
on camera, it makes everything look as what

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.950
it looks like.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.380
So this is the color I am.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.510
I’m using it underneath my foundation on
top of the primer.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.510
I recommend this!

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.260
This is from Deciem.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.740
I always butcher their names, but I did a
previous collective haul and I had a lot of

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.430
products, so I thought I would mention this
and put it in my favorites video because I’ve

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.710
been loving it a lot.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.380
Real quickly, I’ve been using the Bikinibod
supplements.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.000
I did a review on Friday of it.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.739
So If you want to check that out, you can
see my review on it.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.420
But I wanted to mention it in my favorites
today because It has been a favorite all 2-3

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.420
months now.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.939
I haven’t talked about it, or done anything
about it until last friday.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.189
I finally feel comfortable in putting it in
my favorited because I really do like it and

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.209
I’m going to get another bottle cause I’m
almost done with this one.

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.480
So, I love that!

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.400
Let’s jump into more makeup, so from Pur
Minerals I have this Selfie kit.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.780
It’s called love your selfie and basically,
it has all of these shadows and an illuminator.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.420
It has blush, bronzer, lipgloss, mascara.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.269
So Pretty much everything you need for the
kit on the go!

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.000
You can get it at ulta for $39 which is not
bad!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.930
You’ll get a full face kit.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.060
I’ve found myself using this a lot and often!

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.340
So I wanted to recommend that!

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.499
For nail polish, I’ve been using OPI Samoan
Sand a lot in my videos.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.519
That actually is a favorite for this month,
but my most favorite is by Orly.

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.230
This is the sec in dry quick dry top coat.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.000
I use this all the time!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.239
Basically, you can put on as many coats of
nail polish without it drying and you put

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.620
this top coat on it and it will dry all of
the layers underneath the topcoat within seconds.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.199
I give it about 1-2 minutes actually, to make
sure that everything is dry, but it is perfection!

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:37.769
I can’t do my manicures without doing this
at all.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.689
It keeps me from smudging.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.580
I always mess up my nails and they always
end up terrible!

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.749
So I highly recumbent this if you are one
of those girls who do their nails before bed

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.019
or you have to do stuff and you need your
nails to dry super fast.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.919
It has a nice gloss finish, but it’s very
thick and it makes my nail polish color last

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.480
longer too!

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.819
And also, this shimmer shadow in the color
cheers to life!

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.040
This is a brand new eyeshadow that has just
launched and they are incredible!

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.199
I’ve never felt anything like this before.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.689
It’s very beautiful!

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:11.810
Very nice formulation!

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.489
You can apply it with your fingers, a brush
and still get a great color pay off!

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.650
So I had to recommend this if you are going
to pick up anything from city color cosmetics,

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.229
I recommend that you try these too!

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.790
They have a lot of different colors and this
one has been my favorites!

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.310
It’s a bronzy color, and It feel like fall!

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.419
I also have some fashion/style favorites!

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.590
They are sunglasses.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.300
This one, I recently got the other day, but
it’s already made it in my favorites video

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.669
because I love it!

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.580
But this is just plain sunglasses.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.020
Its brown, I don’t have brown I usually
have black, but it comes across black on camera.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.199
But it has this bar which I think takes it
to another level.

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.050
I really, really like these!

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.050
They are incredible!

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.050
And I also love that the nose area isn’t
one of those foot nose areas that mess up

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.300
my nose makeup! (cause it’s so annoying!)It
just sits and it doesn’t create an indention

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.379
and mess up my makeup.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:12.610
I’ve also been loving this one which is
also has the same thing with the footers of

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.610
it.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:14.710
I don’t know if that’s what it’s called.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:22.740
But this is from LuLu’s and I got this from
the nyx face awards and I wore it in my previous

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.100
lookbook ‘not my average Lookbook video’
I’ll list it down below if you haven’t

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.100
seen it.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.100
It’s one of my favorite videos ever!

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.199
So I’ve been loving those!

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.710
So that’s it for myAugust Favorites!

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.970
