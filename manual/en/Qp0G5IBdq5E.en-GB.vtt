00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.370
The adrenaline that you get from when you're
sending the girls or boys out on the catwalk

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:20.250
in your clothes is incredibly exciting.
Hello I'm Vic and I study Fashion at Kingston

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:29.640
University.
Last week we had a great opportunity to showcase

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.210
our first collection at Graduate Fashion Week
on the catwalk.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.600
It was definitely a lot of hard work to get
to that point but I think it was a really

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.320
nice end to what was a really challenging
but fulfilling three years of studying.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.400
One of the good things about Kingston is that
it is part of Graduate Fashion Week and I

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.540
think that was definitely one of my incentives
when I was thinking about where I wanted to

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.680
go.
Graduate Fashion Week obviously got a lot

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.890
of hype around it. It gets a lot of exposure,
it gets in a lot of magazines and there is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.740
a selection process to get into Graduate Fashion
Week and luckily I was selected to have my

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.270
work on the catwalk.
And I feature in the Times Newspaper the day

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.579
after Graduate Fashion Week which is a really
nice thing to have as an ending to the course

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.100
because it was just so nice to be able to
see that there were people outside of the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.150
university, looking at our work, that it's
not just there to be marked, to get a grade,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.040
it's actually about sparking the imagination
of someone who might want to actually employ

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.270
you.
One of the reasons why I came here is when

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.880
I looked at the work that I seen people had
been doing, there was so much drawing, and

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.700
so much expression, and a lot of freedom in
the designing. So when I was looking around

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.009
and choosing which place to go, I thought
Kingston actually offered in between stages

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.509
from like doing all these crazy ideas and
actually channelling them into something that

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.100
was, you know, a wearable garment that was
fit to be sold in the future.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:11.730
One of the key skills for coming here and
something that you should love to do and practice

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.900
anyway is drawing; that's something that's
really important and I think most people who

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.730
are actually interested in Fashion want to
be drawing things, they're drawing people,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.019
they're drawing what's around you, it's a
good way to express your ideas.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.599
I started doing a lot of illustration alongside
my practice, which led for me to be recognised

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.370
as doing proper illustrations out in the fashion
world, alongside the degree, which was actually

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.860
quite good in terms of my course because it
put things into proportion; it also excelled

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.150
my work in university because I was doing
illustration as well.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.700
The atmosphere actually in the studio has
been amazing since the beginning. Our studio's

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.610
always a really productive place to be, everyone
respects each others space. We have enough

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.110
facilities for everyone. There's a lot of
3D experimentation as well and you get to

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.480
grasp a lot of skills, but because obviously
there are a lot of technical skills to get

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.200
with making clothes, I mean it is a challenge
to learn, but it doesn't feel sort of a laborious

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.650
thing, it feels like very natural to be able
to pick up these skills to turn your creative

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.650
ideas into something real.
I don't think you could ever say there was

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.311
a sort of typical Kingston student, knowing
all my classmates and things like that, I

00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:39.930
just know how different we all are.
Kingston has great connections with the Industry.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.930
Throughout the time that I've been here we've
always had industry-based projects. So we

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.130
are taught, I think, to actually have skills
for a job at Graduation, and I think being

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.470
at Kingston, especially on the Fashion course,
you feel quite well-equipped for the industry.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.459
We had a design project for Old Navy, in California,
San Francisco and that was very, sort of,

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.749
drawing based project and I just really went
for it, and we won a ten week internship in

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:14.469
San Francisco, which was sort of a proper
Design Work Placement that was part of the

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.650
university.
As well as that we had a really cool project

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.160
with the British Fashion Council, which was
for Nicole Farhi. I was a finalist out of

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:30.280
the universities, in that project which meant
that I was interviewed with Nicole Farhi and

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.389
Caroline Rush and Anne Tyrrell who are the
Heads of British Fashion Council.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.990
The great thing about Kingston is that it
really embraces your individuality and I think

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.050
one of the main feedbacks that we got at Graduate
Fashion Week was how unique everyones' portfolio

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.871
was, because you know, they were all trained
for these very Industry projects, everyone

00:04:53.871 --> 00:04:58.840
had something different to show and had totally
different interpretations but all equally

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.530
as successful, so that was a really positive
thing to know that it does generate really

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.960
diverse students.
It's been such an enjoyable experience and

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.210
to know how much we've all achieved and I
know the achievements I've had from Kingston,

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:24.030
I don't, I really don't think I would have
found, had I not been here.
