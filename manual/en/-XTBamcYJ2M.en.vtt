Hello, I'm Matt Hail and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm gonna show you today how to do

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:05.790
a landscape painting.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.630
A special word on a couple of the supplies
you're gonna be using today. And the first

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.750
is on the canvas that you select to paint
on. There are all sorts of different types

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.780
of canvases out there. If you're painting
a lot, you can get your own canvas and stretch

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.919
it and wood frame it that's great, but a lot
of art stores will sell canvases like this

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:28.090
which already have the wood framing around
the side, it's ready to go. Another thing

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.560
to look for on your canvases is is it pre-treated,
does it need to be? What is pre-treatment?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.230
Pre-treatment is a material they call Gesso.
Basically what it is is they will put in a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.829
very thin layer of it on your stretched canvas.
What this will do is it will basically kind

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.610
of help the paint interact with the canvas,
not just seep right through, absorb it, it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.100
will help it over time. That's something to
keep in mind because a lot of these canvases

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.990
come pre-treated and it will say so on the
label. Another thing I wanted to cover in

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.730
more detail are brushes and the types of brushes
we'll be using.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.710
There are a lot of different types of brushes,
an entire variety of them out there. Again,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.080
if you are painting on occasion a lot of art
stores will have some very economic options

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.080
for you out there. But let's cover the different
types of brushes that are out there. While

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.280
there are a whole lot of them, you can get
things, brushes are made from everything,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.860
from animal hair, there are synthetics out
there now a days. A lot of people have some

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.200
pretty strong opinions on those. In my experience,
it's all kind of what you're going for. Really

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.200
the most important thing is the artist using
the brush, rather than whether or not it's

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.360
rabbit hair or goat hair in your brush. That
said, I do think that shape is very important

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.969
on brushes in the type of effects you're going
for. So, we're gonna cover the three main

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.439
types of brushes and a specialty brush. The
first are just simply called round. Rounded

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.110
brushes. This is very simple. They're round,
they make a circular shape at the top and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.610
these are really, really good for smoothing
edges, not where you want really, really harsh

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.820
tones. These come in a variety of sizes. The
smaller ones will tend to have more of a point

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.210
to 'em, which is better for detail work. The
next brush are flats. This is this 'cause

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.430
it's a flat top right across the side there,
you got 90 degree angles on each side there.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.349
These are really good for specially being
your more forceful brush strokes. They are

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.230
also really good for kind of wedging or dragging
color around your canvas on. Definitely a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.200
little more of a course, sort of setting in
the infantry of brushes. The next one is a

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.670
philbert, which in some ways is a kind of
a hybrid between the round and the flat, meaning

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.989
that it's still still pretty flat like the
flat brush here, it's not super thick, but

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.550
at the same time it doesn't have the square
top. It has a little more of a tapered, slightly

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.900
rounded edge, kind of more 45 degree angle.
And again, you can get these brushes in a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.280
variety of sizes. Generally the more detail
work you wanna do the smaller the brush you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.629
want. Another specialty brush I wanted to
cover is the fan brush over here. The fan

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.519
brush is really cool. It can do lots of sort
of like neat dragging, very fluttery dry brushing

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.720
effects, where you just may want just a hint
of sunshine, or a highlight on say a leaf,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.180
or some water or a person's face. It's really,
really great because you get a nice wide,

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.240
very thin swaf of color with things like a
fan brush.
