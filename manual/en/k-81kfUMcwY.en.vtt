Hi my name is Jim DeYoung. I'm here in Salt
Lake City, Utah with Fat Cats Family Bowling

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.260
Center. You can see us on the web at fatcatsfun.com.
I'm also here representing expertvillage.com.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.679
I'm going to show you how to score and also
get an average. So right now I have a score

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:24.519
sheet from the game that I was just bowling
a minute ago. It shows you a couple of things.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:31.560
When you have spare, that's ten pins plus
whatever you get on the next ball. So I got

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.130
a strike. So I had nine before so plus 10
pins 19 plus ten more for the strike. That

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:46.420
equals 29. So now I've got. Now with the strike
you add it up plus the next two balls. So

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:54.739
you have a strike and a nine spare. So that
would be a total of 29 pins to add up on the

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.870
29. So that would come out to 58. Now if I
would have gotten nothing on this next ball

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.540
for nine zero. The next ball would not have
added anything on. So if I would have just

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.890
gotten a six count on the next ball and nothing
on that that would just be six pins added

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.940
to that. So that would actually come out to
94. So there's the scoring options for bowling.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.150
If you get all strikes you come out with a
300. Now I'm going to teach you how to keep

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.680
an average. I just made up numbers here. For
one day I had 233, 216 and 224. That was a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.110
total series of 673. You divide that by three
games and you get your average of 224. So

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.130
the next day I came over and I shot 269, 254
and 200. That was a total series of 723. And

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.410
total pins is 1396. You divide that by six
games and you come out to an average of 232.
