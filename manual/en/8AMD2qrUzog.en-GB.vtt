00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.520
I suppose this is a less comfortable history

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.620
within those memories that people take away from World War One

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.299
Almost 100 years later there was still so much shame associated with having fought in the war

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:26.359
and having been deemed a coward or deserter and executed for it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.420
There was a pardon in 2006

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.760
They were saying, generally, quite a few people shouldn’t have been executed

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.480
That seemed like a very important moment for a lot of family members

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:45.100
I hope that people are just given space to
think about those people

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.340
rather than let them be forgotten

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.480
The whole series is called Shot at Dawn

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.600
and that’s because these people were always executed very early morning

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.360
before the rest of warfare continued for the rest of the day

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.600
At first I wondered whether, you know, not
having a family connection

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.200
with World War One was a problem

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.580
because it felt like a really difficult, huge subject

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.080
to find something that I might be able to
comment on or have some sort of input on

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.689
After quite a lot of research, I found out about people who were executed

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.480
for cowardice and desertion

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.930
I thought it was really important to photograph
the sites at the same season

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.630
as when the execution had happened, and also
at the same time of day

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.710
so I went back all throughout 2013

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.020
So this one was in Ferfay in the north of France

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.840
It was a slag heap

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.580
There were other ones all along the Western Front

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.360
so in Belgium and all through France towards Germany

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.180
I was able to come up with 23 sites

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.780
So this photograph was taken in West Flanders

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.440
It’s called Verbranden-Molen, this area, and it’s quite a rare case of a decimation

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.060
So that means every tenth person in the regiment
was executed

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.460
They were told to go over the front

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.320
The battalion before them had gone, had been slaughtered

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.040
They said, we’re too tired, we can’t do
it, and therefore there was a decimation ordered

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.860
a very rare, but appalling punishment

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.260
This is one of the five pieces that will be in the Tate exhibition

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.090
Each work is named with the names of the people
who were executed there

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.090
the times of death, the dates of death and
then the location

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.850
and in the exhibition it will be always shown next to the work

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.500
It’s really the relationship between the
text and the image

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.500
that really make the point that I’m trying to make

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.600
You’re stamping the presence of that person

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.340
back into this empty landscape

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.960
so it’s really the absence that’s glaringly present
