00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.340
The toy helicopter has a shaft and

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.950
two blades each

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:15.710
tilted to catch the air and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.740
move the helicopter forward or backward

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.610
depending on the

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.630
direction of spin first Sergei

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.310
spins the shaft of the toy

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.270
helicopter and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.410
releases it as the blades turn the

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.320
copter moves

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.950
through the air In the second

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.440
release the blades

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.750
aren�t turning as fast and the

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.020
helicopter begins to tumble as the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.120
spinning slows Now

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.000
we�ve added a blade to the

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.640
back end of the helicopter Double blades

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:39.780
definitely stabilize

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.460
the helicopter due to the

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.310
increased angular momentum But do you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.010
think that they

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.890
increase the helicopter�s speed we

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.270
also brought along

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.760
a small helicopter The

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.880
smaller helicopter has

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.290
smaller blades which produce

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.170
less upward force but also less

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.560
mass which makes it

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.900
easier to move The two

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.840
effects tend to cancel each other The

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.090
double small helicopter

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.770
has a large helicopter shaft

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.430
between the two small copters It also

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.940
works well On the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.700
second spin Sergei turns the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.440
copter the other direction and it moves

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.640
through the air in the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.660
opposite direction Finally notice

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.190
what will happen when we combine a

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.250
large blade with a

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.150
small one We discover that

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.340
it�s more stable

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.830
if the large blade leads

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.400
the helicopter What

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.300
if we add tape to one blade

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.240
Although the helicopter still flies it�s

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.970
definitely wobblier

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.710
Except for crashing into

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.720
walls the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.420
helicopter works as well in the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.300
air of the space

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.230
station as it does back on earth
