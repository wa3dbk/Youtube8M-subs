00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.220
What's up? This is Betty, and have I got
the McDaddy HP for you guys today...

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.090
This is the HP dx7500, and it comes 
with an Intel Core 2 Duo Processor.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.360
You have 4GB of DDR2 memory, 
and the biggest one of them all,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.870
you got a Terabyte of hard-drive space.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.870
So, this is a great desktop PC, 
if you're like, the boss,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.710
or if you want a home central 
computer. This would be it, because,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.510
you got so many features in here,
that, I don't know where to begin.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.380
I guess, let's begin with the 
outside, the front. Let me show you:

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.250
On the front here, of the 
HP dx7500, we start at the top,

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.620
the Power button on this model is 
actually at the top of the machine,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.990
moving down, you have 
your DVD R/W Drive,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.660
with your Eject button here,
and your status indicator here.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.400
Down here shows more room for additions, 
if you wanted to add another optical drive,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.780
and then, of course, your media 
reader, that takes all the SD cards,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.450
Micro SD, SD/MMC, you name'em, they're here.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.280
Then, of course, on the bottom your 
three USB 2.0 ports, a Firewire port,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.610
and then your microphone and headphone jacks.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.990
You look back here, we begin at the
top, with our power supply unit here.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.490
Then you have your status 
indicator on the back as well.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.130
Your ventilation, from your power unit,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.470
and then, moving down, you 
see we have expansion slots.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.040
Up to four different 
expansion slots here, to add

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.610
anything else that might 
think this thing is missing.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.310
You also have your Line-Ins and Outs, your
microphone and speaker jacks right here,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.390
and then your Ethernet, and you have more
USB ports, you have four more USB ports,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.160
and another Firewire port, 
like I said  before.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.830
Moving down you have your 
VGA and your DVI ports,

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.160
and then you have more 
digital audio, which is RCA.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.970
I haven't seen this on a computer 
as of late, which is really cool,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.040
because you can connect it to your 
stereo system, or your television, with ease.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.910
And then, of course, your PS2 ports, 
for your mouse and keyboard,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.380
and two more expansion slots down here.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.210
Let's take a look inside - and on the inside
you have a  300 Watt power supply unit.

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.490
Right here you got your optical drives, 
and you have another expansion slot,

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.900
for another optical drive, or anything else
you might think you wanna put in here.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.530
Then down here, you have more bays, you have
a 3.5" bay and then your Terabyte hard-drive.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.110
Looking over to the motherboard, 
you see your  four slots of DDR2 memory,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.080
two of them are already 
taken up with 2GB sticks each,

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.250
and then your heatsink fan 
and your CPU cooling fan.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.360
You also have your PCI Express slots here,
and then your PCI slots down here,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.360
your PCI x1 slots. I don't know if you 
can see'em, but there they are, I promise.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.860
Other than that, you 
have many, many features

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.370
and much, much power on this
machine. It is the HP dx7500.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.910
Perfect for your office, for your home, if
you wanna make it into an entertainment PC,

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.950
this is great. If you wanna make 
it into an office central machine,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.720
with all the important documents, so 
that your employees can actually access it,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.290
this is great. Remember - 1TB 
hard-drive space, can't go wrong with that.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.960
So, this is the HP, check it out.
