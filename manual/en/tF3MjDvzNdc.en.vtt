(light pop music)

00:00:04.874 --> 00:00:06.076
- Hi friends, it's April.

00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:07.420
Thank you so much for tuning in.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.225
Today, we're gonna make
the Glowing Green Smoothie,

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:13.284
which can be found in The
Beauty Detox Solution book.

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:14.861
My friend Crystal recommended it.

00:00:14.861 --> 00:00:18.152
She has perfect skin, so
I have to know her secret.

00:00:18.152 --> 00:00:21.245
And she actually is on day 80-something

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:25.128
of The Beauty Detox Solution
and the Glowing Green Smoothies

00:00:25.128 --> 00:00:26.265
and her skin is perfect.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.094
She looks like she's glowing from within

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.255
and I wanna look like her.

00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:30.387
I wanna look like that.

00:00:30.387 --> 00:00:33.291
And so, I'm starting
and this is my day two.

00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:36.564
I hope you try it and continue
on this process with me.

00:00:36.564 --> 00:00:38.398
And the reason as to why

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:40.814
a Glowing Green Smoothie
is so beneficial for you

00:00:40.814 --> 00:00:43.507
is because it's nutritious,
it has all these greens,

00:00:43.507 --> 00:00:45.481
it has fruits and vegetables,

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:49.010
it releases the toxins from your body

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.983
because of the fiber it has.

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.839
It will end up making your
skin glow from within,

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.528
your nails will be stronger,
hair will be shinier,

00:00:56.528 --> 00:00:59.082
you'll have more energy and
it will aid in weight loss,

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:02.119
due to the high fiber in
the Glowing Green Smoothie.

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.534
I hope you have it for breakfast
every single day with me.

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:07.230
So, let's go ahead and make
the Glowing Green Smoothie.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.755
So, first of all, you're going
to want to cut half a lemon

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:12.955
and put it aside and cut
it into smaller pieces

00:01:12.955 --> 00:01:14.279
for the lemon juice.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.785
And then, you're going
to chop some apples.

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:18.040
As long as it's organic,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.961
it doesn't matter what kind of apple.

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:22.004
Just one apple will do.

00:01:22.004 --> 00:01:23.416
Chop one pear.

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:26.551
Make sure it's washed and organic as well.

00:01:30.581 --> 00:01:32.657
Then, chop a stalk of celery.

00:01:35.468 --> 00:01:38.598
Place your apples, pears
and celery into a bowl

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.101
and we'll be using this later.

00:01:40.101 --> 00:01:43.654
Let's start by adding
one-and-a-half cups of water,

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:46.662
a head of organic romaine lettuce,

00:01:46.662 --> 00:01:51.440
and you can just use your
hands to cut the lettuce.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.776
Then, you're going to
add some organic spinach.

00:01:54.776 --> 00:01:58.467
I usually like to just add two handfuls.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.149
Once you've added the spinach,

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.312
turn the blender on to low and blend.

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:07.694
(blender churning)

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:11.034
Next, add your celery,

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:14.012
your peaches and apples.

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:21.942
And blend.
(blender churning)

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.303
Then, add a banana.

00:02:29.326 --> 00:02:33.269
And blend.
(blender churning)

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.345
Add some parsley...

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:42.978
and then add some cilantro as well.

00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:44.877
And squeeze the lemon juice,

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:49.757
half a lemon, into the smoothie.

00:02:50.226 --> 00:02:54.870
And blend again.
(blender churning)

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.285
So, if you're just
starting out with detoxing

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:01.044
and this is your first time
with the Glowing Green Smoothie,

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:04.191
you should start out with 16 ounces.

00:03:08.484 --> 00:03:10.241
And I like to measure.

00:03:16.372 --> 00:03:20.378
So, you'd wanna start out with this much,

00:03:20.378 --> 00:03:23.369
which is pretty much this cup.

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.833
And because you have extra,

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:28.218
you can actually store it in a container

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:30.192
and put it in the refrigerator

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:32.636
and have that for breakfast the next day.

00:03:35.647 --> 00:03:37.187
If you're on the go, you can place it

00:03:37.187 --> 00:03:39.931
in a sippy cup container and drink it

00:03:39.931 --> 00:03:41.696
while you're on your way to work.

00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:42.968
This is really gonna help you.

00:03:42.968 --> 00:03:46.400
I thank you so much for
watching and have a great day.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.574
Bye.
