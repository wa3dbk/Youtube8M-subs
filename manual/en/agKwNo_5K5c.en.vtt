00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:12.070
From the front you turn back keeping your
arm on the plane from the door frame straight

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:24.790
to the target and the arm should lower the
the shoulder when you are starting and then

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:34.530
you drop down and the arm will then be level
at this point and you can really pull the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.949
door frame with the rear leg also when you
are turning back the front heel will lift

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:54.059
up easily off the ground and the first thing
when you sit down should be the weight going

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:03.289
into the front heel getting ready to brace
all the momentum you are pulling stopping

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:17.350
it and turning your body so you are pulling
all this weight straight out and you get leverage

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:32.070
by going lower using the ground and also by
pulling lower on the door frame if you are

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:43.070
trying to move the whole frame in one piece
instead of reaching up high and pulling the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:58.780
frame over into the ground it should be comfortable
height to drop into so you can compress against

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:14.750
the ground now with the hips leading the throw
or you can think of the butt leading the throw

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:24.560
when you are turned back against the door
frame your butt will be closer to the target

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:34.810
than the disc cause you want to pull the disc
forward with your butt going to the target

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.352
and then when this releases your butt is going
to start going away from the target and move

00:02:41.352 --> 00:02:52.370
the disc out toward the target so that's how
the hips lead even if the shoulders get out

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:02.410
ahead the rotation is now this way and the
hips are turned back but everything is braced

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:09.622
against the front side so when you see the
finish the rear shoulder should still be braced

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:21.180
against the front foot and the throwing shoulder
will be going back that way so when you are

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:33.250
pulling on the door frame the hip is leading
and you just want to pull straight and you

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:49.780
are just getting your body out of the way
what I see a lot of is turning around too

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:01.350
far where the disc is over here and the elbow
is past the shoulder and that's where the

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:17.660
rounding happens so the elbow is going around
where it should be straight leading with the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:37.460
elbow the whole arm with the hand on the other
side of the disc and releases out to the target

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:58.860
I reachback kind of low and drop and throw
so the first move is the drop and that's going

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:09.183
to bring the disc forward you are not really
trying to swing yet and you want to wait until

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:13.960
you get the disc and the elbow out forward
