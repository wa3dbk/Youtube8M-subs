Hi I'm Jason former Mac genius and what we
are going to talk about today is getting information

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.240
from one computer to another via firewire
which is the quickest and easiest way to do

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.110
it. What we are going to do is we are going
to start up the Mac book and we are going

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.710
to view that in target disc mode so when I
start the computer up I am going to hold down

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.590
the T key on the keyboard and what that is
going to allow me to do is to access the Mac

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.200
book from this computer using just a firewire
cable. So it is a quick start up. It has already

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.050
started up and there is a symbol on the screen
of a firewire symbol. So we have a firewire

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:43.170
here and I'm going to plug this in and so
when we plug this guy in here, there we go.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.109
Now we are going to plug this in, plug this
in and what we are going to do now is we see

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.829
that the Mac book is now on the desktop as
a firewire icon and it is down right here

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.010
and so we have full access to this system.
So we can pull any files over, here is some

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.800
work and you treat this just as an external
hard drive so what I'm going to do is take

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.680
this 3D man file and take it over to the desktop
and let it go. So when you have this, your

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.430
other computer mounted on here it mounts like
a hard drive so it is going to show up in

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.410
your panel over on the left side here and
you can eject it from there if you want and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:35.920
what that will do is eject using the firewire
eject port and there we go. So basically again

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.000
what we are doing is we are taking the computer
that we want to access and starting that up

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.840
using firewire target disc mode, we do that
by holding down the T key on the keyboard.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.270
Then we plug the firewire cable in and you
basically have access to this computer, full

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.270
access, no holds barred and you can transfer
any images or documents or pictures that you

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.380
want. I'm Jason and that is how you transfer
information from one computer to another.
