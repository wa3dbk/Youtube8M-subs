00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.930
Here is another great classic knot. This is
a square knot, otherwise known as the reef

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.380
knot. If you look down here you can see that
I've got two lines that I'm going to be using

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.630
here. I got my red and my blue, and what I'm
going to is I'm going to take my blue line,

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:20.620
and I'm going to wrap it under like so. Creating
a bite here that is going to encase my line,

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.630
my red line within it. And I'm going to take
my red line, and I'm going to bring it over,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:32.640
I'm going to bring it under both of these
lines, like so. There we go, and what I'm

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.110
going to do, is I'm going to take this and
loop this back. Pull out a little bit more

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.710
length here, lets keep this part right up
here, and this down. Loop this back over,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.350
like so. Now what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to take this line here, and its going

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.950
to come over both of these and then back through.
As you can see I've created like a little

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.719
cross here. And X. And it kind of weaved in
together with one another. And as you pull

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:11.131
these, you'll see it will come together rather
nicely. This is your reef slash square knot.

00:01:11.131 --> 00:01:15.170
Now what's really great about this knot, is
you can take this even further if you're so

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.679
inclined. And you can take it, wrap this rope
over that one. This rope over those two, my

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:28.369
line back over these two. And bring this one
back through here and create another square

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.420
knot up on top of this. Now this has gone
past what this would have been used for. The

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.789
square knot right here would have been used
initially, say if you had a bath robe, and

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.899
say if you just had your lines coming around
your waist, then you would just tie your square

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.359
knot. But if you're doing this right here,
what you're going to end up doing, is you're

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.829
going to end up weaving this into a line.
And I'll show you what I'm talking about,

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.689
this line right here, was weaved, starting
with our square knot. And just weaved all

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.849
the way down creating this nice thick rope
that we have here. Now this one doesn't really

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.619
have a lot of practical purposes being this
big, but if you do it on a smaller line, this

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.749
is a nice great weaving here, something that
you can trust and put a lot of weight on.
