00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.231
In Morocco, It's clearly noted the non respect of the pedestrian crossing. 

00:00:05.489 --> 00:00:08.489
from the side of the drivers and also the side of the Moroccan pedestrians.

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.734
an understandable attitude because of the partial or total absence of pedestrian crossing

00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:15.888
The Team Agadir the Five Leaders provide us more information about this 
 in this report that they do about the pedestrians in Morocco.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:27.623
Youth Council of Agadir

00:00:53.843 --> 00:00:57.843
What is your Opinion about this images ?

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:05.357
Expressly, those images that we saw in the videos 
 shows a lack of awareness of pedestrians

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:11.673
They let the pedestrian cross and they take other passages

00:01:12.068 --> 00:01:24.068
and also we saw that cars and buses don't 
 respect the pedestrians when they want to pass

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:29.959
Because of the lack of culture of crossing

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:36.196
An example of this culture is to give priority to pedestrians

00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.431
And we didn't see that in those two videos

00:01:39.922 --> 00:01:49.920
An other image I wondered about, is the one where a man driving 
 a big trolley which is over load without seeing his way

00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:53.980
He can cause an accident

00:01:53.295 --> 00:02:00.300
In your opinion why the most people who are educated and 
 cultured don't respect the highway code and the pedestrian cross

00:02:00.622 --> 00:02:06.620
we always noticed that they cross in the road 
 of cars. why in your point of view?

00:02:07.023 --> 00:02:19.020
the behaviors of the pedestrians and also the drivers, the problem is in the 
 culture of our civilian, he is not yet aware of this culture

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:28.580
As the civilian who drives have to respect the pedestrians, 
 the pedestrians have also to respect the drivers 

00:02:29.717 --> 00:02:38.720
the state did its efforts, it did awareness campaigns, pedestrian's cross, signals...

00:02:48.255 --> 00:02:55.260
Sometimes the drivers forgot that they were pedestrians, Why they 
 do not give the priority to pedestrians? 

00:02:55.737 --> 00:03:07.740
For the drivers of the buses and the cars who don't 
 respect the pedestrians and don't stop because of the speed

00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:18.650
also the early arrive, for example there is always traffic in the Assr time 
 ( Prayer Time ) and the Maghreb Time ( Prayer Time )

00:03:19.263 --> 00:03:27.260
and when the pedestrians want to cross, the cars 
 don't respect them, everyone want to arrive early

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:40.660
there are some people don't respect even the red light if there wasn't 
 the policeman to arrive early to his work or his home

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:51.150
And I think that among the causes of this, is that there 
 is no  sensitization all the year in the media

00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:57.290
also there is no awareness to road signals as a culture 

00:03:57.586 --> 00:04:02.590
and also the absence of the respect, the pedestrians don't respect 
 the drivers and also the drivers don't respect the pedestrians

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:08.570
and the drivers have to remember that he can be a 
 pedestrian when he cross the road without his car

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.060
so here we have two causes, there is no sensitization 
  and there is no culture of the road

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:27.080
and the media who have to publish this culture, RTM and 
 2M or by internet and the Association too 

00:04:46.716 --> 00:04:52.720
Drivers, if you want that pedestrians respect you, 
 you have to respect the pedestrian's cross

00:04:53.117 --> 00:04:55.120
Let's change our behavior....

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
To know the reasons of all this problems, we contacted M. 
 Ahmed Elaqued, the president the department of the comunication

00:05:02.843 --> 00:05:10.840
and the education in the National Committee for the prevention 
 of  accidents, and here is his answer

00:05:11.904 --> 00:05:17.900
Unfortunately, like we noticed in our roads that there 
 is mixing between the road users 

00:05:17.224 --> 00:05:22.220
that's means that we find a person who not respect his passage 

00:05:22.252 --> 00:05:33.250
so there is many pedestrians who don't respect the crosses which 
 is made for them to guarantee there safety 

00:05:33.155 --> 00:05:45.160
and it was made based on the signals and the red-lights to have a 
 harmony between  drivers from a side and pedestrians from an other side

00:05:46.163 --> 00:05:57.160
of course in some cities, there is no pedestrian's crosses but in 
 the absence of this crosses they have to respect some rules

00:05:57.748 --> 00:06:02.750
first if they want to cross they have to take a straight line

00:06:02.223 --> 00:06:06.220
so they gain time when they cross

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:23.270
Second, they have to cross in a clear place, so the driver can see 
 them if there is a danger and he can react in appropriate time

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:34.900
but when the pedestrian cross in a reckless way, he surprised by the arrival of 
 a car and his reaction will be too slow what cause an accident

00:06:35.117 --> 00:06:39.120
Drivers, a fire that turns green , I do not know what take you? 
 it looks like you are so relieved that you accelerate like a crazy.

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.960
I remind you that the pedestrian is probably cold, it 
 makes physical effort to not pollute not like you.

00:06:41.768 --> 00:06:47.770
So if you see someone who is reluctant to cross when the light turns 
 green for cars, do sign him through, everyone is happy, and mainly survived
