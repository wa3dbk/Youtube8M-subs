"Past the Age of Miracles:
Facing a Post-Antibiotic Age"

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.559
In a keynote address last year,

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.380
the Director-General of the
World Health Organization

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.019
warned that we may
be facing a future

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.650
in which many of our
miracle drugs no longer work.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.220
“A post-antibiotic era means,
in effect,

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.080
an end to modern medicine
as we know it,” she said.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.760
“Things as common as strep throat
or a child’s scratched knee

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.310
could once again kill.”

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.561
The Director-General’s prescription
to avoid this catastrophe included a

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:33.780
global call to “[r]estrict the use
of antibiotics in food production

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.420
to therapeutic purposes.”

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.510
In other words, only use antibiotics
in agriculture to treat sick animals.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.989
In the United States,
meat producers feed literally

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.820
millions of pounds of antibiotics
to farm animals who aren’t sick—

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.240
just to promote growth,
or prevent disease,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.230
in the often-cramped,
stressful, unhygienic conditions

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.289
in industrial animal agriculture.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.870
The FDA estimates that 80%
of the antimicrobial drugs

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.790
sold in the U.S. every year
now go to the meat industry.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.750
The discoverer of penicillin
warned us back in the 40s

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.500
that misuse could lead to resistance,
but the meat industry didn’t listen,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.140
and started feeding drugs like penicillin
to chickens by the ton.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.360
The Food and Drug Administration
finally wised up to the threat in 1977,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.800
and proposed
stopping the feeding

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.690
of penicillin and tetracycline
to farm animals.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.330
That was 36 years ago.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.110
“Since then, the combined
political power of the factory farming

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.220
and pharmaceutical industries
has effectively thwarted

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.780
any legislative or
regulatory action,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.950
and this stranglehold shows
no sign of breaking.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.970
We realized this reckless practice
was a public health threat decades ago,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.700
and yet, what’s been done about it?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.970
“Present [farm animal] production is
concentrated in high-volume, crowded,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.610
stressful environments,
made possible in part

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.800
by the routine use of
antibacterial [drugs] in [the] feed,”

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.360
the U.S. Congressional Office of
Technology Assessment wrote,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.200
as far back as 1979.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.340
“Thus the current dependency
on low-level use of antibiotics

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.410
to increase or maintain production,
while of immediate benefit,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.950
also could be the Achilles’ heel
of present production methods.”

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.000
Industrial operations use antibiotics
as a crutch to compensate for the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.030
squalid conditions that now characterize
much of modern agribusiness.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.560
The unnatural crowding of animals
and their waste creates such a strain

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.360
on the animals’ immune systems
that normal body processes

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.540
like growth
may be impaired.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.390
That’s why a constant influx
of antibiotics is thought to accelerate

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.060
weight gain by reducing
the infectious load.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.251
The problem is that “[e]ach animal
feeding on an antibiotic

00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:53.740
becomes a ‘factory’
for the production

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.420
and subsequent dispersion
of antibiotic-resistant bacteria”

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:03.800
—offering a whole new meaning
to the term “factory farm.”
