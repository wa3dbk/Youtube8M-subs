00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.810
Okay we are over here at tub number 2 where
we are going to install a PVC pipe drainage

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.079
system and this pipe doesn't have any holes
in it. You can buy a pipe that is perforated

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.579
cause this is a thin wall sewer type pipe.
But the problem is with a thin wall sewer

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.580
pipe that you will buy, it is going to have
holes on exactly sides of each other and we

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.720
are not going to drill like that. We are going
to drill our holes so that the water holes

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:36.860
are on the bottom of the pipe but not 180
degrees to each other. We are going to drill

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:48.220
them so that they are just kind of around
the corner from each other. Then we will give

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.530
an improved way of getting the water out while
impeding the infiltration of dirt and many

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:06.420
things that will get into there to choke up
our little system. These holes are about a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.500
half inch diameter. This is a speed borer.
It is kind of a generic name that is used

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.250
for the drill bit or flat spade bit that some
people call them. That does a real nice job

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.450
of drilling but you can see how we drill primarily
on one side of the pipe and there is a reason

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.850
for that. Now we are going to plug the ends
of this pipe so that we don't have dirt coming

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:48.320
in to the pipes. On the ends, we are just
going to use a can to put in the end and we

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.690
are going to hold it in place with a little
piece of stick. We are going to do that on

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:08.840
both ends of the pipe to provide a barrier
for the infiltration of dirt that will choke

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.829
up our drainage system, like that.
