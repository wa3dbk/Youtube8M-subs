What's up guys it is Jack and Geoff from achievementhunter.com doing Fails of the Weak volume 69

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.780
[laughing] Hehe, teehee. I'm twelve

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.600
I know you are

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.800
Alright so lets begin this thing

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.060
So this is 'newghost9' whose ah, watching the zombie rain

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.680
It's a little bit, [laughing], so the guys hold up down there

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.340
and I guess the zombies are trying to make it to him and

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.060
and not doing such a good job, not really

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.640
he's just kind of like "Huh? Well Alright"

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.100
I love how he's not even shooting at em', they're just like "alright", just falling to their deaths

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.340
Weeeeee!

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.140
[laughing]

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.700
He's just like noop da doo [laughing]

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
He's like "Huh? What was that? Huh? Aah. Ok

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.560
Da doo [laughing]

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.280
Ok

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.280
Alright. It's like lemmings

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.580
So here's 'StoutishTurtle6', I don't know if you caught that or not

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.240
I didn't catch anything

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.820
So I think the dude in white um, so like they're shooting concussion rifles at each other. Uh hu.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.680
And just watch, like he doesn't actually get hit

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.960
But he still dies. Oh yeah.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.280
I think he was just terrified, and like he was like " Oh my god it was so close"

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.000
Yeah, that's uh. You gotta hate when that happens

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.480
Not a very dignified way to go

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.860
Alright, this is 'Baier 97' who sees this elite in firefight mode who decides to go back to his planet

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.660
[laughing]

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.180
He's like "What does this button do-ooooo!"

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.160
I don't know what I'm doing

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.560
Weeeee!

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.460
I mean we've seen that happen to humans a bunch but it's kind of funny to watch i-

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.720
That's what happens when you sleep through ghost class.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.220
This is 'for gr8 justice' here, so an- [laughing]

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.820
[heavy laughing]

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.940
So he was throwing a plasma, and I don't think that could have been timed better, he's like- [laughing]

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.440
Here you go, deliver my partner with a plasma stuck to his leg

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.760
Alright, so here ah, this is an AI fail

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.080
and uh, we got Carter here, who um yeah, what is he shootin' at?

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.340
He's making sure that wall you know is ah, yeah, just

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.200
He's like "Theres bugs, they're everywhere, they're all over me, get em' off!"

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.880
"Kat help me, seriously, I saw a spider!"

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.940
"It's on the wall. You know how I feel, I'm allergic to bees."

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.920
Oh dumb Carter, alright here's 'Ghost 141', and a little boot, I think that's actually, is that Jun?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.260
Aaah. This is another campaign fail

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.440
It's hard to see... From the bottom of the ravine

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.000
Yeah, so ah yeah, so he, this ah this hunter here just decides to punt. Poink.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.180
Goes for the field goal. Uppercut. Where the AI. One of the noble five or whatever, noble six, no one of the original noble five I suppose, noble one through five

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.680
Whatever

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.540
Sure dude, you're doing a great job. 'PervSpaceMarine', did you catch that? Nooo

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.940
Alright, so he chucks a grenade bein' stupid here, and he's gunna throw a grenade at a mine, which is a, smart move

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.840
Absolutely. Mine goes off, the grenade does not go off. Ooooh. So the grenade goes backwards

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.140
Past his head, and then is going to esplode right here, and it blows up the mine, which in turn kills him

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.800
Gotta watch out for that scenario

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.740
That guy's forging in Spire too which is-. You don't see that very often

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.900
Alright here we go, 'Soundman50000'

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.960
Aaaaaaaaand

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:53.460
Punch

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.480
[laughing]

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.160
What, what, what, augh. Auugh

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.920
That's an Installation 04 fail

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.540
That was a ballsy move, until he died

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.000
He jumped off the ledge to go for this guy

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.320
He was like "I got this"

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.840
And theeen, nope

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.500
[laughing]

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.900
Go away! So much better from that angle. Get away!

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.400
Aah that's fantastic, alright moving on

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.840
So this is aah 'Es Ninja', 'I Es Ninja', and ah yeah, so he's gunna chuck a grenade and boom

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.400
So he gets killed, but he also got a double kill

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.020
Believe it or not, so he throws his plasma, and the sniper round that's eventually going to kill him

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:33.100
Makes a trip through the, the grenade there first

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.040
Ok. Yeah. So he kills those two dudes. And he gets himself killed. And he gets himself killed in the process. That's pretty awesome

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.580
That's pretty awesome

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.620
Haha, lots of blood and death going on there

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.000
That was some good shooting'. Yeah, that was pretty fantastic

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.020
Alright, so this is ah 'Maniac Marston'

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.720
[laughing]

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.780
I don't think I have to explain whats going on here

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.560
[more laughing]

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.460
Oh god, we've lost Geoff

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.420
Oh my god

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.260
[Even more laughing]

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.360
Yep, that's pretty much ah

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.500
He's doing the worm. That's pretty much the best thing ever

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.820
Right so he's just chilling there

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.520
Oh man, I could watch this all day long. I know

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.880
This could be my screensaver

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.560
Somebody needs to make that an animated gif, that initial spin thing

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.200
But hey if you have a fail like that send it to ahuploads.com, describe it in detail

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.940
And follow the path and thingy, whatever and watch our previous stuff, we love you!

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.780
