00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.310
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.250
It's time for a cure.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.310
Time is everything. I have FSH muscular
dystrophy.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.630
It's a slow and unstoppable degeneration

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.630
of my muscles. It makes it impossible to
do so many simple things

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.230
others just take for granted. FSHD is the
most prevalent form of

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.370
muscular dystrophy. It can be passed on
from parent to child,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.260
or it could just be spontaneous. No one is
immune.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.129
It's not only had a devastating effect
on me,

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.280
but on my family's life as well. It
breaks my heart to see my husband suffer.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.489
Everyday walking becomes more and more
difficult and dangerous.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.000
He's fallen several times already.
We hope for the day

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
our daddy will be able to run and play with us. And to pick me up in his arms.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.340
But, after decades of hope and your

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.500
generous contributions, that day may be
closer than you think.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.950
We are, at last, beyond just hope.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.860
Yes, the good news is that the decades of
research

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.409
generously funded by your contributions
have produced amazing breakthroughs.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.549
We are really, really close now. It's time
for a cure.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.630
Hi, I Max Adler and I play Dave Karofsky
on the TV series Glee.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.100
Growing up, I saw firsthand how
devastating FSH can be.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.969
My mother and my grandmother both had it. Without a cure,

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.570
my family and I watched the damaging
physical, mental,

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.920
and emotional toll, this disease took on
those we dearly loved.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.939
I stood by helplessly as they were
robbed of their ability to do the

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:55.600
simplest everyday tasks.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.520
We are finally on the
verge of an effective therapy,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.939
and even a reversal of the devastating
muscle degeneration.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.149
So that Jeff, and countless others can at
last have a normal life.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.390
The time is now. I know we're almost
there.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.500
Soon, with your continued generosity,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.120
I won't be afraid of falling when I try to
cross the street, 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.880
and I'll be able to pick up my beautiful
children, and dance with my lovely wife,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.390
Beth,

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.300
whose unfailing support gives me courage.
I'm very happy my wife, Takako, and I

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.650
were asked to participate in this update. We are truly optimistic about our progress in the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.930
very significant strides made by FSHD
researchers around the world.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.150
This past year, with help from the FSH
Society,

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.510
an international consortium discovered a
genetic cause 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.190
of FSHD 2. This has been a major
breakthrough in the field.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.450
Together, as part the larger collaborative
effort,

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.739
partnered in part by the FSH Society,

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.189
we found evidence for modifiers of FSHD.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.360
Suggesting we may be able to slow down

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.500
or stop the disease progression. These
encouraging new breakthroughs provide us

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.569
more energy,

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.019
enthusiasm, and excitement for a final push to a cure.

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.150
More than half a million people around
the world live with FSH

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.629
muscular dystrophy. Thanks to your
generosity,

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.250
the FSH Society is funding research
leading to treatments and a cure.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.180
The FSH Society has earned its
fifth consecutive

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.799
Charity Navigator four-star award, and
has been named one of America's

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.450
'10 Charities Worth Watching'. The award
praises

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.379
our effectiveness and exceptional
performance in channeling such a high

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.439
percentage of your donations

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.360
into cutting-edge research. We ca really
use your help,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.680
now more than ever. With your generous
help,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.829
and the dedication of the many
researchers worldwide,

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.079
the crippling effects FSHD will be gone
forever.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.920
Please don't stop now. Now is the time.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.769
The time for all of us to make the final
push for a cure.

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.159
Thanks for helping to make a cure possible. Please help my daddy.
