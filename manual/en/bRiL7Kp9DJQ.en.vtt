"Dietary Theory of Alzheimer's"

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.799
One of the great
remaining medical mysteries

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.000
is what’s behind the dramatic rise
in Alzheimer’s disease.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.839
In a century, we basically
went from no Alzheimer’s

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.799
to the seventh leading cause of death
in the United States,

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.670
currently afflicting
five million Americans.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.110
A provocative theory was
published last year in the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.580
Journal of the American
College of Nutrition.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.230
Alzheimer’s has become an epidemic.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.440
One in ten of us in our 60s.
One in five of us in our 70s,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.280
and nearly one in three of us in our 80s
will develop Alzheimer’s disease.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.840
Some say it’s just because
we have an aging population.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.660
But if you go back and look at the data,
prior to about 100 years ago,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.930
there was no evidence of Alzheimer’s—
no matter how old you were.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.320
And even now, it’s really only a major
problem in the developed world.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.620
The elderly in India and Africa,
for example, are spared this disease.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.570
When we look at the epidemiology,
we should be shocked.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.350
We have allowed something
in our environment

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.990
to steal the minds of our elderly,
at a terrible cost.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.530
As a people we should
be outraged—frightened,

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.440
and frantically searching for
what’s in the environment

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.290
that’s causing this
terrible onslaught.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.110
But instead, the scientific community

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.590
seems to be passively
letting this happen.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.570
There is not much
research in this area.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.340
Most efforts, frankly, are coming up
with drugs to try to treat it

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.940
rather than try to prevent it
in the first place.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.590
Given the link between
meat eating and dementia,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.670
some scientists have
suggested a prion theory;

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.120
maybe Alzheimer’s is some
human variant of mad cow disease.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.840
We certainly are eating more beef,
but this new researcher is skeptical,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.409
believing the real cause to be something
else in our developed environment,

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.700
namely copper toxicity.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.590
Interestingly, that could explain
any meat/Alzheimer’s connection,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.990
because meat eating
may contribute to copper toxicity;

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.380
remember the U.S. meat shipment
that Mexico refused to let in?

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.010
That was for copper contamination.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.399
This researcher blames three things
that developed countries have done

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.840
over the last
half century or so:

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.319
started using copper plumbing
for our water supply;

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.440
started taking lots of supplements—
like multivitamins with copper;

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.230
and started eating
too much meat.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.010
So he suggests we
test our water for copper,

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.239
throw out any supplements
with copper in them, and then,

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.099
in terms of diet to
prevent Alzheimer's,

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.549
number three, reduce meat intake—

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.180
since the copper in meat
is much better absorbed.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.439
So yeah, blaming meat may actually
be right—but, this new theory goes,

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.999
it’s not prions; the damaging agent
in meat may be copper.
