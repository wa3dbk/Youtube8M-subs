00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.840
We know that ultraviolet induced tans are
dangerous

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.390
but what about tans from self tanners?

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.180
Can they also be dangerous?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.460
Stay tuned for some real surprising news!

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.460

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.160
Hello, I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.160
[pause]

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.330
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:23.019
On June 12, 2012, "Good Morning America" reported
on alleged dangers

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.220
of di hydroxy acetone, also known as DHA,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.470
which is the active ingredient in self tanners.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.440
In essence, they posited that because DHA
was shown to cause bad things in lab animals…

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.250
and in addition, since the report showed that
DHA penetrated

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.310
deeper into the human skin than previously
thought…

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.780
Shouldn’t we be worried?

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.850
After reading the transcript from the show,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.170
I have no reason to believe at this time from
the current evidence

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.080
cited in the report that self tanners may
not be completely safe in humans.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.710
Let me explain.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.100
First, the report showed that DHA not only
stains the dead cells of the skin

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.869
but has been found in some of the live cells
below.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.649
In addition, the percent that penetrates beyond
the dead layer is higher than previously known.

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:14.899
While initially that could raise questions,
the fact is that

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.509
DHA in the current form has been applied as
a sunless tanner for over 30 years.

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.259
However, there are no known clusters of self
tanner induced skin cancers

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.780
or reports of any association clinically of
self tanners causing skin cancer,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.439
regardless of the amount absorbed or the depth
of the absorption.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.409
The fact that DHA was shown in non-human lab
studies to cause some abnormalities

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.200
in no way changes the fact that there’s
a greater than 30 year record

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.560
of safe use of this product in humans.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.179
The second issue raised was

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.399
the potential absorption via the lungs of
the aerosol form when people are having a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.359
spray on tan.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.639
I would like to believe that when people spray
underarm antiperspirant,

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.899
they avoid inhaling those fumes.

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.210
The same common sense applies to any

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.499
fumes including those from self tanner.

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.319
Recommendations made that people take measures

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.450
to prevent inhaling the fumes, such as using
nose plugs…

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.690
or prevent absorbing them through the lips
or eyes, by using lip balms and eye covers…

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.900
are common sense and I endorse them.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.040
Provided common sense is adhered to and

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.710
the recommendations are followed, I see no
reason at this time for spray on tans

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.000
to be avoided unless or until studies are
done that are relevant to humans.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.300
In conclusion, while I used to say that the
only safe tan is one that comes from a bottle,

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.230
I’ll now say that in my opinion, a sunless
tanner is much, much safer than any ultraviolet

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.610
induced tan.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.120

Today's question is:

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.340
What causes more damage?

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.400
An hour of unprotected sun exposure at the
beach

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.900
or four fifteen minute walks to and from work
without sun protection?

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
And don't forget.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.350
You can find the answer to this and
