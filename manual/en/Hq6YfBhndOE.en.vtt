00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:07.830
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.830
 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.320
Hi guys, Phil from AquaTech here. Now I'm gonna tell you how to set up your Pocket Wizard transmitter 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.020
housing to either send a signal to lighting, or remotely fire the camera. The first step

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.070
is to grab the center mount and mount to the center of the sport housing. 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.160
Simply grab the tool that we supply and lock this down into 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.440
place. Remove the two locking bolts,

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.530
which you'll see on the base of the Pocket Wizard housing. 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.310
 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.250
simply twist and remove the top.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.690
With the Pocket Wizard, you'll need to set
this one to transmit

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.880
to send a signal from camera to the lighting. Attach your Pocket Wizard

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.210
to the base of the Pocket Wizard housing. Use the male connector

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.410
and attach it to the appropriate port on your Pocket Wizard.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.320
grab the top of the Pocket Wizard housing, slide into place,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
and carefully align

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.280
the aerial of the Pocket Wizard to pass through

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.400
the o-rings.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.479
Once the top of the Pocket Wizard housing is firmly in place, replace the locking

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.479
bolts.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.420
Now that your Pocket Wizard is secure, inside the Pocket Wizard housing,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.290
it's time to attach it to your sport housing. Simply remove the locking pin,

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.290
slide into place, and re-install. 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.040
The next step is to install the 3-pin male connectors.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.820
On the female bulkhead on the sport housing, remove the cover,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.320
place one end in here,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.180
the other

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.180
goes into the base of the Pocket Wizard housing.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.129
The next step is to connect your camera 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.230
to the housing to transmit the signal from your camera to the Pocket Wizard 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.989
and send a signal to the receiving unit. What you need to do now is grab the male 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:25.609
connector

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.269
to PC jack

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.450
install it into the side of the sport housing, and connect

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.239
to the appropriate port on your camera. It's called the flash sync port,

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.140
then, install your camera.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.760
Now that your camera is inside the housing, it's time to set up the receiving unit. 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.130
Today, I'm just using a Speedlite for demonstration. I've got my Pocket Wizard set to receive, 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.360
connected via the PC mount to the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.590
Speedlite.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.920
So when I press the shutter on the
camera, the signal will travel through the camera,

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.930
transmit to a lighting source.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.840
Because Pocket Wizards work on a radio signal,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.630
the transmitting device cannot be below the surface. 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.700
AquaTech offers a varied range of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.410
leads which enables the camera to be at a depth, the transmitting unit to

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.340
float on the surface and send a signal
to the lighting source.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.819
So to recap guys, the best way to send a signal 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.830
to an external lighting device is via the Pocket Wizard transmitter. And,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.959
if you're on the surface, simply mount it on top of the sport housing.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.100
If the camera is below the surface, you'll
need to grab an extra length of lead

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.100
to enable the transmitting device to sit
above the water.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.700
