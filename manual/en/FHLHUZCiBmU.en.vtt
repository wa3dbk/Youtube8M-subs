00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Hi, I'd like to share three minutes of your time to talk about elephants,

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
specifically, Chai, Bamboo and Watoto, the three elephants on display

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
at Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Chai and Bamboo are from Thailand, where elephants roam miles each day

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500
with their family and companions in a tropical climate.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Watoto is from Kenya, which also has a warm climate.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Seattle, on the other hand, can be pretty chilly between October and April

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
with low temperatures ranging from 35 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.500
During these colder months the zoo staff lock up the 
 elephants for 16 to 17 hours a day

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.500
in indoor stalls averaging 750 square feet each.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.500
Now, 750 square feet may sound like a lot, but for us

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
that's the equivalent of a square room under 5 feet wide,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
less than the average adult arm span.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's less space than the prisoners in Alcatraz had.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.500
That sounds pretty stifling, especially for such intelligent creatures

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.500
as elephants, but is it really that bad?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, the leading cause of death for elephants 
 in captivity is foot and joint disease

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.500
primarily caused by inactivity and prolonged standing on hard surfaces,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
so yes, it IS that bad.  In 
 a sense, living at Woodland Park Zoo

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000
is like a slow death sentence for an elephant.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
Where else could the elephants go?  One humane option is

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
The Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald, Tennesee.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Unlike Woodland Park Zoo, which has less than one acre of space

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.500
for the elephants to share, The Elephant Sanctuary has 2700 acres

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
of varied terrain where many retired zoo and circus elephants

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
roam free 24 hours a day.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The climate is much friendlier than Seattle's, and the Sanctuary staff

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
provide care around the clock.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The Elephant Sanctuary has offered to accept Chai, Bamboo,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and Watoto free of charge.  It seems like the obvious compassionate choice.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Ok, 2 minutes are up, but I'm asking for one more minute...

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.000
The next time you're in your walk-in closet, take 
 60 seconds and just stand still...

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now imagine doing that for 16 hours a day...

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
...seven months a year...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
...for the rest of your life.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Please help make a difference... share this video with your friends
