E is for Edisto Beach and Edisto Island, South
Carolina,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
and I'm Burley Lyons, mayor of Edisto Beach.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.690
We have no Ferris wheel.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.210
We have no slides.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.750
We have no water slides.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.230
We even have no stoplights.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.679
Edisto Island Preservation Alliance
along with Edisto Beach,

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:31.839
along with many other agencies,
have now put 50% plus of Edisto Island

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.280
into land trusts.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:44.579
Edisto Island will remain historical, pristine,
and not overdeveloped.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.309

Edisto Beach is known for its turtle nesting

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.140
area.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.350
We have had bumper crops of turtles
on our beach the last couple of years,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.059
and we attribute that mostly
to the renourishment we did two to three years

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.059
ago.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.200
We're real proud of our track record there.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.640
ยง
A couple of miles off the island,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.180
there is a special tree we refer to as the
Mystery Tree.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:24.440
ยง
You want to ask, I'm sure, who does it?

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.010
Well, we're not gonna tell you.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.470
That's one of our mysteries here.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.590
We have tourists from miles away
that come to see just the mystery tree.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.310
If you have not seen it, you come to Edisto,
and we'll let you know where it is.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.300
But if you can imagine Edisto Island as being
a big oyster,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.540
Botany Bay would be the pearl of that oyster...
nothing more unique.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.000
If you've been to the island,
but you haven't been to Botany Bay,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.660
you just haven't seen the best of Edisto.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.710
It was given to the state by a Miss Pepper.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.289
DNR is the management agency of that island,
and it's open to the public now.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.190
So if you have an opportunity to visit
that special, unique place,

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.400
don't miss the opportunity.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.110
Who wants to go to Heaven?

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.500
Follow me, and I say Edisto.
