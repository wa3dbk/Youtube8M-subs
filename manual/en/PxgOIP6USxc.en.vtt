Hi, I'm Rebecca Balcarcel.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.820
I can help you write a character analysis.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.429
First you need to choose which character your
gonna analyze.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.389
I suggest you choose a character who
changes.

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.140
If you have to write about FINDING NEMO, the
Walt Disney story, you might be tempted to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.279
choose Nemo, because, after all, the title
has his name in it.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:24.449
He must
be the main character.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.760
But really, the character who changes the
most and who really goes on a journey is the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.650
father, Marlin.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.690
So he's the character best suited for a
character analysis.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.160
So number one: Choose a character who changes.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.770
Arlight, now that you've chosen which character
to analyze.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.630
You're going to have to think of
inferences.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.370
Let me give you an example of what I mean
by that.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.300
Here's some...

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.180
Here's an inference down here, but let me
start with this: Fact: Marlin hovers.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.130
We know,
if you've watched this film, that Marlin is

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.780
the dad and he hovers over his son, and doesn't
want to let him be independent and try new

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.660
things or take any risks.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.770
But
the fact that he does this is something that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.340
the film already tells you, so that doesn't
require much thinking on your part.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.140
You haven't actually drawn a conclusion
from that yet.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590
That just makes it just a plain old fact.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.830
What you need is to infer something.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.470
That means you need to draw a conclusion of
your own.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.200
You have lots of
facts about Marlin: what he does and what

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.840
he says and what he thinks and how he reacts
to situations.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.891
And those are the facts that will help you
write the essay, but

00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.859
you need to draw some conclusions from those
facts.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.050
You need to infer what's really going on with
Marlin.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.510
What's driving him?

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.670
What are his motivations?

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.570
Explain his
psychology.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.930
If he were to sit down and talk to Dr. Phill,
or some therapist, what would we discover

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.619
about Marlin's history, about the way he approaches
life, and how

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.619
does that change over the course of the film?

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.439
That's what a character analysis explores.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.769
The facts are the evidence that you're going
to use, as you make a case for

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.439
your interpretation of this character.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:26.519
But the facts are not the main thrust of the
character analysis.

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.239
Now let's look at something else that you
don't want to include

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.790
in your character analysis.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.159
Here we have a judgement, or an evaluative
statement: "Marlin needs to relax."

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:45.480
Okay, this is true, perhaps, but it's not
an inference

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.830
because it doesn't analyze Marlin.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.760
Instead it just kind of judges him, and says,
"You know what, Marlin, here's what I think

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.450
you need to do."

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.950
But that's not analysis.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.049
Analysis examines the psychology and examines
the motivation and simply states it and- without

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.200
judging, without advising...

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.650
We don't need to say that he's a good father
or he's a bad father.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.810
That's not analysis.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.450
Instead, a sentence like this might belong
in your essay, and this is a true inference:

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.019
"Traumatized because of his wife's
death, Marlin clings to his son."

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.059
Well, this explains the motivation.

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:29.480
Why does he hover?

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.120
"Why" is very good question to keep asking
yourself as you look at all the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
facts.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.949
You look at each fact and you think, "Yeah,
but why does he behave this way?

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.010
Why does he say this bit of dialogue?

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.359
Why does he respond this way?"

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.590
The "why"
questions will draw you deeper and deeper

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.290
into the psychology of the character.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.420
Let's say you do have some inferences about
the character, some conclusions that you've

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.659
drawn from all the facts.

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.349
Now you've got to put this into a thesis statement.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:07.349
A thesis is simply the one sentence that sums
up the main point you want to make.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.599
So this
is the sentence that says, "I'm gonna prove

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.799
this to you, reader.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.639
My interpretation is this."

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.030
And then the whole essay is going to prove
that that was a reasonable,

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.030
logical conclusion that I drew from the facts.

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.550
My inference makes sense and I'm gonna prove
it with all the facts of the story.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.199
Let me give you an example of a fairly
deep analytical thesis that does analyze a

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:35.199
character.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:42.560
"Marlin's discovery of his own inner resources
allows him to trust his son's."

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.930
Now this could be unpacked and
explained, so that makes it a good thesis

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.180
for an essay.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.740
For example, I've said that Marlin discovers
inner resources.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.090
My essay's gonna have to prove that he does
do

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.090
that.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:03.150
So, perhaps my first paragraph will s- uh,
assert that certain challenges that Marlin

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.819
faces throughout his story force him to r-
develop or discover, reveal, his

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:16.599
inner resourcefulness, his courage, his trust
in other people...

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.620
He is able to discover that he does have these
things inside of himself, and so no matter

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.740
what life
brings at him, he can face these things and

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.230
he can overcome these challenges.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.900
Before, he did not have that faith.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.960
He had been in a victim mentality.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.580
Now I also say
here that his discovery of his own inner resources

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.830
allows him to trust his son's.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.099
So I'm asserting that his son has inner resources
that, up to now, Marlin has not

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:48.099
recognized.

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:53.940
At the beginning of the story, he does not
trust his son to be able to take care of himself,

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.389
to be able to have any adventures, but by
the end he does

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:04.129
trust his son, and we see a final scene in
which he has to trust that his son does make

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.719
a good decision and chooses a good course
of action.

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.419
I could have another body
paragraph that explains how Marlin reunites

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.900
with his son, moves from the old parenting
style to the new parenting style...

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:25.400
So the story of Marlin's change, his change
as a parent, his change in his world view...

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.159
That is the analysis part.

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.780
That is h- the real underlying story underneath
the plot that's going along.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.729
This is his
psychological story, and that's what you analyze

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:39.100
in a character analysis.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.260
So, pick a character who changes, write a-
analytical thesis that is an inference that

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:51.320
delves into the psychology of the character,
then support that thesis, unpack it, prove

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.949
it, explain it to the reader, and you'll have
your character analysis.

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:55.830
Good
luck.
