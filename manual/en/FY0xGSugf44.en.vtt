00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.070
But it has to be very cool.

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:38.371

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.574

Hotty! 

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.620
The tip is included, right?

Could you bring us the 
credit card terminal then? 

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:58.758

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.063
In how many parcels? 
On the debit, on the credit?

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:05.065
In any way you prefer, sir

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.235

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.782
Fernando, are you there? 

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.953
I’ve been calling for days 
but I cannot reach you.

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.756
It’s because we had problem 
here with your check… 

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.560
And you’ve left too much money 
with us and I wanted to return it. 

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.662
Unless you, maybe I could go 
to your place and… 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.530
Fernando...

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:44.104
I had to leave for o moment and I don’t know 
if you’ve tried to reach me in the meanwhile. 

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:47.340
So I, uh… 

00:01:47.574 --> 00:01:50.110
Fer, Fer...

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:55.582
We have some 
new dishes here… 

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.886
I could, I don’t know… 
give you a special service… 

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.222
But you never pick up 
the phone, man! 

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.423
So difficult…
