00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.780
Unpopular Majora’s Mask Opinions

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.480
I really don’t think that Majora’s Mask
needs a remake.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.850
Sure I’m GLAD that it’s getting remade,
but to me, it just seems like its getting

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.300
the 3D treatment because Ocarina of Time already
did.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.590
While I respect the mechanic from an objective
standpoint, the time limit in Majoras Mask

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.920
will forever bother me.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.620
It's a Zelda game, I wanna go cut grass and
explore without a care in the world, but when

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.390
I look up in the sky and see my impending
doom, I get all bummed out.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.280
Majora’s Mask was pretty damn frustrating
at times.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.670
Limited save points, the three day cycle,
and having to do some of the same things OVER

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.130
and OVER and OVER again.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.780
Combine that with some lackluster temple design
and I have NO IDEA why people herald this

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.680
as the “GREATEST ZELDA GAME OF ALL TIME”!

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.070
The Happy Mask Salesman is easily the scariest
thing ever, Tingle is a close second though

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.909
I kind of like him.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.010
Yuri?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.110
Seriously?

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.740
How can you think that Tingle is scary?

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.460
I think that Tingle is the single greatest
thing to have come out of Majora’s Mask.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.960
I mean I LOVE this guy with a passion.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.840
He’s silly, he’s wacky, and he is one
of the greatest Zelda characters of all time!

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.310
… Second only to Groose…

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.600
The Fierce Deity mask nets you easily the
coolest looking form, though it's limited

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.670
use makes it really lame.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.259
I feel like this game is only so loved because
it was “dark” and “edgy” and “gritty”

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.000
because almost every time that I hear a fan
gush about this game, well, nine times out

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.620
of ten, they focus EXCLUSIVELY on the creepy
atmosphere and the aesthetics rather than

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.130
the gameplay and the story.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.530
Having to find all the stray fairies in each
dungeon to get upgrades for Link was tedious,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.460
and I think I loathe it.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.460
You know…

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.109
I really don’t care that there are only
four dungeons in this game.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.869
Personally, I LOVE shorter games.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.320
There are just SO MANY games to play out there
and too many are overly long with more padding

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.780
than a training bra.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.759
The fact that the content in Majora’s Mask
is optional is amazing because I don’t have

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.979
to spend more time with the game than I WANT
to do.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.460
Majora's Mask is superior to Ocarina of Time
in almost every way, but I had more fun with

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.460
Ocarina of Time.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.480
Let’s hear what you guys had to say about
Majora’s Mask.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.360
@Banana_Bread says “Although the game was
good it was really repetitive.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.430
It felt like I had to force myself to turn
it on and play.”

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.230
KamikaziLucas said that the game felt pretty
short even one hundred percent completed.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.520
@CoolAdrian20 says “I always thought the
Anju and Kafei sidequest was too overrated.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.300
It is a good story, but not that good.”

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.850
TheStrayTiger says “As much as I love it,
the lack of linear progression DOES feel overwhelming

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.500
which I think pushes the player away.”

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.660
@Figcoinc says “Nice!

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.380
Here’s mine, the whole story arch with Skull
Kid was boring, and predictable.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.510
Very disappointing.”

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.930
Now before I let you guys go, I have to tell
you about this AMAZING website that I found

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:53.930
recently.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.320
Don’t worry, this isn’t some ad that you’ve
heard a million people talk about, but this

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.820
is one that will ACTUALLY help you guys!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.330
It’s called Opinion Outpost and if you guys
know me, I love my opinions.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.840
Well, what these guys do is that all of the
big companies come to them so you can take

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.190
surveys for money.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.980
So YES, they will pay you REAL LIFE HARD CASH
for you to just answer some surveys.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.190
It’s awesome, I’m using it, and it’s
a great way to make some extra cash on the

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.190
side.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.190
So yeah.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.290
It’s pretty neat!

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.220
