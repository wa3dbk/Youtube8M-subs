Hey guys,
Chef Mark here.

00:00:02.236 --> 00:00:04.504
We get a lot of requests
for the cashew chicken.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:06.740
We've come up with
a great recipe for you.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.475
It's got some toasted cashews in it.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.012
We're usin' peanut oil to emphasize
that whole nut flavor in it.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.747
Let's grab our chicken
for the dish.

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:16.850
So I'm gonna grab one of these
chicken breast strips for stir-frying.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.986
They're sliced,
already marinated.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:20.554
I don't have to do anything to them

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.990
and they're gonna be really nice
and tender for the dish.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.225
So this dish is really simple
to put together,

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:28.762
but it wouldn't be a great dish unless
it had a really good base sauce to it,

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:30.464
so that's what this is here.

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:33.100
It's our Asian Classics Stir-Fry Sauce.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.134
Great on its own.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:37.537
If you've been to any Chinese restaurant
and had a brown sauce put together,

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.872
that's this sauce here.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.642
All we're gonna do is
add a couple things like peanut oil

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.644
and some cashews
and some ginger to it,

00:00:43.644 --> 00:00:45.579
and you're gonna have
a fantastic recipe.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:47.447
Let's go put this thing together.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:48.849
Okay, cashew chicken.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.450
There's a lot of components
to this,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.453
so I really wanna make sure
that you get all of this together

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:55.222
before you start cooking
any of this.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.723
That's--we call it
our mise en place;

00:00:56.723 --> 00:00:59.226
especially important
when we're puttin' together a stir-fry.

00:00:59.226 --> 00:01:01.495
So I had a pan heating over here,

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.830
and we're gonna use
about a pound of that meat,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.633
so it's one package
that we're gonna use.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.869
And we're gonna go on high
for this

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.638
the entire time
we're gonna cook our chicken.

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:15.742
I've got two tablespoons
of peanut oil we're gonna start with first.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.545
Let's do half of that.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.647
We're gonna go half this batch,

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.750
so we're gonna go as close
as we can to that,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.385
and we're gonna add our chicken
into that.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.787
What I don't want you to do
is come up here

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.690
and sort of start droppin' pieces
'cause you're afraid of the oil.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.825
As close as you can get to that--

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:35.862
much safer because I'm not gonna
start splashing up onto my hands.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:37.798
Once that chicken's in the pan,

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.634
I wanna make sure
that you spread your chicken out,

00:01:40.634 --> 00:01:43.437
so break these pieces up,
separate 'em a little bit.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.074
Make sure you get a nice, even
surface area coating on the bottom,

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:50.243
'cause what we're tryin' to do
is brown our chicken.

00:01:50.243 --> 00:01:53.447
So get it nice,
contact with the bottom of the pan.

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:55.415
Once it browns,
we're gonna flip that over.

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:57.584
It's gonna be cooked
all the way through.

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.286
The way I know that's cooked
all the way through

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:01.722
is the fact that we cut it
so thin.

00:02:01.722 --> 00:02:03.156
So this is gonna take
two batches.

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:05.525
We'll cook the first one,
set it aside,

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.730
and then we'll cook
the second.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.131
All right,
so my chicken's done.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.165
It's cooked all the way through,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:16.003
and we've got some nice browning
on the outside of it.

00:02:16.003 --> 00:02:17.304
So we're gonna put that to the side,

00:02:17.304 --> 00:02:19.373
and now we're gonna build
that whole cashew flavor.

00:02:19.373 --> 00:02:23.644
So we're gonna add our cashews
and one tablespoon of peanut oil,

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:28.215
and for me, I'm usin' that peanut oil
because it tastes really good, for one,

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:32.052
but I'm also usin' nuts in it anyway,
so let's increase that little bit of flavor.

00:02:32.052 --> 00:02:33.620
So with that oil inside here,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.156
as the cashews brown
it's gonna flavor that oil,

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.791
which I'm gonna add my chicken
back in

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.294
and it's gonna make a great cashew,
toasted flavor on the inside of that.

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:42.863
So we're gonna let this brown
a little bit,

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:46.767
and then we'll add our garlic
and ginger.

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:48.035
So this is what we're lookin' for.

00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:49.636
The cashews are really nice
and brown,

00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:52.539
those aromatics are really comin' out,
really roasted.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.874
Great flavor in there.

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:58.378
So let's add our--about a teaspoon,
that half inch of ginger there,

00:02:58.378 --> 00:03:00.313
and I've got three cloves
of garlic.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:02.315
We're gonna add that.
That has been chopped as well.

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.518
Make sure we get all
of that garlic on the inside.

00:03:04.518 --> 00:03:06.453
Don't cheat yourself.

00:03:06.453 --> 00:03:09.790
And then here, we're gonna cook this
maybe on medium-low or so.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.225
We're gonna let this cook
for maybe two minutes or so

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:15.362
just to get, again,
some of those aromatics filling that oil

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.731
so when we add that chicken back,
it'll flavor it nice.

00:03:17.731 --> 00:03:19.666
Just make sure that
you don't brown the garlic

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.135
or some of the ginger in there
as well.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.337
So now that our garlic is cooked
and our ginger's cooked

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:25.639
and really aromatic,

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.541
we're gonna add our chicken
to this.

00:03:27.541 --> 00:03:29.443
And for me, I'm gonna use
a fresh set of tongs

00:03:29.443 --> 00:03:31.711
'cause we had our raw chicken
on the other ones.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:34.848
And all that's left to do
is to stir this up,

00:03:34.848 --> 00:03:38.852
and we're gonna add our half cup
of our stir-fry sauce into that.

00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.787
We're gonna crank this up

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.255
'cause we don't need
to leave it on low

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.690
because I'm startin' to get hungry,

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.194
and all you need to do
is warm this through.

00:03:47.194 --> 00:03:49.796
And for you guys at home,
if you wanna stir it just like this,

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:52.666
maybe back and forth,
just to get this incorporated.

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:56.503
We like to flip it up
in the air a little bit.

00:03:56.503 --> 00:03:58.138
Enough to warm that through.

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:01.441
And all that's left
is to plate this thing.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:04.778
What I like on this is
just a simple garnish

00:04:04.778 --> 00:04:08.081
of some scallions
that I cut up.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.118
Make sure we get
all that sauce.

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:13.520
Simple garnish
of these scallions.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.755
This one,
knocked out of the park.

00:04:15.755 --> 00:04:17.324
Real easy to do.
