Hey Besties!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:06.460
After last week's flush kerfuffle I thought
it would be a good idea to show you guys a

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:14.360
quick way to remove make up completely.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.300
This make up remover tip is great if you're
on a budget.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:23.090
Oil removers are great for your skin and take
over thing off completely making a great base

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.920
for you to apply skin care but they can be
a bit pricy.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.339
So if you're on a budget or if you happen
to run out of your make up remover one night

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:36.300
here's a tip, all you need is cooking oil.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.850
Doesn't matter what kind of oil, you could
go for coconut oil if you want to go for nice

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.289
skin effects but if you're like me and you've
run out of everything in your kitchen, I mean

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:57.420
literally everything pretty much you've only
got crappy blended vegetable oil it works.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.170
So let's see how well it works.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.620
First take off your eyelashes and clip back
your fringe.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:11.070
As fun as oil is on skin, you don't want oily
hair.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.900
Make up remover pad.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.090
I'm so looking forward to going to bed after
this.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.620
You guys have no idea.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:20.620
Seriously no idea.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.640
Oh look we're doing to the third layer of
blush from last week's video.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.330
Ideally you don't want to do too much rubbing
around the eye area because that causes wrinkles

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.490
but what doesn't?

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.680
If wrinkles are the biggest problem you have
in your life I envy you.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.500
Pro tip, although it might seem like a tine
saver, probably don't use the oil that comes

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.500
in a spray.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.590
Also probably do the other side, up to you
though.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.310
I'm not going to tell you how to live your
life.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.850
Taadaa totally clean face.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.220
It feels very nice.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.290
Now I just need to apply all of my serums
and face creams and we'll be good to go.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.260
Maybe I'll even do a face mask.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.370
Definitely a cup on tea.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.930
Well I'm off to do that.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.050
Hope you guys enjoyed the tip, let me know
if you give it a try and I'll see you next

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.050
week!

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.050
Bye!
