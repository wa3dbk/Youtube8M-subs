Hi, I'm Serge Siou and welcome to MacStudioA.

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.510
In this episode, How To Make and Receive Telephone
Calls on a Mac or iPad.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.260
Using the Continuity feature in OS X Yosemite
and iOS 8, making and receiving phone calls

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.660
on a Mac or iPad is a relatively easy process.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.029
Topics Covered:
Phone Calling Requirements and Configuration.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.150
Setup iPhone Cellular Connection for Devices.
Setup Devices for Phone Calling.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.210
And Finally, a Demo, Making and Receiving
a Call using an iPad and a Mac.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.660
Sooooo, Let’s Get Started.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.060
As shown on the Apple support page, the system
requirements for Phone calling.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.690
An iPhone with iOS 8 with an activated carrier
plan.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.540
And, any devices that supports iOS 8 and any
Mac that supports Yosemite.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.220
Furthermore; the support page shows what you
need to do in order for the Phone call function

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.890
to work on your devices or Mac, as shown here.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.070
Basically, sign in with the same iCloud account
on all your devices and Mac and all devices

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.570
needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.399
So, provided your devices meets the system
and configuration requirements, you should

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.450
be good to go.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.689
First, let’s make sure that the iPhone running
iOS 8 is set to allow your devices to use

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.200
it’s cellular connection.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.960
To do so, simply launch Settings and navigate
to FaceTime and check that iPhone Cellular

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.270
Calls is ON by sliding switch to the right.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.100
Next, make sure that the devices that you
want to use to make and receive telephone

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:36.259
calls from, is also setup to do so.

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.880
Therefore, to setup phone calling on a Mac
running OS X Yosemite, launch FaceTime, and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.340
from the FaceTime menubar, click FaceTime,
then click Preferences. Now, make sure that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789
iPhone Cellular Calls is checked.

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.350
While here, you can also choose a different
Ringtone by clicking on the dropdown list

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.350
shown here.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.110
And to setup phone calling on an iPad with
iOS 8, as was done for the iPhone, tap Settings

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.110
and then FaceTime, now make sure that iPhone
Cellular Calls is also activated.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.760
Once all preliminary checks have been completed,
making and receiving a telephone calls from

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.069
your devices works seamlessly.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.069
Now for a Demo.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.760
Using a Mac, simply click on the phone symbol
in Contacts or double click on a phone number

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.760
in Safari to place a call, as shown here.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.320
Similarly, using an iPad, just tap on the
phone symbol in Contacts or a phone number

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.120
in Safari, to place a call, as shown.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.920
As you would expect, receiving a call on your
devices, also went by flawlessly. Basically,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.959
once you receive a call, all devices setup
to use the iPhone Cellular Connection, including

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.840
the iPhone, rings.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.519
Incidentally, depending on how many devices
you have activated for Phone calling, you

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.319
might find it a bit annoying having all you
devices ringing at the same time.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.010
Simply turn Off devices that you don’t wish
to receive or make calls from, using the same

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.950
procedure as when turning On for iPhone Cellular
Calls.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.109
Alternatively, if you want to temporarily
turn off phone calling on all devices, simply

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:51.090
turn off the function only on the iPhone,
as shown earlier when activating.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.890
And that’s all there is to it, making and
receiving phone calls from your iOS 8 or Yosemite

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.120
devices couldn't be more simple.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.939
