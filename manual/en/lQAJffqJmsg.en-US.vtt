Hi! today we'll make these beautiful cupcakes embellishments

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:08.147
for decorating your mail, your albums, your scrapbook projects...

00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:15.147
So stay with me!

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:20.056
you'll first need the pattern I give you in my website

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:24.566
that you obtain by clicking right now on the screen

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.596
you'll also need acetate pieces

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:31.426
You'll start placing the acetate on the pattern

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:38.426
and applying black contour paint to trace the design

00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:46.477
live it dry and then start painting

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:52.317
today is a delicate work so you'll apply a drop

00:00:52.317 --> 00:00:56.897
of paint on a side and fill in using a stick

00:00:56.897 --> 00:01:03.897
with light green finish the cup

00:01:04.217 --> 00:01:08.437
clean the side before continuing

00:01:08.437 --> 00:01:11.707
now apply white paint

00:01:11.707 --> 00:01:13.887
on top

00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:19.017
use the stick to carry the paint till the edges

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:21.497
the live it dry

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:27.327
now decorate the first using pink, dark and light

00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:34.327
green as candies

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:40.517
to paint next one just make

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:47.517
small pink stripes on the cupcake

00:01:49.047 --> 00:01:51.597
for next one

00:01:51.597 --> 00:01:56.546
paint the same way as the others

00:01:56.546 --> 00:02:01.357
and fill with pink the heart and then make many pink dots

00:02:01.357 --> 00:02:04.037
as candies

00:02:04.037 --> 00:02:08.727
to paint the strawberry cream cupcakes just fill with pink

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:12.976
on top and change the greens for the cups

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:17.396
live them dry very well before continuing

00:02:17.396 --> 00:02:24.396
the cut them

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:29.547
now you can use them as

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:30.397
decorations

00:02:30.397 --> 00:02:33.916
or add a clip

00:02:33.916 --> 00:02:38.986
today I have chosen wooden clips that I'll glue with

00:02:38.986 --> 00:02:45.986
instant glue

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:52.857
finally apply some transparent

00:02:52.857 --> 00:02:59.857
nail polish

00:03:01.016 --> 00:03:07.546
