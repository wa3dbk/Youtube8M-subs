00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.810
Two Brothers Who Threw Away 
Their Lumps of Gold

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.920
Once upon a time, there were two brothers
who lived in a village.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
They were getting along well with each other.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.799
The elder one loved his younger brother,

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.149
the younger one respected 
and followed hiselder brother.

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:25.649
One day the two brothers were crossing 
a stream bridge.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:29.309
The younger brother shouted,

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:36.309
“Look there in the water!
There’s something glittering, isn’t there?”

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.570
The elder brother said, 
“Yes. I wonder what it is.”

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:50.859
“Please wait a moment.
 I’ll go there and bring it.”

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.489
The younger brother brought two lumps of gold
from under the water.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.809
“Two lumps of gold! Please have this one,
my elder brother. It’s yours.”

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.809
“No, I won’t. Both are yours 
because you picked them up.”

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.060
“Never, but you should have one.”

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.020
At last, each of the mutually friendly brothers
possessed one lump of gold.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.960
Later on, the two brothers were riding
in a boat on a river.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.229
Suddenly the younger brother took out 
his lump of gold and

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.128
threw it away into the river.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.370
“Oh, my younger brother!
Why are you throwing away

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.299
such a valuable thing?”

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.810
As the elder brother asked, 
the younger brother answered.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.380
“I always respect and follow you,
my elder brother.”

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.259
“But after each of us got 
a lump of gold today,

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.270
a strange thought occurred to me.”

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.740
“What’s that?”

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.929
“I thought both lumps of gold 
would have been mine”

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.440
“if you hadn’t been with me there”

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.180
“so I began to hate you.”

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.990
“But now I’ve decided I would be better
without the gold

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.670
 because it makes me hate you.”

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.280
After hearing his younger brother’s explanation,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.970
the elder brother also threw away his gold
into the river.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.500
“You are right. I also thought 
the same way for a moment.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.940
But those lumps of gold must not break 
our brotherly love.”

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.050
After throwing away their gold,
the two people continued to live

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.110
as good brothers to each other.
