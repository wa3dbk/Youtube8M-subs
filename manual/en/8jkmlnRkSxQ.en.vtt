00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.840
Welcome, friends, to Metro 2033!

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.800
I am Boris, your train operator for the evening.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.980
Naw, but seriously.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.200
This is Metro Redux.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.540
Probably the most requested game by you guys.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.480
Lots of mutants and stuff to shoot.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.760
Definitely the most cheeki breeki game after all the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:16.860
But for now..

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.800
Let's shoot some f**king mutants, yeah?

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.380
Autobiography of Boris.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.720
How to make šašlik and not give a f**k.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.840
Aay and all those parties I had!

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.739
-But I remember nothing of that time.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.659
Haha! You got that one right!

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.800
Aay I remember that time with Anatoli we got sh*tfaced in the metro.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.280
Ah, good times, man.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.760
I remember when we had elevators in this place.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.460
HEY!

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.580
You bent the f**king ladder, man!

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.780
Seriously, man. You need to lose some weight.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.620
You see, this is why we get spotted by the mutants all the time.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.749
And stop calling me Artyom. I'm Boris!

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.720
Auxiliary? More like primary, since nothing, fucking shit works here.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.520
Yeah, just like the good ol' times.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.040
If you wanted to go to the toilet..

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.000
..you better hoped that in your previous life..

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.640
..you had the job shoveling sh*t.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.940
Maan, you've got a rat problem here.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.200
Look how big they are.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.760
These look like one of those rats who eat other rats.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.400
Ahaa! Mutants!

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.160
Now this is what I came here for.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.780
Let's light up these b***hes!

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.500
Ah, you see, this is the shit why we need RPG's, man.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.300
Calm down, is soup for everyone.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.340
No need to panic.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.740
Hey, can we hurry it up?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.340
What the hell are you two doing?

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.500
This is soup kitchen!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.980
It's a public place, you two!

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.020
Go get a room.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.780
Whoa, what happened to you, man?

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.820
Did you swallow a bee or something?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.440
You should get that shit checked out.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.480
Kids.. if you don't brush your teeth..

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.852
..this will happen to you.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.560
Yeah, hunter, ey! Is it cold outside?

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.780
Nah, just kidding. I know it's as cold as your ex's heart.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.180
Oy, cool!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.820
Ahaa! You got me one of those..

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.460
Oh..

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.880
Hunter, I know I said pictures of girls, but..

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.380
Ah, never mind. This will do just fine.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.540
-I learned that the caravan was heading to Riga the next day.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.320
Riga?!

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.020
Ooy prepare the saldejums and kvass my friends.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.900
Because Boris is coming to town!

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.400
Who the f**king debil..

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.320
Shut the f**k up, I'm trying to sleep.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.900
-Don't forget anything, ah?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.860
Yeah, I won't forget to kick your ass.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.118
Who does he think he is?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.200
Shut the hell up already.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.620
Okay, one last cheeki breeki for good luck before we go.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.740
*cheeki breeki v damke*

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.500
Ay yes!

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.900
Ah, the two things that I need!

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.760
A compass and a light.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.580
For solving almost any problem.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.720
Oor, well, you know, just..

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.540
Getting lost in the dark.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.160
-Hello Artyom, how are yo-

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.620
Shut up Igor, I'm doing montage.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.500
What is the meaning..

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.000
-Of this life?

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.520
No, you idiot!

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.140
-Of a dull knife?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.140
No, stop interrupting! It's..

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.300
-Not very nice?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.120
Are we seriously driving a handcar to Riga?!

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.540
You guys are f**king insane!

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.220
That has to be like a 1000 kilometers from here.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.020
Hey guys, I'm.. seeing shadows, but no people.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.080
Yes, yes!

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.853
You learnt my name! Finally!

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.020
Ah, don't worry. You are becoming friend of Boris now.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.600
Side effects may include:

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:25.920
-Uncontrollable laughter

00:03:25.929 --> 00:03:27.454
-Gaining of new friends

00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:29.454
-General raise in happiness.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.640
Ha! You see, this is why we are still the ruling race.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.260
Because we are smart enough to put on some fucking armor.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.978
We have long evolved from walking around with naked butts.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.320
*Artyom, take my shotgun! Here!*

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.280
Now this is my kind of weapon!

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.140
Come and get it, bitches!

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.880
Boom!

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.360
Bring them on! I am a one man shotgun army!

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.020
Yes! Now this is how you make šašlik.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.040
Hot coal is for pussies, we use a f**king flamethrower.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.900
*let's drink to our friend Artyom*

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.640
You know what..

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.420
You can't remember my name..

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.640
..and you faint when you see monsters.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.917
But you're cool, man.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.560
*sips*

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.280
*to you, Artyom*

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.100
Argh, to me? Again?

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.580
Let's drink to the great Boris!

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.280
*sips*

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.320
♫ do you know the words to the cheeki breeki song ♫

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.380
*sips*

00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:21.741
♫ we can make cheeki breeki all night long ♫

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.660
*slams head*

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.800
Ooy, where did I drink myself to this time?

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.080
Sure, Artyom, Boris, I go by many names these last weeks.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.700
-You don't have even one bullet?

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.080
-Okay, let's go then.

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.840
Shit, was it what I drank?

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.320
Or do the kids in the game sound like midgets?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.960
Hey, hold on, midget boy!

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.480
Damn, man!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.860
That vodka was not right.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.740
Wooh!

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.180
I think I need a break.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.840
Friends, I'm going to end this episode here.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.628
Stick around for the next episode very very soon.

00:04:53.628 --> 00:04:56.416
And I think this little human is taking me to a trap.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.909
Okay friends, I'll see you next time.
