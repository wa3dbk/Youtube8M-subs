00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.220
Hi, I'm Ole Kassow, and I am the founder of Cycling Without Age

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.500
and I'm out cycling with Thorkild, my
friend, who is 97

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.330
I met Thorkild two and a half years
ago when I was cycling to work

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.660
and I saw him sitting on a bench and I
thought he would probably enjoy

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.020
cycling and he probably did when he was
a young man and so one day

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.000
I hired a rickshaw and I started taking
the residents from a local nursing home

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.900
out for rides

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.500
and it was such a joy both for me and
for the residents

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.750
we kept doing it and it inspired lots of
people

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.910
around Copenhagen and then very soon

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.190
in cities all around Denmark. In just
two and a half years

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.460
after that first ride with Thorkild, Cycling Without Age

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.289
has spread from one pilot and one bike to
300 locations in 2000 volunteer pilots

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.469
in Denmark and Norway which means that
twenty thousand elderly people

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.510
now have the opportunity to strike up
new friendships

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.960
and once again be part of their local
community. Now we need your help to bring

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.170
Cycling Without Age to your city.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.949
Because now that Ole Kassow has

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.100
started this project with rickshaws

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.220
then now we suddenly get a completely
different life

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.990
because we are being counted. When
you're an old person

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.869
and you are put into nursing home and
perhaps even lost your relatives

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.920
or your spouse, this is going to have a
negative effect

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.759
very often on your mental health. The
most important thing is to bring

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.920
young people and old people together.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.979
the first time I tried biking in a rickshaw

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.689
I didn't... I had no idea what I was doing,
but afterwards I just felt so energetic.

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.480
I biked with a man

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.500
who lost his wife some months ago,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.200
and he was looking for his wife all the
time. He was very sad. And then we went

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.010
for a ride,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.980
him and his daughter and me, and then all of a sudden his daughter just

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.680
looks at her father and she says: "Oh my God, Dad, this is the first time you smile

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.190
since Mom died. Those are very very, yeah, touching experiences.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.950
Cycling Without Age is about more than just cycling

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.670
It's also about getting to know each other

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.480
You develop friendships, actually.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.330
We're now in the workshop where these wonderful highly specialized machines are being built

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
and being shipped off to cities across
Denmark

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.410
but it's not just about the bikes. It's
also about educating people,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.990
locals around the country, to get the
most out of the bikes.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.250
We received hundreds of emails from
people around the world,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.210
which is amazing and totally
surprising

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.470
and many of whom are actually now getting involved in setting up

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.690
chapters of Cycling Without Age in their
cities.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.780
I'm Ditte from Aquitaine, France. I'm from Fairfield, Iowa, USA

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.040
From Buenos Aires, Argentina. Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.250
Gerard Bodalski from Lutheran Homes of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.090
In Singapore the people who are ageing now

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.140
are called pioneers. That's because they built Singapore out of nothing. In Cycling Without Age

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.830
we want to take the pioneers out to sense and feel the pulse of the place

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.320
they started exactly 50 years ago.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.220
We have great nature and beautiful parks and I would love for the senior
citizens here in West Hartford

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.330
to be able to experience all that and to get wind in their hair.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.569
We want less cars and more cyclists for every age. Yeah.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.349
That's true greatness.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.280
You heard from them and you heard from me. Now we're asking for your help to raise money

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.760
for bicycles like these

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.840
and know-how to be sent around the world to cities and countries

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.030
where people, passionate people, locals
are looking to implement this in their

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.959
local community

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.880
to help improve the lives of the elderly.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.380
Please help us reach the campaign target.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.000
Thank you very much.
