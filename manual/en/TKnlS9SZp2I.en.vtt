00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
K-Tigers' dance with SHINee's song called 'Dream girl'!- Miracle Korea Ep.12

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.720
Each of motion in their dancing became more firm and restricted since they do Taekwondo dance with music.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, we have a parade of impressive Taekwondo skills to get rid of our stress!

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.100
Is he human waterwheel?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.800
And here comes the grand finale of this performance!

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.900
It's so dizzy to see that high height.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.800
And he flew like a butterfly and broke the roof tile with his leg like a bee!

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.660
How do you feel now, everyone! Feel liberating now?

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.800
Brand new concept of Taekwon performance, K-TIGERS!

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.480
Your performance is the best!

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.580
The audience's reaction is more enthusiastic than ever!

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:11.480
How was it? The performance I recommended?/ It was amazing! OMG!

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.600
Aren't they K-Tigers who came out in the episode when the painter, Sek Chang-woo was here?!/ Yeah, they are!

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.340
They were the model of croquis in episode when painter, Seok Chang-woo came out!

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:35.080
And the painter, Seok Chang-woo received 10,000,000 won, winning the first place by depicting K-Tigers in croquis.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:56.080
They gave touching performance for everyone as shiny supporting actors. They were the number one supporting actors to make painter, Seok Chang-woo to win the first place, to say simply.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:05.180
And it seems like the size of 'K TIGERS' became larger than before?

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.080
We couldn't show everything during the episode of painter, Seok Chang-woo. But we have more members now so we will have more varied performances.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.000
You don't need to be that serious. You don't need to talk with discipline as if you were doing Taekwondo!
