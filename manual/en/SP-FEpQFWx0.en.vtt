00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.560
So there's this club we want to
tell you about

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.339
It's very exclusive.

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.039
Many apply, few get in.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:14.709
Here are some of those who have tried to get in and failed to join the ranks.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.829
but every now and then a candidate comes
along who proves himself worthy.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.069
He's bold

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:22.480
He's audacious

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.739
He's colorful

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.500
He has earned his stripes and is now
an elite member of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.279
the integer club

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.730
the first rule of integer club is that
you do not talk about integer club

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.940
second rule about integer club is that you
do not talk about integer club

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.400
third rule about integer club is that we were
totally kidding about first two rules

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.409
Go ahead and talk about integer
club

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:45.520
It appreciates the free advertising

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.920
the members of this club to a lot of
traveling

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.740
Their main mode of transport?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.210
a number line

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.910
it sorta like the new york subway but
with more stops and fewer muggings

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.910
The integers conductor top-secret business
only at their designated stops along the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.960
line their train doesn't stop at four
point eight for example

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.370
as tough as these integers are they
wouldn't dare mess with a number of that

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.180
is so shady

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.660
The ringleader of the integer club goes
by the name Zero he keeps tabs on both

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.960
negative and positive integers also
report to him

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.230
many of them passed through when having
their signs reversed in fact zero is

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.570
responsible for distributing those
negative signs as positive integers

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.850
passed through his station on their way
into the bad part of town

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.770
once in awhile usually when zero owes
an integer a favor he'll hook them up with

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.110
even more than one negative sign

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.000
which can make them look rather complex
and helps to confuse and disorient

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.080
the enemy

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.670
of course like any quality undercover
organization everyone's got a partner

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.870
Eight's partner is negative eight

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.140
Eleven's partner is negative eleven and
so on

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.830
they work well together but don't get to
hang out very often

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.540
The only member of the integer club
without a partner

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.439
zero of course he likes to fly solo

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.180
there are rumors that he used to have a
partner back in the old days but well he

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.389
doesn't like to talk about it

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.799
there is no direct way to apply for
integer club

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.159
you can submit online and you won't find their
headquarters address in the yellow pages

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.519
or yelp

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.079
but whether or not you ever receive a
personal invitation to become one of

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.709
them you have to feel better just
knowing they're out there

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.579
keeping our math homework safe

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.579
and our algebra teachers happy
