00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.180
2006 TDI, I believe the engine code is

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.980
BRM, complaint is lack of power

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.189
black smoke out the tailpipe especially
going up a hill

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:19.349
so obviously first thing I did was

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.580
drive it and verified the complaint

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.779
funny enough there were no codes stored

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.849
you would think that with a power loss issue

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.699
especially when it gets to the point
where you notice the power loss

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:37.660
that a code would be present, but not in this case

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.180
so as you can see I have the engine RPM

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.050
boost pressure "desired" what the computer is commanding

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.150
and boost pressure "actual"

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.420
millibars, snap-on scaling has got that

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.640
auto correcting or auto scaling, so these peaks might

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.149
 look similar in terms of behaving
according to what the ECM says

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.559
or wants but as you can see here the scaling

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.300
on here the highest point it was 1600 millibars

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.679
where as the computer or ECM

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:14.950
is actually commanding up to 2040

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.703
millibars

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.899
let me just see if I can get the cursors going

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.830
so let's just pick a peak here, you can also see

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.509
when the ECM is commanding

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.179
or is expecting boost as I'm accelerating 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.770
boost, you can see here, it hasn't even started
climbing yet and that's pretty much

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.410
the sensation that you feel you step on
the gas pedal and nothing's really happening

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.459
and it's only until engine speed increases

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:51.789
to the high RPM's when

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.440
you actually do feel a little pick up or boost

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.849
and then obviously you see me here these
are probably going through the shifts

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.129
1st gear, 2nd gear etc.

00:02:01.129 --> 00:02:05.590
and then decelerating in terms rpm
and obviously once you

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.209
decelerate in rpm, the boost level

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.240
ECM commands it to go off

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.580
or doesn't need the boost so it cuts the boost level

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.930
...so the main complaint or thought
process here basically already is

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.070
the fact that had I don't hear the
turbo whistling

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.230
at lower speeds which is the quick spool because of the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.590
not the wastegate, but the turbo vanes

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.240
you know how they're supposed to adjust to the narrow gap causing the turbo to spin

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.550
quickly at lower rpm... I don't hear that

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.560
so I already have my suspicion that
some is going on with the turbo vanes

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.520
and following video here's what I found:

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.420
2006

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.480
BRM

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.870
TDI

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.150
complaint is lack of power, exhaust smoking

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.050
black smoke, no codes stored aside from intake flap motor, but no boost code

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.400
and when I data logged it, there was no boost

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.780
or there was boost, but it was slow to build

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.349
here's the turbo actuator

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.890
sits on the top on this one

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.890
you can see the turbo rod... when the engine is running

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.730
vacuum is applied here, and it's supposed to force the rod down

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.670
 that's not happening.... so I'm just going to check it for vacuum here

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.480
I've got 17"... 18" of vacuum

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.510
so that tells me that the vacuum solenoid is good

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.310
the vacuum lines are good

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.240
so with vacuum supply being good...

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.419
the only thing left is

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.569
the diaphragm either is broken... or the vanes are stuck

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.290
so I'm gonna hook up the vacuum hose

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.570
see if I can pump it up

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.569
won't pump up... vacuum diaphragm is broken
