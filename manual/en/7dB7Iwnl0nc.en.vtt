AMANDA CLAIRE: All right, so the next thing
you're going to need to buy is a fabric to

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.069
use for the screen. Now again, if you were
doing traditional screen printing, there's

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.900
fabrics that are sold for that purpose, and
you know, they're not like outrageously expensive,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.539
but you know, you pay some money for them.
And they're kind of these special fabrics

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.880
that are used for screen printing, you know,
they're either silk or synthetic or there's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.010
kind of different ones you can get. For this
method, you don't really even need to look

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.980
for those fabrics. You know, you can go to
a fabric store and just kind of look around

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.600
to see what they have. There are--you will
almost certainly be able to find several fabrics

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.360
at a fabric store you can use for screen printing.
Now the properties you want are first of all,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.680
you want them to be pretty thin, okay and
you want it to be fairly--I mean you can see

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.440
that it's sort of like transparent, almost
I mean, you know. I can sort of see through

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.590
it and that's because it's woven out of fairly
thin threads and if I look closely, there's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.010
actually some spacing between the threads,
right? And what I mean by that is if you look

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.561
at fabric like you know, a cotton knit like
my t-shirt's made of you can't really see

00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:14.340
through the holes in the threads and more
than that, I mean it has kind of a complex

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.031
knit to it so it's not really built that way.
A fabric like this is really just a very,

00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:28.140
very simple you know kind of grid of threads
and there's holes between them, okay. So,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.810
that's kind of basically what you're looking
for. Now the size of the holes in the fabric

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.860
are going to determine the detail that you
get in your image. So if you have really,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.320
really small holes you'll be able to get you
know, a little bit more detail. A fabric that

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.000
has kind of larger holes in it, you get a
much kind of rougher image and you don't want

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the pores--the holes in your fabric to be
too big because you still need to be able

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.150
to kind of seal them off with the glue that
we're going to be using later. Another thing

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.000
about your fabric is you don't want it to
be stretchy, okay? And that's really important.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.980
You want it to kind of be, you know, fairly--I
mean all fabrics stretches a little bit, but

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.950
you don't' want a stretchy fabric. You want
one that kinda will retain kind of its shape

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.990
and its strength if you kinda stretch on it
but, so I don't know if you can see this,

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.841
you probably can't see through it, but it's
kind of a--it's not a gauzy fabric but it

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:25.880
is a thin fabric. And they often sell things
like this for use in, you know curtains, or

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.069
I don't know maybe like the hems of dresses
and skirts or whatever. Just look around and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.700
find something. It kind of doesn't matter
what color it is. I mean, I like white because

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.170
it's easier to trace your image. You probably
want to get a light color because if you're

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.040
going to be tracing your image onto it but--so
that's your fabric.
