00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.239
Are you paying too much for auto repairs?

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:07.960
Chances are, if you own a Mercedes, BMW, Range
Rover, Land Rover, Audi or Volkswagen, you

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:08.960
are.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.670
This is especially true if you go to a dealer
for repairs.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.940
In the next couple of minutes you'll discover
what to watch out for and how to make sure

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.330
you're getting your car serviced and repaired
by a highly qualified auto technician at a

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.590
reasonable rate.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.300
Time Magazine recently posted an article on
their website entitled "Crafty Ways Car Dealerships

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.269
Get You to Spend—When You're Not Buying
a Car" the article stated

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.789
car dealerships are placing a renewed focus
on making more money from their service departments,

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:38.190
sometimes via questionable tactics, including
classic upselling and proactively reaching

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.930
out to customers about problems they might
have but don't even know about.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.559
"The front end of the store is sexy," says
one dealership CEO, "but we make our money

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.840
in the back."

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.839
Among some of the practices the article mentions
are:

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:52.999
• Using cheaper, second-tier parts in service
jobs

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.289
• using scare tactics and preying on the
consumer's ignorance to increase sales

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.170
• Using commissioned workers who are motivated
to upsell services

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.740
• inflated fees and part charges tacked
on at the bottom of service bill

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.000
Not all dealers are bad, but they have large
overhead so there's a lot of pressure to find

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.850
ways to bring in more money.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.060
To protect yourself, simply compare their
offer with another one from a well established

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.490
and trusted independent service center.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.910

has an A+ rating and has been located in Hermosa

They have a ton of testimonials from happy
clients.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.869
Here's a 5 star Yelp review.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.979

"The BEST auto repair shop I have EVER been

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:34.979
to!!

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.290
Vasken is the most honest mechanic you will
ever meet and did more work then I paid for

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.619
and did it all cheaper then the Audi dealer
would have for HALF of the work!

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.040
I am so sick of being ripped off by crooks
in this industry and this shop is truly the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.090
best out there.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.869
I STRONGLY recommend them!"
