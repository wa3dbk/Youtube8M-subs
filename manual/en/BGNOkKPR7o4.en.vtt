00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.790
Okay, so, our chicken's done, our herb roasted
chicken. What we did, we made an herb butter,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:14.530
we piped it in between the flesh and the skin
of the chicken. We made our pan gravy, roast

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.510
the chicken for and hour, now it's ready to
carve. So let's have a look here. Usually

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.780
what I'll do, I'll take off the legs and thighs
first. So we're going to cut right down here.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.160
Now this has been cooking an hour so it should
be pretty tender, almost fall off the bone

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.640
tender. So what I'm going to do is bring the
knife in, just work the chicken away, and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.251
then you eventually will find the socket joint
in here, and you can release the chicken.

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:56.360
Now before you pull it away, just make sure
you trim it all the way around. You want to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:08.640
keep as much meat in tact as possible. So,
there we go, it's coming apart. So there's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.670
our thigh. Now what I like to do with the
breast, you can, you can work this two ways,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:23.340
you can either go in with your chef's knife
straight down, and bring the knife down, and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.580
cut it straight to the backbone. And then
the breast will come away, but you have the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.660
bone on the breast. What I like to do for
classical service, and it's just nice when

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.530
you're cooking for someone else, is to go
down along the breast plate, and what you

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:51.420
will do is remove the white meat from the
bone. Okay, so we get that in there. Let's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:03.290
remove the wish bone, which should be right
around here, it's still a little hot. Okay,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:12.170
then slowly we're going to to work the meat
away from the chicken. Now if it doesn't come

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.280
off the bone this easy, your chicken might
not be thoroughly cooked. You cook it for

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.340
one hour, you roast it, it should come off
this easy. And if it's a little hot on the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.810
hands you can wear some food handler's gloves,
and work it off the bone that way. So now

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:44.160
we have our breast away from the chicken.
There we go, beautiful. Now as you can see,

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.690
the herbs that we incorporated with the butter,
they're in between the flesh and the skin.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.069
Lift it up there, see tha, that's all flavor,
that's all flavor and that's all going directly

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.599
into the flesh of the chicken itself. So what
we're going to do is sauce the chicken with

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.129
our pan gravy. But you don't want to cover
the whole thing. You just want a little bit

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:11.819
of gravy, maybe down the center, something
you can dip it into, but you definitely don't

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.060
want to mask the flavors of the herbs and
butter. So let's sauce our chicken and have

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.700
a taste.
