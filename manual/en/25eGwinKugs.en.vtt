00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:16.043
[sound of foil pieces tapping against each other in the wind]

00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:34.000
I wish that I spoke more languages

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.132
because I think each language is a window completely.

00:00:37.132 --> 00:00:39.324
It's a new window.

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:46.950
I at times regret that I'm not very good at languages.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.089
I'd love to have more windows opening to me.

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:05.984
There are times that I name my--title my--works in my language, Ewe

00:01:05.984 --> 00:01:11.811
Like in my language, there are several words which would have multiple meanings

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.200
With a little tonality change, the word "Gli"

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.817
can mean so many things

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:22.100
"Gli" is "wall"

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.534
"Gli", same spelling, is "story"

00:01:26.534 --> 00:01:30.743
"Gli" is like "disrupt"

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:37.154
or "Gli" can mean erupt

00:01:37.154 --> 00:01:39.350
And so on and so forth

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.351
Several of the words that I use have such a range of meanings

00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:50.217
Whereas with English I find that it is a bit specific

00:01:50.217 --> 00:01:54.717
And since I'm working with the idea of non-fixity

00:01:54.717 --> 00:02:00.435
and something indeterminate, I don't want the language to inform.

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:05.133
Because wanting it to inform, and by giving it a context

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:10.333
you limit its ability to stretch,

00:02:10.748 --> 00:02:16.551
and I want it to remain contextless

00:02:16.967 --> 00:02:19.689
so that it leads you anywhere.

00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:33.096
The tradition that actually started my profession off

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.112
was this collection of symbols that

00:02:37.112 --> 00:02:39.270
they call Adinkra symbols

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.131
"Adinkra" means saying goodbye.

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:47.750
It's actually a series of signs and symbols that

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.799
are printed on textiles.

00:02:52.014 --> 00:02:55.766
In a library, I read a couple of books

00:02:55.766 --> 00:03:00.450
in which there were claims that Africa didn't have art

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.951
or that African art is not abstract

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:09.467
and then I saw these signs in which you clearly see

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:14.350
people making attempts to encapsulate abstract ideas

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.825
like the oneness of God or unity

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.883
That really opened my eyes, and I stayed with those signs for well over 5 years

00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:29.955
after I finished school.

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:40.467
Just like in Europe you will go to the museum to see

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.217
the artworks of your forebearers,

00:03:43.217 --> 00:03:47.966
this was my museum that I discovered.
