Hi, I'm Charles Stewart Jr, and I'm going
to show you how to burn music to a music CD.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.849
First you want to go out and buy some CD-Rs.
Basically these are CDs that are recordable

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.420
so that you can put them in your computer
and burn them as you know, either storage

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:26.089
or music CDs. Nowadays pretty much all computers
have at least a CD burner in them. So, it's

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.859
safe to say that you have one. If you don't,
you want to make sure that you do have one

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.290
and you can go out and buy one, an external
one to plug in your USB if you don't have

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.930
one. But let's say you've got one in your
computer. You basically just you know open

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:50.480
up your computer, put in your CD-R, and I'm
going to use iTunes because iPods are pretty

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.200
much dominating the market and iTunes is similar
to other music programs, so I'm just going

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.850
to show you how to burn a CD using iTunes.
So we've got it open and iTunes is similar,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.480
it's pretty much the same thing with Windows
and Macs, so it really doesn't matter which

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.600
operating system you're using because these
will all apply to both. I've gone ahead and

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.810
I've created a playlist and dragged all the
songs that I want to be on my CD, for this

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.090
I'm doing old eighties metal bands. And again,
when you do it it'll show you the time and

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.479
usually you can only fit seventy-four minutes
on a regular CD, so, that's about an hour

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.530
and fourteen minutes. So you want to make
sure, right now I'm a little bit over, I'm

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.170
an hour and fourteen minutes and six seconds,
so I don't really want to push it. So I'll

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:48.390
probably delete one of my songs, 'cause it'll
try to span it over a bunch of CDs. So now

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.090
I've got fifteen songs. And it's pretty much
ready to go so, I've selected my playlist,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.870
and I've got all the songs up in the order
that I want them. If you want it in a different

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.760
order you can grab them and move them around.
But I'm good with that. So, then you're just

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.170
going to go down here to the burn disc button
and just hit burn disc. iTunes is going to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.069
start looking at it to make sure it's good
to go, and now it's going to start burning.

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:22.170
And then once it's done iTunes will let you
know and you can eject it and take it to your

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.879
car or take it to a party or wherever you're
going with it, and you've got your music CD.
