00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:10.070
Beneath the thin atmosphere of Mars lies an enigma: a desert landscape shaped by flowing water.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.930
In the distant past, Mars must have had a warmer, wetter climate,

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.120
but scientists wonder: just how wet was ancient Mars?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.680
[ Villanueva ] So in the ancient past, we have some indications that water was flowing on the surface, but how much water was there?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.420
Are we talking about oceans, are we talking about small rivers, a little rain?

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.830
So these definitions of how much water was on the planet was very undefined.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.230
[ Mumma ] A major question has been: how much water did Mars actually have when it was young, and how did it lose that water?

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.900
To answer this question, a team of researchers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.000
used infrared telescopes on Earth to study water molecules in the Martian atmosphere.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.010
[ Mumma ] We used the world's three major telescopes for infrared astronomy.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.910
From the ground we could actually take a snapshot of the whole hemisphere of the planet on a single night.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.830
The new infrared maps reveal the atmospheric ratio of normal to heavy water molecules at different locations and seasons on Mars.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.110
Heavy water molecules contain a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.160
which remains trapped in the Martian water cycle while normal hydrogen is lost to space.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.630
The researchers found that water from the polar ice caps is highly enriched in deuterium,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.330
indicating that Mars has lost a tremendous quantity of water.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:33.330
Now we know that Mars water is much more enriched than terrestrial ocean water in the heavy form of water, the deuterated form.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.910
Immediately that permits us to estimate the amount of water Mars has lost since it was young.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.250
The findings indicate that only 13% of an ancient ocean remains on the planet today, now stored in the polar ice caps.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:53.380
87% of this ocean has been lost to space. This means that early Mars would have looked much different than it does today,

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.880
with a significant portion of its surface covered by water.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.980
[ Mumma ] So the really interesting question is, could it form a sea or an ocean? And indeed, it would.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.420
In the northern plains, which is a relatively flat region but depressed from the rest of the planet,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.330
it would form an ocean that was approximately 20% of the planet's surface area.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.080
And so that is a respectable ocean.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.250
By combining Martian topography with the new estimate for water loss,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.380
the researchers were able to simulate Mars' ancient ocean, and its escape to space.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.660
As Mars lost its atmosphere over billions of years, it lost the pressure and heat needed to keep water liquid,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.760
causing the ocean to shrink and recede northward.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:54.600
The remaining water eventually condensed and froze over the north and south poles, giving Mars the ice caps that we see today.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.530
This new scenario means that Mars would have stayed wet for longer than previously thought, expanding its ancient habitability.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.780
We now know that Mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.180
Curiosity shows it was wet for one-and-a-half-billion years, already much longer

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.880
than the period of time needed for life to develop on Earth,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.980
and now we see that Mars must have been wet for a period even longer.
