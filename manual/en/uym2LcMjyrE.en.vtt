00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.090
I'm Alison Haislip.

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:02.190
I'm an actor.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.120
I'm currently on Hulu's first
original series, Battleground.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.330
So most people know me from my
tenure on the G4 network.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.250
And they all like the story
that G4 actually

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.665
found me in a bar.

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:21.700
I was bartending, and I just so
happened to be wearing an

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.140
old school Nintendo remote
control charm necklace.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.580
And a guy who worked in
development came to the bar,

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.970
was sitting down, we
got to chatting.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.540
He asked me about the necklace,
and I was like I've

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.240
played video games
since I was five.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.710
And he was like, and
you still play?

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.310
I'm like yeah.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.800
And he's like but
you're a girl.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.550
And I'm like I know.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.740
So we just continued chatting,
and when he realized I

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.990
actually knew what I was talking
about, he was like you

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.440
need to be on our network and
set me up with a meeting with

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.160
the head of talent.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.760
And I went and met her, and
basically just spent 45

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.560
minutes talking about how
I'm a massive nerd--

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.470
took the philosophy of Tolkien
in college, and my parents

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.430
threw Trekkie parties and
would dress me up as a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.520
red-shirted Edson to pass
out hors d'oeuvres.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.630
This is in my blood.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.010
And they hired me two weeks
later because of that.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.040
And I had no idea what I was
doing, had never hosted a day

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.320
before in my life, had never
seen a teleprompter.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.940
But I knew what I was talking
about, and that seemed to just

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.090
work on the network.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.090
90% of my job was stuff people
wished they could do in their

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.030
entire lifetimes.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.530
And I got to do it
in four years.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.010
So it was an amazing,
amazing experience.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.740
And it was hard to
leave when I did.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.280
But now I'm back in the acting
track, and that's what I was

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.800
out here for in the
first place.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.770
I'm extremely passionate about
gaming, whether it's video

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.040
games or board games
or whatever.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.040
Obviously I love acting.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.940
That's what I do.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.780
That's why I'm out here.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.330
And social media has,
surprisingly, become a huge

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.320
part of my life.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.920
Social media's something
that actually came

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.150
pretty easily to me.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.150
I got an AOL Instant Messenger
account at a very young age,

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.960
like right when that was a
thing, mainly because I went

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.670
to-- super nerd alert-- space
camp and made friends who were

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.580
out of state.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.410
And my parents wouldn't let me
call them, because it would be

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.040
too expensive.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.950
So we got Instant Messenger
accounts so we could talk to

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.480
each other online.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.830
And I remember going to college,
and no one had an

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.780
Instant Messenger account.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.539
And they thought that was
the coolest thing.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.330
And so that just kind of grew
into Friendster and then

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.660
MySpace and then Facebook.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.070
And then when Twitter came out,
I remember hearing about

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.445
that for the first time
in the G4 offices.

00:02:19.445 --> 00:02:20.870
I was like, oh, that
seems like fun.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:21.650
And I just signed up.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.180
And it gave me a platform to
just post random thoughts that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.520
just wouldn't come across in
any of my actual jobs.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.800
And my following just kind
of grew because of that.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.660
And I remember when I hit 10,000
followers, my mom was

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.490
like there's 10,000 people out
there who care about what you

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:41.470
have to say?

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.640
And now I've got over 100,000.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.090
And I've gotten jobs because
of my Twitter account.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.260
And I never in a million years
thought that social media was

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.120
going to be a pinnacle point in
my career, but here we are.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.200
I'm such a nerd.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.350
And I don't use that term
to be like I'm so cool.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.970
I'm a nerd.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.310
I mean I'm actually a nerd.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.600
And people kind of get shocked
by it sometimes.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.420
But I went to space camp
for four years.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.670
I've read Lord of the Rings
at least six times.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.810
I took philosophy of
Tolkien in college.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.700
I'm a card-carrying member
of the Lord of

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.650
the Rings fan club.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.460
It's in my wallet.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.580
I grew up watching every episode
of Star Trek, every

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.240
version of Star Trek.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.950
I had the chicken pox in second
grade and watched all

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.030
three original Star Wars
every single day

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.370
for two weeks straight.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.820
I have it all memorized.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.120
And then video games, I've
played video games since I was

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.330
five, and I haven't stopped.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.220
I was the only female
member of a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.360
GoldenEye club in college.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.480
Every Sunday night we'd get
together, and it was a bunch

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.770
of dudes and then me,
playing GoldenEye.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.980
I hated the golden gun.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.890
Gaming is an escape.
