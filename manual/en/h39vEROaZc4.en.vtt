00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.300
Now the frame that we've created needs a way
to stand up onto the base of our stage so

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.889
I'm going to show you how to make the wooden
sticks go inside the corrugated paper and

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.870
that will create a stand, in order for us
to stick inside the base of the stage. So

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.660
if we cut our strips correctly, the lines
of the corrugated paper should be running

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:35.430
along the length of the strip. So I have room
to take a thin skewer and put it inside the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.280
opening of the corrugated paper. What I first
want to do is, I don't want to use the full

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.122
length of the stick, it's not necessary, so
I'm going to cut a piece and I'm going to

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:54.200
be left with a piece, probably about five
inches is a good size. And I cut two sticks

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:08.240
like that. And then I go ahead and stick it
inside the corrugated paper. If you have trouble

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.540
getting it in, if you didn't use a thick enough
corrugated paper, you can twist the stick

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.180
back and forth and it will slide in, or you
can just press it down onto a hard surface

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.300
because the stick should fit right into, run
along the lines of the corrugated paper. You

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:34.869
don't have to worry about it pushing itself
out or tearing the frame. So we put it in

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:41.130
high enough so that it creates, it will be
sturdy, it will create a nice base, and we

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.630
should have enough left out to be able to
stick into the base of the stage. It's important

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.270
that the part of the stick that's sticking
out should be, both of them should be even,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.590
so that the frame stands straight up and by
the weight of the border, the thickness of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.000
the corrugated paper and also the sticks that
are inside, this will create a nice strong,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.220
sturdy support to let the border stand up
straight onto the base of the stage. So now

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.550
I've shown you how to insert the wooden skewer
sticks into the picture frame border so that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.560
it will stand erect onto the base of our puppet
stage theater.
