00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.250
makhana, dear friends

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.790
let's go ahead and learn how to make
this chatpata paneer phaldaari makhana,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:31.090
for this preparation add some oil in a
pan and first we're going to fry these

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.040
seeds of lotus which are popped like pop
corns

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.850
so in the hot oil add them in this
preparation after these things get

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.230
roasted we're going to toss them on top
and which will give a nice crispy

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.530
texture on top which makes this dish even
more tasty

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.260
these fried makhanas added over any dish will add the nice crunchiness to the dish

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.470
fry these makhanas and keep it on the
side and in the same oil add cashew nuts

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:09.190
and slightly color them when the cash nuts gets little bit of color then add

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.500
the paneer, fry the paneer little bit
especially i fry the paneer whenever I'm

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.830
giving a paneer which is a dry preparation 
like this

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.440
now this is getting the nice texture, in this add pinch of

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:31.450
turmeric, reduce the flame and now we're
going to add salt and other masalas, add

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.060
salt, chaat masala,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.930
amchur powder, jeera powder and red chilli powder, that should be good enough and then just

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.229
let this get nicely mixed up with oil
and they'll give a very nice chatpata

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.450
