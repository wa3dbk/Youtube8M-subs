00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"Illegal Drugs in Chicken Feathers"

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.205
Between 1940 and 1971, the synthetic 
estrogen DES was prescribed

00:00:14.205 --> 00:00:18.770
to several million pregnant women with the 
promise that it would help prevent miscarriages.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.803
Problems were first highlighted 
in 1953 when it became clear

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:25.851
that not only was DES ineffective, 
but might actually be harmful.

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:29.070
However, a powerful and 
emotive advertising campaign

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.186
ensured that its use continued until 1971,

00:00:33.186 --> 00:00:39.070
when it was found to cause cancer of the vagina 
in the daughters of the mothers who took it.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.704
DES was also used to stunt the growth of girls 
who were predicted to grow “abnormally tall.”

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:50.603
As one pediatric textbook put it in 1968, 
excessive tallness in girls can be a handicap.

00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:53.738
It provides difficulty in 
the purchase of smart clothes;

00:00:53.738 --> 00:00:59.204
the victim is ineligible for certain sought-after 
professional positions such as air line hostess;

00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:04.569
and poses problems in selecting 
suitable dancing partners.”

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:11.769
But most people don't know that the greatest 
usage of DES was by the livestock industry,

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:15.092
improving feed conversion 
in cattle and chickens.

00:01:15.092 --> 00:01:19.036
Within a year of approval it was 
fed to millions of farm animals,

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.103
and although it was shown to be 
a human carcinogen in 1971,

00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:27.587
it was not until 1979 that all use of 
DES in the meat industry was banned.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.370
Now they just use different 
synthetic estrogen implants,

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.837
but even now decades after DES was banned,

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:41.564
we’re still seeing the effects: an elevation in 
birth defects even down into the third generation.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:49.506
Arsenic is another human carcinogen that was 
fed to chickens, this time by the billions.

00:01:49.506 --> 00:01:53.937
The arsenic ends up not only in the 
meat, as I’ve talked about previously,

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:58.404
but also in the feathers, which 
are fed back to the animals.

00:01:58.404 --> 00:02:01.703
See, a third of the bird is inedible.

00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:06.236
What do they do with billions of pounds 
of heads, bones, guts, and feathers?

00:02:06.236 --> 00:02:09.970
Fertilizer and animal feed.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.668
Feather meal is fed back to 
chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, and fish.

00:02:13.668 --> 00:02:16.625
Now, straight feathers are not 
particularly nutritious,

00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:20.770
so guts, heads, and feet may be 
added for little extra protein,

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.005
and manure added to 
the feed for minerals.

00:02:24.005 --> 00:02:28.230
The problem is that feather meal used 
as animal feed could contribute

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.304
to additional arsenic exposure 
in persons who consume meat.

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:37.036
This gave researchers an idea, though.

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:43.204
By testing feather meal, they might be able 
to find out what else chickens are fed.

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:54.504
“Feather Meal: A Previously Unrecognized Route 
for Reentry into the Food Supply of Multiple 
Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products.”

00:02:54.504 --> 00:02:59.270
All samples tested positive 
for antibiotic type drugs,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.491
between two to ten different 
kinds in each sample,

00:03:02.491 --> 00:03:07.137
including fluoroquinolones, 
which have been banned for years.

00:03:07.137 --> 00:03:11.202
So either the poultry industry 
is illegally still using the stuff

00:03:11.202 --> 00:03:15.719
or it’s being used in some other 
animals fed to the chickens.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.970
Regardless, when the feather meal 
is fed back to the chickens

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.387
they are getting exposed to this drug,

00:03:20.387 --> 00:03:22.653
which is against the law 
to feed to chickens,

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:27.284
creating a cycle of re-exposure 
to banned drugs.

00:03:27.284 --> 00:03:31.916
Then it just gets weirder.

00:03:31.916 --> 00:03:35.550
The feathers turned up with 
a half dozen other drugs:

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.417
Prozac, antihistamine, fungicide, 
a sex hormone and caffeine.

00:03:40.417 --> 00:03:45.350
Why doesn't the poultry industry 
just say no?

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.650
Evidently the antihistamines are 
to combat the respiratory problems

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.177
from packing in so many tens of 
thousands into the confinement sheds,

00:03:53.177 --> 00:04:01.000
and the caffeine helps keeps the chickens 
awake so that they eat more and grow faster.
