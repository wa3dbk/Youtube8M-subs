00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.539
I started thinking about medicine when I was
in high school and my parents are teachers

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:12.490
so working in an academic center comes easy
to me because I think I grew up in that teaching

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.950
environment.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.990
But I started to really think about medicine
as a high school junior and senior.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.960
And I shadowed a doctor at Parma Hospital
where I'm from in the Cleveland area and it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.220
was in the emergency department and I saw
what he did, you know, intubating somebody

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.230
who couldn't breathe and I just fell in love
with it.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.980
After I went to college I came back to Parma
Hospital for my first summer and I got a job

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.430
in the operating room.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.980
And my job was just to clean up the operating
rooms and move patients around but I really

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.890
enjoyed working in medicine.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.340
I love the teamwork, the camaraderie, the
teaching, the science, the research.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.540
Emergency medicine is a is so rewarding and,
you know, there's certainly downsides to being

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.810
an emergency physician, we have to work Christmas
and we sometimes work the weekends and things

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:11.120
like that, but there's really no other specialty
to me where you're counted on to see any patient,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.520
anytime, for anything and have to know the
first several hours of any emergency.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.770
It's just so fulfilling.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.390
A shift for me is like seeing each patient
at, you know, their most needy time of their

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.060
life and getting to treat them.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.330
And it's like a series of of short stories
that you can read where you see different

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.360
patients and you know I really enjoy the speed,
the fact that it's fast paced, the fact that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:47.020
patients count on us in their their sickest
times, learning is nonstop and all those things

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.180
for me in medicine and emergency medicine
just are very fulfilling.
