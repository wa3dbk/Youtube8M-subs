00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.860
It’s not just the sense of freedom

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.780
although that’s a big part of it. 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:15.671
But to cover distances 

00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.631
of 100, 150, sometimes 300 kilometres, 

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:22.700
you have to be driven by something that goes way beyond that. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.700
I think 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.700
the physical part is only

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.200
only a small piece of a bigger picture

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.760
It’s the mind that sets the limits. 

00:00:35.245 --> 00:00:37.805
It’s hard for the brain to comprehend

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:39.640
that the body needs to perform for such a long time. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.630
It’s not always easy, 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.700
keeping your thoughts from wandering, 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.960
especially when the going starts to get tough. 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.200
What I try to do is to break the race down into smaller goals

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.880
getting to the next checkpoint, running another 10km, or 1km. 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.480
That’s the only way I can get a grip of it, I can feel confident, 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.460
safe in the knowledge

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.200
 that I’m going to manage this. 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.200
It’s something I strive after in everything I do, 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200
Both at work and in my free time 

00:01:13.553 --> 00:01:15.253
After all, I also work indirectly on other people’s safety also

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.380
– building up security solutions that prevent crises from occurring 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380
and helping countries to protect their citizens. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.740
That’s why I think it’s so important

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.214
to feel secure in yourself

00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:32.214
 so you can understand what that means. 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.060
Planning is vital

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.520
getting an overview and having clear goals. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.980
But it’s also about daring to think differently every day 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.240
and doing things that have never been done before. 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.120
I need to stay one step ahead at all times, 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.860
in order to deal with the obstacles that might crop up along the way. 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.780
Our projects can be incredibly complex  and extremely long

00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:08.821
up to 10, 15 years

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.309
, and it’s important that the small decisions 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.880
still move you forward all the time. 

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:19.663
I think it’s easy to take safety for granted

00:02:20.767 --> 00:02:25.027
and my job is a reminder that we really can’t do that.
