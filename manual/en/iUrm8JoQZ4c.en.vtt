"Damn, I'm in the last rows,

00:00:18.853 --> 00:00:21.452
they will never ask me to play,
I wanted it so bad!"

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:23.854
You, the one who raised
his hand first. Say a language.

00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.563

Where's the slipper?

00:01:25.463 --> 00:01:29.159

Sara to do some Kama Sutra!

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:58.884
Nononono.

00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:11.096

00:03:15.354 --> 00:03:19.535
Well, Japan is a different culture, people...
Sometimes it can...

00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:23.036
