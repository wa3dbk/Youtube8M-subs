Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com.
Here we have three violins and as I point

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:23.789
to them, this violin is from a German factory
in the 1920’s, the Heberlein Factory and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:35.050
this is quite beautifully figured maple. This
violin is an older German violin, I don’t

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:43.040
know its age but it has an on the inside of
the top when I had it apart I found penciled

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:51.320
handwriting saying that it been repaired in
New York in 1911, so it’s definitely someone

00:00:51.320 --> 00:01:01.171
older and it’s similar maple figure. And
the neck on this instrument has I think a

00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:14.240
more pronounced figure in the grain. And then
the other violin is my French violin, and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:29.009
here the figure is more settled, it’s still
visible than it is more settled and violin

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:42.700
makers developed different sort of signature
styles of altering the color of the varnish

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.649
and in some cases they did it to an extreme.
This is referred to in the commercial violin

00:01:49.649 --> 00:02:01.989
trade as imitation old, and it was thought
I believe that an older violin would have

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:08.189
better tone would have also withstood the
test of time, and therefore you can increase

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:16.219
the value of a new violin if you made it look
old. Now whether that really made any difference

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:23.349
in the value of the violins I’m not prepared
to say, but the result is that violins have

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:31.780
very interesting appearances that I think
arise from the ways that individual violin

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:42.430
makers tried to apply that concept. So a lot
of the violins don’t have uniform coloring

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:52.709
in uniform varnish, but actually deliberate
changes in the varnish, the differences in

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.220
the varnish that are related to making it
look older and more in use.
