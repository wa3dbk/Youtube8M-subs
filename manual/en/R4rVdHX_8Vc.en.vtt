00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.889
Hi! Welcome to Sprig Barton's going to eat
some Dutch Food for you.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.610
I've got more Dutch food!
Yes, I've got some haring.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.209
Some Dutch herring!
hehehaa, Yes!

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.249
I've got some Dutch flags!
It's haring!

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:19.570
Maatjes are little bitty harings about this
big

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.730
between 150 and 160 grams
The kind we like to eat

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.580
because they are tender
they're not gritty

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.400
everything's perfect
Between the end of May and the beginning of

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.649
July
is the best time to get these because they

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.860
are so
they are so good

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.329
and they are at their highest point of having
their fish oil content

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:48.329
so, lots of fish oil really healthy fish
This cost 1,65 which is a really good price

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.440
(euros)
considering you get one at the market and

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.840
he wants 2 (euro) for one and there's 2 in
here for 1,65

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.679
so like that's like 82 and a half cents compared
to 200 cents

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.430
this is much better
this is supposed to be de-boned and de-headed

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.250
back in the middle ages
back in the middle ages we started having

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.479
this stuff in Holland
they developed a way of deboning it and putting

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.250
it in brine
brine is the salty water

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.470
so it's not too salty, it's just a bit salty,
just enough to kill off the nematodes, stuff

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.200
you don't want to eat.
and uh

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.939
so we can eat raw herring with onions
these haring were caught in June 2013

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.060
in June of 2013 so I should have gotten them
last year

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.579
but, let's try them.
Eat some for breakfast.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:52.579
mmmmm
right.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.360
I'm going to inspect it.
Let's make sure that the bones aren't in there.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.520
This is the herring that we're going to eat.
And you're supposed to eat it like this.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.560
but the first thing you're supposed to do
is

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.810
dip it in onions
and guess what! This handy package gives me

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.750
raw onions to dip my haring in.
ooooo

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.190
the onions are supposed to stick
they do kind of stick to the fish oil

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.170
and you don't eat the tail
and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.770
it smells so fishy!
and nice!

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.910
so I'm going to eat it like you're supposed
to

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.700
just like this, I don't know how much fits
in my mouth

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.700
here we go.
I saved the tail.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.140
mmmmm
that was so tasty

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.110
huh, that's really good
ooh, got some onion down my shirt.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.280
blechk
going to have to clean that.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.280
Yumm! Raw onion and raw fish!
that has been put in brine for a bit.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.170
and... I also read in the fish news
I've got another bit here.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.970
I also read in the fish news
that they have to freeze them for 24 hours

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.940
to kill off some other bugs.
we'll see, if I get sick, I'll post one of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.940
me being sick, ok.
another one.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.350
stupid face, closeup silly face ooooooo
mmmmmmm

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.320
number 1
I can see why you put the onions with it.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.320
It takes away the saltiness a bit and gives
it a little bite.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.240
its really good
mmmm

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.470
these are also useful for eating pieces of
the haring.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.010
mmmm
oooh, yummy

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.420
I should have gotten one for my husband, but
he's going to be upset isn't he....

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:31.200
I do, I have a second one, he can have it.
I love you!

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.310
See you in a little bit!
with more....

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.830
Right!
