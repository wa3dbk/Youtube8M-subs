00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.420
[male voice]: Did I document all the engines
on scene and add them to the resource summary?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.940
[female voice]: Did I tell him about those
snags on the left flank.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.480
[female voice]: I hope she remembers that
there's another crew on the way.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.200
Narrator: Communication, as we all know, is
vital to success on the fireline.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.170
One of the most vulnerable times for communication
breakdown is during a transition.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.200
Transitions occur at all levels: between team s,
incident commanders, crews, and individual firefighters.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.320
Transitions can occur on or off the fireline
during any phase of the fire or any time of day.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.320
They can take minutes, hours, or even a full
day to accomplish.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.300
Narrator: Consider the following - You are
an ICT4 that has just arrived on scene of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.870
a new start reported by the Flagtail Lookout,
southwest of John Day Oregon.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.560
By the end of the shift you will be required
to transition with another ICT4.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.340
Use the Student Workbook pages provided to
document necessary information.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.860
A list of resources that were dispatched with
you is in your Student Workbook.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.800
The fire is currently torching isolated pockets
and making short runs.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.829
The weather is expected to become hotter and drier as the day goes on.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.680
Narrator: You are first on scene and as you
are finishing your size-up to dispatch your

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.970
resources start showing up.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.900
Type 2 exclusive
use helicopter.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.170
You decide to use them to do bucket work on the head of the fire.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.780
Two type 4 engines.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.390
You split them up and
have them anchor and flank on each of the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.390
sides, spraying water where necessary.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.220
Two type 6 engines.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.020
You decide to pair them
up with the type 4s to support their efforts.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.630
One twenty person hand crew.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.310
After talking
with the engine bosses, it appears that some

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.210
saw work and hose lay support is needed so
you divide the crew to support the engines.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.550
Narrator: As the fire continues to slowly
grow it is threatening Bear Valley Work Center

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.540
where there are 10 structures.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.340
It is also nearing a major highway.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.680
Narrator: You have ordered a single engine
airtanker and another engine for structure

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.150
protection.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.690
As resources are spread thin, no further assistance
is expected due to other fires burning in

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.600
the area with higher priorities.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.520
At 2000, the fire is approximately 25 acres.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:25.440
Prepare a briefing to transition with the
incoming ICT4.
