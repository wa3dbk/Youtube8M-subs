00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So this question's coming from Easterlake.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
They're asking will Crusader 2 feature AI opponents not seen in the previous Stronghold Crusader 1.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
As we already said the game will feature several new AI opponents, they'll vary quite differently from each other

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in the way they work with you. We want the characters to surprise you and interact with you more strongly than before.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
A large number of AI opponents will be classics returning from the first Crusader, as well as completely new characters to the series.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
They'll have their own fighting style and sense of humour, but essentially we want each character to be a different battle.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If you play with a combination of human and AI each time you mix those up it will be a completely different fight

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and even if you fight against the same AI opponent twice they will have a new type of castle or a new range of defensives.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The personalities are mixed up as well so they run their economies differently,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
they taunt you differently, they harass you differently,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
they generally try to make your life a living hell, but each skirmish map will be different from the last one.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Daitken92 has asked "What graphics engine are you using for Crusader 2?"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We can tell you the game will feature an enhanced Vision engine, it will be in 3D and will feature Havok physics.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The main thing for us, aside for a few optimizations and enhancements to the wall destruction,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is to make the game run as smoothly as possible on computers big and small,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so everyone can have a great time playing the game.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We got a question from Jarmenkell, which is "How is the graphics engine different from Stronghold 2 or 3?"

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
For Crusader 2 we use the new Vision Engine,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which is completely different from the Stronghold 2 engine, which we built ourselves.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's the one we used in Stronghold 3, but it has received a lot of optimisations to help it run better.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
There will be a lot of more highly detailed models and buildings.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
One thing worth pointing out is that the programmers and artist have put a hell of a lot of time into making the UI,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the mini map, the multiplayer lobby, the AI and other parts of the game, completely new, completely redesigned for Crusader 2.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There now better looking, more intuitive, less obstructive, less big on screen, so you can see more of the action,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
combining these things to make it feel like a really new fantastic game, that is a worthy sequel to Crusader 1.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Fupao has asked us if there will be an in-game map editor. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Obviously the Stronghold games thrive on their community of map builders,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
as you know maps are still being created and submitted for the original games.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The top Stronghold fansite just went past 6,000 downloadable maps the other day, 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
so it goes with saying we will be included a full map editor for Crusader 2.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It will give players the same creativity and flexibility that we have when making maps, 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we are also looking to make it easier to find the map editor this time.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you are looking for it, it will be in your Steam library listed as a separate app. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So if you want to open it up you just find Crusader 2 in your list of games and it will be right there underneath.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Serjo777 has asked "Will units be able to destroy walls in the game?"

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We understand this is a pet peeve for some players and we can confirm that units won't just hack at the walls with their weapons,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
they will actually take out tools and dismantle the walls.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We will also be adding an option from the first game 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
which should help alleviate this problem as well, which brings me onto the next question.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Plation has asked "Will the Strongwall option be included?"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The Strongwall option from Crusader 1 will be included. For those of you who don't know what this is, 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it essentially means your average knight can't knock down a wall or a tower,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
they have to go through the gatehouse. Siege equipment can destroy walls, but your average knight can't just knock them down.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Sir Abe has asked us "Will the game feature magic?"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Crusader 2 will not feature magic. We know how much our players on the whole value realism

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and authenticity and we are respecting that for Crusader 2.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Don’t get me wrong we love Game of Thrones, but you won’t see any dragons in this game.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000
TomaskTemplar has asked us if this will be a Steam-only game.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
To be prefectly honest we haven’t decided yet on whether Crusader 2 will be exclusive to Steam or not.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The game is definitely built with Steam in mind and all the cool Steamworks features that entails,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
but we haven’t decided whether or not the game is going to be exclusive to the platform yet. 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So this question's from xhuggels asking "Will there be offline LAN multiplayer?"

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We're hoping to take advantage of players’ ability to form a direct connection over LAN

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and we’re looking into the viability of this on the Steam platform but we haven't got anything to confirm just yet.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Pharmaton has said "Since Firefly is self publishing Crusader 2 can you still buy a physical copy?"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
He says "This is Stronghold, I need a copy for my collection!",

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
we would love to do a physical copy of Crusader 2, it's something we want to do. We've got nothing to announce right now,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
we're just concentrating on developing the game and releasing it on digital platforms.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We have to thank you guys for watching these series of videos, it really does mean a lot to us that you'd send in your questions and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
we want to answer the questions. We are completely independent now,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
so we can open and honest with you guys and let you know what's going on with development.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It obviously helps us as well, you sending in the question to help rack our brains to see what other features will be added to the game.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So, thank you!
