00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.058
One of the heads was given to a group of
museum students at the Institute of Archaeology

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.669
to research and to see if they could find
any more information about these so that

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:21.978
we could start using them a bit better.

00:00:21.978 --> 00:00:25.298
The only clue we had was a tag

00:00:25.298 --> 00:00:29.337
that said 'number 34 murderer',

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:33.757
and then it said his name, but the script was very difficult to read,

00:00:33.757 --> 00:00:37.066
so we weren't quite sure actually of what his name was.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:41.675
They did an excellent job and were able to find a
publication written by Noel

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.255
which was in the British Library - as far as we
know it was the only in the country.

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:48.834
I found the book and I was kind of reading through it
and realised exactly what it was.

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:52.804
I was smiling oddly and probably people around me
thought that it was a little strange.

00:00:52.804 --> 00:00:56.644
And the book - it contains all the information we could want to know

00:00:56.644 --> 00:00:59.193
about this collection.

00:00:59.193 --> 00:01:02.602
So this is a huge advantage and means
that we can now actually start

00:01:02.602 --> 00:01:06.391
calling them by their real names which
is something, but also we can start

00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:10.222
trying to look into a bit about why they
were in the collection

00:01:10.222 --> 00:01:13.331
and what it was they did.
What's so interesting is the way that Noel

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:19.131
writes about it and sets up these casts
and sets up notions of criminality

00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:23.000
before even showing us the casts. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.300
And so we've been able to look at the way that he interpreted

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.489
these heads and to look at some of the
stories

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:34.447
about the individuals behind the
heads, if you like, which are absolutely

00:01:34.447 --> 00:01:35.387
fascinating.

00:01:35.387 --> 00:01:42.387
I think the most interesting ones are
the criminals.

00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:48.305
These are heads that were cast, both from life and from death,

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:51.385
by a British phonologist

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:54.775
called Robert Noel, and he was specifically

00:01:54.775 --> 00:01:59.134
interested in collecting the heads of
criminals,

00:01:59.134 --> 00:02:02.504
collecting the heads of intellectuals,

00:02:02.504 --> 00:02:05.923
and assessing

00:02:05.923 --> 00:02:09.343
their personalities and their character
traits

00:02:09.343 --> 00:02:12.983
by examining the heads.

00:02:16.443 --> 00:02:19.751
It's very exciting to have been a part of that
and to have helped UCL

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:24.151
in being able to use the collection more.

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:28.301
I think personally a lot of time when you 
do your research paper or report 

00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:33.050
someone marks it and that's the end of it, so for us to be able to produce a report

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.749
and find out all this research and 
know that someone else is using it

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:39.808
and someone else is benefiting from it - 
I think personally that's satisfying.

00:02:39.808 --> 00:02:43.959
They're of a unique collection

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.728
anywhere really in UK - they're the only
collection really of

00:02:47.728 --> 00:02:54.728
these types of cast heads which
have had a phrenological basis.
