00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.180
 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.260
Hi, welcome to Ski Talk. I'm Steve. I'm the ski buyer and

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.440
Ski-E-O here at skis.com and joining us today is Rick. Hi Rick.
How ya doing, Steve?
Rick is our

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.460
19 year veteran with Salomon, knows a few things about boots and is going to tell us about the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.540
women's Quest 80 from Salomon. So the Quest 80

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.710
boot is a really nice fitting boot for that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.840
strong-intermediate woman to advanced-level woman, correct?
Sure is.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.930
So it's a three buckle design. Why don't you tell us a little bit about the three buckle design? Now why

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.990
three buckles, first of all?
At this level, Steve, really we're talking about ease of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.150
access, convenience and a little bit lighter weight without sacrificing any

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.260
performance.
And it's also got a ski/walk feature on it which is a real nice

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.330
feature both for on the bottom of the hill and at the top of the hill, right?
Yeah.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.380
Just release it, uprights the cuff, allows them to walk a little bit

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.520
easier, stand a little more naturally. When you're ready to ski, just click it down

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.580
and then when you're ready to make your first turn, as you flex forward, it locks it back 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.650
into the ski position.
I said top of the hill, what I meant by that is if

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.810
the person owning this boot wants to do a little bit of hiking to get to some of the fresh powder and stuff...
Sure.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.940
...it makes it a lot easier to walk, right?
Yeah. I wouldn't call it a true AT boot but

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.050
yeah you got some backcountry access built in here.
Now the sole is a little bit

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.090
accommodating for that as well.
Yeah, almost mimicking somewhat of a hiking boot style.
That's good for

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.230
gripping either at the bottom of the hill if there's a lot of snow and stuff, it will help give a better grip and traction.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.250
Yeah. We've all seen the Warren Miller movie so this will help cut out some of that

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.310
slip-and-slide.
So, in terms of the buckles, we got micro-adjustable

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.480
buckles. We've got side cuff adjustments on it. What else do we have for a good fit

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.550
and feature?
Yeah, you've got that upper cuff alignment so it will accommodate, ya know

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.640
so it will align to the lower leg. You've got micro-adjustability here so it can

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.710
fit just about every foot. 100mm last, that doesn't

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.860
mean a lot to, you know, our customers out there but what that does mean

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.960
is it's going to fit that average foot. You know, probably 80-85% of the 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.040
customers out there, this will be slam dunk for them.
And the difference between this

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.200
boot, the Quest 80 and the Axis 70 and 60 for

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.350
women is this is a much narrower last. This is a snug fitting boot versus those

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.510
other ones which are more of a comfort, looser fit, right?
Yeah,

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.600
this definitely is not gonna, ya know, be that super

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.650
low volume fit but again average fit, more performance-oriented for sure

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.680
than the Axis.
Yeah, that's what I'm kind of getting at is this is for the woman who's a good intermediate

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.750
skier and wants the better connection to ski

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.810
for better performance. Now let's talk about the liner. It does have the custom

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.940
heat-moldable liner. What else does the liner got going on?
You've got the 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.030
faux fur so it gives it a nice look, really comfortable. Super warm.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.090
All of our ladies have extra insulation too.
I think that's an important point that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.280
the...Salomon is known for having really warm boots and the women's

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.410
boots are even warmer than the men's, right? You guys put a little extra insulation 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.490
in there, a little more quilting.
We try to keep them happy.
Stuff like that, yep.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.570
All right, is there any features I missed on that boot?
I think we got it covered, Steve.
Okay, great.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.780
So there you have it. That's the Quest 80 for women. I'm Steve and this has been Ski Talk.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.830
Thanks for joining us.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.030
 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.249
