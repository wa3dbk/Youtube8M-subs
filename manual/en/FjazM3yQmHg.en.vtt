00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.770
HTC Desire S.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.809
Expected Q2 2011.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.400
The replacement for the original HTC Desire
launched a year ago, the HTC Desire S doesn't

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.740
stray too far from the original handset with
a series of small improvements to make it

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.580
a slightly better device all around.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.760
The Desire S has a slightly improved processor,
a little more RAM, a slightly bigger battery,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.890
a new front-facing video camera, better WiFi
support and a revised case design. If you

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.630
already own a Desire, then there's not much
you are missing out on here.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:47.810
As with the previous version, there's a 3.7"
480 x 800 pixel display, although this is

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.200
now a Super LCD panel rather than the OLED
display the previous version had. On the back

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.649
is a 5 megapixel camera capable of 720p HD
video capture, and there's a basic VGA resolution

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.750
camera on the front for video calling.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:14.600
Inside is a 1 GHz Qualcomm MSM 8255 CPU and
33% more RAM than the old model at 768MB.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:22.640
Internal flash memory is quoted as being 1.1GB,
expandable via a microSD slot to another 32GB.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.920
It's a bit lighter than the old version at
130 grams, and the casing is a new unibody

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.299
design that looks similar to other HTC smartphones.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:40.350
The 1450 mAh battery is quoted as giving up
to 7.25 hours talktime on 3G which isn't bad.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.250
In our experience, the old HTC Desire was
pretty good when it came to battery life,

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.740
but the change in screen technology might
give a different performance with the Desire

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.620
S. The Desire S has quad-band GSM support,
UMTS 900/2100 and WiFi, now including 802.11n

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:58.620
plus DLNA support.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:06.799
There's a comprehensive multimedia player
with a 3.5mm audio socket, and of course GPS

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.200
and all the usual Android smartphone features.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.060
We're not entirely sure what version of Android
the HTC Desire S runs, it looks like either

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.750
version 2.3 "Gingerbread" or a newer revision
2.4. HTC have added their own "HTC Sense"

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.690
interface on top which is excellent as far
as we are concerned.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.900
It may only be a minor upgrade to the original
HTC Desire, but then we think that the original

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.780
was the best handset of 2010, so there's plenty
of life left in this phone yet. Although die-hard

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.340
HTC fans may be disappointed to see that it
is still a single core device, there is a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.200
rumoured HTC Desire 2 in the pipleline which
should be even better.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.970
HTC say that the Desire S should be available
during Q2 2011.
