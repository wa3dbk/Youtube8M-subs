Hello and welcome to another video brought
to you by AllFreeJewelryMaking.com and KeepsakeCrafts.net.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.410
Today we're going to make these simple pearl
wire wrapped earrings.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:35.751
So to make these great kind of funky, fun
earrings you will need two ear wires, some

00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:36.890
craft wire.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.820
This is 22 gauge wire and I love this pack.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.290
You can get it in all different colors.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.360
I'm going to use the silver, but you could
have a lot of fun and choose different colors.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.820
And then also you will need some top drilled
beads.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.720
These pearls have the holes, they're not centered,
they're at the top and that's what we need

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.360
in order to make this design.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.159
So I just pulled out a few and I'm going to
try to find a couple that will work together

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.890
and sort of match, but I'm not real worried
about it.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.080
The first thing we want to do is pull out
a length of wire, about 8" long.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.920
Let me grab my ruler here.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.189
It may be a little bit more than you need,
but it's better to cut a longer piece and

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.240
throw a little bit away than it is to run
short.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.069
That's just really aggravating.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:38.090
So you take your pearl and you slide in your
wire and leave about 1/2" sticking out the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:48.249
other end and then bend both ends of the wire
up like that and then the one thing I like

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.259
about this 22 gauge wire is I can manipulate
it with my fingers.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:04.389
So I'm going to bend it so it makes sort of
a triangle above the pearl and if you need

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:11.650
to, get in there with your tools.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.340
So it should look something like this.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.840
This isn't going to show so you don't have
to be too worried about that.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.360
Now this shorter one, we're going to cut off
so there's only about 1/8" above that bend,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.830
just like that.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:38.500
Next go ahead and grab those two wires right
at that bend with your chain nose pliers and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:45.940
then bend the remaining long wire at a 90
degree angle.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:53.790
Go ahead and grab that with your round nose
pliers and then start making a wrapped loop.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.590
Start your loop, reposition, use your pliers,
finish your loop and you can just keep holding

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:09.880
onto this with your round nose pliers as you
start wrapping all the way down, down past

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:20.920
the hole in your bead and you can be very
careful and make nice neat loop wraps, but

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:34.730
I'm gonna actually go on purpose with kind
of messy wraps just like that.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.460
And then just tuck that end in.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.730
You might need to use your chain nose pliers
just to get that end tucked in and there you

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.730
have it.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.960
If you need to use your round nose pliers
to straighten our your loop.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.470
Flatten it a little bit and there you have
it, a wrapped pearl.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.080
Here's another one I made earlier.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.860
I probably could have wrapped that a little
further down the hole and then all you need

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:18.070
to do to make yourself a great pair of earrings
is open your ear wire, slide on that loop

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:27.120
you just made, close it up and there you go.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:36.920
Now how fun was that and how quick was that.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.930
So I hope you give this project a try.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.220
