00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.930
Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. Mousse is a well known desert and its also easy to make,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.930
but im going to make it so much better. So join me today as i make my version of a nutella and marshmallow mousse.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.660
To start with into a microwave safe bowl

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.179
Place in our marshmallows. I have given these marshmallows a quick rinse

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.249
just to remove and excess flour that may be on the outside. and i have also given them a quick

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.309
pat down to dry them with some paper towel to remove any excess water.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610
Next pour in a quarter cup of milk

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.230
And then add in our nutella

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.460
Now place the bowl into a microwave and we are going to microwave it

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.739
for one minute at a time

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:46.090
stirring it each time

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.690
Just until it is melted and combined

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.390
next into a mixing bowl pour in our thickened cream or heavy cream or whipping cream.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.390
Next with a hand mixer or a stand mixer whip it up until soft peaks start to form

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.520
So that is what we are after

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.160
as you can see a soft peak has formed

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.490
Next with a whipped cream, you will need about a quarter of it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.600
place that in

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.700
to the nutella mix

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.670
Now mix that through completely

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.240
Once mixed through

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.350
with the rest of our cream

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.549
place it into the bowl

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.299
and what we are going to do is carefully

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420
fold it through

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.870
Don't mix to hard so to keep the air in the cream

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.750
So continue to fold through until combined

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.170
Once the cream has been folded through completely

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.760
we are going to use a dessert glass

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.760
Now pour in some of the mixture

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.630
and just with some clear wrap

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810
cover the top

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.620
so its nice and air tight

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.959
Now place it in the fridge for a good two hours to set

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.669
I have taken it out of the fridge and it has set nicely.

00:02:13.669 --> 00:02:16.239
So as one final step I'm going to add a little bit of

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.769
whipped cream

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.619
just on top

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.950
Now its time to give this a try

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.349
look at that

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.899
Its nice and fluffy

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:34.259
That is fantastic

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:38.400
That really is a lovely infusion of taste from the Nutella and marshmallows

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.330
This mousse is so fluffy and light that i can certainly say, this Nutella and marshmallow mousse taste

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.979
simply delish

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.609
So give it a go because i guarantee you will love this one, you really will.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.219
and as you can see it was so easy to make

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:58.099
So just make it up a few hours before dinner and you will have a lovely dessert

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.070
