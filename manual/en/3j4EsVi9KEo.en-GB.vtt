00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.340
The only reason I chose the University of
Surrey is because this is a really good university

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.360
to study my major which is Nutritional Science.
The University of Surrey is a top 3 university

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:22.970
to study my major, and also this is a really
good university in the UK which is top 8 right now

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.660
My advice for the news students who are
coming to the ISC at the University of Surrey

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:37.890
is if you want a new life just come to the ISC
at Surrey, because the ISC is not just a department,

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.760
it's located in the university so you're not
just having your life in the ISC, you're having

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.720
a Surrey student life as well, so it's like
a combination. It's really good, it's really

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.310
different, it's really unique! I got an opportunity
for Surrey with a Masters degree, I got an

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.570
offer for HR Management and I got this opportunity
and I'm really happy with that. Also I got

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.500
Kings College London for my Masters degree
as well the Leadership and Development, so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.460
I'm going to continue studying abroad. The
staff here are very kind and every time I

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:25.509
have some problems I will send them emails and they will help me to solve them as soon as possible

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.000
The teacher who helps me the
most is our applied maths teacher who is called

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:44.689
Pat. She is my personal tutor and every time
I have problems I will ask her to help me

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:54.159
and she will try her best to solve the problems
for me. I decided on this university because

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.579
Surrey engineering course is in the top 3
in the UK and for the research about communications,

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.739
it's the best in Europe, so that's why I chose Surrey

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.740
I choose UK because my second language

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:19.750
is English, and then the UK has good education and also for

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.440
engineering they have good, high quality engineering
courses in the UK, so that's why I chose it.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.740
I've made a lot of friends in the UK, not
only Chinese also some English as well because

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.239
we take undergraduate modules and so there
are a lot of English students doing the same

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.870
course as well and the university actually
is quite good, they try to not put too many

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.670
Chinese students in the same class so they
make sure you have friends with English and

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.920
European students as well so you don't just
sit with your Chinese friends all the times

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.940
so you can practise your English all the time.
