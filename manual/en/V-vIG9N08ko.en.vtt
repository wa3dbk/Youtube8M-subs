Hello, my name is Jill Phillips, and I'm co-owner
of Squeals on Wheels, a traveling petting

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:09.120
zoo and pony rides.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.660
My name is John Phillips.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.750
We have horses, miniature horses.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.180
We have miniature llamas and alpacas, chickens,
ducks.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.660
We have bearded dragons.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.609

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.560
When pigs from small miniature pig parents
are born, they can actually fit into the size

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.110
of a little teacup, which is where the term
""teacup pig"" comes into play.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.670
They're three to five ounces, some of them,
very teeny.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.350
Pigs will reach their maximum growth at somewhere
between three to four years, sometimes even

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.540
five years.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:58.040
I would say that the average size miniature
pig is under 30 pounds.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.180
Some obviously get very much larger and some
may end up smaller, maybe even under 20 pounds.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.720
Because miniature pigs are so incredibly intelligent,
it's very easy to litter box train them, and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.310
they are easily litter boxed trained within
one to five days.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.950
Little piggies do live ten to fifteen years
of age.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.860
You also need to piggy-proof your home, much
like you would toddler proof your home.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.450
To make sure they can't get into any mischief,
lock up cleaners, toxins.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.240
One thing to note about miniature pigs is
they just don't like to be picked up.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.270
They don't like their little feet in the air.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.159
They don't like to be held up standing.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.450
They really dislike it, and they will squeal.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.200
But personally, I think it's really worth
the effort, because they are a wonderful little

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
pet.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.250
They're intelligent.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.760
You can teach them to do almost anything.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.070
They love to snuggle.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.850
They bond fully with people.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.890
They're very affectionate, and you can teach
them to do about anything.

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.790
You can easily harness train them, and then
the piggy gets to exercise, and you get your

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.090
exercise, and they're a wonderful little addition
to any family.
