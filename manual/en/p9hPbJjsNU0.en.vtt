00:00:01.042 --> 00:00:03.042
 Today I'm taking you with me to my dance studio

00:00:02.426 --> 00:00:04.426
 to practice walking on high heels. Let's go!

00:00:21.718 --> 00:00:23.718
Let's chat for a minute

00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:25.902
 because I like talking

00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:27.755
 so, heels are heels

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.301
 but the truth is that, we've been talking 
 about this last time, we should know

00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:32.011
how to walk on plain sole as well

00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:40.716
The mistakes I've made

00:00:40.653 --> 00:00:42.653
 And still make, I reckon

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.559
 In cases when I don't control myself

00:00:44.551 --> 00:00:46.551
 And my mum always said: "you shouldn't do this this way!"

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.469
 Are these four

00:00:50.324 --> 00:00:52.324
number one

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 Placing your foot from the external site

00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.631
number two

00:00:59.257 --> 00:01:01.257
 Placing your feet on the outside (so grotesque)

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:03.849
 so called plodding

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:05.371
 especially while wearing shoes with too long nose

00:01:06.543 --> 00:01:08.543
number three

00:01:07.811 --> 00:01:09.811
 Pushing out your calves

00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:12.231
 This is the mistake I make commonly

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:14.712
 and my mum keeps repeating

00:01:13.985 --> 00:01:15.985
 "you push your calves out again!" well..

00:01:17.717 --> 00:01:19.717
number four

00:01:19.322 --> 00:01:21.322
 Throwing your feet in forward

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:24.561
 How to eliminate mentioned mistakes?

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.428
 It's easy!

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:28.748
 Control the way you place your feet

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:31.568
 and the position of your calves

00:01:31.982 --> 00:01:33.982
 and that's the whole philosophy!

00:01:36.558 --> 00:01:39.558
Attention!
The responsability for your health, both phisical and mental, while 
 doing exercises presented on the movie is on you!

00:01:59.894 --> 00:02:01.890
Hi! Perfect!

00:02:01.592 --> 00:02:03.590
Today we are in ballet room!

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.150
 I have ballet bars at my disposal

00:02:13.757 --> 00:02:15.760
 and mirrors from each side

00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.580
 to control my body and position of my legs and feet

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:24.830
 As I am in a ballet room

00:02:24.231 --> 00:02:26.230
 I thought 

00:02:26.557 --> 00:02:28.560
 I might use ballet bars

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:29.470
 because when I practice at home

00:02:29.038 --> 00:02:31.040
 I use chairs because I don't have my own bars

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:35.320
 so, grab a chair and let's start!

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:42.900
OK, let's pass on to the workout

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.150
 my ways on how to improve our heels walk

00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:45.580
 and eliminate the common mistakes we make

00:02:50.476 --> 00:02:52.480
number one

00:02:52.627 --> 00:02:54.630
 Feel comfortable

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:56.070
 Put on some sport suit, anything that makes you feel comfy

00:03:00.102 --> 00:03:02.100
number two

00:03:00.801 --> 00:03:02.800
 Play your favourite music, be carefull with your neighbours

00:03:04.823 --> 00:03:07.820
 *Let's throw a party like in Ecuador Manieczki 
 (name of a popular disco club in Poland)*

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:09.790
 *I'll play some Kalwi&amp;amp;Remi and there will be a bass attack*

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:14.300
number three

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.830
 Feel yourself into music

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.060
 close your eyes

00:03:16.801 --> 00:03:18.800
 and relax for a minute with your fav beat

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.880
number four

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:26.370
 Bend your knees

00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:28.140
 bounce a little bit to warm them up

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.590
 don't straighten!

00:03:32.642 --> 00:03:34.640
number five

00:03:33.878 --> 00:03:35.880
 Hips

00:03:34.792 --> 00:03:36.790
 All the time keep your knees bended

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:38.500
 we move our hips to the right, to the left

00:03:37.177 --> 00:03:39.180
to the right, left, right, left, all the time

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:44.040
number six

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:45.140
 Let's try rumba step

00:03:44.661 --> 00:03:46.660
 that warms up well our ankles and hips

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.980
number seven

00:03:51.128 --> 00:03:53.130
 add more and more hips untill you'll get to cuban rumba ;)

00:03:56.538 --> 00:03:58.540
number eight

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.960
 Stand in front of the chair, grab its back

00:04:00.132 --> 00:04:02.130
 If you have ballet bars - even better, why not

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.090
 and we lift up on ballet releve

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.470
attention!

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.590
 NEVER place your body weight on the external site of a foot!

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.830
 ALWAYS place your body weight on big hallux

00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:21.580
 again: the whole body weight is on our halluxes!

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:23.100
 it's very important!

00:04:22.378 --> 00:04:24.380
 because then it doesn't bend our ankles outside 

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:27.090
 what leads to ankle twist

00:04:30.623 --> 00:04:32.620
number nine

00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:33.970
 Let the bar go of and try to 
 walk a few meter up on toes

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:35.880
 remember about bending your knees and relaxing your hips

00:04:37.762 --> 00:04:39.760
 try to walk on your room controling all of the 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.620
 toes, calves, feet, hips and knees

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.710
*oh gosh....*

00:04:46.845 --> 00:04:48.840
number ten

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:50.200
 put on high heels and try all of the points on heels!

00:04:53.116 --> 00:04:55.120
 And?

00:04:53.865 --> 00:04:55.860
 Did it work out?

00:04:55.002 --> 00:04:57.000
 Now we should repeat on and on this workout

00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:59.860
 all the time

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.230
 to succeed and walk like the best models in the world

00:05:10.042 --> 00:05:12.040
it's not over yet!
