Paris, France. 1968
CO.PI.T.O. Files

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.517
Smoking with Pete

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.471
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:31.472 --> 00:00:35.073
Welcome to a new telecast
of ‘Smoking with Pete’.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.867
Tonight we’re smoking cigarettes

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:48.365
with high Bavarian tar content.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:21.087
Welcome to the Optional TV
Parainformative Command’s web page.

00:01:21.088 --> 00:01:22.659
Copito!

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.650
The first phase of our action plan
will be launched from here.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.317
We will unveil great secrets
that have until now remained hidden

00:01:31.317 --> 00:01:36.388
under seven locks in the arches
of the darkest TV top dogs.

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:40.269
We will disclose what the television
put aside, so that the spectator

00:01:40.269 --> 00:01:42.124
decides what’s worth watching.

00:01:42.225 --> 00:01:45.197
Like in an all-you-can-eat restaurant,
we’ll display all the dishes

00:01:45.198 --> 00:01:49.392
for each to choose his own meal,
without anyone to tell what to eat.

00:01:49.432 --> 00:01:50.944
Here’s the question:

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.016
Until today, you didn’t know about
the existence of a great amount

00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:58.514
of TV programmes
which were never before broadcasted.

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:02.748
Were they gross rubbish? Nobody wanted them
and so they were filed away?

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:05.660
They threatened the established order?
Is it only excuses?

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.729
Lies?

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.828
Sacco?
Or Vanzetti?

00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:11.034
We strive against the current

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:12.475
Like the salmon,

00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:14.249
We climb to the top

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.600
Like the goat,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.717
We fear not Hercules,

00:02:17.717 --> 00:02:19.047
Nor Samson,

00:02:19.047 --> 00:02:21.446
For we stand loyal to Co.PI.T.O.’s oath.

00:02:21.447 --> 00:02:23.867
Backed by a worldwide collaborators’ net

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:27.162
we have trespassed
the forbidden gates

00:02:27.162 --> 00:02:27.867
of television studios

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:29.308
to get hold of the material

00:02:29.308 --> 00:02:35.548
we are making available to you,
our fervent followers.

00:02:35.548 --> 00:02:39.792
Though chased we may be,
though run away we must and for ever hide,

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.141
our mission will not cease.

00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:44.701
And there where a lie is revealed,

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.646
where a mask is falling down,

00:02:46.646 --> 00:02:49.499
or a secret is unveiled,

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.342
somebody will raise
his eyes to the horizon...

00:02:52.342 --> 00:02:58.692
and fill the sky
with the avenging shout... Copito!

00:03:07.463 --> 00:03:08.269
Clothes, clothes...

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.381
Remember,

00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:31.169
here we’ll stand, firm and ready
after the truth.

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:35.513
Copito!

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.949
Fabulous…

00:05:30.013 --> 00:05:32.281
Ah, a perfect bouquet!

00:05:33.002 --> 00:05:36.096
And that’s all for tonight, my dear friends.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:43.480
We’ll be back next week
with a new broadcast of ‘Smoking with Pete’,

00:05:44.305 --> 00:05:50.554
to smoke a cigarette that’s 100% nicotine,
and no tobacco.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.987
Good night.
