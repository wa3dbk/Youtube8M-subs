00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Unfinished (X JAPAN)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Lyrics)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Wipe your tears from your eyes.
Just leave and forget me.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.000
No need to be hurt anymore.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Go away from me now.
I don't know. "what is love ?"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
No need to be hurt anymore.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You said "I miss you so much―
―Every night thinking of you and facing loneliness"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But when you feel sadness
never can I stay with you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I'm not the one you need.
Close your eyes and forget me.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
There's nothing I cad do anymore.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I lost my way.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Piano Solo)

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(Lyrics)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I've been walking in the night of tears.
There I found someone was holding you.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:28.000
As the night was all falling down.
With my love also vanished my vision of you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
My heart is cold now.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Wipe your tears from your eyes.
Just leave and forget me.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
No need to be hurt anymore.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You said "I need you always―
―Every day thinking of you and living loneliness"

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But when you feel sadness
never can I stay with you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Go away from me now.
I don't know. "what is love ?"

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:41.000
No need to be hurt anymore.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Can't find my way
