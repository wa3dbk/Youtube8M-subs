Hey photography friend, Its me again Michael Zelbel.

00:00:04.401 --> 00:00:11.336
In my little video I have shown you how I am using the cutter with shower curtain

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:17.627
in order to simulate soft box which enable me to shoot body scapes of my friend Lincy,

00:00:17.627 --> 00:00:20.509
if you haven’t seen the video, go back to my website, watch it,

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.911
click the video and its worth watching.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:27.200
And I want to shoot one additional film,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.117
one additional set with little twit to the scene .

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:36.842
I want to shoot this area of her body and I want to have some back light coming

00:00:36.842 --> 00:00:42.895
between her legs just enough light to give some lineation to give some idea about how

00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:49.992
to shape over there and for back light using this little thing,

00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:58.417
of course I got it standing over her from another shoot and so I am just going to use it.

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:05.015
It’s a speed light as well so I will set it to slave and it’s got a little soft box on top,

00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:09.121
since the light is coming from behind and should shoot the lineation so I don’t need to

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:12.308
fix soft box over there, you know it would be good but

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:18.712
I will just have to put it over here.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:23.802
We will just attach it like this so it comes from low angle using a multi climp

00:01:23.802 --> 00:01:26.657
so put this thing over here to multi climp.

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:30.682
So I am going to put it some where over there so its coming between her legs

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:34.257
and hope that’s a good effect Let’s see, let’s try it out.

00:01:34.468 --> 00:01:48.679
[Musical interlude]

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:54.269
Okay, this ends our quick little video on art on the body scaping shooting.

00:01:54.784 --> 00:02:01.972
I hope you find it useful and I wish you a lot of fun and a good light

00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:03.956
and I hope to see you soon.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:06.653
and I hope to see you soon.
