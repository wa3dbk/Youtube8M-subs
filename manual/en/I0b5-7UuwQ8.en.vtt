00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.890
Let's do a little bit of
practice dividing rational

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.105
numbers, or another
way to think about

00:00:05.105 --> 00:00:06.860
it, dividing fractions.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.039
Same thing.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.210
So we have part A.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.160
Well, number 1.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.560
Find the multiplicative inverse

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.840
of each of the following.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.290
Now, all that means is if I
have some number a, its

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.370
inverse is going to be 1/a.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.580
When I take a number and
I multiply it by its

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.940
multiplicative inverse, I'm
going to get a/a, which is

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:30.120
equal to 1.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.410
So a times its multiplicative
inverse is going to be 1.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.390
So let's do these

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.160
problems. So part A.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.600
We have 100.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.460
So the multiplicative
inverse of that is

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.130
just going to be 1/100.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.810
And if you multiplied that
times that, you'd get 1.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.730
Part B.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.040
I'll do all of these.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.950
We have 2/8.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.530
The inverse of 2/8 is 1 over
2/8, which is the same thing--

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.320
this is equal to 1 times
the inverse of this.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.960
Times 8/2, which is the
same thing as 4.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.380
Now immediately, you might
see something.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.760
I guess, you see
a pattern here.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.430
If I take 1 over a fraction,
the result is

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.930
the fraction swapped.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.950
So the inverse of 2/8 is 8/2.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.640
You just swap the numerator
and the denominator.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.150
So let's apply that to part C.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.840
If I have negative 19/21, its
inverse is just going to be

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.570
you swap the numerator
and the denominator.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.720
Negative 21/19.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.690
And if you were to multiply
these two numbers,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.270
you would get 1.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.470
The negatives would
cancel out.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.100
The 21 and the 21 would cancel
out, the 19 and the 19 would

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.380
cancel out.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.600
Part D.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.980
The inverse of 7,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.610
multiplicative inverse, is 1/7.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.060
And then finally, let's do E.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.000
So the inverse of-- so they give
us z to the third over--

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.880
so it's negative z to the third
over 2xy to the third.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.150
So the multiplicative inverse
of that-- one of the harder

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.630
words for me to say-- is just
going to be equal to-- so

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.700
that's the inverse-- is going
to be 1 over this, which is

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.210
just going to be negative.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.180
The denominator becomes
the numerator.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.080
2y to the third over z cubed.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.190
Now let's go to this
next section.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.610
Divide the following
rational numbers.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.400
Be sure that your answer
is in simplest form.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.650
So I'm just going to do every
other one of these problems,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.010
just so that I don't use
up all of your time.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.195
So let's do this first
one: part A.

00:02:46.195 --> 00:02:47.890
Well, I'll do it over here.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.170
Part A.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.000
5/2 divided by 1/4.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.010
This is the same thing
as 5/2 times 4/1.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.920
You divide by something is the
same thing as multiplying by

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.310
its inverse.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.580
So I'm multiplying by
the inverse of 1/4.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.670
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, we could divide the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.160
numerator and denominator by 2,
so the 4 becomes a 2, the 2

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.360
becomes a 1.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.130
5 times 2 is 10/1,
So it's just 10.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.050
Part B.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.440
Or let me do every other one.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.500
C.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.300
5/11 divided by 6/7.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.580
Once again, this is the same
thing as 5/11 times the

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.235
inverse of 6/7, so times 7/6.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.720
And so we get, this is 5
times 7 is 35 over 66.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.270
And that's in lowest common
form or simplified form.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.040
So E.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.030
Let's do E.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.440
E, we have negative x over
2 divided by 5 over 7.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.770
Once again, this is the same
thing as negative x over 2

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:26.470
times 7/5, which is equal
to negative 7x over 10.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.390
Think you're getting
the hang of it.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.050
Let's do part G here.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:41.410
We have a negative 1/3 divided
by negative 3/5.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.100
Well, this is going to be the
same thing as negative 1/3

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.650
times the inverse of this,
times negative 5/3.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.600
I just swapped the numerator
and the denominator.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.030
So this is going to be equal
to-- the negatives cancel out.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.160
A negative times a negative
is a positive.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.860
1 times 5 is 5.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.540
3 times 3 is 9.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.490
Let's do one more.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.550
Let's do I.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.740
Part I.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.790
11 divided by negative x/4.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:18.050
Once again, this is the
same thing as 11 times

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.010
the inverse of this.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.600
The multiplicative inverse of
it, times negative 4/x.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.860
And if this confuses you--
actually, I shouldn't write

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:27.690
multiplying.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.665
That looks just like an x.

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:30.590
I should say this the
same thing as 11

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.810
times negative 4/x.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.180
Or you could view this as 11
over 1 times-- you could even

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.750
view it as negative 4/x, which
is equal to minus 44/x, or

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.360
negative 44/x.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.340
Let's do this last problem
right here.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:57.850
The world's largest trench
digger, Bagger 288, moves at

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:00.360
3/8 miles per hour.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.590
So its speed, or its velocity,
or its rate is equal to 3/8

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.620
miles per hour.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.870
We could write it like this.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.010
How long will it take to dig
a trench 2/3 miles long?

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:25.180
So we want to go a distance
that's equal to 2/3 miles.

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.590
So we just remember that
distance is always going to be

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.710
equal to rate times time.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.760
So our distance is 2/3 miles.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:48.260
That's going to be equal to our
rate, 3/8 miles per hour,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.800
times our time.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.200
Or we could divide both sides
by 3/8 miles per hour, so if

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.030
we divide both sides by
3/8 miles per hour,

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.850
we'll get our time.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.661
So divide by 3/8
miles per hour.

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:14.100
Divide by 3/8 miles per hour.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.630
This cancels out.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:19.510
So time, we're going to get
time is equal to this.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.103
So we have 2/3 miles.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:26.430
Let me write it this way.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:32.150
2/3 miles divided by
3/8 miles per hour.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.580
Or another way to think of it,
that's the same thing as times

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:45.270
the inverse, times 8/3
hours per mile.

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.400
I just took the inverse
of this.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.450
We divided by this.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.920
That's the same thing as
multiplying by its inverse.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.310
And we inverted the
units as well.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.350
And so we'll see that the
units cancel out.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.920
Mile in the numerator, mile
in the denominator.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.360
We're left with hours.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.000
And so this is equal to 2 times
8 is 16 over 3 times 3,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.250
9, 16/9 hours.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:16.810
So like an hour and 7/9, or
1 and 7/9 hours to dig

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.020
the 2/3 of a mile.
