Hi, my name is Dave Andrews, today I'm going
to show you how to change file type associations

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:15.210
in Windows XP. To begin let's go to the computer,
and on my desktop I'm going to create just

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:28.050
a simple text file. If I open up this text
document, I've typed some text, you notice

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.620
that it's opened up using notepad, let's save
my text, and we want to change that to open

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.860
up with Word pad. To do so, click on the start
bar down at the very bottom, and we want to

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:54.040
select my computer. From here, go to tools,
and select folder options. And we want to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.280
go to the file types tab. What this is doing
is loading in all of the file types that my

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.719
computer supports as well as the programs
that run them. The one that we want to change

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:15.479
is TXT for text file. So find TXT in that
list and select it. As you can see, it now

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.549
opens with notepad and we want to change that
to open up with Word pad. So click the change

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:33.939
button, and select Word pad. Now press okay.
This is changed to open with Word pad. Close

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:41.359
out of that dialogue and close my computer
and open up the new text document. As you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.899
can see it is no longer opened up automatically
with Notepad, but instead has opened up with

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:55.659
the Word pad editor. It's that easy to change
how your file types open in Windows XP. My

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.599
name is Dave Andrews, and I've just showed
you how to change file associations in Windows

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.099
XP.
