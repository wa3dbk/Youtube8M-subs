00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.700
Okay, we will need three strips to start our
braided rug. And we'll probably be using about

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:15.339
four or five pairs of old jeans in order to
make one decent sized little area rug. Now

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:22.119
when you are making your jean strips, jeans
come in all different colors of blue jean.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:28.230
So you want to think about that and use that
as your design elements. Some very light colored

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.770
jeans can add a nice look. You can mix them
up with a dark color. Or you can just have

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.300
one braid of just light and work that into
the center. And the next pair use a very dark

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.920
so that you have a dark outline on a white.
So you want to think about that. While you

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.640
are cutting your strips, you can sort them
as to how you want to use them. Next we are

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.660
going to put our three strips together. And
you'll need to secure that for the beginning.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.559
You'll need to secure that. And you just take
with a needle and thread and do a few stitches

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.870
there. Now one thing you want to make sure
is that your three strips when you start are

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:18.330
not the same size. Okay? You don't want them
to all end at the same time. Because when

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.350
a strip ends, we are going to add another
piece to it and there will be a bulky section.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.380
So we'll be adding a piece like this and so
it will be doubled over for a little while

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.430
and so it will be a real bulky section. So
you don't want all three strips to end at

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.370
the same point and then we'll have one big
huge bulky section. You want them to end at

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.010
different times. So here I have a short one.
And I will be joining another one. And then

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:54.700
as I go down, I just want to make sure that
these also do not end at the same time. Another

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.040
thing that you want to prepare before we start
our braiding, is if you have ripped the jeans

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:08.469
like I have in many places, there's a lot
of extra strings here. So you want to trim

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:13.900
out these extra strings because what will
happen is as you're braiding, they'll just

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:19.760
get very tangled up and you'll have difficulty
with the braiding. So just go through and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.739
any of this excess strings, you want to get
rid off. Just snip them out. Now when you

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.090
cut the strips, you don't end up with all
of these, all of these strings.
