00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.020
good

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.550
hi guys. so i wanted to introduce 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.870
this new project I'm working on 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.910
so... it's made for keyboardists

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.800
what do you have here ? it's a...

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.160
this little Casio

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.300
Casio Privia keyboard

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.500
what it does is... 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.440
it has a dozen instruments or so

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.220
electric piano, pipe organ

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.200
strings, bass... whatever.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.900
we don't have many
instruments on this keyboard

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.740
and, what I wanted

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.430
to achieve with this

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.930
is bringing more instruments

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.090
more features

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040
and bringing all your new instruments

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.280
just on a USB stick

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.950
and so you can extend the keyboard with as many functionalities

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.360
as you want

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
so le'ts...

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:57.140
[mumbling]

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.800
so here we just have the classic piano

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.680
we do have other instruments

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.920
some organ

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.040
and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.250
a few others

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.560
electric piano

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.800
and it's still very plain

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.740
after a few minutes, you're done, you've tried everything you could

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.640
so, now instead of this, we will use the

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.920
USB connection

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.420
and send MIDI signals

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.120
and this device will take the relay

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.040
so it will take the MIDI signals

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.560
to synthesize new sounds

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.560
you don't need your computer, all you need is just this device

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.000
if you have new instruments (*sf2), you can just copy them on a stick 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.880
so it will sound...

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:59.600
more like this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.960
this is actually the synthesizer

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.880
 this sound is not

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.200
available

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.400
on this keyboard when you buy it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.880
it's just new instruments

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.930
so using this, you just

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.010
turn the wheel, let's say

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.640
and it will show you which instrument you are using

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.289
so, we have some electric piano, we have, what do we have ?

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.212
ah yes, we have beats, for example

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.030
so imagine this, on this very classic piano

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.030
you cannot get this, for example

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.960
so you get beats, drums

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.799
you also get pads 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.700
typically, this is just

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.820
some kind of instrument you can achieve by downloading a file and plug it into it

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.760
so now, I have downloaded some other soundfonts

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.640
i just put them on my USB stick

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.080
and there you'll need to come in closer

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.400
so I just plug in

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.560
see we have 'MEM-021 (Atmosphear...)'  - that's my preset

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.320
if I just come and plug my USB stick

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.440
now it's loading the instruments

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.080
 and we have some

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.560
voices instead

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.200
it's played directly from USB

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.560
and of course you can browse the USB stick

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.880
and maybe find something more interesting

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.440
maybe you're gonna have some Moog sounds

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.120
I don't know if you can hear from the video, but

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.740
this is totally different from what you get usually

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.280
from this piano

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.109
some bass...

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.700
and let's try a Mellotron

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.860
ok

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.260
so you get the idea, now

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.150
for now we have USB connection

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.759
hotplug

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.479
In the future we'll have live recording too

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.499
and then, there's some features to come

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.960
come with the networking features

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.640
I will make another video for that
