Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.420
Today we are going to show you how to change
the door closing cam on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.460
Its really easy job, all we are going to need
is a 5/16th nut driver and Philips screw driver.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.380
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.970
In preparation for this repair there are two
things we want to do, first of all we will

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.551
empty the shelves on the door, because we
are going to end up removing this door to

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:26.420
do the repair, and secondly we will turn the
refrigerator off, so that we don’t have

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.189
fans running while the door is off.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:41.170
Next we need to remove the cover for the top
hinge, it’s a one Philips screw holding

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.790
that in place.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:01:30.490
Next we will remove the two 5/16th hex head
screws that hold the top hinge in place.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.759
Next we will lift the door off and put it
on a suitable work surface, so that we can

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.240
change the cam on the bottom.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:49.189
Now with the door on a solid work surface,
our next step will be to remove the screw

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.329
that holds the cam to the bottom of the door.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:01.759
But first thing we will do is we will loosen
the center screw of the door stop, and will

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:19.111
remove the screw that is closest to the corner,
pivot the door stop out of the way and remove

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:22.000
the bottom door closing cam.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.700
You should supply the new one into place.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:47.980
Reinsert the 5/16th hex head screw.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.990
Before we tighten it we’ll want to make
sure that it aligns up perfectly with the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:04.570
recessed hole in the bottom of the door and
tighten those two screws.

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.020
Now we are ready to reinstall the door.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.170
Now that we’ve replaced the parts, we are
ready to reinstall the door on the refrigerator.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:23.550
Set the door on the lower hinge pin; rotate
it into place at the gasket hole right there.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:40.040
Set the top hinge into the door, locate the
holes for the two 5/16 hex head screws.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:58.290
And start those by hand; we won’t tighten
these up completely until we check the alignment

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.500
of the door.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.940
Make sure the gap is even top to bottom between
the freezer and fresh food door and leveled

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.300
across the top.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:20.430
Now that we have an even spacing from all
the side, tighten those two screws up firmly,

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:36.010
we are ready to reinstall the hinge cover.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:50.930
Check the operation of the door and our repair
is complete.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.790
And that’s how easy it was to change the
door close cam on your refrigerator.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.439
Thanks for watching, good luck with your repair.
