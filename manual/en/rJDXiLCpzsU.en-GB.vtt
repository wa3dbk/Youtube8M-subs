Top 5 Features of Windows 10 – Should you
upgrade?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.440
With the release of Windows 10 fast approaching
and many people wondering why they should

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.520
upgrade, here are the top 5 features of the
newest operating system from Microsoft.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.810
Number 1:
Cortana.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.630
Windows 10 is bringing Microsoft’s own voice
assistant to desktops, laptops and almost

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.140
anything running Windows. Cleverly placed
on the taskbar, Cortana will always be within

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.789
reach to give you fast access to information,
reminders and provide quick recommendations.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.420
You can trigger it by saying “hey Cortana”
or by typing into the search pane. Although

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.559
it’s just a small addition to the os, Cortana
will help to make Windows quicker, cleaner

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.210
and more user-friendly.
Number 2:

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.019
Snap Assist
Now, I don’t know about you, but whenever

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.429
I’m using my laptop I almost always have
2 or more windows open. Whether it’s Spotify,

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:57.829
google chrome or just a word document, multitasking
is a huge part of how I use Windows 8. Luckily,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.601
with Windows 10, Microsoft has made it even
easier to just snap two, 3 or even 4 windows

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:07.650
together side-by-side. The snap assist feature
has different configurations for all of your

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.800
open windows, including apps from the store,
and even recommends layouts for specific apps.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.000
Number 3:
Start Menu

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.751
Windows 8’s full screen start menu was hated
by most and scarcely used. Thankfully, in

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:22.960
Windows 10, gone are the clunky tiles and
instead, you get a start menu similar to windows

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.900
7 but updated and combined with elements of
the metro UI. To the left there are lists

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.421
and pop out menus for frequently used programs
and options. To the right you see the windows

00:01:32.421 --> 00:01:37.430
8 style tiles that can be dragged and resized.
In fact, the whole start menu can be made

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.760
bigger or smaller, depending on how you use
it.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.890
Number 4:
Virtual Desktops

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.180
Something that people have been asking for
is the ability to have multiple desktops on

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.490
Windows. Instead of having dozens of mixed-up
windows all together, you can now put some

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.271
of them on separate virtual desktops and move
between them quickly. This is useful if you

00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.159
have projects that can’t be mixed up or
if you need different setups for different

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.730
programs.
Number 5:

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.780
It’s free. If you upgrade to Windows 10
from 7 or 8, within the first year of launch,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.360
it’s absolutely free. With previous versions
of Windows costing up to £200, Windows 10’s

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.140
price tag of nothing is an extremely good
deal and even if none of the other features

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.410
interest you, this alone should make you upgrade.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.110
There are plenty more new features in this
new OS and I couldn’t include them all.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.230
For the gamers out there, you’ll be pleased
to hear that Microsoft is adding brand new

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.930
integration with the Xbox One. Much like remote
play on the PS4, Xbox One gamers can now play

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.580
their Xbox on their windows 10 pc, laptop
or tablet. There’s also full messaging support,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.170
and a feed that shows you what everyone on
your friend’s lists are doing. For the people

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.870
who get a ton of notifications, Windows 10
has a new action center which is very similar

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.870
to the notifications panel on Windows Phone
8.1.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.950
So, if you’re still on the fence about getting
windows 10, don’t be. 10 is what windows

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.709
8 should have been so when it finally drops
sometime this month, be sure to get it.

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:50.790
