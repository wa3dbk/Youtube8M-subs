00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.500
[3D LiDAR]

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.100
[The Key to Smarter Everything]

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:15.466
There are these vacuuming robots that currently run around folks’ houses.

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:19.566
And they actually have to interact with obstacles

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.033
and figure out where they are.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:27.000
With 3D LiDAR, the robot would accurately map the inside of the house,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.933
know where all the obstacles
are without having to run into them.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.800
[LiDAR = Light + Radar]

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.100
LiDAR is a camera or device
that allows it to measure distances.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.300
It emits a laser, and that laser beam
impinges on some object in the distance

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.566
and then our sensors detect the returned laser pulse.

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:52.967
It’s called time of flight.

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:58.733
So we know accurately how long
light takes to get from point A to point B,

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:04.366
and what our cameras do is
measure that round trip to accurately project

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:09.500
a distance and give that information back to a computer.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.466
3D LiDAR would also be able to
look at the scene at various times,

00:01:15.466 --> 00:01:20.200
detect changes and make sure that if something
moves it could tell how far it’s moved

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.733
and update its own programming
to not run into those objects.

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.166
Our technology allows robots
to now see in 3D.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:33.366
These robots will actually have the ability
to think for themselves,

00:01:33.366 --> 00:01:38.634
make decisions about their environment, and then affect that environment in a positive way.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:44.533
So that’s a big leap from a 2D or our current situations where everything is programmed

00:01:44.533 --> 00:01:47.134
in a static environment for the robot.

00:01:47.134 --> 00:01:50.300
This technology is in its infancy.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.700
We have just begun to scratch the
surface of what its applications are.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.533
Self-driving cars is just one
of a number of applications for 3D LiDAR.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.633
You can stack cars together.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:04.234
Meaning that you can move more cars
through an area much faster,

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:08.466
and since the cars have the ability to talk to each other, they can move as one.

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:12.233
You have large convoys of cars moving through an area

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:15.733
and nobody has to guess
what the car in front of it is going to do.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:20.400
We’re at the forefront of bringing
this to a number of applications

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.900
that will make life on Earth better for everybody.
