00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.560
Chip evacuation and process security

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.760
can make or break your production
efficiency.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.880
Reaching superior levels of
reliability,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.320
with the tool life predictability
needed

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.360
for secure and trouble-free
production processes,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.600
CoroMill QD is changing the game for
milling grooves.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.120
The cutters are equipped with
internal coolant

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.280
and geometries developed for secure
and productive milling.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.000
For long overhangs,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.800
SilentTools dampened adaptors
take care of vibration.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.760
CoroMill QD - your solution for
clean, high-quality grooves.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.400
In heavy roughing operations,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.440
predictable tool life is critical

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.360
to facilitate production planning

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.280
and prevent tool breakage.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.560
The CoroMill Plura heavy duty end
mills

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.160
are developed for removing a lot of
metal in a short amount of time,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.120
while bringing your workshop the
reliability needed

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.360
for demanding roughing.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.480
With proven endurance,
this is your first choice

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.120
for roughing with solid end mills.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.640
The new heavy duty end mill thrives
when being pushed.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.760
and often reaches its best
performance

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.520
with high cutting parameters,

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.360
making it a chip eater to rely on.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.440
Imagine reducing lead times to the
extent

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.320
that a complete component is
finished in one week,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.120
or even a couple of days,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.960
from order to delivery.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.040
With know-how being an increasingly
scarce resource,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.600
acquiring the latest solutions is of
critical importance

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.440
to stay ahead in the transforming
gear manufacturing landscape.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.000
The software InvoMilling 1.0 is
the next step

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.880
in shortening lead times
for gear production.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760
The software only takes a few hours
to learn.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.120
Then you are set to change
the programming

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.120
when machining different gears,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.960
removing the need for a specific tool
for each gear profile.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.360
This reduces component delivery time
to a matter of days.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.400
InvoMilling - agile gear
manufacturing.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.800
