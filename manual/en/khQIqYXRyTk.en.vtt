00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.900
Let's say you what a VW Golf GTI or a Jaguar
XFR or even a Porsche Cayenne Turbo.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.390
But you'd like to turn their performance all
the way up to eleven.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.119
Well that's why you can get a Golf GTI Performance
Pack, a Jaguar XFR S and even a Porsche Cayenne

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.170
Turbo S.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.000
However, are these highly-tuned models really
worth the extra cash?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.210
To find out, I'm going to be comparing them
on track with their standard versions.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.390
In this video we have the Jaguar XFR-S up
against the normal XFR.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:46.210
The standard Jaguar XFR has a 5 litre supercharged
engine with 503bhp and 625Nm of torque.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.960
It can do 0-62mph in 4.9 seconds before reaching
an electronically limited top speed of 155mph.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.880
It costs £65,380.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:08.740
The XFR-S costs an extra £14,615, but for
that you get an extra 39bhp and 55Nm torque.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.899
0-62 falls to 4.6 seconds and you can reach
a top speed of 186mph.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:21.000
It also gets a louder exhaust, tweaked gearbox,
stiffer chassis and firmer suspension.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.959
Does all this make the standard XFR feel lacking
when you get out on track?

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.049
Lovely V8 noise, gearbox has a relatively
smooth shift.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.959
Coming down to second here, you can feel that
the car is relatively soft for a performance

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:45.899
car but it changes direction well.

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.079
Bit of understeer there but you're only a
throttle press away from dialling in some

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.079
oversteer.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.109
110mph now, hard on the brakes, down to 3rd,
down to 2nd.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.380
Lots of torque but 2nd is needed here, just
there a bit of wheelspin.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.349
When the car is loaded there's a bit of twist
and you need to make sure the unloaded wheel

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.650
doesn't sin up.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.010
You can feel a little cherup as the rear wheel
starts to light up.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.220
It's a constant battle managing traction to
extract the lap time.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.361
You can drive this car really sideways- it's
got a lovely light feel to it.

00:02:28.361 --> 00:02:34.390
It's such an engaging chassis but to get a
lap time you have to manage the oversteer.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.600
Quite hard work through that high-speed change
of direction.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.780
Round the corner, to 3rd, more wheelspin.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.040
Trying to keep it neat really.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000
Trying not to have the car sliding or losing
traction.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.750
And across the line.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.550
The standard XFR completed the flying lap
in 01:14:30.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.560
Can the XFR-S go any quicker?

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:12.620
The first thing you notice is that you can
feel the extra power but it's not night-and-day

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.620
difference.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.840
As soon as you come to a corner you can feel
the difference.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.510
There's so much torque, so when there's a
long corner and the standard car's having

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.920
a bit of understeer that moves into oversteer,
wheras this one's just planted.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:35.460
There are a lot of physical changes to this
car, you can really feel it - it's so much

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.530
tauter than the standard car.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.390
When it transitions into oversteer the diff
is so much better - it's smooth rather than

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.650
spinning the unloaded wheel.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.069
There's more feel in the steering too.

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.380
When it oversteers it's really smooth and
it's a much tauter car than the standard XFR.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:08.840
It's still quite an oversteer-y muscle car,
don't get em wrong, but it's a much different

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.540
feel to the standard car.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.489
Everything's honed, tight down, sharper -makes
the standard XFR feel like a stocky executive

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.530
saloon, a testament to this car.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.080
And across the line.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.909
The Jaguar XFR-S was 1.6 secs quicker than
the standard XFR - but is it worth the extra

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:30.909
money?

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.830
If you rate driving pleasure above all else,
then the answer is yes.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.249
With its completely re-worked suspension and
unique diff, the XFR-S feels like a completely

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.639
different car.
