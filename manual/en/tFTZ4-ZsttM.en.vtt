Hi I'm Emily Tatak from the Wilton Test Kitchen and today I'm here to show you how to create

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:06.053
an ombre affect

00:00:06.053 --> 00:00:08.053
with buttercream

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.414
to create an ombre you need a few tools

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:12.414
I've got some paper towels,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.213
I've got five bowls or however many shades you want

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:17.213
of buttercream divided out

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.794
I've got five clean spatulas, one for each color

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.393
I've got a lot of toothpicks on hand

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.994
and I've got my icing color which today is going to be violet

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.713
so when I like to create ombre I like to start with the darkest color

00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:32.400
and then work my way up

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.713
which in this case will be white

00:00:34.713 --> 00:00:36.713
so I'm going to start over here

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:38.713
with my darkest color like I said

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.234
and using a clean toothpick I'm just going to dip into the icing color

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.694
and run it through my buttercream

00:00:46.214 --> 00:00:48.214
so to get your darkest color

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.373
you're probably going to have to add more than one toothpick of color

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.713
so don't feel like you have to get it all in one shot

00:00:58.353 --> 00:01:00.353
and when you add additional icing color

00:01:00.373 --> 00:01:02.373
like for instance that is just too light

00:01:02.373 --> 00:01:04.373
to be my darkest color

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.854
so to add more icing color

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:08.854
I'll take a new toothpick

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.074
and again run it in my icing color

00:01:13.107 --> 00:01:15.107
and get a good amount in my icing

00:01:15.253 --> 00:01:17.253
I'm just going to keep doing this

00:01:17.514 --> 00:01:19.514
until I reach my desired shade

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.674
and you want to use a new toothpick every time

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.493
because you don't want to contaminate your icing color

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.594
with buttercream, or royal, or whatever your coloring

00:01:28.594 --> 00:01:31.593
so always have a lot of toothpicks on hand

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.893
so I'm going to keep coloring and adding, it's getting darker as you can see

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:38.893
but it's still not at the shade that I want

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.414
so I'm going to take a second and add more icing color

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:44.414
and once I get this color done 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.568
I'm going to add less and less to create the lighter shades

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.334
and there we have it, I've got my five shades of violet all

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:17.334
ready to go from dark to light

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.874
and buttercream really isn't the only thing that you can do ombre in

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.874
that's what's so fun about it

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.254
like this cake here, and this cake here, we did ombre in fondant

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:28.434
and all you do is the same kind of technique

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:30.633
you just keep adding an icing color

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:32.713
until you get that desired shade

00:02:32.753 --> 00:02:34.753
and if you want something really different

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:36.895
and go with the naked cake trend

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:39.974
you can even dye your cake layers like we did here

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.081
and have an ombre effect on the cake layers

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.853
but just remember to start with a white cake base

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.794
that way the color is very vibrant and really obvious

00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:50.794
and that way it doens't get diluted

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:52.794
so for more inspiration and tips

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:54.794
