00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:11.019
In this video, you can learn some epic dance
moves you can do with your fingers.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.100
Hey what's up YouTube?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.190
This is El Tiro.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.470
You're tuned in to Tutorial Thursday, where
you'll learn epic new dance move to add to

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.010
your freestyle or choreography.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.340
Today, we're learning three awesome finger,
digit or hand moves.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.340
Let's get started.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.500
So the first one is actually a simple wave
with your digits across your hands, looks

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.500
like this.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.570
You can send a reverse.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.370
You can even do build up so you can go whoop!

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.320
Dancing with your fingers is really all about
concentration and focus.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.490
So if you're going to start like one hand
at a time and really slowly, you can start

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.579
with your pinky, and move to whatever that
finger is called and you move to your middle

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:51.890
finger and then you go to your pointer and
your thumb.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.899
So really slow, you kind of want to work that
out.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.790
And then, what might help too is actually
you go from closed to open with each finger

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.320
and you try in that order, and then you close
in that order too.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.090
So I'm opening and I'm closing.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.130
I'm just trying to get in order.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.130
So when you start to do that, you cannot get
an open and close in the order just like that.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.750
Make sure you are ambidextrous, meaning you
can do it in both fingers and hands.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.530
You should be able to do forward and backwards.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.280
So I'm going open (oops!), open and close.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
And I'm also doing a reverse.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.499
And if this is hard for you, I would go really
slow.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.249
Now once you're getting this, this seems pretty
easy.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:40.729
Even right here, I mean if this is really
easy too, you can even use this concept to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:41.889
like do moves.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:46.989
So don't take it for what it is, use it to
explore and create moves.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:51.880
So once you start to get that, then we can
kind of get some hand motions together.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.139
Now I'm kind of waving and opening at the
same time, or I can do a throw across just

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:57.149
like that.

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.789
it only looks cool if you do it in the right
order versus that's lame.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.990
So I can put my head in between.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.270
I can go lots of different moves there.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.819
And then you break it down to your knuckles
and you can go and do that wave nice and tight

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.640
just like a caterpillar.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.739
So the next one, we're going to put our hands
right in front of our face like this or you

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:25.909
can go out like that.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:31.709
And I'm going to now do some pushing and waving
to make it look kind of float like a jellyfish

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:32.709
or something.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.069
So I'm going out, my pinkies, I'm pushing,
I have a nice little float motion to go with

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.069
it.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.780
So if I was going to do this in an actual
move, maybe I would like wave together and

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.450
I would start low and I would kind of go around
and float this up in the air.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.079
And then my third move, I'm going to do kind
of like magic pop up.

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:01.551
Hands are going to be like this and I'm going
to go one, and I'm going to go (blow) let

00:03:01.551 --> 00:03:04.120
me rewind that for you.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.370
Ok, it looks like this, hands right here,
I'm going to go head nod, and I'm going to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.370
go, bam!

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.370
See that?

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.370
quick switch.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.390
Make sure, you're paying close attention.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.090
So that quick switch has to be timed, and
you can put that back in your pocket.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.040
So I'm going huh!

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.599
Here, pop!

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:31.659
Switch back, end
So those are three really fun and easy but

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.829
super creative dance move you can do just
using your hands and fingers.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:42.709
I dare you to use it in your freestyle, send
to me on Instagram @brambilabong.

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:43.870
And wait, don't go.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.180
