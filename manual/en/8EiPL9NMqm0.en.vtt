Hi! I am Shelly Cordsen with Expert Village.com.
We have now sewn our borders onto our quilt

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.380
and if you have not figured it out yet in
all my segments, you will see different samples

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.230
which will definitely give you different fabric
ideas and for instance this is the only one

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.860
where I did the center and used it as a border.
So have fun with your choices. All our borders

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.610
on this and this equal and this and this equal.
So now I have a squared up quilt. We are now

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.219
going to sandwich it getting it ready for
machine quilting. Backing, you will need one

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:51.859
yard 36 by your width of fabric WOF 44 wide.
We are going to lie that on our table and

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.829
this is where we needed our tape. You are
going to tape it down. If your quilt is bigger

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.719
than your table, use your kitchen floor or
you can use your carpet if you want to. This

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.670
is just a real soft cuddly quilt and I am
just going to tape my four corners down like

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.410
that. Batting; you need a batting about 44
x 36 and I again like to use low loft batting.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.530
There are even some battings out there that
are flame retardant for baby quilts if you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.020
would like to purchase even that. So we are
going to just spread that out real nice, there

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.030
is some spray adhesives that you can buy on
the market, spray on your batting and it will

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:45.049
stick and not shift. I prefer not to use that
just because I, I donâ€™t know may be I am

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.920
lazy I just like the soft feel without any
glue but most of your glues are washable.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.330
Okay, we are going to center our top on here,
make sure I have a little bit of give on each

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.170
side underneath you can see that and now we
are going to pin it down and get it ready,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.460
get it nice and smooth, this is another place
a lot of people use spray washable glue. We

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.280
will use safety pins. The safety pins I prefer
as you can see have a little curve to them,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.900
it just makes it easier for you to pin it
in and out. So because you have a hard surface

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:33.260
you can just dig that pin in and pin. Places
your pins all through the quilt just avoiding

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.849
the seams because that is where you will be
doing your machine quilting.
