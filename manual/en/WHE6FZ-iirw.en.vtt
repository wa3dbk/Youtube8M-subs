Hi I'm Tony Newton with Expert Village and
today we are going to talk about composing

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:18.980
on the piano, writing songs and using chords.
Okay this is basically a very emotional and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:26.020
soul searching and treasure hunting we call
it cause what you are trying to do is a very

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:38.410
exploration and experimental. So basically
when there is a couple of ways but you hear

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.260
what is in your head then you try to duplicate
that in your keyboard. Which is longer process

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.420
but if you have study your harmonies you would
know how to do it but if you are just sitting

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:59.260
down you are not familiar with those. If you
just experiment with chords you know you just

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:11.240
just go try to find one chord that you like
lets say we like this chord here so once you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:27.130
have one chord then find another chord that
works with that one.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:40.110
Okay so I have 3 chords here or is it 4 ,1,2,3,4.
Let's say think of going up, going down, going

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:53.350
sideways, that was going up right, let's go
down A major minor. Okay so that is going

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.090
down so let's see if we can make something
else go jump around.
