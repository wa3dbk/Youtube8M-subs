Jason Montanari, I've been with Mustang for
five years now.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.780
I went for a hike the other day at the Quabbin
Reservoir.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.170
We were coming up from the Enfield Lookout

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.540
and there was a group of Harleys up there

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.630
and I'd say a good three out of the five had
Mustang Seats on 'em,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.020
so me and my mother went up to check out our
seats on the bikes

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.800
and was quickly approached by one of the bikers.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.180
He wasn't too happy that I was standing next
to his bike.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.519
But after telling him where I worked and why
I was looking at his bike

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.059
he almost turned into a little kid:

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.360
Jumpin' up and down, he had this grin on his
face,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.470
just talking back and forth. . .

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.549
Just thank goodness for Mustang saving my
life.

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:49.549
[laughs]

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.611
&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: So what did you say? Like,
can I help you?

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:53.510
&gt;&gt;JASON: Yeah, can I help you, he said,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.260
uh, can I help you is there a reason you're

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.260
near our bikes?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.320
And I said, Yeah, I just like to check out
our product.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.070
And usually don't get to see it on motorcycles
like that,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.850
and it kinda brought a smile to his face.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.720
And to mine because I'm still here.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720
[laughter]

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.070
&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: Did he know the factory was
nearby?

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.390
&gt;&gt;JASON: No, he thought it was out of Connecticut

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.310
cause of our boxes and they say right on it,
Connecticut

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.140
so he didn't expect one of us to be right
around that little area.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.570
&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: And you told him what you do
here?

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.170
&gt;&gt;JASON: Yes ma'am. I told him my brother's
a builder

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.909
and I build the driver back rests and the
sissy bar pads

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.939
so it's pretty much on the whole setup of
things.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:32.939
&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: And your parents?

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.229
&gt;&gt;JASON: And my parents both ride. They both
have Mustang Seats.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.150
It was a very, very, very cool experience
to see something like that

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.979
rather than just to see 'em go out the door
every day,

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.979
to see it firsthand.

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.770
&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: So you were friends by the
end of the conversation?

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.259
&gt;&gt;JASON: Yes! Quite, quite. We were that close
to exchanging numbers.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:52.259
[laughter]

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380
&gt;&gt;INTERVIEWER: Well thanks for sharing that!

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.109
&gt;&gt;JASON: Absolutely!
