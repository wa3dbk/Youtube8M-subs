00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:13.179
My name is John Rosselli, I'm
the Interim Program Director

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.079
for the Nurse Educator Program.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.860
Nurse educators are
registered nurses

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.230
who teach either in a faculty
setting, such as a nursing

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.241
education program, or in
a professional development

00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:31.621
setting, such as a hospital or a
clinic, or something like that.

00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:33.592
A typical day is
vast and varied.

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:35.462
Oftentimes, we spend
most of our time

00:00:35.462 --> 00:00:38.382
preparing for and
teaching courses.

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.963
And preparation might be
creating exams, creating

00:00:41.963 --> 00:00:45.323
the lecture for the day,
student learning activities.

00:00:45.323 --> 00:00:48.434
We also grade papers,
projects, and exams.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:53.114
We also look at our curriculum
that we use and we evaluate it.

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:55.335
We make certain it's up to date.

00:00:55.335 --> 00:00:57.975
In a professional
development setting,

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.125
they're responsible
for making certain

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:06.486
that they teach the nurses
their annual certification

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:09.487
requirements, the day-to-day
professional development

00:01:09.487 --> 00:01:10.007
classes.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.277
And oftentimes, they're
not only training nurses,

00:01:12.277 --> 00:01:14.857
they may be training
ancillary staff.

00:01:14.857 --> 00:01:17.978
They could be training
the janitorial staff

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:21.658
on infection control, they could
be training physicians as well.

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:26.169
A student who enters in and
completes a nurse educator

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.799
program learns many
different skills,

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.027
such as curriculum
design and evaluation.

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:34.860
They learn a lot about
the role of the nurse

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.441
educator in a professional
development setting

00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:39.311
and in a faculty role.

00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:42.101
They also learn the teaching
and learning process,

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.862
teaching strategies that
help facilitate learning,

00:01:44.862 --> 00:01:49.112
and learning strategies
that help learners learn

00:01:49.112 --> 00:01:50.472
more efficiently.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:53.943
Nurse educators also learn
how to educate students

00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:57.143
in the clinical setting,
in the laboratory setting,

00:01:57.143 --> 00:01:59.374
and in the simulation
experiences.

00:01:59.374 --> 00:02:01.684
As a nurse educator,
oftentimes you

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:05.304
have the opportunity to
continue in practice.

00:02:05.304 --> 00:02:08.404
When you continue in practice,
you are most up to date,

00:02:08.404 --> 00:02:12.415
and you are able to help your
students learn the most up

00:02:12.415 --> 00:02:16.216
to date skill sets, the
most up to date equipment,

00:02:16.216 --> 00:02:21.639
and that ensures patient safety
and positive patient outcomes.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.097
I think it's
important for students

00:02:23.097 --> 00:02:26.847
to have mentors within
a nurse educator program

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:31.668
because, oftentimes, what we
think will work, what we've

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:35.449
been taught will work, may
not work in all instances.

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.879
But having a mentor that you
can call upon to run things by,

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.040
run the strategies by, this
is what I did in class today

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.896
and it bombed.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.770
Can you help me understand
why and what can I

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.300
do to make certain
it's better next time?

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.831
A mentor's very
important for that.

00:02:50.831 --> 00:02:54.331
So when students do
well in a project

00:02:54.331 --> 00:02:58.692
or they do well in a course,
and they demonstrate gratitude

00:02:58.692 --> 00:03:02.752
for having learned so much
in just one semester, that's

00:03:02.752 --> 00:03:05.023
very gratifying,
that's very rewarding.

00:03:05.023 --> 00:03:07.163
It's also nice to
see them graduate

00:03:07.163 --> 00:03:10.964
at the end of a program
and become colleagues.

00:03:10.964 --> 00:03:15.474
Nurse educators play a valuable
role in teaching nurses

00:03:15.474 --> 00:03:19.615
not only the skills of nursing
and all the competencies,

00:03:19.615 --> 00:03:21.795
but they're also gate
keepers for making sure

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:24.295
that the public remains safe.
