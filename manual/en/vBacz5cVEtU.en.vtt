00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.560
Back in 2005 I sent a copy of Answers
to Your Bible Version Questions to one

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.900
of the fathers of the modern Creation
Science movement, Dr. Henry Morris.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.090
I wrote to him about how important
it was when he came to my Bible

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.590
college in the 1980s, and said
some words that changed my life.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.870
He said something like this:

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:36.750
"If you cannot believe Genesis 1-11,
how can you believe John 3:16?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.340
If you cannot believe that death
came by the one man Adam,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.930
how can you believe that life
came by the second Adam,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.220
the Lord Jesus Christ?"

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.550
Oh, my professors ridiculed him.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.210
But those words never left me.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.850
So I wrote it to him,
when I sent him the book.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.250
On May 20, Dr. Morris
wrote me a letter back!

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.190
He totally surprised me!
in part of his note he said this:

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.510
"But I especially enjoyed reading
Answers to Your

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.470
Bible Version Questions.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.500
I have a whole shelf of books on
the 'King James Only' movement,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.510
but I think yours is the best,
with the most impressive evidences."

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.280
And he invited my family to come
visit him in Santee near San Diego

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.560
at the Creation Science Museum!

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.350
So on June 1st, 2005,
my family and I did just that!

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.570
We didn't even know that Dr. Morris
was just recovering from pneumonia.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.060
He asked his son, Dr. John Morris,
the president of ICR, the Institute

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.260
for Creation Research, to give us
a personal tour of the museum.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.520
After that we took them to lunch.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.810
During that time Dr. John entertained
my kids and my wife,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.959
and I got to talk to Dr. Henry.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.239
And while we were there,
he focused on one issue:

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.170
the issue of the King James Bible.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.540
It turns out that some people from
Wycliffe-SIL,

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.560
the Summer Institute of Linguistics,
had really shaken his faith

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.049
about the idea that
God had preserved His words.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.379
He said that he wanted me
to come back, just myself,

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.779
to spend the day with him,
so we could go back and forth,

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:44.169
spend a whole day together, and
answer some really tough questions,

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:47.870
and then he wanted me
to speak to his staff at ICR, about

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.829
why I believed that the King James
Bible was God's preserved words

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:54.169
in English.

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.430
I told him I would.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.870
But during the time that I was
preparing, on February 25, 2006,

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.019
Dr. Henry Morris
graduated into eternity.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:14.569
I never got to give him
the answers to his questions.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.569
When I was looking through
his articles that he had written

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.379
over the years, I found one
that he had written the month

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.599
before we contacted each other,
in April of 2005.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.650
In it
I was startled to find these quotes:

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.269
"But all translations, including
even the King James are imperfect."

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.849
Dr. Morris continued:

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.439
"But did not God say that
He would preserve all His pure words,

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:46.780
and do so forever?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.680
If so, many would ask, where is it?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.000
Where can we read these
perfectly preserved words?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.159
Well, God has clearly answered
this good question!

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.109
'For ever,
O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven'

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.930
(Psalm 119:89)."

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.390
Are God's words only preserved
in heaven?

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.650
Hi, I'm David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:30.030
Dr. Morris seems to have written
the article before he read my book.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.680
But regardless, I would still
love to answer his questions.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.560
Here's what I would have told Dr.
Henry Morris, his son Dr. John Morris,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.650
and the staff at ICR.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.370
I'd like to take a step back and
use some of Dr. Morris's own words,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.790
and answer those questions one by one:

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.350
He said:
"...did not God say that He

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.430
would preserve all His pure words,
and do so forever?

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.470
If so, many would ask, where is it?

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.150
Where can we read these
perfectly preserved words?"

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.000
Even a pagan knows that
God's words are preserved in heaven.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.060
He would reason, That's God's domain!

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.260
Why wouldn't they be settled in heaven?

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:30.340
The miracle would be
if they were settled in earth.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:37.430
So think about these words
that were said by God the Son,

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.400
the Lord Jesus Christ.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.660
Listen to His words.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.880
Matthew 6:10.

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.860
You can even quote it with me:
"Thy kingdom come.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:58.060
Thy will be done in earth,
as it is in heaven."

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.890
Everyone knows that
God's will is done in heaven.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:10.710
The miracle would be
if God's will were done in earth.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.360
God holds us accountable for
His words.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.820
Not in heaven,
but in earth, today,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.150
where we live, on this planet.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.780
Jesus also said,
in Matthew 24:35,

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:37.700
"Heaven and earth shall pass away,
but my words shall not pass away."

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:44.750
For God to keep His promise
to preserve His words,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:50.360
they have to be right here, in earth.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.050
So his next question, "...where is it?"
that's easily answered.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:04.510
Look for a people, and a place,
where the kind of person God exalts

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.900
as His kind of person is in action.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.790
Look for somebody who is persecuted,
who is unjustly treated,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.480
though he lives for righteousness,
and sheds his blood when necessary,

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.280
to preserve God's words,
and to keep the Gospel going.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.180
And then look at the Bible they read.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:36.160
I'll give you a hint:
Persecuting Rome loves the wrong one!

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.870
That's one reason why
I put my faith in the 400+ years

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:47.880
tried, tested and proved
King James Bible,

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.660
God's preserved words in English.

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:56.919
Faith in these words
bears that kind of fruit.

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:58.889
God did promise
to preserve His words.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:02.180
And God did keep them,
in the King James Bible in English,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.460
for us.

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.800
Why would God hold us
accountable for His exact words,

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:14.790
If He did not give us His exact words?

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.469
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
