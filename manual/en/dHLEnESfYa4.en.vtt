Hello everyone this is Sandra with the DisneyCarToys
channel and today we are going to be

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:06.980
playing with this Barbie castle playset.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.320
And of course because I am building a castle
for

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.990
Barbie I had to invite the Disney Princess
Magic Clip dolls and they are the perfect

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.990
size for

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.990
this castle.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.380
This castle is based of the Barbie DVD Barbie
Mariposa and the Princess Fairy.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.380
I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.970
am actually really impressed with this playset
because there is a lot of fun features, there

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.970
is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.579
a little area for a dance floor for two dolls
there is even like a little flying contraction

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:31.579
at the

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.600
top where they can fly like real fairies,
there is a bedroom with two beds for both

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.600
dolls that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.030
come with this set and a little dining room
too.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.134
Well here is everything that comes with this

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:46.920
set it come with a ton of pieces of furniture,
two dolls and a big castle to build, I will

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.920
start

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.920
building.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.950
Ta da here is the castle and it is like even
cooler then I thought it would be and it

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.971
was pretty easy to build too first I want
to show you the dance floor the dolls can

00:00:57.971 --> 00:00:58.971
be

00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:02.040
removed and they have their own stands so
they can stand up on their own which is super

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040
helpful.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.990
This purple butterfly fairy is Cantinia from
the movie and then the pink on is

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.250
Mariposa.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.760
Lets get them spinning I mean this is really
cool I mean everything works really

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.350
well with this so they are spinning and dancing,
I really like it, if you check out their

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.180
butterfly wings they looks really pretty.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.090
So Mariposa has true butterfly looking wings

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.610
where cantinia looks more like fairy wings
and when you slide this little jewel back

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.610
and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.320
forth, not only does the dance floor move
but this little spinning thing at the top

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.320
of the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.320
castle moves too.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.690
So let me see if the Magic Clip dolls fit
and they do I just clipped in

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.950
Princess Aurora and then I will get Cinderella
and they just kind of clip in at the top of

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.950
their

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.030
dress there.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.340
And lets have them spin and wow they hold
on very well, this is really cool

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.240
because it is really hard to find a Magic
Clip doll castle they are really expensive

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.240
but this is a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.799
really good alternative, so lets have them
fly woo.

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:01.799
And woo look at the air fairies, I wish I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.370
had Wendy from Peter Pan it would be perfect
for this.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.220
And now if I go down from the top

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.519
of the tower and I go to the second floor
which is the bedroom here I have Elsa and

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:13.519
Ann

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:14.829
sharing a bedroom here and one thing I want
to show you which is actually really cool

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:20.129
about this set is it actually fits Anna and
Elsa really well we have a blue one for Elsa

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.129
and

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.340
they are the right size for them too.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400
And then this pink one for Anna and one thing
that is

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.440
kind of nifty about it is the pillow is shaped
like flower just like her dress in Frozen

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.440
Fever.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.050
And this balcony on the outside kind of reminds
me of Elsa’s ice castle when she is singing

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.040
let it go out the balcony.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.439
This is purple though but pretty similar.

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.989
The bedroom pretty much

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.870
has it all there is a vanity with a mirror
and a butterfly chair and there is a brush

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.870
that Anna

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.530
can hold in her hand so she can style her
hair before coronation day.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.530
Plus there is a night

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.170
stand which is similar to what you might see
in Barbie’s dream house because the pieces

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.489
actually sticks in the night stand so that
they don’t fall out.

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.739
Now lets move onto the first

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.680
floor I have Belle and Ariel eating at the
table and Ariel is sitting at this cute little

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.680
butterfly

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.859
chair the dolls sit really well in these chairs,
which is amazing.

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.049
And the table comes with a

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.260
nice butterfly wing shaped chandelier.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.969
And the table just like the Barbie Dream House
toys

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.219
comes with cupcakes and teacups for a tea
party.

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.799
Everything is butterfly themed here so we

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:33.059
have a butterfly chandelier here and behind
that we have a picture of the two Barbie dolls

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.180
and of course a dance floor to the right.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.400
And check it out the French doors do open
to the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.470
outside.

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.269
This is seriously the coolest castle I have
ever seen that you can use your magic clip

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:45.269
dolls.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.850
