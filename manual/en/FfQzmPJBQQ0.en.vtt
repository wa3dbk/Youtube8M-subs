00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.810
This video is brought to you by Sailrite.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:10.000
In this video we will demonstrate the Lift-The-Dot
Eyelet Type Base installation using the Pres-n-Snap

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.540
Lift the Dot Eyelet Type Base die set.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.000
Sailrite stocks two types of studs for various
fabric assembly thicknesses.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.220
The Lift-The-Dot Long is for fabric assembly
thicknesses up to 11/64” (about 8 layers

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.230
or less of canvas) while the other stud is
for thicknesses up to 1/8” (about 6 layers

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.430
or less of canvas).

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.110
Installation of this fastener must be done
with the Pres-n-Snap tool and the Lift the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.810
Dot Eyelet Type Base die set, sold separately.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.610
After installing this die set into the tool
we are ready to install the fastener.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.329
You’ll notice that the Lift the Dot Eyelet
Type Base Washer has a concave side and convex

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.329
side.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.240
The concave side faces down into the die and
the convex side faces up.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.460
The washer is held in place via the rubber
ring.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.899
The stud is held in place only via gravity,
so you must hold the tool as shown here in

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.840
the video to keep the stud from falling out.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.270
Now simply position the fabric assembly where
you want the fastener to be installed and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.350
depress the lever of the tool.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.409
No need to pre-punch a hole in the fabric
assembly, this tool and die set will punch

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.420
a hole in the fabric and set the fastener
all in one simple press of the lever.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.130
The Lift-The-Dot stud is now ready to be fastened
to the socket.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.070
Just push the socket over the stud and it
securely snaps in place.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.029
This fastener locks on all three sides and
will only release on the side with the dot.

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:47.159
Order the Lift-The-Dot Eyelet Type Base fasteners,
the installation tool and the die set from

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.789

it will help save time in installation and

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.060
also attaches the stud more securely in fabric
assemblies than the traditional two prong

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
stud.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.390
