00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.540
O.K, now we're ready to talk about the last
and probably the most important, or second

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.799
most important part of your introduction.
And it's called the thesis statement. Now

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.460
if you've ever written a paper or taken an
English class, you know what a thesis statement

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.779
is. But I like to put it in these terms. The
thesis statement is you telling us what you're

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.599
going to tell us. You're telling us exactly
what the speech is going to be about. So if

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.680
we're going to do a speech on research and
our three body parts are going to include

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.860
reading and finding out all the information
you can, body part one. Talking to people,

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.140
people who've owned the cars, talking to car
dealers, mechanics so forth and so on, body

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.410
part two. And body part three, actually getting
out there and driving those cars and having

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.940
something to compare to. So in your thesis
statement you're going to say, today we're

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.720
talking specifically about researching buying
a new automobile, more specifically the areas

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.540
of information you can read and where you
can find information about that car. Talking

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.100
to different people about the different cars
and actually getting out there and driving

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.390
the cars. And that's going to be real important.
Your first thing in your introduction is what?

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.280
I know you remember, it's your attention getter.
The very last part of the introduction is

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.380
your thesis. That's something that's real
important about speeches and speech writing

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.600
is that you have to constantly tell us, what
you're going to tell us. So you're going to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.140
get our attention. O.K. you've got it. Then
credibility, you've got my attention now tell

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.080
me why I should listen to you. And what qualifies
you to teach me something. After that you

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.310
might have a little bit of filler information,
again filler is maybe a little story, a little

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.909
background information on your topic and then
last you've got this thesis. You're telling

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.579
us what you're going to tell us.
