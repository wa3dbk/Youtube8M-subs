00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.680
Whats up guys the coding beast here.
So today i gonna redo one of my old tutorials

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.770
for steamcmd. So this gonna be about how to
download all the Garry's Mod content you need

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.710
for creating your own server. So first off
you have to go to the steamcmd website. I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.610
will put a link in the description for that.
This tutorial only gonna work for windows

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.300
users so you will have to scroll down until
you find the windows download. Click on it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.300
and it will download a zip file. It takes
a few seconds to download. Open it up and

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.989
before you do anything with that you will
have to go to your computer and find somewhere

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.839
where you want your server to be created.
i choose to do it on my C drive. I made a

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.100
folder called Steam and in there i have a
folder called Garry's Mod and SteamCMD. Open

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.100
up steamcmd or whatever your folder is called
and drag in the steamcmd.exe. Now just open

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.000
up steamcmd and it will start updating. You
can see it's downloading alot of files. This

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
takes about a minute depends on your internet
speed. So it's now done downloading and extracting

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.509
all the files. and now you can see there is
a little field down here where you can type.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.509
So the first thing you have to type in is
login anonymous and it's important that you

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.549
don't do any typos in this else it wont work.
If it ask for a password you probably did

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.409
a typo. So this will connect to the steam
public servers it takes a few seconds to connect.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.409
Let's see. Here we go. Success. So the next
thing you need to type in is force underscore

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.030
install underscore dir make a space and now
you will have to go back to the steamcmd folder

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.470
and find the directory where you want your
server to be installed to. So i choose to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.030
make a Garry's Mod folder here. So now you
go up here. Click on it. Right click and copy

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.030
or Ctrl + C. Go back to steamcmd right click
on the icon go to edit and paste. It's should

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.870
look like this and now just hit enter. And
then the next thing you have to do is type

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.870
in app underscore update and then the id of
the game. Garry's mod have the id 4020 and

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.489
then after that you have to type validate.
So this will take depending on your internet

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.489
speed. it took about 2 yeah 2 hours something
like that. It really depends on your internet

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.430
speed but be prepared on it taking alot of
time. So after that you just have to create

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.549
the bat file and we will do that in the next
tutorial.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.639
So yeah thanks for watching please comment, rate and subscribe.
