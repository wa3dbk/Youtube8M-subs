00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.299
Can you drink beer while bodybuilding?

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:12.040
They say not to operate heavy machinery while
drunk.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.980
That should include weight lifting and body
building machines.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.480
You don’t want to try to lift 500 pounds
on a drunken dare and risk your neck literally.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.650
But what about drinking a beer once in a while?

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.690
Beer is allowed in moderation if you’re
planning for it in your diet.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.240
How so?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.300
Body builders are allowed so many carbs on
a diet with precise ratios of carbohydrates,

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.890
protein, fat and sugar.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.559
You could have a beer if you give up the bread
or rice.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.070
I’ve heard that alcoholics end up with more
body fat.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.440
Alcohol use and abuse leads to a build up
of fat around the abdomen and especially the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.440
liver.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.739
If you drink too much and too often, you’ll
have a fatty stomach no matter how skinny

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.729
the rest of you is.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.930
Hence the term beer belly.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.020
It increases your appetite, while having twice
as many calories per gram as protein.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.120
You’d be better off staying sober and just
having the wings than a beer.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.579
If I eat the wings first, the beer is absorbed
more quickly.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.320
You could join in the party by having lower
proof beer than vodka, and by mixing drinks

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.249
with water to lessen the effect.

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.119
Mixing coke with vodka is double trouble,
since you are mixing pure sugar with pure

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.130
alcohol.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.490
Go for lower alcohol drinks like beer and
wine over vodka and anything that lists its

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.110
proof number.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.240
So one beer is fine, but not a few glasses
of wine.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.189
And you could always go for ginger ale or
sparkling waters that look like alcohol.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.399
Invest in a Soda Stream and make fruit flavored
water that looks like alcoholic beverages.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.700
You’d save money and trips to the store.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.979
And you’d a rowdy crowd at your place.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.310
I’d just be left with those happy to watch
the game sober.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.579
Not sure how many that would be.
