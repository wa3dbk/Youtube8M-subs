00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.099
Now, it is thought that an asteroid slammed
into the Chixulub Crater, in the Yucatan,

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.710
and that sent up this nuclear winter spewing
debris into the atmosphere, blocking out sunlight.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.700
That cooled the planet, killing off the vegetation.
The vegetarian dinosaurs died off. Three quarters

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.100
of the dinos were herbivores. The other one
quarter, the carnivores, had nothing left

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:31.109
to eat, they too died. But that asteroid struck
a gypsum deposit. Gypsum, is actually a hydrated

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.660
sulfate of calcium. When this explosion took
place, it created literally trillions of droplets

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.769
of sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, each acting
as a tiny mirror, reflecting impingent sunlight

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.739
back into space. From the vantage point of
the dinos, that was the worst possible spot

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.949
for that asteroid to have struck. It intensified
that nuclear winter, assuring their demise.

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.499
Now, was that by accident, or by design? I
submit that it's possible that advanced ET

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:06.070
humanoids wanted to jump start humanity on
our planet. At that time, the mammals were

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.540
only little rats going nowhere. And if the
dinos had not died out, this creature right

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.920
here, the dinosauroid, might be the master
of earth today. Because experts say that one

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.320
specific dino, the Stenonychosaurus, the long
clawed dino, who had the largest brain of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.810
any dinosaur for it's size, would have evolved
into possibly an upright standing entity,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.660
with a large brain, perhaps ninety pounds.
Not on earth, but perhaps today on planets

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.050
beyond our solar system. Perhaps this was
prevented by advanced ET's. You ask well how

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.910
could they direct an asteroid to a specific
spot? Again, that's where the time comes in.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.450
We already have the ability to divert an incoming
asteroid. Advanced societies might actually

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.780
be able to guide asteroids to use them as
weapons of war fare, or perhaps, simply to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.020
change the course of evolution on a planet.
Now, lets look at dinosaurs being killed in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.320
this scene from the nineteen forty-eight flick
"Unknown Island" starring Barton Macclane,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.260
and Richard Denning.
