00:00:01.837 --> 00:00:03.637
- [Curtis Smith] A lot of southwestern
gardeners like to grow

00:00:03.637 --> 00:00:06.718
peaches, plums, apricots,
nectarines, cherries,

00:00:06.718 --> 00:00:08.479
plants that are in the stone fruit group,

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:09.997
and these are all plants that are subject

00:00:09.997 --> 00:00:11.756
to the peach tree borer.

00:00:11.756 --> 00:00:12.844
This peach tree is having a problem

00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:14.567
with the borers right now

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:16.284
and you see that it's not doing well.

00:00:16.284 --> 00:00:17.955
If you look at the base of the tree,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:19.091
we'll see the primary damage,

00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.252
we'll see other borer damage

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.965
up and down the trunk of the tree,

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:23.604
but right here at the base of the tree,

00:00:23.604 --> 00:00:25.462
we see the real problem.

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:27.449
When the borer has attacked the tree,

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.890
it will produce a jelly-like sap,

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.992
indicated that there's
borer activity here.

00:00:31.992 --> 00:00:33.505
You can see sap in other
places on the tree,

00:00:33.505 --> 00:00:34.690
but this is the glob that

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.396
really indicates the peach tree borer.

00:00:36.396 --> 00:00:38.644
Even when you don't find the
borer in the jelly-like sap,

00:00:38.644 --> 00:00:40.353
you know there's a problem here,

00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:42.856
so you're gonna need to do
something to control the problem.

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:44.803
Lee Anne Merrill with
M&amp;R Durango Insectary

00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:48.970
is gonna show us an organic
way to deal with this problem.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:52.131
Lee Anne, how can someone deal organically

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:53.682
with peach tree borers?

00:00:53.682 --> 00:00:54.630
- [Lee Anne Merrill] Well, one method of control

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.964
is using insect parasitic nematodes.

00:00:56.964 --> 00:00:58.820
- Nemotodes, is that
like root knot nematodes?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.632
- No, root knot nematodes
are a plant parasite.

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:03.630
These are parasites of insects.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.636
- So they don't bother people?

00:01:04.636 --> 00:01:06.794
- No, or earthworms.

00:01:06.794 --> 00:01:08.588
- So they don't hurt anything
except the bad guys out there?

00:01:08.588 --> 00:01:11.152
- Right, they're very specific
within a range of insects

00:01:11.152 --> 00:01:13.593
as to what they parasitize.

00:01:13.593 --> 00:01:16.437
They're in a styrofoam box
inside the cardboard box.

00:01:16.437 --> 00:01:18.909
That preserves them, because they are a

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.872
perishable, living organism.

00:01:21.872 --> 00:01:26.593
So we'll just unpack the
box. You'll see ice packs.

00:01:26.593 --> 00:01:29.542
These are to keep the
nemotodes cool in transit.

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:31.568
They're very temperature sensitive.

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:35.092
Just remove the sponges and
place them into the water.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:39.036
You're just going to gently
work the sponges in the water

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:42.859
until the nematodes
disperse out of the sponge.

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.179
- So what do we do now?

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.778
- Okay. After you receive them
and you know they're cold,

00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:49.730
you can just leave them
out at room temperature,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.990
I always leave them face down

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.268
so the moisture is next to the nematodes,

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:56.750
for about 15 minutes until
they begin to warm up.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.086
So next, we're going to talk about

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:02.014
the methods of application.
You can either apply

00:02:02.014 --> 00:02:03.971
with a hand watering can.

00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:05.858
You just stir up the nematodes

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.501
and make sure they're well dispersed,

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.148
and pour them around the base of the tree.

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:13.700
Or you can use syringes
if you can find holes

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.556
in the bark where they've tunneled.

00:02:15.556 --> 00:02:19.032
You can just draw the nematodes up,

00:02:19.032 --> 00:02:21.174
and stick the tip in the hole

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.717
in the tree and inject the nematodes.

00:02:24.717 --> 00:02:26.636
Or you can use a backpack sprayer,

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:28.114
a handheld backpack sprayer.

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:31.375
These nematodes can
withstand up to 300 psi.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:34.458
Most of these operate at about 10 to 15.

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:36.450
So, you're safe that way.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.938
You just have to make sure that you remove

00:02:37.938 --> 00:02:40.765
any filters that might be in the nozzle

00:02:40.765 --> 00:02:42.497
and check down inside the tank

00:02:42.497 --> 00:02:44.106
and make sure there are no filters

00:02:44.106 --> 00:02:45.844
where it comes up into the hose.

00:02:45.844 --> 00:02:47.177
- Okay, well let's go do it.

00:02:47.177 --> 00:02:49.699
Let's use the watering can today.

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:52.474
This peach tree's having
some problems with borers.

00:02:52.474 --> 00:02:54.832
- Yeah, I can see that.

00:02:54.832 --> 00:02:55.665
- So, what do we do?

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:59.400
- Well, let's apply nematodes
right around the base.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.549
- Okay. How do we do that?

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:03.289
- We're going to stir up
our resuspended contents

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:06.625
so the nematodes are well mixed,

00:03:06.625 --> 00:03:10.242
and then we're going to pour
them into the watering can,

00:03:10.242 --> 00:03:14.232
and we'll apply them right
around the base of the tree.

00:03:14.232 --> 00:03:17.128
It's important to do your
application in the evening

00:03:17.128 --> 00:03:19.630
or when it's cloudy and
raining like it is now.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.627
- This moisture helps?

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:23.602
- Yeah, it's important
to have damp ground.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.679
It facilitates their movement
down into the soil profile.

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:28.814
- How big an area do you have to wet?

00:03:28.814 --> 00:03:30.013
- Well, I don't want to get too far away

00:03:30.013 --> 00:03:31.739
from the base of the tree in this case,

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.091
because borer larvae are
primarily going to be

00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:37.214
right near the base of the
tree or under the bark.

00:03:37.214 --> 00:03:38.457
- Borers, here it comes!

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.980
- You just go around and
apply fairly quickly.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.580
It doesn't hurt to get the water

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.676
and nematode suspension
right onto the bark.

00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:51.871
These are microscopic,
so some of them will move

00:03:51.871 --> 00:03:56.313
into the areas that have any kind of break

00:03:56.313 --> 00:04:00.341
in the bark or damage, and
get to the larvae that way.

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:02.060
- That was really easy.
Is there anything else

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.790
we need to know, like
when we should do it?

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.481
- Yes, it's important to apply
the nematodes in the evening,

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.786
or on a cool, cloudy, rainy day.

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:11.658
They're susceptible to UV rays,

00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:14.187
so you don't want to apply them
during the heat of the day.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.052
If they dry out, they die.

00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:17.491
- How about temperature?

00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:18.786
- Temperature is very important.

00:04:18.786 --> 00:04:21.086
Soil temperature is the most important.

00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:24.119
These grubs are going to be
at about a one inch depth,

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:26.489
and the nematodes need to
be in soil temperatures

00:04:26.489 --> 00:04:31.200
of at least 50 degrees or
warmer, and preferably under 85.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.860
- Okay, so if people want
to know more about this,

00:04:33.008 --> 00:04:34.340
so you have a website they can check.

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:37.256
- Yes, it's www.goodbug.com.

00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:38.891
- Thank you, Lee Anne.
- You're welcome.
