00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.463
Hey Declan! Can we get some ice cream?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.660
What what what what?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.720
Welcome to the ice cream shop tour!

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.040
This is the awesome set of our music video, Ice Cream Shop.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.260

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.180
or in the description below

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.100
It took over six months to put this set together

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.740
All for our Ice Cream Shop music video

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.040
Isn't it awesome?

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:32.813
We already showed you some of these things in our Ice Cream Shop Tour Part 1

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.300

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.080
[Laughing]

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.450
Look at all the stuff on this shelf!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.820
We got all our glassware from the thrift shop

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.900
This is what they use in a real ice cream shop!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.320
This is for ice cream float. This is for ice cream float.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.180
This is for grande. This is for little grande.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.863
This is for ice cream sundaes.

00:00:57.863 --> 00:00:59.700
This is for little grande! [Laughing]

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.640
These are the things that we got at the dollar store

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.100
Our milk shakes...

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.080
our fat straws...

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.340
our spoons...

00:01:09.478 --> 00:01:11.558
our sprinklers containers...

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.120
and our ice cream cups

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.800
We made a lot of our props too

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:23.785
The inside of the root beer floats and milk shakes are painted

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.080
See?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.680
Look at our awesome ice cream cakes

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.980
Our ice cream cakes stay frozen on our magic cake stands

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.460
Our cakes...

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.640
They're dollar store gift boxes

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.320
We turn them upside down...

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.304
and then we decorated them with frosting that we made with Model Magic

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:02.164
The cherries are Christmas decorations

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.619
They're really cranberries

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.120
These soft serve ice cream cones are bubble containers

00:02:14.422 --> 00:02:16.182
They smell like chocolate

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.080
Ahhh! Ah! AH!

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.860
[Laughing]

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:22.800
Ow!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.980
This is actually a Play Doh toy

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.904
It's so colourful we thought it would make a good prop

00:02:28.904 --> 00:02:33.424
We might show you how it works in another video because it's really cool

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.820
These are real ice cream cones that we bought from the grocery store

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.940
These have been out for over a year... so

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.380
They still look good but I wouldn't eat them

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.780
Gross! A year?!

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.280
[Barfing sounds]

00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:53.631
Look at all the flavours in our ice cream shop!

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.400
Check out Zany Zebra!

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.980
All our tubs of ice cream are empty frosting tubs...

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.680
We made sleeves and labels for them

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.380
And in case we open one up...

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.160
We made some fake ice cream out of Play Doh

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.500
Our 50's diner costumes were made especially for this video

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.140
We'll probably use them again

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.340
We got awesome shoes too!

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.780
Declan's costume was easier. We just had to make the hat

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.520
Our ice cream shop sign took a week to make

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.660
We had to cut out each letter by hand. Twice!

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.700
We used birthday cards to make these cute posters

00:03:41.177 --> 00:03:44.777
Here we framed some lucky money that grandma gave to us

00:03:45.327 --> 00:03:47.087
We drew all these pictures

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.840
Aren't these drawings cute?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.040
All these signs are from our Fairy Bakery

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.569
We repurposed them for our ice cream shop

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.840
Look at all the flavours in my ice cream shop!

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.780
Everyone has a favourite flavour...

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.659
so we made a board where everyone can post theirs

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.560
Do you see Mootoo and Declan's?

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.420
What's your favourite flavour?

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.000
Post it in the comment section below

00:04:15.108 --> 00:04:17.588

No. It looks like this.

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.820
No no. I'm sorry but...

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.860
It looks like THIS!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.140
[Giggling]

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:35.643
