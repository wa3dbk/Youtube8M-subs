00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.801
Hey, everyone!

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.941
Howard Pinsky here back with another Photoshop
tutorial!

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:14.771
If you caught my recent vlogs, you're probably
aware that I'm now living in Los Angeles,

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:16.961
where we just got a ton of rain.

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.761
Well, for most parts of the country it would
just be considered a bit of rain, but California

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.341
definitely needed it.

00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:27.921
To go along with the theme of lovely weather,
let me show you a pretty simple way of adding

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:33.361
raindrops to your images, to make it seem
as though you're looking through a wet window.

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:37.721
The girl in this photo looks like she's thoroughly
enjoying being out in the rain, so we'll keep

00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.521
her out there, while we keep ourselves dry
behind a window.

00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:46.701
Let's begin by creating the brush that will
allow us to paint in the rain drops.

00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:52.321
Grab your Brush Tool, shortcut B, and choose
a standard hard brush from the Brush Picker,

00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:55.381
with the size set to around 70 pixels.

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:59.101
Depending on the size of your image, the size
of your brush may need to be adjusted to get

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.240
the perfect raindrop size.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.300
Now in order to customize the brush, let's
open up the Brush panel, which can be found

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.251
under the Window menu.

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:13.341
In the Brush Tip Shape section, the only option
you'll need to change is Spacing.

00:01:13.341 --> 00:01:19.261
To ensure that the raindrops are not all clumped
together, increase the spacing to 1000%.

00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:25.381
Next, hop into Shape Dynamics, and set the
Size Jitter to around 75%.

00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:29.741
This will randomize the size of the raindrops
as you're painting, so that the drop are not

00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:31.501
all the same size.

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.411
All the other values can remain at 0%.

00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:39.230
Finally, turn on Scattering to allow the raindrops
to scatter across the document when you're

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.781
painting them in.

00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:46.300
Make sure Both Axes is on, and set the Scatter
value to 1000%.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.931
If you'd like more drops as you're painting,
you can turn up the Count a touch.

00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:51.931
Perfect.

00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:53.870
The brush is now ready to go!

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.491
Make sure to create a new layer so that you're
not painting directly on the background image.

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:03.470
As you start brushing on your document, you'll
notice that the raindrops are scattering nicely

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.120
around the image.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.291
Keep brushing until you're happy with the
amount of rain that will be present on the

00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:09.291
window.

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:12.261
I'm going to fill the image with a nice amount
of drops.

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:17.541
Now you may be noticing, as the raindrops
are being added, that they're all very round.

00:02:17.541 --> 00:02:20.331
Of course, this isn't how they would look
in real life.

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:25.682
To randomize the drops even more, let's add
a few filters, but before doing so, you'll

00:02:25.682 --> 00:02:29.361
want to convert the layer into a Smart Object.

00:02:29.361 --> 00:02:33.421
This will allow you to edit those filters
even after they've been added.

00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:38.701
The first filter to be added, will be a Wave
distortion, located under the Filter &gt; Distort

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:39.731
menu.

00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:45.801
For the values, number of generators will
be set to 2, the Wavelengths will be 10 and

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:49.031
200, and the Amplitudes will be 5 and 30.

00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:52.091
Everything else can stay as is.

00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:58.461
When the Wave is applied, the once round raindrops
will start to appear, well, not so round.

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:03.490
Finally, to rough up the edges a touch, a
Ripple filter can be added, again, under the

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.710
Filter &gt; Distort menu.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.221
For these settings, the amount will be -55%,
and the Size set to Large.

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:12.221
Perfect.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.941
So now that the shape of the raindrops is
looking better, it's time to give it an updated

00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:19.971
look, which will be done using Layer Styles.

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:23.571
Double-click on the raindrop layer to open
up your Layer Styles, and the first setting

00:03:23.571 --> 00:03:25.960
you'll want to change is the Fill.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.841
To allow the styles to be seen, and to allow
the raindrops to be transparent, set the Fill

00:03:30.841 --> 00:03:32.991
to 0%.

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:38.541
Make sure you don't adjust the Opacity, as
that will effect the Layer Styles, as well.

00:03:38.541 --> 00:03:42.891
The first Style that will be added, will be
a Bevel and Emboss to give our raindrops the

00:03:42.891 --> 00:03:46.471
depth they need to start looking like raindrops.

00:03:46.471 --> 00:03:51.951
Start by increasing the Depth to 200%, and
the Size to 25 pixels.

00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:57.710
If you're working with larger or smaller raindrops,
these values may need tweaking.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.481
Down below under Shading, turn off Use Global
Light, then set the Angle and Altitude both

00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:05.081
to 60.

00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:09.020
Of course, if you want the light to be coming
from a different direction, you can adjust

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.091
the Angle accordingly.

00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:17.401
Now to give our drops a bit of shine, set
the Gloss Contour to Cone - Inverted, set

00:04:17.401 --> 00:04:23.131
the Highlight Mode's Opacity to 100%, then
change the Shadow Mode to Soft Light, with

00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:26.371
an Opacity of 100%, as well.

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:31.261
The raindrops now have a bit of depth, but
they're still a bit too dark.

00:04:31.261 --> 00:04:36.531
Let's add an Inner Shadow, which will actually
act as a highlight.

00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:41.851
Start by switching the Blend Mode to Soft
Light, with the color set to a pure white,

00:04:41.851 --> 00:04:44.541
and the Opacity set to 100%.

00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:53.001
Next, turn off Global Light, and set the Angle
to -120 degrees, the distance to 20 and the

00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:54.631
Size to 25.

00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:59.181
Finally, set the Contour of the shadow to
Cone.

00:04:59.181 --> 00:05:00.521
That's starting to look a bit better.

00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:04.991
To finish off the Layer Styles, a Drop Shadow
can be added to give the drops a little bit

00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:06.591
more depth.

00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:12.581
Set the Blend Mode to Soft Light, the color
to black, and the Opacity to 100%.

00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:19.871
Next, turn off Global Light, set the Angle
to 60 degrees, the distance to 2, and the

00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:21.321
size to 6.

00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:22.321
Perfect!

00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:27.311
That will do it for the Layer Styles, but
the overall image still doesn't look complete.

00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:31.170
If you were to be focusing on raindrops on
a window, the background would certainly be

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:32.521
blurred out.

00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:33.911
Let's make that happen!

00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:38.071
Select your background image from the Layers
Panel, and before you do anything, convert

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:39.871
the layer into a Smart Object.

00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:44.581
Again, this will allow you to edit any filters
you may add along the way.

00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:48.931
As we're looking to blur out the background,
Gaussian Blur, found under the Filter &gt; Blur

00:05:48.931 --> 00:05:50.921
menu, is our best bet.

00:05:50.921 --> 00:05:56.621
The amount of blur is up to you, but for this
example, 25 pixels should work well.

00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:00.941
Right away, that brings the focus to the raindrops
in the foreground, but there's still more

00:06:00.941 --> 00:06:02.561
we can do.

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.811
With the background image still active, duplicate
it.

00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:13.081
This can quickly be done with Command/Ctrl
+ J. You'll see why it's duplicated in a moment.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:17.781
On this layer, we're going to add a slight
frosted texture to the nonexistent window.

00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:23.221
Within the Filter Gallery, there's a nice
Glass distortion which will work well.

00:06:23.221 --> 00:06:26.991
Head up to the Filter menu, then open the
Filter Gallery.

00:06:26.991 --> 00:06:31.890
Once launched, expand the Distort category,
and choose Glass.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:38.491
For the settings, set the Distortion at 15,
Smoothness at 2, Texture to Frosted, and the

00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:41.521
Scaling to 100%.

00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:45.040
Of course, you can tweak these settings to
your liking.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.420
Once the filter is applied, your window will
now have a frosted look to it.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.640
So why was this filter applied to a duplicated
layer, you may be asking?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.691
Having the frosted texture on a separate layer
will allow you to mask out portions of it

00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:01.161
to make it look like the moisture was rubbed
away.

00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:06.950
Instead of using the Layer Mask for the filters,
you'll want to apply one to the overall layer.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.791
Press the Layer Mask icon at the bottom of
your Layers Panel.

00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:15.261
Now, grab your Brush Tool, and find a nice
rough brush, like the Round Bristle Brush.

00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:19.510
Then with the foreground color set to Black,
paint in the area that you want to hide.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.850
At first, you may not be able to see through,
which you can correct by adding an Adjustment

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.651
Layer right above the previous layer.

00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:33.231
For example, you can add an Exposure Adjustment
Layer, then increase the Gamma slider, which

00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:38.531
will create a nice contrast between the two
layers.

00:07:38.531 --> 00:07:40.201
And that will just about do it!

00:07:40.201 --> 00:07:43.980
If you want to give your images a rainy look,
you now know how it can be done!

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.010
Thanks for watching everyone!
