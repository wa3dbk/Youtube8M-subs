00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Jessica Matthews, Exercise Physiologist: With beach season just a few months away, today we're going to show you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
three great exercises and one stretch to help you sculpt a great butt this summer.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This first exercise we'll get started with to start sculpting that great backside is a quadruped bent-knee hip extension.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I promise it's a lot easier than it sounds.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, today I have Mikaba with me, and as you see, she's in an all-fours position.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Her knees are placed below her hips, and her hands below her shoulders.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, you'll see she's on an exercise mat that's a bit thicker, and this provides some great cushioning for both the hands and the knees.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
To begin this exercise, she'll keep her knees bent and begin to draw her foot up towards the ceiling.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, notice here that she's bracing through the core staying stable here and keeping her hips level.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And she'll go ahead and lower down and she'll repeat a few repetitions on the same side, about eight to 12.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And then she'll repeat on the opposite leg.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, notice here she's not lifting too high. Again, so important to brace through the core and keep the hips level.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, why this exercise has been chosen is because research has found that it's highly effective for working the glutes.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
An ACE research study found that this exercise, which involves no equipment except a mat,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is great for working the gluteus maximus, the gluteus medius, two key muscles that make up the backside,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and also great for working the hamstrings; the backs of the thighs.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This next exercise adds a great new challenge and twist to one of our old favorites.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
As you'll see here, Mikaba's lying flat on her back with the knees bent and feet on the floor.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is a single leg progression of the glute bridge, which adds new challenge and intensity to this exercise.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
To begin the exercise, you'll see here she'll begin to draw her left knee in towards the body and just lightly hold behind the left thigh.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
To initiate the movement, she'll exhale and begin to press her body up off the mat, 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
keeping the shoulders rooted but the hips begin to elevate off the floor.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Form for this exercise is key, so as you notice, Mikaba is taking about a two-second count to lift the body up.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
She's holding at the top for about two seconds, and then slowly lowering down for a count of four.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now, she'll repeat this exercise about eight to 12 repetitions on this side, and then she'll repeat on the opposite.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Now, again, having this single leg variation adds new challenge and variety to this exercise,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and really effectively challenges the glutes, helping you sculpt that great backside.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This next exercise we're now in a standing position and Mikaba's going to demonstrate for us glute activation lunges.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So, here's how she'll do it. She's starting with the feet hip-width apart, and she'll step her left foot over her right,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
stepping out to about 3 o'clock if you think of a clock positioning.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Notice how once she's there she begins to lunge and turns her arms to the left side.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then she'll begin to come up, and she'll repeat repetitions here, about eight to 12 on each side.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, what you'll notice here is with this movement with the arms driving to the left,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
it actually effectively loads the glutes even more so than a traditional lunge.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
What's really important about making sure we activate the glutes is that's what helps to protect our knees

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
when we do things like running, jumping, or walking.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So, great challenging exercise, a new twist to an old favorite, the lunge, and effectively challenges the backside.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Now that we've done three great butt exercises, we're going to show you a stretch to stretch out the entire glute region.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
As you see, Mikaba is lying back on the mat on her back with the knees bent and feet on the floor.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
To start, she'll open her arms out to the sides, creating a letter T shape with the body.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
From there, she'll cross her left ankle over the right knee and enjoy a nice stretch as she opens the left knee up.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
From there, she'll begin to draw the right knee towards the ground and let the left foot come fully in contact with the floor.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Now, notice here she's keeping both of her shoulders rooted into the mat

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and she'll enjoy the stretch for anywhere from about 15 to 30 seconds.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:55.000
She'll then repeat on the opposite side and she can complete two to four sets of this stretch.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
