00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:10.100
Welcome to WildStar.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.000
This is DevSpeak.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.500
This disclaimer absolves me of all responsibility.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.400
Guys, I'm gonna be honest.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.000
I've been waiting for this episode

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.200
my entire life.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.600
It's all I've thought about.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.700
It's warplots.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.600
Warplots are

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.500
massive,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.800
strategic,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.700
glorious,

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.100
80-player PvP matches,

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.600
with giant customizable battle fortresses.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.200
Warplots have seamlessly combined my love
of housing...

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.410
with high stakes, strategic warfare.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.600
Real talk,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.800
I'm a military...

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.910
genius!

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.100
I'm basically George Washington,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.800
General Patton... and...

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.100
Charlemagne.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.800
I take that back...

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm more.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.400
My next match...

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.100
will be my greatest triumph.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.200
I've crafted,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.000
I've looted,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.800
the finest defenses.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.300
I've taken 27 days of PTO.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
For my Warparty, I've gathered...

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.600
literally the 39 finest warriors from my server.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.200
We have matching uniforms.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.700
Prepare yourselves, Flaming Death Knights!

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.200
And I have developed...

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.900
the perfect strategy.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.200
Oh crap, they have robots.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.100
Okay, delta squad will move in force,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.500
capturing resource nodes Tango and Charley,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.800
securing precious nanopak to power

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.060
our rocket launchers.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.000
Meanwhile,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.200
Cavalry Division 6 will whip around the flanks

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
to draw the enemy out,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.400
making way for...

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.900
the Centurions,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.500
led by Corporal Jenningsworth,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.300
sent to disable their precious robot factory.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.500
Jenningsworth?

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.400
The robots!

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.049
They're not powering down!

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.790
Now all this, forces the enemy...

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.900
to make a foolhardy charge upon our front
gate.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.700
But I've placed a furnace,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.800
a laser trap,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.300
and a nuclear power plant

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.200
in the perfect configuration.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.900
It's... impassable.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
Aggghh! They're passing it!

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.500
But they have no idea about my secret weapon.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.840
I've journeyed deep into the bowels of Nexus
to recover

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.000
an unstoppable monster.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.100
Theirs is bigger!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.900
We're all going to die!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.600
Little do they know Sir Galahad has placed

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.349
his deployable land mines perfectly.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.300
One inch to the left!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.500
ONE INCH TO THE LEFT!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.489
Dammit Galahad why did you place it SO FAR
TO THE LEFT?!?!?!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.900
We cannot fail!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.120
Our Warparty rating is UNMATCHED!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.100
WE'RE OVERMATCHED!!!

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.800
FALL BACK TO THE ALAMO!!

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.300
Defend the Power Generators!

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.300
(sighs) You're all useless.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.600
Lieutenant Commander Data, your uniform!

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.400
Why is your belt buckle yellow?!

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.499
KICKED!

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.650
Ok, we're going to need a random mercenary
to finish this.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.600
Oh...

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.600
No.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.700
You are kidding me!

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.000
To take on my unstoppable legions...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Pre-order WildStar now.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.400
And, as always,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.500
reach out to us.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.100
The devs are listening.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.600
KICKED!

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.700
Don't forget to subscribe for more videos.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.500
Private Pile! Your salute is sloppy!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.200
Kicked!

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.600
Ensign Bilsworth! Did you look me in the eye?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.700
Kicked!

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.100
Chief Medical Officer Crusher! Your weapon
is not properly polished!

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.700
Kicked!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.400
Viceroy Wellington! ...uh... I don't like your
face!

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.100
Kicked!

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.000
Admiral Ackbar! Stop being right all the time!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.600
Kicked!
