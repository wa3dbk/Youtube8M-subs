“Drug Residues in Meat”

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.430
One of the reasons we are increasingly
plagued with new superbugs

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.750
is the mass feeding of
antibiotics to farm animals.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.360
As Britain’s chief medical officer
put it in his 2009 annual report:

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.680
“every inappropriate…use [of antibiotics
in] agriculture is potentially signing

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.980
a death warrant for a future patient.”

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.730
Earlier this year, I had the
opportunity to debate

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.800
some of the captains of industry,
like the National Pork Producers Council,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.270
on this dangerous practice of
feeding antibiotics to livestock:

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:41.140
“To ask if there’s a question between
human drug resistance and livestock

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.150
antibiotic use is like asking if there’s
human-induced climate change,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.130
or if there’s a link between
smoking and lung cancer.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.290
There are a few dissenting
industry scientists on one side,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.610
but then basically every
other scientist on the other.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.440
Both opposing camps have
scientists on their side,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.580
but only one really has
science on their side.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.580
One can just look at who’s
on the sides of this debate.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.909
In one corner, you have the
World Health Organization,

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.630
the American Medical Association,
the American Academy of Pediatrics,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.890
the American Public Health Association,
and another 100 medical and public health

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.810
organizations in the country.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.090
On the other side, you have the
National Turkey Federation,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.090
the National Chicken Council,
the Sheep Industry Association,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.550
the National Pork Producers.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.590
It could not be more stark…”

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.730
I’ve always insisted that the reason it’s
dangerous to feed millions of pounds

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.950
of antibiotics to cows, pigs,
and chickens every year—

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.540
in part just to fatten them
faster for slaughter—

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.130
is because this fosters antibiotic
resistance in bacteria that can

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.700
then infect human beings—

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.119
not because there’s a problem
with antibiotic drug residues

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.450
getting into the meat itself.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.689
How wrong I was.

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.550
In a damning report released earlier
this year, the U.S. Inspector General

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.979
slammed the USDA for not
protecting the American public.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.000
As you can see in the
Executive Summary of the report,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.020
one of the public safety issues facing
the United States is the contamination

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.170
of meat with residual drugs,
pesticides, and heavy metals.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.800
These drug and chemical residues then
find their way to our dinner plates.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.750
But in order to safeguard the nation’s
food supply from harmful residue,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.000
the USDA, FDA, and EPA are supposed
to test for these contaminants,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.560
and prevent adulterated meat
from entering the food supply.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.800
But, based on their review, the
Inspector General found that

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.980
the National Residue Program is not
accomplishing its mission of monitoring

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.030
the food supply for harmful residues.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.290
They haven’t even established threshold
values for many dangerous substances,

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.670
which has resulted in contaminated meat
being distributed to consumers.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.820
And then the USDA’s Food
Safety and Inspection Service

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.940
doesn’t even attempt to recall meat
confirmed to have excessive drug residues.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.780
What’s the problem with
not having safety thresholds?

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.810
Well, for example, in 2008, Mexican
authorities rejected a shipment

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.010
of U.S. beef because it contained
excessive levels of copper.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.520
But since we haven’t set a safety level
for copper, it was fine by U.S. standards;

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.080
there weren’t any.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.350
So too dangerous to be sold in Mexico,
but good enough for U.S. consumers.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.340
There are more than a thousand pesticides
approved for use in the United States.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.340
The Environmental Protection Agency
routinely asks the USDA to test

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.980
for pesticides that everyone
agrees has high health risks.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.790
But, for many years now,
they continue to test for

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.370
only one type of pesticide,
out of more than a thousand.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.920
What’s the big deal, though?

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.180
What potential affects could the drugs
and toxic metals in meat have on people?

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.410
Bleeding, ulcers, allergic reactions,
serious nerve damage,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.480
severe inflammation, skin cancers,
internal cancers, jaundice,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.480
kidney failure, neurotoxicity (kills
brain cells), and even death.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.120
Doesn’t cooking destroy the drugs, though?

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.781
No amount of cooking
will destroy residues.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:21.320
In fact, in some cases, heat may actually
break residues down into components

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.560
that are more harmful to consumers.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.420
And then, even when our government
finds these drugs in the meat,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.700
they don’t stop it from
contaminating the food supply.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.540
The inspector general noted a case
where a slaughterhouse found four drugs—

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.840
Ivermectin, Sulfadimethozine,
Florfenicol, and Sulfamethazine—

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.500
yet, released the meat from these
carcasses into the food supply—

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.050
despite the fact that consuming
these drugs could result in

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.600
stomach, nerve, or skin problems.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.370
But the USDA ordered no recall.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.180
Now, the USDA doesn’t actually have
the authority to demand a recall—

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.980
which is a problem in itself.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.650
But they can, at any time,
ask, at least, the company

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.620
to voluntarily recall the meat.

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.000
So when’s the last time they asked a
company to recall their meat due to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.070
illegally high drug residues?

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.401
The USDA hasn’t even asked since 1979.

00:05:16.401 --> 00:05:21.960
And this is not the first time
the USDA has been cited

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.010
for failing to protect the public.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.600
This was exposed 25 years ago by
the National Academy of Sciences.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.800
So what happened?

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.430
What happened in 1984, according
to the Inspector General, is that

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.360
they signed an MOU.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.230
And then, the problem remained
unresolved for the next 25 years.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.370
So, that’s what we’ve
been eating all this time.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.480
So what does the Inspector
General propose now?

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.400
#1 recommendation: start from scratch.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.889
The government needs to reestablish
the National Residue Program

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:04.210
so it can accomplish its mission
of safeguarding the U.S. food supply.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.900
What will be the USDA’s response now?

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.160
Maybe they’ll draw up another memo.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:16.490
In the meanwhile, if we insist on
doing drugs, though our diet,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:21.210
which meat has been found to have
the highest risk for contamination?

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.240
It’s the veal.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.930
Think about how they’re
raised, you know.
