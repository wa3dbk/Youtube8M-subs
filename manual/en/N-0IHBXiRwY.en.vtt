00:00:04.698 --> 00:00:07.989
Misunderstandings and arguments are pretty common in the playground.

00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:12.424
Kids are still developing social skills and learning how to communicate with others.

00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:16.819
Not every incident or disagreement that upsets a student can be defined as bullying.

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:20.670
Sometimes it’s a one-off problem or a genuine misunderstanding.  

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.722
Bullying is different.  

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:28.324
Bullying is a deliberate and repeated abuse of power of one student over another. 

00:00:28.324 --> 00:00:34.515
It can be verbal, physical or psychological abuse that is intended to cause harm.  

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:38.158
Lately there has also been a lot of talk about cyberbullying. 

00:00:38.158 --> 00:00:43.228
This happens through communication technology like email, social networking sites 

00:00:43.228 --> 00:00:48.273
such as MSN, Facebook and of course mobile phones.

00:00:48.273 --> 00:00:53.181
This kind of harassment can be spread very quickly, not just to a child’s own friends, 

00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:57.718
but way beyond the school community to complete strangers.

00:00:57.718 --> 00:01:03.993
It can be devastating and needs to be taken as seriously as any other form of bullying. 

00:01:03.993 --> 00:01:06.579
Bullying is not a problem isolated to school yards. 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.656
It can happen anywhere that kids socialise, including online. 

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:15.829
It’s a community issue which is why parents have such an important role to play 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.781
in resolving this kind of negative and very damaging behaviour.

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:24.131
Unfortunately parents often don’t hear about their child’s problems 

00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:26.470
until the issue has really escalated

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.996
and their child has been repeatedly harassed and hurt.

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:36.521
If your child is not one to talk openly, and many teenagers have trouble expressing themselves in this way, 

00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.286
some of the signs that may indicate there is a problem are:

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:44.433
Sudden physical pain – like stomach aches or head aches that keep them from school.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:49.031
Finding it difficult to get out of bed or not wanting to go to school at all.

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:52.793
A change in their demeanour – are they more withdrawn than usual?

00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:55.588
Do they look stressed or really miserable?

00:01:55.588 --> 00:01:57.860
Are they much angrier than normal? 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.256
Is your child having trouble containing their emotions?

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:04.783
Or perhaps you’ve noticed a sudden decline in academic performance. 

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:10.048
I think the best advice I can give is trust your instincts.  

00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:12.605
You know your child best. 

00:02:12.605 --> 00:02:14.558
If you feel that there’s been a change in your child, 

00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:21.033
that lasts for more than a week make sure you follow it up.
