00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.130
So, you're thinking about investing in metals like Gold and Silver. Like any 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.440
smart investor, 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.999
you do your homework. 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.759
You look at the financial pages. You visit a
few websites. And it's not long before

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:20.130
you realize that in one very important way,

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.050
investing in Precious Metals

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.699
it's like hearing a teenager on the telephone.

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.089
It has has a language all of its own

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.480
In precious metals an ounce isn't a normal ounce, 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.660
"ask" isn't a question,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.469
and "Spot"

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.840
isn't a dog in a children's book.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.200
Let's go over some basic terms and what
they mean to you as an investor.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.340
The first word you'll want to know is "spot".

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.010
The spot price of Gold is the current
real time

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.910
price as set by supply and demand in the global
financial markets.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.290
Tied to the spot price is the "bid" and
the "ask" prices.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.870
Bid and ask mean pretty much the same
thing in Precious Metals

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.930
as they mean for any stock on any
exchange

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.420
The "bid" is the price that the financial
markets will pay to buy the raw metal at 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.350
any given time.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.450
The "ask"

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.870
is the price the will sell it for.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.229
Most of us can't buy precious metals at
the spot price,

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.039
because the spot price doesn't include
what it costs to manufacture 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.730
and distribute an item.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.380
The price most of us pay for Precious Metals includes what's called a Premium. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.310
Before you make any investment in Gold or Silver, 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.590
you should know how much 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.120
of a "premium over spot" you're paying.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.450
The calculation is simple. 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.370
In a one ounce product, 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.369
the most popular size, 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.730
you simply take the price of the item and subtract the "spot ask price." 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.060
This tells you the premium over spot.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.190
Premiums over spot will vary depending on any number of factors. 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.330
Bullion products that are manufactured by refiners generally have a lower premium

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.090
than government-issued coins, even though both may 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.080
have the exact same weight and purity. 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.310
Rare coins have higher premiums, 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.109
mainly based on what's called 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:09.799
"Numismatic value."

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:13.099
Numismatic value is determined by scarcity

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.200
quality, demand and other intangible factors. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.489
In short, the price you pay for a Precious Metals product is the spot 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.759
price plus the premium. 

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:25.829
Simple? 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.669
Yes. But we're not done yet. 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:32.620
Other terms you need to know explain the Precious Metal product's "weight" and "purity."

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.269
The traditional measurement for the weight of Precious Metals is the troy ounce. 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.659
The troy ounce is not the same ounce you see on a kitchen scale. 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.529
The troy ounce is actually about one point one standard kitchen ounces.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:49.869
The purity of a coin 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:53.099
or bullion product is measured in karats. 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.639
When jewelers tell you that a ring is twenty-four-karat Gold,

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.089
they generally mean it's ninety-nine point nine percent pure Gold. 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:06.799
Precious Metals dealers usually use the term "fine" to describe this purity. 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.169
When you see that a Gold or Silver product is point nine nine nine fine,

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.780
that means it's ninety-nine point nine percent  

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.539
pure Precious Metal. 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:17.929
When it's four nines fine, 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:22.779
that means it's ninety-nine point nine nine percent pure.

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.730
If you intend to purchase coins, 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.980
another term you'll want to know is "Grading."

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.949
Grading effects the numismatic value of a coin by determining how much or how 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.629
little wear the coin has experienced, 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.649
and how sharp the dies were when the coins were struck in the mint. 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:43.629
So, now that you know some basic terms about buying and selling Precious 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.679
metals
