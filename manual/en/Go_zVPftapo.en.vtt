The baby alpacas (called crias) on this alpaca
farm are shown in this video enjoying a summer

00:00:39.920 --> 00:01:25.970
day leisurely eating grass.. but one cria
wants to play and tries, to no avail, to get

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.399
the other crias interested.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:49.180
It is fun to watch the spurt of energy and
see this little cria trying to stir something

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.180
up.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.869
Watch the comments on the video to be ready
to see the energy spurt one little cria has

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:52.869
partway into the video.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:53.869
These young alpacas are adorable.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.000
