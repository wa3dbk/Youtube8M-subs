00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.980
Today on our 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche, we'll
be installing the Derale Transmission Cooler,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.759
part number D12906.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:16.129
We'll also be using the Derale Universal Mount
Kit, part number D13002 and the GM Radiator

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:24.119
Adaptor, part number D13035.Now our truck
has had some modifications so the removal

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.680
of the grill is different than normal, so
we will not be showing it.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.680
With our grill out of the way, we'll go ahead
and test fit the cooler.After finding a good

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.150
spot for our cooler, using a couple of bolts
and nuts we purchased separately, we'll attach

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.290
the Derale brackets to the cooler.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.570
At this point, we want to leave the brackets
loose until theyre mounted to the vehicle.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.260
We can go ahead and attach the rubber line
to the cooler as well using two of the worm

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.370
clamps.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.920
It also may be necessary to use some transmission
fluid as lubricant to get the line around

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.900
the fittings.We can now tighten down the worm
clamp securing the rubber line to our cooler.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.210
We will then place our cooler in its location
and using a couple of self tapping bolts,

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.320
we'll mount the cooler braces to the A-brace
here on the truck.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.830
We'll do this on both sides.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.930
We can then tighten the brackets to the cooler.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.460
Now our cooler is secure and were ready to
run the line.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:02:16.669
Going around the radiator, we'll pass 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:30.549
the line through 
here 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:55.459
to 
the factory cooler.Next, we'll need 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:09.870
to 
identify the downstream transmission line.
