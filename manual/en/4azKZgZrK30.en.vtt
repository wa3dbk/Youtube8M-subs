00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.420
 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.910
Hi.  This is Marty from Blue Lightning
TV.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.320
If you have a lackluster photo with
infinite focal depth and many objects in it

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.570
that distract attention away from
your main subject,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.500
I'll show you have to transform it into
a beautiful, timeless image.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.310
Go to File and Open.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.720
Locate your photo, click on it and click "Open".

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.200
 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.170
To fit it on to your screen, press
Ctrl + 0 a PC

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.380
or Cmd + 0 on a Mac.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.860
Make a copy of it by pressing Ctrl

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.559
or Cmd + J.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.449
To increase the brightness and contrast,

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.760
open the Levels window by pressing

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.310
Ctrl or Cmd + L.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.960
Slide the input white to the point where
the histogram starts to significantly

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.480
rise up..

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.900
Slide the input black to the point
with the histogram begins.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.720
Then, click OK.  To correct the overall
color,

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.980
invoke "Auto-Color" by pressing Ctrl

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.230
or Cmd + Shift + B.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.420
To increase the overall vibrancy of the
colors,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.240
click on the adjustment layer icon and
choose

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.190
"Vibrance".

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.180
Click on the Clip-to-Layer icon

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.000
to restrict or clip the
adjustment layer

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.340
to just the one layer beneath it.
Increase the vibrancy to taste.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.610
For this example, I'll increase it to
approximately 70.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.840
Let's merge these two layers

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.610
by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + E.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.979
The next step is to isolate your subject
 from its background.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.259
To do this, we need to ultimately make a
selection

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.420
around it.  For this example, I'll use the
pencil tool.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.170
But first, let's zoom into the subject.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.170
Press "Z" on your keyboard and drag a
rectangle around it.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.760
Open your pencil tool.  Make its size
relatively small...

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.299
and the Hardness, 100%.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.889
Press F5 to open the brush preset panel. Make sure

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.959
all the aspects in the brush tip shape
area are unchecked,

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.489
however, "Smoothing" is OK.  Press F5 again
to close the panel.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.260
Make sure your foreground and background
colors are black and white.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.549
If they're not, press "D" on your keyboard.

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.849
To draw a quickmask, press "Q".

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.340
Now, I'll draw around the subjects

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.540
making sure there are no empty spaces in
the line.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.030
Open your "Paint Bucket Tool" and click
inside the quickmask

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.540
to fill it.  Press Q to make the quickmask
into a selection

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.910
and then invert it by pressing Ctrl

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.860
or Cmd + Shift + I.  Go to "Select"

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.989
and "Refine Edge".  The Refine Edge window
will open.

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.069
Draw around the hair and other areas
that may be wispy

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.120
or feathery.  Play with the "Smart Radius"

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.819
to see if you get better results in your
photo. I did an

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.160
in-depth tutorial on using the Refine Edge feature.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.410
Its link is in the video description.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.030
Output it to "New Layer with Layer Mask".

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.860
It created a new layer and made a layer
mask of the selection.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.810
Click on the eyeball of the middle layer
to make it visible

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.130
and click on the layer mask to make it
active.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.160
Invert it by pressing Ctrl

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.100
or Cmd + I.  Click on the thumbnail of
the photo

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.280
next to it to make it active.  Go to
"Filter"...

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.770
"Blur" and "Lens Blur".

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.320
Lens Blur attempts to recreate the blur you would get from a real lens.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.180
In most cases, "Gaussian Blur" would work
fine,

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.840
however, Lens Blur offers you more
control.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.169
Make the Preview, "More Accurate"

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.050
and the source of the "Depth Map" is
Layer Mask

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.980
The Blur Focal Distance is 0.   The Iris
could be any shape you'd like.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.100
The Radius controls the amount of blur.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.620
The lower the number, the more in focus
the background will be.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.530
Conversely, the higher the number, the
blurrier it will be.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.600
For this example, I'll make the radius, 23.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.790
Specular Highlights recreates a "bokeh"
effect

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.900
which blooms out the brightest areas of
your photo.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.960
This works especially well in indoor
photos

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.790
that may have bright spots of lighting.
Set the adjustments to amounts that

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.270
work well for your photo.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.919
Next, we want to remove the blurriness

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.550
in areas that are at or near the same
distance

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.450
as the subjects.  In this photo, they
include the wood planks near the groom's feet

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.010
 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.210
and the railing under his elbow.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.500
Click on the layer mask to make it
active

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.710
and open your brush tool.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.510
We'll adjust the brush size in a second.
Make the Hardness

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.750
0% and the Opacity 50%.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.700
To increase or decrease the size of your
brush, press the right

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.490
or left bracket keys.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.970
Now, I'll brush over the railing to
reveal the focused image

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.110
that's under it in the Layers panel. 
I'll also brush over the wood planks, as well.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.220
 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.590
For this example, I'd like to add a
subtle lens flare

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.660
to one of the brightest areas in the
photo, which is on her dress.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.500
First, let's make a composite snapshot of
this image.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.530
Press Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.760
on a PC or Cmd + Shift + Opt + E

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.550
on a Mac.   Go to "Filter"...

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.160
"Render" and "Lens Flare".  
Make the Lens Type

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.250
"50-300mm Zoom" and the
Brightness, 50%.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.500
I'll drag the Lens Flare over a point on
the dress

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.600
and click OK.  As I toggle back and forth,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.940
notice the difference with the lens
flare added.  Press Ctrl or Cmd + 0

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.170
to see the entire photo on your screen.
Let's set a soft

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:51.280
white vignette around the edges.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.930
Open your "Elliptical Marquee Tool",
click on the upper left corner of your

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:56.920
document

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.320
and drag across an ellipse to the lower
right corner.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:05.530
Go to "Select" and "Transform Selection".

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.420
Go to a corner

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.690
and when you see is straight, double-
arrow, press and hold

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.850
Shift + Alt on a PC or Shift

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.910
+ Opt on a Mac and drag it in a little.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:24.910
Click on the checkmark to accept it.
Click the "Refine Edge" button

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:29.030
and feather it to taste.  I'm feathering
it approximately

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:33.920
108 pixels.  Depending on the size and
resolution of your document,

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.140
you may need to adjust this number to
get a similar effect.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:42.340
Output it as a Selection.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.220
Invert the selection by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + Shift + I.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.229
We'll fill it with white and since
white

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.599
is our background color, press Ctrl or Cmd + Delete.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:59.990
Then delete the selection.  
Using these simple techniques,

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:03.479
you can transform a drab, mundane
snapshot

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:09.060
into a gorgeous, timeless image. This is
Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.009
Thanks for watching!
