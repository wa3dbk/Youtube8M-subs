00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.304
Hey, guys. So if you've been subscribed
to my channel for a while,

00:00:02.304 --> 00:00:05.546
you know that I make a lot of commercial 
or infomercial spoofs.

00:00:05.546 --> 00:00:07.015
And the reason for that is because I think...

00:00:07.015 --> 00:00:09.280
..so many of these commercials
are just so irritating.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.607
I mean, they're already taking away 
from whatever it is you're watching.

00:00:11.607 --> 00:00:13.440
And, most of the time, they're 
not even entertaining.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.663
Commercials are a bunch of lies.

00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:16.942
The only time they tell the truth
is at the very end of a commercial,

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:19.168
when they're talking really fast and you
can't even understand them anyway.

00:00:19.168 --> 00:00:20.298
Kind of like what I'm doing right now, I guess.

00:00:20.298 --> 00:00:22.175
For example, you know at the end
of a toy commercial...

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:23.398
..for kids where they're always like:

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.837
What?! Whoa!

00:00:26.837 --> 00:00:28.347
No way! Dude!

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:30.209
(laughter)

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:36.496
Or like medicine commercials.

00:00:36.496 --> 00:00:37.902
They always have those
quick disclaimers that have...

00:00:37.902 --> 00:00:39.956
..all the side effects of the medicine at the very end,

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:42.211
and sometimes it's even worse
than what the medicine's supposed to cure.

00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:44.799
(speaking rapidly) Higasprin does not protect 
against HIV, STDs or PIPs.

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:46.645
If you experience nausea, heartburn,
headaches, vomiting, dizziness,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.433
loss of sight, diarrhea, gonorrhea,
sangria, or even death,

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.640
contact your doctor because Higasprin 
may not be right for you...

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.463
..and we are not liable. Batteries are not included.

00:00:51.463 --> 00:00:52.917
But more than anything that I hate about commercials

00:00:52.917 --> 00:00:54.577
is probably the subliminal messaging in it.

00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:57.612
You know, like in every shampoo commercial
they use these beautiful, perfect girls

00:00:57.612 --> 00:00:59.230
with flawless hair using their products,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.856
Because they want to put in the back
of your head that if you use their product...

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:02.988
..you'll end up looking like them.

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:05.557
I mean, come on! Would you buy a shampoo
if the commercial looked like this?

00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:07.611
(woman) Oh! Water!

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:08.984
(woman moans)

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:16.104
Hairball essences. Batteries not included.

00:01:16.104 --> 00:01:17.787
Probably. I'd still get that one.

00:01:17.787 --> 00:01:18.438
But you get the point.

00:01:18.438 --> 00:01:20.061
Most commercials are just not honest,

00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:22.596
because this is what commercials
would really look like if they were.

00:01:40.818 --> 00:01:43.869
&amp;#9834; trendy techno music &amp;#9834;

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:47.348
So cool!

00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:50.704
-What do you think he's on this time?
-I don't know. Shrooms?

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:54.830
Pep-C. At least it's not shrooms.

00:01:58.562 --> 00:02:02.252
He drinks beer, not because it tastes good,
but because all his friends do.

00:02:02.252 --> 00:02:05.401
He's quick to make decisions...
that he would later regret.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:09.308
He wakes up like a new person...
that has a headache and nausea all day.

00:02:09.308 --> 00:02:11.469
He is the most average man in the world.

00:02:12.176 --> 00:02:15.739
I don't always drink beer, 
but when I do, I prefer not to.

00:02:16.338 --> 00:02:17.446
Stay sober, my friends.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.570
A delicious, hot, juicy 75 grams of fat. 
Less than 875 calories.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.545
Fries, dripping with oil and probably
some sweat from the guy cooking them.

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:31.758
And a 32 ounce cup of soda
that could be enough for a family in Africa.

00:02:31.758 --> 00:02:34.213
You'll feel so full, you won't even want to move.

00:02:34.213 --> 00:02:37.694
Thanks to the all new Angus cheddar cheese
Big Whopamac Meal Burger.

00:02:37.694 --> 00:02:39.115
We know you'll be back soon...

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.581
because we forgot to give you half your order.

00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:44.810
(hums McDonald's jingle) That's copyrighted!

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:55.689
With nearly ten miles per gallon, 
a whopping 145 different horse powers,

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.080
equipped with a neighborhood 
waking exhaust system,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.585
and a working engine light
that will come on for no reason,

00:03:00.831 --> 00:03:03.605
all backed by our one month
warranty that you're gonna need.

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:09.302
The all new, used, 2004, 3 wheel drive,
four door, H-150 with a hemi-roid. By Getta.

00:03:09.732 --> 00:03:11.270
Just Getta car.

00:03:14.582 --> 00:03:16.809
Hello, I'm the spokesperson for Gecko Insurance.

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:19.279
Or should I say "Spokesgecko"? (fake laughter)

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.932
I've nothing to do with car insurance, 
or comedy for that matter.

00:03:21.932 --> 00:03:24.917
In fact, I think the only reason why I'm here
is because the comedy name is similar to Gecko.

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:26.930
Seems quite lazy if you ask me.

00:03:27.314 --> 00:03:30.417
Gecko. In 15 minutes, you could
spend 15 percent more time...

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:31.878
.. than we did writing this commercial.

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:37.509
Do you need cash now?

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.044
Are you running low on funds?

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:42.473
Well, thanks to Cash-2-Gold, you
can now send us your gold.

00:03:45.105 --> 00:03:45.674
Do it.

00:03:45.938 --> 00:03:48.983
Cash-2-Gold: We're a real business..
(breaks into laughter)

00:03:48.983 --> 00:03:51.260
I'm sorry. Charlie, I can't do this one, man!

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.323
(Charlie) Just read the lines!

00:03:52.323 --> 00:03:55.331
-I'm not going to do this one!
-(Charlie) Just do the damn voice over, dammit!

00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.669
-You're stealing from old people.
-(Charlie) Don't you point at me.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.680
-(Charlie) Don't you dare point at me again.
-Charlie, don't come over here.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.439
(Charlie) Don't you point at me! I'll bite that finger!

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:06.198
Ch-Charlie! OWCH! Charlie! Owwwwww.

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:10.656
What's great about the iPhone?

00:04:10.656 --> 00:04:12.540
You can do this. And this.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.839
And this. And thi-...

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:17.662
And th-...and you can...hold on.

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:20.469
[dialogue inaudible] Hey!

00:04:21.422 --> 00:04:23.641
Oh, oh. Uh-oh. OH! The f*ck?!

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:26.659
Introducing the new iPhone: it's okay if you drop it

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:29.184
because the next one's probably coming 
out a month after you get this one.

00:04:32.782 --> 00:04:36.467
With Bouncy's new rip-in-halfs, there's now
100 percent more sheets per roll!

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:39.021
You can now take a half sheet instead of a full one.

00:04:39.297 --> 00:04:42.637
Because when you're at your worst, 
Bouncey is like a purse.

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.597
You know, cuz' it holds things in it
and picks stuff up and--and--

00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:49.564
Charlie! This one doesn't make sense either, man!

00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:50.981
(Charlie) Just f*cking do it.

00:04:50.981 --> 00:04:53.316
(Charlie) I'm sick of this sh*t. 
I'm quittin' this job soon.

00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:55.152
(Charlie) I don't f*cking want to deal with this (beep).

00:04:55.152 --> 00:04:56.661
Alright, so maybe I exaggerated some of these.

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:58.200
Anyway, thank you guys so much for watching.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.240
I know I haven't done one of these type 
of rants or &lt;i&gt;Off The Pill&lt;/i&gt; type of things,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.183
you know, where I get really upset
about something and talk about it really fast.

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:07.738
I just hate to see people getting tricked.

00:05:07.738 --> 00:05:09.216
I hate when people are not honest.

00:05:09.216 --> 00:05:11.626
And commercials are just the worst thing
I could think of--

00:05:12.225 --> 00:05:13.996
Bobbleheads! Higatv.

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:15.762
Bobbleheads! New shirts.

00:05:15.762 --> 00:05:19.205
B-B-Bobbleheads! Wristbands in different colors.

00:05:19.205 --> 00:05:19.727
Bobbleheads!

00:05:19.727 --> 00:05:20.841
That's not my merch.

00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:24.205
Higatv. Buy. BUY NOW. Buy now. B-B-Bobble...

00:05:24.205 --> 00:05:25.127
Buy now!

00:05:28.864 --> 00:05:29.458
Do it.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:29.958
Tee-hee!
