00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.317
WE ARE FRIENDS

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:17.249
Here we go round the mulberry bush.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.154
What are you doing here? Haven’t I told
you not to come here? Go away…go away.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.920
Our mother is always like that. You
know that about her don’t you?

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.139
Let’s keep playing the game.

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.914
Here we go round the mulberry bush.

00:00:29.014 --> 00:00:30.954
Ah… haven’t you left yet?

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:32.555
You’ve dirtied your clothes.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.785
If someone drops in how will you look to them?
Get out of here.

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:37.696
Please Mother, don’t hit us.

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:39.780
Get inside.

00:00:40.213 --> 00:00:42.297
Hm…hm...Why are you hitting the children?

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.363
Why are they playing with our children?

00:00:44.463 --> 00:00:48.200
Why can’t they play at their home?
Why do they need to come play here?

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.069
They’re children. Why shouldn’t
these kids play with ours?

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:54.021
This woman and her pride… I’m
not even going to bother.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.414
Get away from here.

00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:58.297
Ouch… the wound in my foot hurts.

00:00:58.397 --> 00:01:04.511
Don’t cry sister, we’re almost home. We’ll
get Mom to put some medicine on it.

00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:07.276
Mother…Mother…

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:12.274
What happened children?
How did you get hurt?

00:01:12.374 --> 00:01:17.147
We went to play next door Mother,
and the lady there hit our sister…

00:01:17.247 --> 00:01:21.660
Haven’t I told you all not to go there?
They don’t like us.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.053
But Mother, we don’t have
anyone else to play with.

00:01:25.153 --> 00:01:30.743
But they don’t like us. Come
here so I can dress your wound.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.586
Nethmi baby, come with your
sister and have some tea.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.846
What you did today was very bad.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:42.547
What did I do wrong?

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:44.984
What you did was an act of
child rights violation.

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:47.693
Do you know what will happen if the parents of
those children complain about us to the police?

00:01:47.792 --> 00:01:49.252
What will happen to you then?

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:51.152
How did I violate child rights?

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:54.447
They were the ones who came to play with our children?
Why can’t they play in their own homes?

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.124
I don’t know if this
woman will ever change…

00:01:56.224 --> 00:01:59.350
Mother what you did today was very wrong.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.712
Samanalee didn’t do anything wrong.
You hurt her badly.

00:02:03.812 --> 00:02:08.417
Yes mother, if their parents complain
to the police, we’ll lose you too.

00:02:08.517 --> 00:02:10.150
Let’s go and apologise to them.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.583
That’s true. I didn’t think
about that yesterday.

00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:16.026
I didn’t know she was  badly hurt.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.127
Let's visit her.

00:02:18.227 --> 00:02:21.016
At last the woman has come to her senses.

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.235
Come let’s go.

00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.042
Come daughter, hurry up.

00:02:26.142 --> 00:02:28.205
Yes…yes… let’s hurry up.

00:02:28.305 --> 00:02:31.189
Samanalee might have been badly injured.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.234
Yes, you hit that child without even
thinking about the consequences.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:36.001
I didn’t think about the future...

00:02:36.101 --> 00:02:38.871
Samanalee…Samanalee…

00:02:39.322 --> 00:02:44.564
Ah... Nethmi and family have come.
Mother…Mother...Nethmi has come.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.416
Ah… You’re the lady next
door….what brings you here?

00:02:47.516 --> 00:02:52.714
Please forgive me. I hit your child
without even thinking about it.

00:02:52.814 --> 00:02:55.059
I don’t know if I hurt her badly.

00:02:55.142 --> 00:02:57.931
Yes her leg is hurt, but it’s our fault.

00:02:57.974 --> 00:03:00.394
We’re not good enough for
our kids to play together.

00:03:00.493 --> 00:03:01.796
Please don’t say that…

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:05.500
Samanalee can come and play in our garden 
from now on. I won’t hit you again.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.156
It’s true. Please feel free to
come and play with our children.

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:11.435
Come let’s go and have
some tea at our house…

00:03:11.535 --> 00:03:15.436
That’s a good idea… let’s go.
