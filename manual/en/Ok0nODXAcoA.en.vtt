00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.270
TurboSquid has introduced CheckMate, the
industry's first quality standards for

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.750
3d models.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.683
As our customers' needs have evolved, we
have found that most of them want

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.769
certain quality attributes in the stock 3d models that they buy.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.020
CheckMate was designed to answer these
requests.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.620
CheckMate is a set of 3d modeling standards, coupled with a certification

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.210
program, that tests TurboSquid's models
against the standards.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.940
All models that pass the standards are marked with a CheckMate badge.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.220
CheckMate models are well-built models that open without errors and render

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.250
as expected.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.710
CheckMate models of real-world
objects are accurate representations.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.600
Each product includes wire frame render
previews, full model information such as

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.800
poly count and the type of mapping used,
and detailed descriptions so you know

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.250
exactly what you're buying.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.930
There are two levels of CheckMate certification:

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.160
CheckMate Pro and CheckMate Lite.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.790
CheckMate Lite is our basic certification level for reliability.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.856
CheckMate Pro models meet a stringent
set of standards, including quad

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.360
topology, flawless geometry, and clean UV
mapping.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.226
You can search for CheckMate models using the CheckMate filter on the TurboSquid

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.310
search page,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.420
or just look for the badges:

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.670
blue for CheckMate Pro and silver for CheckMate Lite.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.336
If you're a TurboSquid artist you can
submit a model for CheckMate

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.950
certification when you publish or edit it.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.479

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.150

our knowledgebase and on YouTube to
help you pass the CheckMate standard.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.570
CheckMate is a step forward for the entire 3D industry, bringing

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.940
production professionals the kinds of 3D models they need for their pipelines.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.740
We invite you to search for CheckMate
models at TurboSquid and see the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.580
