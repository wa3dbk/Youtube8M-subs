The small coffee farmer always felt abandoned and left behind.

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:52.013
If you visited a small farmer home you could tell
they had no prospect for the future.

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:04.479
Before, us, small producers, we were disconnected,
separated from one another.

00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:15.721
We are thankful for Fair Trade Certification.
It came at the right time for us.

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:24.492
What I learned about Fair Trade Certification is that
they care a lot about the social side, about us.

00:01:25.596 --> 00:01:30.596
With Fair Trade Certification, we now have access to credit.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:41.841
After becoming certified, we united and have taken
responsibility to care for the environment.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:59.080
What touches me the most is the concern for our children,
their schools, if they are doing well.

00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:24.163
Selling coffee for a better price allows us
to take better care of our families,

00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:29.813
grow our business and produce better quality coffee.

00:02:45.003 --> 00:02:50.503
Fair Trade Certification means a better quality of life.
