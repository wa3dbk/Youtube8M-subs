00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.330
Those who travel in the RPG circles may be
familiar with the Anima: Beyond Fantasy game

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.950
system, but for those who aren't it's set
in a strange hybrid fantasy world that has

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.890
both futuristic and medieval elements to it.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.250
The latest release from Bulkypix is set within
this dark and Gothic universe, and while Ark

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.450
of Sinners has high aspirations in its Metroid/vania
like gameplay, it falls desperately short

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.840
of the mark.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.281
Most of the blame can be directed towards
the game's flabby controls - oh sure it has

00:00:36.281 --> 00:00:41.380
its basics covered: left, right, jump, attack
and special attack, however their positioning

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.500
on the screen and (more importantly) how they
feel once used makes it hard to feel confident

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.829
in your actions.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.260
Specifically, it's odd to constantly go to
press the jump button (ordinarily within the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.540
corner of the screen) only to hit the special
attack instead.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.930
Weirder still, you'll automatically jump as
long as you hold the button down - imagine

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.149
only _just_ clearing the lip of a platform
higher than you and finding yourself launching

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.960
upwards and forwards before you know what's
happening.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.920
The combat isn't much better as you engage
in a typical combo-based system, however each

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.280
hit lacks a sense of impact or weight - enemies
as well as your character tend to float and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.200
bob around as though they're in a world made
of jello.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.990
This has its cool side when you launch up
in to the air and continue your attack, throwing

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.749
them down to the ground on the final strike,
but even with upgrades the combat feels wet

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:29.100
and limp.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.049
At least there's a lot more going on with
the story, which shouldn't be surprising given

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.560
the source material.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.770
Celia doesn't know how she ended up in Ark,
but she does remember her partner and she'll

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.979
stop at nothing to find Nemo (insert obligatory
snigger here).

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.619
She does so despite the warnings of the enigmatic
'ID', a harlequin suit wearing oddity that

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.459
knows far more than it lets on.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:54.840
The cityscapes as well as the character designs
are also beautifully executed, looking perfectly

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.459
creepy and menacing (as long as you don't
start fighting them).

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.279
It's just a shame you have to navigate a large
portion of it from right to left, with a camera

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:06.409
placed _just right_ to ensure you plow in
to hazards before you have the time to pull

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.670
back on the rubbery controls.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.740
Ark of Sinners Advance has so much potential,
but it's hard to enjoy what's on offer when

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:21.959
it feels like you're wading through molasses.
