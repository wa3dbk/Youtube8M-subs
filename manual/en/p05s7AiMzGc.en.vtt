Hi1 My name is Karl James and on behalf of
expertvillage.com, we are going to continue

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.460
on with our fish Courtbouillon recipe. Any
way, we are going to start by prepping our

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.199
fish. Like I said we are using catfish fillets
and what we are going to do with that is first

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:26.009
we are going to season it with our Cajun or
Creole Seasoning. It's a combination of sea

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:35.230
salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika,
a little Cayenne; we'll season both sides

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:55.360
of that. Flip them over here.
Once our fish is seasoned, we are going to

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:05.429
take the fillets and cut them in about 2 inch
pieces for our Courtbouillon. We'll do that

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:27.780
with all the fillet. You could also just stack
them and cut them but I like to feel everything

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:41.509
I am working with, sort of. So we have our
fish all cut and seasoned and what we are

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:49.500
going to do next is our bonus item; our shrimp,
let's just dump those on there. Put some seasoning

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.829
on those. Going to mix them up here. I'm not
sure if we are going to do it yet but we may

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:04.079
use the shrimp whole or one thing you can
do is just cut those in half also depending

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.990
on how much fish you use and how much you
are making. Once we get all of this cut up

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.310
and prepped, we are going to stick it in the
refrigerator and move on to our next item.
