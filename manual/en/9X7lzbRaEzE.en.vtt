On behalf of expertvillage.com my name is
Carolyn Travisano and I'm here to show you

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.290
about window murals. So we're going to go
over some brushes, different brushes that

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.420
I use. It's very important first of all to
take really good care of your brushes, because

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.970
they'll last a long time and they're not inexpensive
so the longer you have them the more money

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.290
you'll make during your business. So, we have
different brushes for different reasons. I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.540
like to use a nice thick 1 inch brush for
going in and doing like the tile work and

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.990
any large scale work that you're doing. You
don't want to go too wide or too big with

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.920
your brush cause you loose control of the
paint especially on a window. If you put too

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.320
much paint on your window it will drip. So
it's very important to keep control of your

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.570
brush and your paint. This one I use and this
is a 2 inch brush and this is more, I like

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.690
the technique that this paint brush gives.
Also some great things about brushes too is

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.220
that you can create different techniques and
different textures with the type of brushes

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.990
that you use. So with this particular type
of brush if you're wanting to make it more

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.570
kind of like that effect would be where you
want to see the brush strokes, you use something

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.950
like this. Now, when you want to get more
detailed or more refined you'll go through

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.869
these particular brushes here. Again, they're
different sizes for different reasons, it's

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.460
just to be able to get into certain areas
with something like this, where I can do one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.700
single stroke and get into the lines or I
will go to a thinner brush to do the lettering.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.031
Now, a couple of techniques that I wanted
to show you with painting the window murals

00:01:51.031 --> 00:01:56.939
and if you're trying to do something in a
nice even line, a nice steady line, a great

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.689
technique to use which my dad taught me is
that you take a ruler or a piece of wood something

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.909
like this and you lean it on the wall where
it's nice and sturdy and you lean your arm

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.810
on it and you take that and you can make a
nice even stroke. The higher you go on your

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.170
hand, the more steady your stroke would be,
so it evens your line out a lot. So this is

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.579
a very handy technique and tool to use. Some
of the things that you'll need to bring with

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:32.279
you when you're doing something like this;
blue tape and this particular tape is great

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:37.790
because it won't pull off any paint, it's
a masking tape to mask off while you're painting.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.510
If there's already existing paint on the wall,
it's very important, again to tape off the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.999
areas so you don't have to go back and touch
up any work that wasn't yours, that needed

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:52.659
to be touched up because you made a mess.
So it's easy, it pulls off, it doesn't pull

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.389
any paint and you can make nice straight lines
and what's great too is that the paint won't

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.879
sneak down in between or underneath the tape.
Always have a ruler handy to make sure for

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.129
measuring purposes and also you can use one
these for your arm as well.
