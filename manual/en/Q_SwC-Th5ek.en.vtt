00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:04.156
(gentle techno music)

00:00:07.106 --> 00:00:09.143
(fun pop music)

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:11.058
- We're here in Hawaii,

00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:12.648
on the island of Hawaii,

00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:14.554
also known as Big Island.

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:15.609
- This island is actually bigger

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.232
than all the other Hawaiian
islands put together.

00:00:18.232 --> 00:00:19.231
Let's explore.

00:00:19.231 --> 00:00:20.333
- Woo!

00:00:21.743 --> 00:00:24.491
The Big Island is all about adventure.

00:00:25.423 --> 00:00:27.283
Right now we're in one of the caves

00:00:27.283 --> 00:00:29.176
of Keauhou Bay.

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:32.631
This cave is so cool, but
it's time to go cliff jumping.

00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:37.256
We're going 30 feet high.

00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:38.966
That's a long way down.

00:00:39.997 --> 00:00:41.870
(yelling)

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.252
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

00:00:44.472 --> 00:00:45.559
- Ahh, I just did it!

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:46.582
(laughs)

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:49.212
Snorkeling was really fun.

00:00:49.212 --> 00:00:52.636
We saw Hawaii's state fish
and lots of cool coral.

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.228
These oceans are just so beautiful.

00:01:01.038 --> 00:01:03.878
- [Male Host] Going over
the volcano was unreal.

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:04.637
You put your hands out

00:01:04.637 --> 00:01:06.762
and you can feel the
warmth of the volcano,

00:01:06.762 --> 00:01:08.840
like you are right there, and

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.755
it is active, it is happening.

00:01:13.185 --> 00:01:16.146
- Standing on top of all that black lava.

00:01:16.146 --> 00:01:18.483
It is so cool to touch it.

00:01:19.731 --> 00:01:22.331
We're headed to the Lava Tube.

00:01:22.331 --> 00:01:25.045
This was a major passageway for hot lava.

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:27.100
This place is really cool.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.342
This is out of this world.

00:01:28.342 --> 00:01:30.258
It's really fun.

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:30.955
(zip)

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:32.336
- It's said to be one of the top 10 things

00:01:32.336 --> 00:01:34.344
you have to do before you die

00:01:34.344 --> 00:01:38.338
is to go snorkeling at
night with manta rays.

00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:39.103
And they just float around,

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:41.580
and they have these big,
huge cauldron mouths.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.268
They go upside down.

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:46.054
There was a manta ray
right in front of my face.

00:01:46.054 --> 00:01:47.308
You'll never forget this.

00:01:47.308 --> 00:01:48.905
It's just amazing.

00:01:49.792 --> 00:01:51.906
- I am really impressed with Big Island.

00:01:51.906 --> 00:01:55.036
It's so different, and I love that.

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.451
- Yeah, you have
volcanoes next to the sea,

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.250
and there's lava rock everywhere

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.073
that you can climb all over.

00:02:01.073 --> 00:02:02.767
- If you're looking for adventure,

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.855
there's something here for everyone.

00:02:05.855 --> 00:02:07.307
(yells)

00:02:07.307 --> 00:02:10.575
(fun pop music)
