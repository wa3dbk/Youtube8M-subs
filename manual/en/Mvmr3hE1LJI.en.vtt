00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.690
Today in After Effects, we're going to take
a look at how to make this kinetic type effect.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.309
As you can see, each letter fade on screen
at a time, and scales down slightly.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.930
So to start off, go ahead and go up to "Composition"
and make a new composition that is 1920 by

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.310
1080 pixels and then click "Ok."

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.720
So after that we're going to need to get some
type out on the stage.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.279
So go ahead and go up to your top menu bar
and grab your text tool, and then feel free

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.890
to type out whatever you like.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.789
I'm going to be typing out "RCGTutorials."

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.510
Now after that, we need to go down to our
text layer and then open up the drop down.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.739
Now the option that we are looking for is
the little triangle labeled "Animate."

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.000
No go ahead and click on this triangle to
open up the menu, and then select "Scale."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.570
So then go ahead and click back on your text
layer and then click the "Animate" menu again

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.219
and select "Opacity."

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.300
We should now have two separate text animators
that we can use to affect each letter of our

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.300
word.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.980
So we're going to go ahead and start with
our scale animator.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.140
So make sure and open up the range selector
option for that animator.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.780
Now if this is your first time using any of
these text animators, I highly recommend just

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.890
playing around with the different properties
of each to see how they affect your text.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.980
But the one that we're going to focus on is
the offset of the range selector.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.550
So go ahead and click the stopwatch for the
offset property and make a keyframe at the

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.190
beginning of your timeline, and make sure
to set its value to negative 100%.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.770
Now after that, move out on your timeline
about a second and a half, and move your offset

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.080
value to positive 100% to make another keyframe.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.410
Now the last step for this animator is to
raise up your scale to about 140%.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.390
Now feel free to really crank up the scale
if you want to exaggerate the scale down effect.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.870
So next we're going to head over to our second
animator so that we can adjust the opacity.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.140
Now again, make sure and open up your range
selector options so that we can adjust the

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.220
offset.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.530
Now for the offset on this animator, we're
going to want to move out on our timeline

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.740
about a half a second, and then set a keyframe
with a value of 0%.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.650
Then move out to about the end of our animation
and then set another keyframe for a value

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.670
of 100%.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.420
Lastly, you want to take the opacity value
and lower it all the way to 0%.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.710
Now this essentially sets the opacity to 0
for the letters that aren't included by the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.800
offset.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.410
So when the offset changes, then the letters
fade in.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.400
This is the same way that the scale animator
works as well.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.250
Now keep in mind that you can move around
and adjust the timing on the opacity keyframes

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.310
so that it works appropriately with your scale
timing.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.810
Now also, feel free to select all of your
keyframes and then press F9 to apply easing

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.909
for a more natural animation.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.360
Now the real benefit of making this effect
in this way, is that if you wanted to change

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.159
what the type says, or even the overall scale,
it's as simple as grabbing your type tool,

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.250
and then making the changes.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.810
The effect still works the same way.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.349
So that about wraps it up for this kinetic
type effect.
