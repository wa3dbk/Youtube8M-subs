00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.500

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.579
He's not breathing and I don't feel a pulse.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.619
And he's all blue.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.530
And he's really cold!

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.530
Do you think you can do some CPR with me?

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.600
I just was, but you stopped me.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.280
Is there a defibrillator available?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280
No.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.430
Okay, listen carefully.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:18.410
Lay him flat on his back, on the floor and
remove any pillows.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.020
What'd you say?

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.820
Lay him flat on his back, on the ground and
remove anything that's below him.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.820
I did.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.810
Okay, you got that?

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.200
Okay now place your hand on his forehead,
your other hand under his neck then tilt his

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200
head back.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200
Okay.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.560
And then put your ear next to his mouth.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.870
He's not breathing.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.180
He's not breathing.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.220
Oh my god!

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.120
Okay ma'am here's what we're going to do:
Did you know what was going on with him?

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.710
Or you just found him that way?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.030
I just found him, it was just his birthday!

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.530
Listen carefully, I'm going to tell you how
to do some chest compressions.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.530
Okay.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.810
Place the heal of your hand on the breastbone
in the center of his chest, right between

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.090
his nipple line, put your other hand on the
top of that hand.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.660
And pump his chest hard and fast.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.250
30 times, at least twice per second and two
inches deep.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:38.450
Let the chest come up all the way between
the pumps, then tell me when you're done with

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.450
the 30 compressions.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.450
I am.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.450
I don't know how many I've done, I'm sorry,
I wasn't counting.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:52.590
When you feel you've gotten to 30, check in
his mouth for any object and remove anything

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.590
you find.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.590
He's so cold!

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.940
There's nothing in his mouth.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.940
Oh my god.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.390
Do you understand me so far?

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.390
Yeah.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:07.520
Now with your hand, under his neck pinch his
nose closed and tilt his head back again.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.500
Give two more regular breaths, then pump the
chest 30 times.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.729
Make sure the heel of your hand is then on
the breastbone in the center of the chest,

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.030
right between his nipples.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.180
You understand?

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.180
Yeah.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.770
Okay, you continue to do that now.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.949
Can you tell them to go through the back?

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:43.909
I don't know if the front is open.

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:52.220
I have two dogs in here too.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.180
Tell them to go upstairs!

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:15.080
Keep working for me, you're doing a great
job.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:29.419
Keep going ma'am, two breaths then 30 pumps.

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:31.360
Danny!

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.250
Oh no!

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.189
Danny!

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.080
No, Danny.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.080
Oh Danny.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.789
Ma'am are they with you yet?

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:53.509
I think I hear people outside but I don't
know.

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.749
(dog barking) I'm sorry, she's friendly.

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.750
Ma'am are you with them now?

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.569
Help is here!
