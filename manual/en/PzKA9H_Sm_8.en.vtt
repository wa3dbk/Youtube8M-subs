All right friends, welcome back.

00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:04.510
So in this lecture, we're going to cover 2 things.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.142
One is Asian glow and the other is pharmacogenomics.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:17.442
And so, Asian glow or alcohol induced flushing, what we want to do is understand that well enough to explain it to a patient

00:00:17.442 --> 00:00:21.010
but also, relate it to something called pharmacogenomics.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:30.036
And what pharmacogenomics is is the study of how genetic differences can affect drug metabolism and in this case, alcohol metabolism.

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:38.412
And why Asians are more predisposed to getting this alcohol induced flush compared to Caucasians.

00:00:38.412 --> 00:00:44.170
So what we can see in this picture here is an Asian before and after drinking alcohol

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:52.510
and the redness that we see here is called alcohol induced flushing. I said Asian glow. It;s sometimes called the Asian flush

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.176
and what happens here is you take a sip of beer or any alcohol for that matter and within minutes right,

00:00:58.176 --> 00:01:03.637
within 15 minutes, you get this reddening of the face or in the neck that we can see here a little bit.

00:01:03.637 --> 00:01:12.206
Maybe some itching on your upper torso and this is a result of genetic differences amongst Asian people.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:14.769
By the way, I want to give a quick shout out for this picture here.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:28.879
This is from PLOS which is the Public Library of Science. It's a fantastic non-profit. We can see PLOS here. It's a fantastic, non-profit open access journal for free scientific papers.

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:36.503
So, back to this picture. So what we see here is this alcohol induced flushing and this is common in East Asians.

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:42.703
So it occurs in actually 1/3 of East Asians

00:01:42.703 --> 00:01:49.370
and when I say East Asians, I'm referring to Japanese, Taiwanese, or Koreans.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.436
So East Asians and they get this flushing.

00:01:55.436 --> 00:02:01.969
And so the first question is why is alcohol causing this and that's kind of a trick question

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:07.777
because surprisingly, the answer is that it's not alcohol that is directly causing this redness

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:11.974
but instead it's a metabolite of alcohol.

00:02:11.974 --> 00:02:18.194
So, I'm just going to write here as alcohol and it's not alcohol but instead it's a metabolite of alcohol

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:22.377
and that metabolite my friends is called acetaldehyde.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:36.437
So let's put acetaldehyde in a little box because this is the key player here. This is what's causing all of our problems.

00:02:36.437 --> 00:02:42.067
Interestingly, it's acetaldehyde that is also causing a majority of the hangover effects of alcohol.

00:02:42.737 --> 00:02:43.936
So, what's going on?

00:02:43.936 --> 00:02:46.476
Well, right here we see this redness of the skin.

00:02:46.476 --> 00:03:02.000
So, what's going on is in the periphery near the skin, acetaldehyde is causing the release of things called histamine and prostaglandins.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:20.707
So, histamine and prostaglandins and so, if we remember from physiology, histamine is  a vasodilator

00:03:20.707 --> 00:03:33.703
and prostaglandins like PGE2 or the PGD2. This is the specific name of those prostaglandins. These are vasodilators.

00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:38.369
So, vasodilators.

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:46.145
And so, what they do is they widen your arteries, your veins and they increase the blood flow to your skin

00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:52.737
and remember, blood is obviously red so we increase the blood flow to the skin and we get this facial flushing

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:58.169
and so, this is what's causing the flushing.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.400
So you got to know this.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:08.276
Histamine is pretty proven to cause this flushing here. Prostaglandins we know that they cause vasodilation as well

00:04:08.276 --> 00:04:15.236
And so, the reason you need to know this is because a patient might ask you, "Hey doc, what is causing flushing?"

00:04:15.236 --> 00:04:19.281
That's the answer. Histamine and prostaglandins from acetaldehyde.

00:04:19.281 --> 00:04:27.974
But what he might also want to know is how can I treat this you know this rag or this reddening that I get, this alcohol induced flushing?

00:04:27.974 --> 00:04:32.169
And so, what's happening here is that your answer to him should be,

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:41.560
"Well this is a reaction to a drug and any sort of drug reaction that we get, the best solution is to avoid the offending agent."

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:53.000
So, let's just write here the treatment (Tx or treatment) is no alcohol and alcohol can be abbreviated by ETOH for ethanol

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.775
but that's not fair.

00:04:54.775 --> 00:05:02.147
What if this patient just wants to have one or two glasses of wine socially but avoid this alcohol induced flush?

00:05:02.147 --> 00:05:08.237
Well some research has shown that to treat it, we can use antihistamines.

00:05:08.237 --> 00:05:20.241
We know histamines cause the flush so we can use antihistamines to treat it.

00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:27.670
And the one most commonly used by people is something called cimetidine which is an H2 blocker.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.833
So, let's just write cimetidine.

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:42.677
That's different than Diphenhydramine which is an H1 blocker but you could actually probably use both.

00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:47.646
I did see a paper which talked about both cimetidine and diphenhydramine used together

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:53.634
and that if you took it before you started drinking, you would decrease the flushing in your face.

00:05:53.634 --> 00:06:00.834
So, things like you know Pepcid AC or Zantac might help here. That's the H2 blockers.

00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:05.806
The other thing is that we know prostaglandins cause some of this flushing.

00:06:05.806 --> 00:06:15.170
And so, something that inhibits the production of prostaglandins is our good old friend aspirin.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:25.376
And so, I'll just write here aspirin decreases the production of prostaglandins.

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:30.603
So, this is the part 1 of our lecture. This is really the underlying principles of Asian glow.

00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:36.737
So, we know that 1/3 of East Asians (the Japanese, the Koreans, the Taiwanese) they get this flushing

00:06:36.737 --> 00:06:42.205
and it's not a result of alcohol but it's the result of this build up of something called acetaldehyde.

00:06:42.205 --> 00:06:49.970
And this leads to the release of histamine and prostaglandins which are vasodilators. More blood goes to the skin.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:58.241
We are getting flushing and the treatment for it is 1, avoid alcohol but 2, we can use antihistamines to block the histamine effect

00:06:58.241 --> 00:07:03.637
or we can use aspirin to decrease the amount of prostaglandins.

00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:13.702
So, the next question that a patient might ask you is, "Doctor, why is this happening to me but it's not happening to my Asian wife or to my Asian friends?"

00:07:13.702 --> 00:07:20.533
And the real question he's getting at is why do some people get flushing and others don't

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:26.903
and that leads us into pharmacogenomics and something called enzymatic polymorphisms

00:07:26.903 --> 00:07:30.000
and that's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
