Hi, I'm Rob Randall, CEO of ACARA.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.119
In this vod-cast I'd like to talk to you
about the My School website.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.470
My School provides a detailed profile on all
schools across Australia -- all nine and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.000
a half thousand of them. You can search for
any of these simply by entering the school's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.759
name, suburb or postcode.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.110
The 2014 update of My School builds on the
past four years of sharing information with

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.520
the Australian public about the performance
and resources of schools.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.940
My School enables parents, school leaders
and their communities, educators and members

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.470
of the wider community to:
- Search for schools in their local area or

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.140
from any part of the country
- to view school-level NAPLAN results

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.910
- to compare statistically similar schools
- or to identify schools that are doing well and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:57.940
share successful strategies

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.770
This service is designed to support accessing
and sharing of information about schools across

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.660
the Australian community. Of course, My School
doesn't provide information about all that

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.270
is going on in a school. You'd need to visit
the school or the school's website to learn

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.140
more about particular schools.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.470
This year's update maintains all of the
functionality of previous releases, including

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.500
various ways you can compare a school's
progress over time with schools serving statistically

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.909
similar student populations. The 2014 update
provides an extra year's worth of data on

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.110
educational outcomes, and the latest profile
and population data on each school.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.190
A new feature is a mapping function, which
allows you to view a map of the school's

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.070
location, with other local schools displayed
on the same map.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.130
This year we've also enhanced the calculation process for the Index of Community Socio-Educational

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.420
Advantage better known as ICSEA. Research shows that family
background factors, such as parent education

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.510
level and occupation, are closely linked with
student educational outcomes. The development

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.259
of ICSEA involved identifying the combination
of these factors that were most closely associated

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.259
with student achievement in NAPLAN tests.
During 2013 we worked closely with our partners

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.579
and with independent experts to make the calculation
of ICSEA more accurate and reliable - to ensure

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.629
an even greater fairness of comparison.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.069
My School continues to be an extremely valuable
tool for educators and communities to understand

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.370
what is going on inside schools. As always,
the site's greatest utility remains its

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.079
power to spark the sort of conversations which
lead to better outcomes for students. By opening

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.629
a window on school performance across the country,
discussions can focus on what schools are

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:51.370
able to do -- be they the school down the
road or on the other side of the country.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.999
Since the release of the first version of
My School in 2010, there has been

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:59.169
much discussion about the data presented on
the site and its usefulness and validity.

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:04.779
In the intervening years this data has become
widely accepted and information presented

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:09.480
on My School has been used to inform and bolster
any number of policy discussions and debates

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.109
about school performance. It is encouraging
to see how My School has grown to become a

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.569
valuable and widely accepted feature of the
Australian educational landscape.

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.930
It's an important responsibility to publish
such vital information, and here at ACARA

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.859
we work closely with our key partners -- by that I mean 
the state and territory and federal education departments

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:35.969
and test authorities as well as the Catholic
Independent school sectors. We work with them to collect

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.989
the information on a regular basis, and make
sure that what we are publishing is the most

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.090
accurate and current data available.
If you'd like more information about My School website,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.760
go to the website itself or contact us by phone or email.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.480
Thank you.
