00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.580
Hello again in this segment we're going to
cover tools needed for replacing into your

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.780
car carpet on automotive and since we just
covered safety use. One of the things just

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.550
brought to my attention in related to safety
and you need to be aware of before you start

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.560
the project the two driver seats driver and
passenger's seat could be heavy depending

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.960
on the make and model of your vehicle requiring
that you personally lift to get them out and

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.000
you also need to remember when you bending
over to actually remove the seat, you want

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.690
take special precautions on your lifting how
you remove that seat because you don't want

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.570
to damage your back so I just want to bring
that up on the safety issue real quick. Okay,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.700
basically what we're going to use again is
a standard tool set that I've used for pretty

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.720
much all my training applications. There is
one accessory that comes in real handy. This

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:55.610
is a push pin removal tool and it goes underneath
the plastic push pins that hold down varies

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.860
plastic components into your car and it allows
it to push out and prime it out and get them

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.789
off really easily and it really helps to prevent
damage to them. Sometimes they're reusable.

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:10.780
They're design for one use only but this can
real asset to getting those off. Other thing

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.140
I recommend is make sure you have real small
tip screw driver or I also use some old dental

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.220
cell picks because there's some excess caps
that need to be removed on the interior to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.119
get access to screws. Other thing I'm going
to use I'm going to use a cordless drill driver

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.060
to ease to pull the screws out faster. If
you use one especially going back together,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.830
you want to make sure you set the clutch real,
real low because you don't want to strip the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.090
screws they going into plastic inserts in
most cases and they strip out real easy. So,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.240
note to caution there if you're using a drill
driver. That's should pretty much cover for

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.060
the basic tools need. Also, I want to bring
to your attention at this time, if you're

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.490
replacing with one new prefab carpets come
pre-molded to your car, you want to make sure

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.030
to unpackaged that. Get it out of the box
and lay it out in a warmer environment so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.509
it can kind of the plastic to soften up and
get into its shape and that'll make the application

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.950
a little bit easier later on down the road.
So, I just want to give you that quick tip

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.939
before we move farther. Okay, there's one
other item I recommend having, I got a couple

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:17.400
of these there's just old scrap pieces of
four by four and I'm going to use them as

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.700
wheel chocks because we're going to be in
a situation where we have to have the vehicle

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.730
in neutral and the parking brake off and I
don't want the vehicle to roll. So, having

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.090
a couple of wheel chocks will be good asset
to have and safety as well. Please watch our

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.909
next segment and we'll cover removing the
driver seat.
