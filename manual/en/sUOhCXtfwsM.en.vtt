00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.820
Red card!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.859
For what?? Because of my afro? Don't be
a hater!

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.080
Everton's Fellaini complains referees call
fouls on him because of his afro, FIFA has

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.560
approved goal line technology and Messi scores
his 300th goal for Barcelona. These stories

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.690
What's going on? Little Dap! It's Jared
Montz former pro and founder of OnlineSoccerAcademy.com.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.970

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.240
Part of being a better player is being a better
fan. That is why we are doing the show!

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.150
Let's start off with a game of... Soccer
player look a likes.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.270
Stoke City's American International Brek
Shea looks like... this Llama.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.010
The Twitter handle @Earth_Pics tweeted this
Llama pic out saying "Hipster". Vancouver

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.010
Whitecaps player Jay Demerit then re tweeted
saying, "Or @BrekShea"

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.559
Well played Jay, well played!

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:12.559
Messi scored his 300th goal for Barca followed
by his 301st goal Saturday in his side's

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.659
2-1 win over Granada. That's 301 goals in
366 appearances.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.210
Messi300 was the hashtag!

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.609
[Silence]

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:28.820
This is Barca....

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.189
The headline on HereistheCity.com is "Fellaini's
mountain of hair scares referees".

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.939
The 25 year old Fellaini is Everton's leading
scorer this year with 11 goals. He says refs

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.869
gave him bookings last year that weren't
merited mainly because it's hard for him

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.380
to go un noticed.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.380
Even when he is out on the town people notice
his hair he says. Quote, "On one occasion

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:59.889
a Liverpool fan had nothing better to do then
pull my hair once, twice, five times and it

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.880
got annoying."

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.240
Stop it, you are hurting my feelings! I'm
leaving...

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.770
Poor Felliani. There was an internet meme
going around about what he looks like running

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.510
through a wind storm.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.449
Baaaahaaaaa!!!

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:20.419
FIFA has approved the use of goal line technology
for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:26.580
UEFA president Michel Platini is not in favor
of goal line technology. According to ESPN

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:33.220
he says, "I prefer to give â‚¬50 million to
grassroots than goal-line technology for perhaps

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.290
one or two goals a year," he said and then
added "If the goal-line referee is one metre

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.540
from the line and he has good glasses, he
can see whether the ball is inside or not."

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.229
Excuse me Platini but you are assuming the
ref is not blind in that scenario. Those aren't

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:52.320
good odds. Hah Hah!

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.850
That's a Red card! Bad joke Jared.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.520
Seriously though post a comment and let me
know what you think of goal line technology.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.970
Are you for it or against?

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.070
Keeper

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.169
[Silence]

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.270
[Silence]

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:06.369

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.570

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.669
Gooooaaallll

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:15.449
In Peru's top football division goalkeeper
Juan Flores collapsed in a recent game due

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.109
to heat exhaustion. It's hard to grip the
ball when you are passed out so the ball fell

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.509
out of his hands and forward Piero Alva ran
up and scored.

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:26.720
Watch the video by clicking here.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.770
According to Backyardsportsblog.com after
the game Alva said, "Football is for the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:33.600
living".

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.809
Oh snap! Alva with some intense words. Doesn't
sound like FIFA Fair play to me Alva!

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:44.820
