Announcer: Welcome back to The David Pakman
Show.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.300
David: Couple of David Pakman Show Members
of the Week that I want to say hello to today.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.570
First is Albert Stevenson. Hey, Albert, thanks
for being a member. Albert's a good guy, Louis.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.000
Albert saved my life once, actually, believe
it or not.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Louis: Really?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.269
David: And also Dragan Yankovic. Couple new
members, Members of the Week on The David

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.269
Pakman Show.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.460
And of course, we are giving away the iPad.
We're getting down, Louis, now to just a couple

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.689
of weeks until we give this thing away. All
members at the end of the month will have

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.980
10 entries to the iPad giveaway. Of course,
you can get one free entry if you just sign

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.680
up for our newsletter or like our Facebook
page. So a lot of ways to get in there. I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
know, Louis, you're doing all the... running
all the numbers to figure out exactly what...

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.160
what's what, I guess is fair to say.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
Louis: You're damn right.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.239
David: Delta Airlines charged some U.S. troops
returning home a combined $2800 for extra

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.559
baggage. They are facing pretty significant
criticism. Now, for a while I've not been

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.890
a fan of Delta because of their very open
anti-union ways, which is not unique to Delta

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.380
in the airline industry, but Delta certainly
has some particularly strong anti-union views.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.470
Now, 34 U.S. soldiers were coming back from
Afghanistan, and they were charged a total

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.750
of 2800 bucks in baggage fees. Now, of course,
we know that Delta supports the troops, or

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.340
at least they claim to.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.320
The incident came to light a couple of days
ago after a couple of the soldiers who were

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.979
a little more media-savvy recorded a video
about this and posted it on YouTube, went

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.080
viral, ton of views. And Army Staff Sergeant
Robert O'Hair says in the video we showed

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.560
up and found out we had too many bags. We
had four, and Delta Airlines allows three

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.799
bags. Anything over three you have to pay
for, even though there's a contract between

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.170
the U.S. government and Delta, when returning
from Afghanistan on military orders, you're

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.720
authorized up to four bags.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.100
So it's amazing to me that we hear JPMorgan
Chase and other mortgage companies have really

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.009
mistreated troops, including not... let me...
how can I even explain this? When troops are

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.770
gone overseas on deployments, and therefore,
they may have late payments, complete lack

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:17.840
of compassion altogether. Complete lack of
compassion at all, and foreclosing, credit

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.450
ratings affected, etc.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.140
And we hear so much about supporting the troops,
and usually it's associated with blindly supporting

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.930
silly wars, putting the ribbon magnets on
your fridge or on your car.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.910
Louis: It's all about... it's all about image.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
David: It's all about image, right. And what
about supporting the troops by not sending

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.280
them into pointless wars to begin with? Oh,
no, no, no, that's liberal crazy talk. What

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.280
about...

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.280
Louis: Think about how many commercials there
are for giant companies that in some way involve

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.500
soldiers even though it has nothing to do
with the business that company might provide.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500
It's all just image.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.470
David: Of course. It is, and, you know, Delta
has actually been shamed into changing this

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.610
policy. They now changed the baggage policy
for all U.S. service members because of this

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.620
controversy. And I actually... I'm not...
you know, Louis, that I'm not huge on boycotts,

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.750
as a general rule, in the sense that I don't
really believe that boycotts are often effective.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.250
Sometimes they can be. I mean, we saw advertisers
boycott Glenn Beck, and that was really pretty

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.489
effective, his show is ending.

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:14.489
Louis: Yep.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.280
David: Absolutely. Now, I've actually... I
actively do not fly Delta Airlines, and I

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.940
haven't for years unless it's an absolute
emergency, which just hasn't come up yet.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.049
And sometimes... I mean, actually, next week
we will be at Netroots Nation, I had the option

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.019
of a direct flight from Hartford to Minneapolis
on Delta, I did not take it. I'm laying over

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:43.080
in Chicago, I'm back in Chicago with the breastfeeding
mothers and babies being changed in the middle

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.819
of the terminal, I'm going back into that,
Louis, as a choice, in part because I absolutely

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:55.230
do not want to fly Delta. Yeah, I mean, what
do you think about that? I'm putting my money

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.569
where my mouth is, so to speak.

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.020
Louis: Yeah, good. You're actually doing it.
What else can I say?

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.250
David: You like it. I am...

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.599
Louis: I think most people... I think even
if I... obviously I do not like this. I'm

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:13.159
no huge Delta fan either, but I think it would
be very hard for me to do that if a Delta

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.580
flight is cheaper and/or more convenient.
It's tough.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.770
David: Yeah. When you go down to visit Grandma,
it's... you can get that direct flight into

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.060
West Palm with Delta, and that's pretty attractive
for someone like Louis who's both incredibly

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.470
lazy and, you know.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.509
Louis: Yes. That's mostly it.

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.110
David: Absolutely. And I know I will get questions,
well, what airline am I flying on, because

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.520
many are anti-union? I'm going on United.
I almost always fly United. I know that they

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.530
have had some squabbles with unions, but as
a general rule, a vast majority of their employees

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.030
are in a union, and now there's issues of
how will they merge with the Continental union,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.759
is it going to see a wage reduction? I know
it's not perfect, but it's a completely different

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:53.521
situation than the Delta thing, no question
about it.
