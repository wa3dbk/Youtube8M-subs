00:00:00.994 --> 00:00:03.570
Let's begin by creating a new project.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.985
We can create a new project from File - New Project.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:10.037
This will bring up the new project window.

00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:11.857
The first thing we need to do is set the

00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:14.552
destination or path to our new project.

00:00:15.577 --> 00:00:18.283
I'm going to put this new project on my desktop.

00:00:18.283 --> 00:00:21.428
I'm going to call the new project Roll-a-ball.

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:26.025
And then I will click on Create Project

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.205
to make a new project.

00:00:28.205 --> 00:00:31.083
We now have our new project with a new empty scene.

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:33.083
Before creating anything in the new scene

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.444
we need to save our scene.

00:00:34.444 --> 00:00:37.662
We can save our scene by going to File - Save Scene

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.662
or by using the keyboard shortcut.

00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:43.541
I'm going to save this scene in the Assets directory

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.638
in a new folder called _scenes.

00:00:46.638 --> 00:00:49.420
The underscore is optional, I use it to sort this

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.074
folder to the top of my project window.

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:54.795
Now I'm going to call the scene MiniGame.

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:59.919
We can now see in our Scenes folder

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:01.919
the scene called MiniGame.

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:05.549
Let's create our game board, or play field.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.383
To do this we will use a stock Unity plane.

00:01:08.883 --> 00:01:10.741
We can create this plane from either

00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:13.527
Game Object - Create Other - Plane.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.267
Or from inside the Hierarchy view using the Create menu.

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.457
Rename this game object Ground.

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:25.457
We can do this by either selecting the game object

00:01:25.457 --> 00:01:27.637
and using the enter or return keys

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:30.145
to allow editing, or by clicking on the

00:01:30.145 --> 00:01:32.338
game object twice, slowly.

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:34.712
Type in the new name or hit enter or return

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:36.712
to confirm this change.

00:01:37.212 --> 00:01:39.914
Reset the transform component using the context

00:01:39.914 --> 00:01:42.312
sensitive gear menu in the upper right.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:44.770
This will place the game object at the location of

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.278
(0, 0, 0) in our scene.

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:49.278
This point is known as the origin point

00:01:49.278 --> 00:01:51.650
of the world and this is where all of the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.341
coordinates in the scene are calculated from.

00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:56.341
Now with the game object selected and the

00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.599
cursor over the Scene view type the F key, or choose

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.112
Frame Selected from the Edit menu

00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:05.025
to see the entire game object in the Scene view.

00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:09.034
We need to change the scale of the ground plane.

00:02:09.034 --> 00:02:11.356
We can do this in a number of ways..

00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:13.356
We can use the Scale tool,

00:02:13.356 --> 00:02:15.714
simply grab the axis handle you want to change

00:02:15.714 --> 00:02:18.419
and drag the handle rescaling the plane.

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.419
We can click and drag on the title of

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:22.419
the fields we want to change.

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.347
Or we can type a number directly in to the

00:02:25.347 --> 00:02:26.753
field we want to change.

00:02:26.753 --> 00:02:29.517
You can tab between fields and hit enter or return

00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:31.517
to confirm your choice.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.070
Now remember a plane has no volume

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.525
and scale does not work on the Y axis.

00:02:36.525 --> 00:02:39.435
There will be no change unless you go in to negative numbers.

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:41.699
In this case the plane, which is a single

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:45.158
sided object will simply face the other direction.

00:02:45.158 --> 00:02:47.629
If you place a plane in the scene and you can't see it

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.620
check your orientation between the plane and camera

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.620
and make sure that you have the correct values

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.287
for the Y axis of scale.

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:56.881
This is usually the value of 1.

00:02:57.478 --> 00:02:59.687
Let's create our player object.

00:02:59.687 --> 00:03:01.687
In this assignment our player object

00:03:01.687 --> 00:03:03.687
will be a Unity sphere.

00:03:03.687 --> 00:03:07.672
From the Hierarchy - Create menu select Sphere.

00:03:08.752 --> 00:03:10.752
Rename the sphere Player.

00:03:12.813 --> 00:03:15.529
Reset the transform to make sure it's a origin.

00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:18.402
Select Edit - Frame Selected

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:20.402
or use the F key while the cursor is

00:03:20.402 --> 00:03:22.653
over the Scene view to focus our Scene view

00:03:22.653 --> 00:03:24.653
camera on our game object.

00:03:24.653 --> 00:03:26.653
See how the sphere is buried in the plane?

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:28.653
This is because both game objects

00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:31.237
are in the exact same location in the scene,

00:03:31.237 --> 00:03:33.763
the origin point, or (0, 0, 0)

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:35.763
on the X, Y and Z axis.

00:03:35.763 --> 00:03:37.763
We need to move the player's sphere up

00:03:37.763 --> 00:03:39.763
until it rests on the plane.

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:44.003
All Unity primitive objects, cubes, spheres, capsules,

00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:46.279
have a standard size, they are either

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:51.188
1 by 1 by 1 or 1 by 2 by 1 Unity units.

00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:53.188
As such we simply lift the player object up

00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:55.188
by half a unit in the Y axis

00:03:55.188 --> 00:03:58.363
and we know it is laying perfectly on top of plane.

00:04:00.852 --> 00:04:04.220
If we look in the Game view we can see it's very dark.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.220
There are no lights in the scene.

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.108
Add a new directional light from the Hierarchy - Create menu.

00:04:11.975 --> 00:04:14.716
Rename this Main Light.

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:18.838
Reset the game object's transform to Origin.

00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:25.148
Set the X axis and the transform's rotation to 30

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:27.524
so it shines down on the game board.

00:04:27.524 --> 00:04:30.404
Now this light does not give shape to the player's sphere

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.991
so set the transform's Y axis to 60

00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:34.991
so the light comes in from 1 side.

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:37.481
This gives a better shape to the ball.

00:04:38.113 --> 00:04:41.150
The player's position over the plane is some what ambiguous.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.248
It's hard to tell the player's exact position over the plane.

00:04:44.248 --> 00:04:45.874
Shadows will help with this.

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:48.823
Set the shadow type on the main light to soft shadows

00:04:48.823 --> 00:04:51.927
and set the resolution to very high resolution.

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:54.745
Now it's hard to see the separation between

00:04:54.745 --> 00:04:56.745
the ball and it's shadow.

00:04:56.745 --> 00:04:58.745
To help with this let's add what is

00:04:58.745 --> 00:05:00.510
called a fill light.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.510
Duplicate the main light.

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.755
Rename Main Light to Fill Light.

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:13.779
Reverse the transform rotation values to -30

00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:16.319
and -60.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.172
so the light shines up from below but still from the front.

00:05:21.818 --> 00:05:23.818
Change the colour value for the light

00:05:24.318 --> 00:05:26.318
to give a hint of blue.

00:05:27.812 --> 00:05:31.009
And lower the intensity to 0.1.

00:05:33.042 --> 00:05:35.042
Finally, turn off shadows.

00:05:35.542 --> 00:05:37.542
This will now act as a gentle fill light on the

00:05:37.542 --> 00:05:39.942
ball separating it from it's shadow.

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:44.600
Let's look at the organisation of our hierarchy.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600
Even with only 5 game objects

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.600
the hierarchy is already getting confusing

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
and is disorganised.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.600
Organisation in our projects and in our hierarchy

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.420
are very important.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.583
We need to understand the organisation at a glance.

00:05:57.583 --> 00:06:00.119
We organise our projects using folders or directories

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.119
created by our operating system.

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:03.905
We add these to our project using the

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.905
Project Views - Create menu.

00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:11.141
We organise our hierarchies by using game objects.

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:14.671
In our scene game objects can hold other game objects.

00:06:14.671 --> 00:06:16.671
Don't be afraid to use an empty game object

00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:19.336
as a directory or folder in the hierarchy.

00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:23.223
To do this, first create a new empty game object.

00:06:24.538 --> 00:06:26.538
Rename it Lighting.

00:06:28.143 --> 00:06:30.323
Reset the transform to origin,

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:33.085
and this step is important, we want the transforms of

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:35.085
all of our container game objects to be at

00:06:35.085 --> 00:06:37.085
origin before we use them.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.952
Add the Fill Light and the Main Light

00:06:39.952 --> 00:06:42.638
to the lighting parent game object.

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:48.288
Now see how these lights are in the middle of the game board?

00:06:48.288 --> 00:06:50.094
They are some what in the way.

00:06:50.094 --> 00:06:52.094
Remember directional lights light all of the game

00:06:52.094 --> 00:06:54.678
objects in the scene based on their rotation

00:06:54.678 --> 00:06:56.358
not their position.

00:06:56.358 --> 00:06:58.358
We can simply move their parent game object

00:06:58.358 --> 00:07:01.054
up 100 units above the game board.

00:07:01.444 --> 00:07:03.444
There they are, out of the way.

00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:05.944
Next we will find a way to move the player game

00:07:05.944 --> 00:07:07.944
object using player input.
