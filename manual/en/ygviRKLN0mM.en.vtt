00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you follow the money behind the Saab deal you end-up in London.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here is the Russian banker, Vladimir Antonov, who financed 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the first part of the purchase before he was kicked out. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is his first long interview since the affair was made public.

00:00:30.883 --> 00:00:33.100
That there are strong bonds between Vladimir Antonov 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.200
and Spyker is in no doubt. They even share an office here 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200
in London. And even though he has been denied a part in

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.000
the Saab deal there are still strong plans to expand into Russia.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
To Vladimir Antonov the plans were so concrete that Muller

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
travelled to Russia for a business meeting [and it was agreed]

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that if Spyker was to expand into Russia 
 then Vladimir Antonov would follow as owner.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:44.700
Just before Christmas, GM explained that there was not 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
about the decision he was on his way to an official meeting 

00:01:49.036 --> 00:01:52.040
with Ricksgalden [the National Debt Office in Sweden].

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And Vladimir Antonov who already collected car models as a child would 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
like to continue to have an active role in Spyker and Saab.
