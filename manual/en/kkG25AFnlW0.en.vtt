00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.060
my name is Rick Nofsinger, my name is  Reid Robinson, Cizan

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.730
My name is Timothy Hood

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.690
I've been in construction since I was in
high school. I'm an aerospace engineer,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.060
aka, rocket scientist

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.170
the theme to my house

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.709
is a woman in red

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.100
I'm a husband,

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.150
father, grandfather

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.039
greatest calling I think is a
grandfather

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.399
i'm a senior IT consultant for a
health care company

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:29.929
i keep myself busy with my hobbies which are photography and wood carving

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.559
i knew nothing about unclaimed property
until my wife and i were watching channel 5 news

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.250
and they mentioned that it
I never thought much of it because i'm

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.110
usually really good about keeping track
of my money

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.410
very good friend of mine called me

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.600
and said

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.800
hey you've got some money online that you are owed         it was a number of years before we

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.510
actually realized that money was there

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.530
and there was quite a bit of it

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.940
She looked at the fund and my name was there.  There was a notice
about

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.540
uh... property taxes that were paid
twice

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.720
but since we've moved the letter didn't get
forwarded to our new address.  I went on

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.320
to the Utah State Treasurer's website

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.060
filled in everything popped up just great

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.750
there was this cash with my name on it from

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.329
twenty-plus years ago

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.500
actually called them and said

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.260
now is this a scam?  I just wanted to make
sure before filled everything out

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.210
everything was correct.  My money was just there
waiting for me.  I thought if I had

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.830
any money out there at all that it might be

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.430
twenty or thirty dollars.  I was just
thinking something small and it was

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.000
almost thirteen hundred dollars.   They
sent me

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.289
an email that

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.730
had a breakdown of where

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.270
all of these funds had come from.  It
was kind of fun to see

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.270
it was like a history of my life.  All we
have to do

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.050
was fill out a form

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.540
and then mail that form in with some
proof

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.860
of who we were and that we were
actually entitled to the money.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.299
The whole thing took me

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.900
no more than twenty twenty five minutes.
So it filled out actually that day it was

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.159
a Tuesday and by Monday there was a
check in my mailbox.  I had my check within a

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.110
week

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.970
and I determined the best way to spend
this was to take

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.419
the entire family out to dinner

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.659
it was a great relief to get that
money and be able to take the family dinner not

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.889
having to worry about who's gonna pay

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:22.109
it was a great experience. It was a great blessing; it was needed money

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:27.319
I used it for things that I needed to
pay.  I'm actually going to Germany

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.079
in September me and my mom it's just because I have some
extra money.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.950
The money came just a little bit after
Christmas so we used it to pay off some

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.049
Christmas bills.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.299
But the things that the kids really liked
was when I got the kids a fifty five inch 3D

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.529
big screen TV.

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.519

for them also
