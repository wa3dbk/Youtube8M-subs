Hi, I'm Maronzio Vance, and you're watching
Animal Cribs.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.150
Today, curiosity gets the best of us, as we
go check out a cool cats crib.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.330
Come on, and follow me.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.330
Uh oh!

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.170
This cat's gym is located in a studio apartment
in Los Feliz, California.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.970
Can you say rent control?

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.970
Damn!

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.830
Check out this handmade, high-rise cat gym.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.990
Lordy, lordy.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.110
This handmade ceiling scrapper stands over
seven feet tall and features five tiers for

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.240
lounging and playing.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.240
Say what?

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.720
I said five tiers of lounging and play!

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.101
Mmm, look at the ultra softball fur with designer
print fabric.

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:50.950
Ball and bell tempt playful recreation.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.581
That's right, these cats are some furry players.

00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.690
Don't hate the furry players!

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.690
These cats take out frustrations or communicate
with other cats with this ultra modern scratching

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
post.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.690
Nasty!

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.870
Look at the balcony: These cats can get a
birds eye view of this 300 square foot apartment.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.510
They are the king and queen of Los Feliz.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.350
This is your kingdom -- we're all just living
in it.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.350
Say what?

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
After an exhausting day of lounging, sometimes
the cats just gotta go.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100
Why not go in style?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.220
Check out this litter box.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.630
This crap box is made of durable heavy duty
plastic for a long life.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.220
These cats are the s***!

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.409
They don't play the game, they own it!

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.710
I'm gonna get out of here, because I don't
have 19 million nerve endings in my nose.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.010
You've been watching Animal Cribs.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.060
I'm Maronzio Vance.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.540
I'll see you guys next time.
