What’s up guys, its Kaizahr!

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.880
Today’s video will show you how to make your very own Boo keychain.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.920
All the materials required for this project are listed in the description box below.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.720
Ok, lets get started. The first step is to take a piece of clay and shape it into a ball.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.640
Then you’re going to take another piece of clay and form it into cone.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.360
Attach this cone to the ball of clay and blend it in.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.580
Use your fingers to Smooth out any imperfections.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.000
For Boo’s tail you’re going to gently push the tip upwards.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.120
For the hands you’re going to make two more cones and cut them at an angle.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.440
So now you’re going to attach an arm on each side of the body and blend it.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.900
For the mouth, you’re going to outline a smile with a pointy tool

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.080
Then outline a V shape right under the smile.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:04.640
Now take a sharp tool and carve out the smile.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.860
You don’t want the inside of the mouth to look rough so make sure to smooth it out.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.760
For the tongue you’re going to take a medium sized piece of clay and roll it into a long oval.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.820
Take any pointy tool you have and create a line right down the middle.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.880
Now carefully bend the tongue and place it inside Boo’s mouth.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.220
Boo has 4 teeth so take some clay and create 4 tiny cones.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.360
Once you’re done with the teeth, attach them to the upper part of his mouth.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.200
So the last step before baking is to insert an eye pin into the center of the head and use extra clay to secure the eyepin in place.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.960
Time to bake your piece! Make sure you follow the instructions on your clay package.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:11.120
So now we’re going to paint him and you’re going to need red paint for the inside of the mouth.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.460
For the tongue you’re going to need pink paint.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:30.900
After you finish with the mouth, you’re going to paint the entire body and the teeth white.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.860
For the eyes, paint two black ovals

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.600
Then add a curved line on top of each eye.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.920
Boo’s eyebrows should connect and form a “W”.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.660
For the pupils, paint two tiny white dots on top of the black eyes.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.480
Finally, the last step will be to add a layer of glaze to protect the details.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.600
