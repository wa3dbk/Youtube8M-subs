david jackman dot com and

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.859
one in high-definition we made the
promise we said that this week the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.449
conversion begins

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:27.429
and has begun its uh... hopefully going
to be not particularly painful but it

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:31.570
might be somewhat painful but i have so
much to talk about i want to waste

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.390
anymore time louis discussing these
hijinks going on with high definition

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.960
low definition any of that stuff

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.080
the big news over the weekend and aging
ana seven seven seven boeing seven

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.480
seventy seven

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.630
crashed on landing at san francisco
international airport and airport i've

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.120
flown in and out of many many times

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.790
uh... similar to

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.680
boston international airport logan
airport in boston massachusetts close to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.060
our current studio

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.170
uh... it is an airport that has a lot of
water surrounding it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.870
and as as we know now the flight coming
in from seoul korea into san francisco

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.100
was flying to lowell

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.560
and flying too slow coming in and in
india dot

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.940
actually being caught on video and we'll
look at that video and ended up actually

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.160
hitting the what appears to be the
landing gear

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.880
possibly on the seawall

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.050
aparna upon approach

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.760
and ended up crashing kind of sliding
off to the side and down the runway

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.070
let's look at the head the amateur
handheld video that was taken on site

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.350
there

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140
let's go

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.060
isn't here

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.600
all my car or transfer them

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.260
all my god on on my god

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.940
almighty god

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.990
almighty god

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.810
okay so incredible video as you can see
louis uh... did is just a lot of

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.010
questions about this and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.280
number one the question was was this a
mechanical failure or was this was this

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.369
pilot air of some kind

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.659
the yearly report we have are that
nothing was wrong with the plane

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:16.309
and this does appear to have been some
kind of pilot era now in this particular

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.629
crew there would have been

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.099
at the time of landing

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.949
pilots in the cockpit and their our
warnings that go often planes our planes

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.109
are flying to slow on landing

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.989
so right now the real question is

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.529
why wasn't anything done until the
request for speed increase at the point

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:37.959
that it was too late just a lot of
questions here lewis

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.369
yeah i mean right off the bat it sounds
like

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.519
incompetence coming from the the flight
crew

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.469
but it's hard to say i mean uh... from
the passengers point of view this must

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.949
be pretty scary before started scariest
being in a in a free fall are you know

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:55.589
thirty thousand feet in the air

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:56.499
uh... you know

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:57.380
locally

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.040
it was not as catastrophic as you could
have been

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.379
but uh... yeah a lot of questions no
question about it now uh... the the the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.049
seven seventy seven has a target landing
speed of a hundred and thirty seven

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.939
knots which is a hundred and fifty seven
miles per hour

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.969
and they were well below that one point
five seconds before impact there was a

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:16.769
call

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.729
for an aborted landing of course at that
point

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:24.859
it was to late now you would you would
upon hearing seven seven seven crashes

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:27.289
you would think huge number of
casualties

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.859
as we now know

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:33.989
a number of injuries including some
people who who reportedly are paralyzed

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.150
only two deaths

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.389
and some reports say that one of those
deaths according to the county coroner

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.200
may have actually been

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.859
is victim being run over and killed by
an emergency vehicle

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.949
responding to the accident that kind of
called secondary incidents

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:57.039
and again that is incredibly trip tragic
it is if it is true

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.319
but it also means that only one person
actually died

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.609
from this accident and that may be one
of the most surprising aspect of the

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.849
entire story lewis

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.329
yeah that uh...

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.349
kinda disturbing about the emergency
vehicle killing someone i'm not sure

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.629
have acted

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.569
could happen but uh... yet one one death
of course

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.660
there was a shame and and whoever else
my being in critical condition that's

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.500
uh... that's pretty bad as well i'm even
in some cases

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.189
um... that might be better than and the
condition some people elected after an

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:30.599
accident like this india we we are going
to keep following the investigation
