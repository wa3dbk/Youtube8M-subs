00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.080
My name is Greg Sieminski

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.128
I am one of the owners

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.240
and I'm Eve Sieminski, also a co-owner at Iron Fist Brewing 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.400
We started our production in 2010, so right now we are in business three and a half years

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.840
We started from our hobby, which was our home brewing

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.140
It was four years before we opened a commercial business

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.000
Really, what drove us to go into commercial production

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.760
rather than just keep it at a home brew level is

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.020
the fact that right around that time where they were getting really good at their home brewing,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.120
the economy took a complete nosedive

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.040
Our personal businesses which, we were both self-employed, took a 75% hit

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.440
and we had some savings, we had a nice big home equity line,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.340
and we said, "We're either gonna do this now, or we're never gonna do this."

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.960
We've been exporting to many different countries

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.420
our first country we went into was Hong Kong, China

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.180
which was wonderful

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.960
we won Best Beer in Hong Kong

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.540
kind of helped the ball get a little faster rolling in that way

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.740
 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.740
We were so proud of that, and so we started...Greg and Eve really started

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.020
trying to get more countries involved and seeing what the opportunities would be for us

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.500
in exporting our products to everywhere

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.000
We've done Sweden, Norway, Finland

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.600
Our biggest shipment so far has been to Sweden

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.540
they took a full container's worth of beer

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.800
three different brands of our beer over into three countries

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.760
We also send our product to Canada

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.320
Mexico

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.620
and we are ready to ship two pallets to Australia

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.440
We found out about Carrie Brooks and the U.S. Commercial Service about a year and a half ago

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.380
at a San Diego Brewers Guild meeting

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.520
She did a speech for all of the Guild members

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.800
really, we thought it was gonna be a good match for Iron Fist

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.300
so the next day we came right back with all of our notes

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.460
and told Greg and Eve, the owners, about what a great opportunity we thought it would be for us

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.220
Exporting has allowed us to definitely hire more people

00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:17.405
and create more jobs

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.620
We had at least two full-time positions that have been created

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.620
as a result of our growing demand internationally

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:29.980
so it's definitely good for the health of our business and just the fact that we get to create more jobs in the community

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.400
I absolutely loved working with Carrie Brooks and the Commercial Services because 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.560
it made that transition into exporting pretty much seamless

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.040
and easy, and something that I really was a little bit afraid of

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.620
to tell you the truth, when Mike and Melody came and told us about what they had heard

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.760
at the Guild meeting, I was a little apprehensive, just because of all the red tape that is involved

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.220
in international shipping, but she made it very easy
