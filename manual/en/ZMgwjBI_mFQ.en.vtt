00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.229
Greenheck's rigorous in-house testing of dampers
has long been recognized as the benchmark

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.335
testing facility enables us to quickly develop
new products for unique applications. This

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.719
testing facility enables us to quickly develop
new products for unique applications. This

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.719
presentation demonstrates our ability to test,
and qualify, fire dampers in accordance with

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.719
Underwriters Laboratories ( U -- L ), standard
five-five-five.

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.719
U L five five five requires the damper to
be mounted in a fire rated wall or floor built

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:58.469
within a bulkhead. The barrier and bulkhead
is then clamped to the test furnace.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.480
During the initial minutes of the test, heat
shields cover the damper and contain the heat

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.860
within the chamber until the damper closes.
During a one and one half-hour test, the damper

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.860
is exposed to temperatures up to one thousand
seven hundred ninety two degrees Fahrenheit

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:29.220
over a ninety-minute time, temperature curve.
During the three-hour test, exposure equates

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.570
to a maximum of one thousand nine hundred
twenty five degrees Fahrenheit for one hundred

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:19.400
eighty minutes.
When the exposure time has been reached, the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.280
barrier is removed from the furnace with the
flame side exposed. An impact and erosion

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:22.859
test is performed to test the structural integrity
of the product. After the one and one half-hour

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.480
flame test, a fire hose with a water pressure
of thirty p s i is sprayed directly at the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.159
damper, for a calculated time of one and one-half
seconds per square foot of damper face area.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:36.159
The three-hour test requires the water pressure
to be forty-five p s i and the damper is sprayed

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.260
for three seconds per square foot. The water
is sprayed evenly across the surface of the

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.840
damper for the calculated exposure time.
During the fire text, and after the impact

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.109
and erosion portion, UL inspects the damper.
When looking directly at the face of the damper,

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.590
the visible sight through openings can not
exceed three-eighths of an inch in the vertical

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.310
plane, or one thirty second of an inch in
the horizontal plane. UL uses a pass, fail

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.290
method. All of the mentioned requirements
need to be met throughout the testing process

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.870
for the damper to pass.
If you have further questions about this damper

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.870
fire test, please contact us. And remember,
Greenheck offers the most AMCA licensed,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:37.870
and the most UL classified dampers in the
industry. When it comes to dampers, look to

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.590
Greenheck.
