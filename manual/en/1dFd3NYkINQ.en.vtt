00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.549
These are my kilns. This kiln is a really
huge one and because my work is so little

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:12.700
I don't fire it. This one fires on two twenty
but this is a small electric kiln that actually

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:23.670
fires on household current. The way that a
kiln works is that it pours and fires to a

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.470
temperature of o cone six which is around
twenty six hundred degrees. So I use one of

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:40.140
these little bars which are called a cone
and when it gets to the proper temperature

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:50.979
this little bar inside will melt. I put it
in, I put the cone in like this into the cone,

00:00:50.979 --> 00:01:00.139
cone holder and this little switch goes back
and forth. And when this melts it'll then

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:08.670
trigger this latch to go, to go down and turn
the kiln off automatically. I put my porcelain

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.630
in and I turn it on low for about an hour
with, this is called a peep hole. And the

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.159
peep hole needs to be unplugged when you first
start up on your kiln. And I fire it for about

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:30.530
an hour on low. And I turn it up to medium
and fire it for another hour. All this time

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:38.840
this lid is shut down. And then I turn it
on high for an hour. And after an hour I plug

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:50.369
up the peep hole and it will just go for anywhere
from three to six hours longer depending on

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.249
how much green ware is in your kiln. Or how
old your elements are. Because as the elements

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:06.799
get older, it takes longer to fire. I have
a head that I fired inside the kiln. It?s

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:15.360
sitting on a bed of what's called prop pet.
This is kind of like asbestos like material.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.221
The shoulder plate I have the prop pet stuffed
inside because if I just had it in the kiln

00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:30.030
like this when it gets hot it would tend to
want to close down and break at the shoulders.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:41.830
So I put this cottony prop pet stuff inside
to support it during the firing. When it goes

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.540
in its white in color and very chalky and
very fragile. And then this it comes out of

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:57.510
the kiln with this color. As I mentioned earlier,
the porcelain slip has the color in it.
