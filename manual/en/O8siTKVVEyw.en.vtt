00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.830
A Logitech gamepad F310 review

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.919
out of the box the gamepad

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.169
looks pretty good

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:18.779
There's some info on the back

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.370
Now in the box you'll find

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.589
an instruction manual,

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:28.759
a driver, for the thing to work,

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:33.060
and the actual controller.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.040
The controller is USB,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.200
it feels pretty good.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.730
The analogs are good, the triggers,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.070
they're all good. Buttons, standard.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.760
k

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.940
Here's it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.730
compared to a PS3 controller.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.030
And a wii U controller.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.899
For the look I gave it a 7 out of 10 cuz it looks pretty good,

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.800
but as a third party feel to it

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.330
For the actual feel of the controller, it feels really good. The only complaint is that the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.400
triggers were

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.940
kinda sketchy,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.860
and the buttons were

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.260
pretty small.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.670
For feel I gave it an 8.5 out of 10.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.820
now the program it comes with is the
logitech profiler

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.020
add you assign buttons to it for games that aren't selec- That don't have a built in feature.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.270
But for games that do, you can just plug it in.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.270
Here's some gameplay

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.120
It can also play games that aren't controller supported,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.829
such as

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.139
executable files.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.260
Here's a game I made

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.609
called ArcAde.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:03.609
Here's some gameplay.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:21.109
For gameplay, I gave it a 9 out of 10, because the buttons were really responsive.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:28.109
now for the whole controller i give
it an 8.5 overall

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.789
thanks for watching
