Hi.

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.440
I’m Gerry Oginski, a New York medical malpractice
and personal injury attorney.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.430
And in today’s video tip, I’m going to
tell you about a podiatry nightmare.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:13.349
A 57 year-old woman goes to a foot doctor
to have a bunion removed, nine months later

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.379
she’s dead.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:20.420
Let me tell you what happened in this case
and why the doctor was irresponsible and careless.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.170
In this particular case, the woman had bunion
surgery and that went fine.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.320
The problem was after she had the surgery
things started to go bad.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.029
She had a post-operative wound infection that
never got better.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.640
She kept returning to the doctor office on
a regular basis and her complaints were that

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.700
she had pain and swelling in the wound area,
and the pain and swelling never went away.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.590
It was red, it was sore, it was swollen.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.270
The doctor kept telling her things would get
better and he even gave her antibiotics, that

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.670
didn’t help.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.180
And after a period of time this skin surrounding
the incision got necrotic.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.870
And that means there was dead tissue around
the wound.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.300
And no matter what the doctor did - and in
fact he debreeded (he cleaned out the dead

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.700
tissue) and he kept telling her to return
to the office - and every time she returned

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.590
she had the same exact problems: things were
swollen, they were painful, they were red,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.580
and again she kept getting this dead tissue
surrounding the wound.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.760
And this happened over a period of nine months.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.490
The problem was that the doctor failed to
recognize one of the most important things

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.360
in the field of foot surgery; and that the
infection that this woman had was never going

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360
away.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.440
And it never went away.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.930
He never sent the patient out for another
opinion, he never sent the patient to an infectious

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.729
disease specialist.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.920
And ultimately what wound up happening was
she developed an infection into her bone which

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.830
is known as osteomyelitis.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.710
And as a result of the unrecognized and untreated
osteomyelitis, this woman died nine months

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.790
after having this foot surgery.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.650
This was a tragedy that could have been prevented.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.810
And I am pleased to say that her family was
able to successfully resolve their lawsuit,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.600
but at the expense of having their loved one
die at the hands of an incompetent foot doctor.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.979
