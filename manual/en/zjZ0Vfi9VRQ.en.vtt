Hi I'm Jeffrey Knight with Ewing Irrigation and in this video I'm gonna show

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.990
you how to find a break in a field wire

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.620
with pinpoint accuracy using a Greenlee
2003 pulser.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.080
Broken wires are a frustrating problem...it
can be caused by poor splices

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.809
or even a tree root that's grown through the wire. Many times

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:28.480
the only way to fix this is to replace the
entire wire from the controller to the valve.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.430
I'm gonna show you better way. I used a volt/ohm meter to verify that the broken wire was

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.510
actually the common wire

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.840
so to use the pulser, I'll take the red
lead...

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.980
and I'll hook it up to the common wire...

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.180
the black lead will go to ground.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.570
Now when I turn the unit on, it'll send twenty four hundred volts DC through the wire.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.700
I'll use the receiver to pinpoint the
location of the break.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The receiver goes parallel with the wire path

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.179
and when you turn it on there's an analog meter that you'll watch.

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.579
when the needle bounces to the right,
that's the direction of the fault.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.700
If it bounces to the left, it's to the left.
Right now it's showing that the fault

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.740
is over there somewhere so we're gonna
go get a closer look.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.740
Now all we have to do is follow the
needle on the analog meter.

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:34.100
Right now it's telling us that the fault is
this direction so I'll pick it up and move it.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.639
and its built-in back to the right

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:44.159
so I'm gonna flag from the center point of the receiver...

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.280
move it back again...

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.450
It's bouncing in this direction now so I know
that the break

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.120
is in between these two flags. Now I'm
going to pivot the receiver...

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.150
and figure out where the break is

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.100
this direction.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.200
The needle's moving to the left...so I'm going to pivot around...

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.250
okay so now I know that the fault is
somewhere within this grouping of flags...

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.200
so now all I have to do is get a shovel
start digging.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.100
There it is...right there.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.000
So you can see the pulser has
prevented  us

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.700
from having to replace the common line all the way around the house

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.370
now we can simply make to repair right
here in the trench where the broken wire is.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.420
I'm Jeffrey night with Ewing Irrigation and I'll see you again with

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.409
another trouble shooting video.
