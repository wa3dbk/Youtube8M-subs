00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.200
At least I know
what the posts sound like.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.280
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.320
Remember your numbers ones
and twos for the last time.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.400
Number one.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.360
Good, come on, good,
good, come on, good.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.400
You play good.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.160
Number two. Come and touch us.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.880
Okay, ready, David?
Just cop on the blindfold.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.960
I'll try.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.040
Right, you
take mine--

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.440
If you take my bicep,
we're gonna have a little jog.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.720
Ready? Let's go.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.400
Okay. Just coming down the hill now.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.200
There we go.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.200
Ready for the return journey?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.280
Yes, sir.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.520
All right. Let's go.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.760
Middle.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.520
There you go.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.280
Amazing.
All right?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.280
Thank you very much.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.520
My word. You've done superbly.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.760
Thanks for that.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.240
Great guide.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.560
How was that? How did it feel?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.040
Hopefully, it gives
some kind of idea.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.040
It's that feeling, obviously.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.040
Yeah.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.640
You're very trusting
is that I would say.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.440
Coming to you.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.200
Stand still, it will come to you.
Stand still, stand still, good.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240
That's it, good. Come into my voice.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.760
A pass me if you can.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:10.920
Well Done.
Yes, David.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.320
I bet you go.
- Here we come.[]

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.880
Well, done.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.000
Yeah.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.160
Nobody there.
- I'm here.[]

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.000
Yes. Yes.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.040
Come on.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.880
Come straight, [] shoot.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.240
Leave it.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.640
Yeah, come out, come out.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.160
Come in. Come in, come in.
Same shoot, same shoot, yes.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.760
Good goal.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.760
Really important to listen to the guy
behind the goal where the posts are.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.800
Okay.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.680
And then you just keep
on kicking for bang.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.840
Okay.
- Let's go.[]

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.160
Ball is down here.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.040
Put your left hand on the ball.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.840
And listen to Jeff.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.080
This is your right post.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.040
Okay, centre. Centre.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.720
Oh, not bad.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.920
Centre.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.240
Oh!

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.560
Third one.
One for luck, one for luck.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.040
Centre. Centre.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.720
Oh, yeah, tremendous.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.200
Lovely.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.480
Brilliant stuff, brilliant stuff.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520
Well, done.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.720
How did you find it?

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.960
I thought the goal keepers were [].

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.160
You guys at the back.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.200
It's a big shoulder
you got hold of it.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.440
You got a bigger head.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.800
Cheers, guys, well done.
Thank you, David.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.000
Not thinking of losing of your
eyesight anytime soon, are you?

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.160
Well, I'm not sure about that.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.080
I always get a lot of [] for not
really having a celebration.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.880
But we're both too
old for celebration.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.200
Exactly. We' re just delighted [].

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.320
I know.
