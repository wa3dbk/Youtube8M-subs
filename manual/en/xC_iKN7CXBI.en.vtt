Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.120
[pause]

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.300
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.650
Fingertip cracks are so, so painful but they
are amazingly easy to fix, and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.359
they are easy to fix with stuff you already
have in your medicine cabinet,

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.460
stuff like Band-Aids and practically any ointment
like Vaseline, petroleum

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.249
jelly, Aquaphor or even the antibiotic ointments
we talk about like

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.619
bacitracin and Polysporin and, as crazy as
this may sound, if you catch

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.579
that crack real early, Krazy Glue will fix
it. In order for you to

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.620
understand why these things work, you need
to understand what’s going on

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.260
here and what causes them. So I’m going
to explain three different facts.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.429
First of all, the skin of the tip of your
finger is very thick, just like

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:55.199
the skin of the palm. Second, any time fluid
comes into something, it gets

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.600
larger, just like when you sprain your ankle.
The ankle swells up because

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.719
of all of the fluid that comes in to help
heal it and, on the other hand,

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.829
when you lose fluid from something, it shrinks
and shrivels. That’s how a

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.979
grape goes to a raisin. And third, in the
wintertime, the temperature is

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.880
lower, the humidity is lower and there is
much more evaporation of water

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.509
from all parts of our skin.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.430
So, let’s start with this representing the
curve of the tip of your finger

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.659
and the thickened skin. You can see this little
line. This line represents

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.690
a crack. That crack can come from a simple
scratch, just over drying of the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.439
skin or any other trauma that happens to the
skin. But you get a crack. The

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.640
surface of that crack then loses some water
by evaporation. Because the

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.100
skin is so thick, there is more water being
lost at the top than at the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.930
bottom. As a result, the crack starts to open.
Well, now the inner part of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.179
the skin is exposed so the fluid, because
of the lower temperature and

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.560
humidity, can evaporate from there and, as
it evaporates, it pulls a raisin

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.899
deal on us, it shrivels up, so the inner parts
of this crack shrivel up and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.221
pull apart from each other and they keep pulling
further apart as more and

00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:16.380
more water is lost. It’s a little bit like
a positive feedback cycle

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.490
because, as you lose more water, it opens
up more, it exposes more of that

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.960
inner skin but look at what else is happening,
it’s getting deeper and, as

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.620
it gets deeper, it starts to hit nerve fibers
and that’s why it’s so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.200
painful. So how do you fix this? Just stop
the leak, and we stop the leak

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.070
of that inner fluid by putting bacitracin
or Polysporin or any of those

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.320
other ointments I mentioned right into the
crack and then covering it with

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.650
a Band-Aid. The Band-Aid and the ointment
prevent the natural fluids inside

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.380
from evaporating. As a result, the fluid accumulates
inside and, as it

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.250
accumulates, it causes swelling of the inner
walls of the crack and,s as

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.930
they swell, they move closer and closer together
until they touch each

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.890
other. It becomes less deep, less painful
and, as a result of the two sides

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.850
coming together, it actually heals. This process
only takes 2-4 days of

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:15.760
using your ointment and Band-Aids 24/7 for
it to actually heal. And the

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.980
reason you can’t use Krazy Glue when it’s
deep and open like this is the

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.120
Krazy Glue will go in too deep and it will
hurt but if you use the Krazy

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.750
Glue at the very beginning, it won’t hurt
and it can seal it just the way

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.540
the Band-Aid and ointment does. So the next
time you get a painful

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.430
fingertip crack, just head to your medicine
cabinet, and you will be able

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.111
to fix it in 2-4 days.
