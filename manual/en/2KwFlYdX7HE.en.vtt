Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:04.730
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the wash impeller on your dishwasher.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.580
It’s a really easy job; all we’re going
to need is a #20 torques bit, and a 5/16ths

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:10.820
inch nut driver.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.180
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.560
Now the next step in this repair we’ll be
to open the door and remove the lower rack;

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.470
and just set that aside.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.380
Next we’ll remove the lower spray arm; there’s
a center retaining nut there that’s about

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.289
two inches in diameter, just unthread that.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:41.210
Lift the spray arm off; set that aside.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.120
Now with our #20 torques bit we’ll remove
the six screws that hold the pump cover on.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:01:01.600
Now we can just lift that pump cover off;
there will be a couple of these split rings

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.009
that sit inside the opening at the top so
we should retain those.

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:12.659
Next we’ll just lift off the back wash arm;
set that aside.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.710
Next we’ll lift off the filter.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:27.240
Now we have access to the three screws that
will remove the discharge cover.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:38.490
With those three screws removed we can lift
off the discharge cover.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:49.850
Now with the discharge cover removed we have
access to the impeller; a single 5.16ths screw

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.570
that is holding the impeller to the motor;
we need to get a good grip on the impeller

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.380
itself and loosen that screw.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.349
Simply lift the old impeller out, remove the
old screw; inspect the little rubber gasket

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:17.939
on it, make sure that’s still in good shape;
if not we’ll have to replace that as well.

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:25.329
Now with the impeller removed we can also
lift out the bottom of the pump and filter

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:32.909
and inspect that drain area to make sure there’s
nothing in there that doesn’t belong such

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:42.540
as some bones or broken glass; we can remove
all of that while we’re in that area.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:53.110
And check the food chopper to make sure it’s
not damaged.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.530
Put the bottom filter plate back in; make
sure to line up that oval opening with the

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:12.239
opening in the pump; as well as the base for
the discharge housing.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.189
The impeller has two flat sides to it so it’ll
go in two different ways; just line that up

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:24.010
on the shaft, make sure it’s pressed down
tightly, reinstall that 5/16ths screw.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:38.209
And again we’ll have to hold that impeller
as we tighten the screw.

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.420
Make sure it’s good and firm; and just rotate
it to make sure it doesn’t bind on anything.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.400
Now we can reinstall the discharge cover.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.969
There are three little notches on that discharge
cover that will line up with appropriate notches

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:55.459
on the base of it.

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:02.680
And we’ll reinstall the three 5/16ths screws.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:14.139
We’ll put all three of them in before tightening
any of them.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:21.139
Next we’ll reinstall the filter, remove
any articles that are adhered to the outside

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.230
of that.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.949
That will snap down into a little groove in
the base.

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:35.830
The backwash arm we’ll look at the slotted
openings around the edge and if there’s

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.250
anything jammed in those we should peel that
out.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:50.300
It has two flat sides on the top of that that
will line up with the spray arm bearing; make

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.270
sure it turns freely.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.389
Next we’ll install the pump cover.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:08.930
Put those six torques head screws in place;
don’t tighten any of them until we have

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:23.099
them all in.

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.610
Again we want to make sure the lower spray
arm bearing turns freely.

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.000
Make sure that the center spray nozzle is
in place.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.199
It’s important that we put these two split
rings back in; insert them so that the splits

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:45.080
are opposite each other; just sit those down
into the opening around the spray arm bearing.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:06:01.620
And that bottom spray arm again has two flat
sides to it that will line up with the bearing.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:09.680
Then tighten the retaining nut.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:18.360
Reinstall the lower rack, and our repair is
complete.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.030
Told you it was an easy job.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.369
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
