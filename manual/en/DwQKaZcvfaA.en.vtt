Hey guys, I just thought I'd make a quick video for you R35 owners

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.160
who have a JDM model

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.840
GT-R. So, this is for the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.129
Bluetooth setting up for your

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.130
audio player (like your iPhone) or

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.699
whatever you want to connect via
Bluetooth to your

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.449
in-car entertainment system, so

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.570
it's pretty simple to do, you just go up top here

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.590
which it'll be in Japanese in your one most likely. Top left corner,

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.410
the phone icon, click that, then you've got

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.719
you just click the top one

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.620
as such... then you scroll down...

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.000
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
there we go. To Bluetooth.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.379
One down from Bluetooth again on the
next screen is this one

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.799
I've already got mine on
so it will come up with a prompt

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.299
ok, so at that stage we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.360
just go to your iPhone

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.780
under WiFi is your Bluetooth, you click Bluetooth, make sure that it's 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.729
enabled. It's now syncing with the car

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.240
and it's got, you won't be able to see (I don't know how to focus on this thing)

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.890
it's already got the device available there, you click that

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.119
and you set your own pin code, it'll come up with a 4-digit pin

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.400
you enter the pin and it'll be sync'd with your car.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.530
so at that stage you go out of that, go out of it...

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.659
...from this display,

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.740
then click DISC,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.340
and I've already got it on Bluetooth. Yours will probably be on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.899
either Music Box or CD

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.280
just click it as many times as you need to go to the
Bluetooth screen. Click the 'play' button

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.000
up the top,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.200
which is the first option. Go to your phone

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.489
...there we go!

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.280
and you just play it from

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.720
whatever your device is with Bluetooth and it'll be sync'd

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.390
with your car and you'll be able to play your music through there.

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.360
*music through stereo*

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.580
