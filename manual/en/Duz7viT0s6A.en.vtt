What's up fish tank people? Fishtanktv.com. Dustin's fish tanks. Bringing it to you New Years Edition. That's right.
Happy 2013 everybody. I'm excited. Chilling out last night, guess what I did. The girls went to bed, without their pacifiers. Not easy to do, I don't know if some of you parents have ever done that before. We took the pacifiers away from both Mya and Nola. But I had some time to chill. Welcome to the new year, me and my tank.
Did a little bit of work but don't have much time cause we're about to run out to Toys'R'Us for the girls who don't use pacifiers anymore.
But I want to talk about this tank, cause it's one of my goals. One of the important things to me for 2013 is to make this tank beautiful again.
It used to dominate, it doesn't dominate as much as it once did. We're heading in the right direction with it. So, I want to talk about it. I want to talk about what makes this tank a success.
In aquascaping, I believe there is value in the open spaces in your tank. The space between the branches over here, the open space over here. The surface, the space between where the lotus come and the space between the surface. The height of the crenemateans verses the surface.
Just the space. I think there is value in the spacing of everything in your aquascapes.  I think that's one of the things that's successful in this tank. I also want to show off the Trident that I've been slowly.. This is a good tip. If anyone's growing Java Fern, just keep separating it, and separating it, and separating it. I'm using rubber bands on here. I will cut them quickly, but it was just easier to do. I was in the mode so I said "Alright I'm going to do it". So I've got these ugly two rubber bands here and I think you can see one back there. Ultimately were' going for that whole tree effect with the trident. NO the trident is not for sale on Aquatic Jungles, not even in a combo anymore. SO do not ask, but I appreciate it anyway.
So, open space is what's key. 
I want to talk about goals too. I had a great year with Aquarium goals. I'm really excited. I'm a real goal person. The greenhouse wasn't even on the goals list this year but I went to Peru, I put the greenhouse together, had a lot of success on the YouTube Channel. So I'm really excited about that.
I want to share one of my goals is to make this tank beautiful this year. I also want to put out some more good written content, a couple more guides, that sort of thing. If you guys have some ideas on what you want me to right about let me know.
I'm still working on a book. I have to get my file of this old computer that's going to have a lot of content on it.
So that's what I'm doing. I'm excited. Look at the open spaces. What are your goals for 2013? I'd love to hear them. I think it's important. I write mine down too. I think that's very important. Write down your goals, what you are trying to achieve.
I feel really good going into this year. I had a monster 2012 on a lot of fronts. So I want to share that, I want to share the tank and I'm just excited.
I also want to share the open space up on this one. This tank is actually being torn down. I'm not sure if I'm going to tear this one down though, I really like it the way it's so full. Open spaces again working really well here. You'll notice I didn't scrape the algae. I added one, maybe two capfuls of regular old flourish and it threw off the balance a little bit and I instantly got algae so that's just something you want to watch when you are fertilizing your tank. You have to get a feel for that, I didn't have a feel for that tank as you can see by the stuff on the glass.
But, that's what I'm doing. Having a lot of fun. Happy 2013. Now I have to run to Toys'R'Us. I've got some kids to spoil rotten for their 'No more pacifier away'.
What are your goals for 2013? Talk about it and let me know. Also, housekeeping notes, I'm looping a lot of the old Species Sunday's with a lot of good great tips on the newsletter email I'm doing.
