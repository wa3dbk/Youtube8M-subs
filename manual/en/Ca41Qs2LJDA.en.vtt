00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.431
In this clip we're going to discuss the manager
mode. Manager mode is pretty much when you

00:00:05.431 --> 00:00:13.120
take control of a team and you'll play in
your league. You'll also be able to schedule

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:21.270
preseason friendlies with other teams. You
also get to compete in your, if you country

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.529
has a cup, you'll get to compete in that tournament.
And then from beyond that there are also other

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:35.579
tournaments that you may be able to enter
due to how your team does. Basically, everything

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.219
is controlled in manager mode. I'm talking
players, how much they get paid, game time,

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.760
just trades, anything, you name it. They do
it in there, training modes, how you want

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.889
your guys to practice, even what days you
want them to practice. So, we're going to

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:03.760
dive into that and I'm going to show you how
deep it really gets. Alright, so we just up

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.750
manager mode from the game modes. We'll roll
to a new manager and create a new one here.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.790
Yeah, one of the big things in manager mode
is, you're the manager of the team so you're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.290
hired by whoever owns the club that you're
coaching and therefore you have to answer

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.362
to them. And they are like your boss. So basically,
I mean, I won't put the names or anything

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:35.160
in there. But you got your manager look which
you can get a couple different you know, different

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.960
looking people. Obviously your name and your
surname. Surname, if you don't know, that's

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:49.820
your last name. Your nation, your currency,
you can go from pounds and Euros and dollars.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:01.800
Where you're born, when you're born. I'll
just say that's good enough. And you get to

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.640
select what country you'd like to look for
a job in. Which is really interesting because

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.959
they have many different leagues within this
game. So, I'll just cycle through them here.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:21.819
You can just take a gander. Basically, all
over Europe, America, and there's also teams

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.329
from countries throughout the world like Korea,
Scotland. I mean it just jumps all over the

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:38.860
globe in this game. So, it's pretty interesting.
So, let's take a job in Turkey. Why not? So

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:46.450
basically, we selected Turkey. And, we are
going to select a team. Alright so we're in

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.340
the Turkish league here and we're going to
basically just look around. You get your starting

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.500
budget, which is how much money they're going
to give you to start with your club. And basically

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.870
you can check their stats. You know, there's
the attack, the midfield and the defense and

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.999
the team chemistry. So we'll just pick, let's
try and get one I can pronounce, we'll be

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:10.609
to Istanbul be...
