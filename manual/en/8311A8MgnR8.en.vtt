00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.450
carry fewer guests.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:09.510
Which seems to make for

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.150
a more personal, enriching journey.

there's always the option to do

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.550
nothing at all.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.710

in onboard entertainment and nightlife.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.440
And ships are designed

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:54.500
with an emphasis on

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.600
expansive decks and big, open views,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.829
perfectly suited to the Alaska experience.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.130
and a bit more room.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.850

Each with a character

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.970
and a charm all its own.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.170
