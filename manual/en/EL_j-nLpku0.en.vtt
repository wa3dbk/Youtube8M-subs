00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:13.060
In this segment of Decorative Painting Techniques,
we're looking at, once we've colored our glaze,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.680
what we can actually do with it.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.520
That is where a lot of the glazing techniques
come in, techniques like sponging, ragging,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.550
color-washing and striae.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:35.270
All of these techniques are basically using
a film of glaze on top of a surface then manipulating

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.060
it with a tool, whether it's a brush, or a
rag, or a sponge.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.920
So, what you're doing is you're apply your
glaze to your surface, whether it is your

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.030
walls or your ceiling.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.920
And then, working in a limited amount of time,
before the glaze dries, to make an imprint

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.820
of your work in the glaze.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.560
We would use glazes in situations where we
want to bring a lot of warmth or depth to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.740
walls, or any surface.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.049
It could even be furniture, for example.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.350
If you put an antiquing glaze on a cream background,
you can make a piece of furniture look as

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.700
if it is hundreds of years old - as opposed
to looking like you bought it yesterday.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.369
Ultimately, glazes are used quite unexpectedly
on a lot of things that you may have lying

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.939
around in your home or your office.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:44.639
You could find glaze on mirror frames, such
as on cabinetry, a lot of kitchen cabinets

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:47.729
have glaze on them.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:56.689
Glaze is much tougher than paint, so it becomes
a much more durable surface once glazed.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:06.409
One of the things you should not be confused
with is the glaze used on pottery, glazes

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.660
that are actually applied to pottery and fired
in a kiln.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.580
However, it is the same essential outer coating
that is the tough durable part of pottery.
