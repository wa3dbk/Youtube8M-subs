00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.840
Forget about Scorpion vs. Johnny Cage, and
Blanka vs. M. Bison.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
Forget that weak crap.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.980
You want to see a real battle between heavyweights?

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.800
Between gaming legends whose very names strike
the fear of God in all who hear them?

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.820
How about Joe vs. Nick?!

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.840
Oh, what's that?

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.850
Sorry, I couldn't make that out through your
cries of terror.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.309
Well, whatever you're trying to say, make
it fast.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:55.670
Because here comes Warren, motherf*ckers.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.690
So this game has some of the weakest names,
I've ever seen in a fighting game.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.740
I was expecting the boss battle to be a sew-off
between Billy and Gertrude.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.900
But the name of the game might be even worse.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.890
This is Deadly Moves?or at least, that's what
it's called on the Genesis.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.330
On the Super Nintendo, it's called Power Moves.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.520
And in Japan?

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.360
Power Athlete.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.570
Power Athlete.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.850
I can't tell if that's a video game or a sports
drink.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.670
Now, if you weren't around back in the early
90s, you might not know this.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.420
But after the release of Street Fighter II,
there were suddenly a million fighting games,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.860
all trying to do pretty much the same thing.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.760
In terms of its core mechanics, this is about
as generic a Street Fighter clone as you're

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.760
going to find.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.750
The fighting in Deadly Moves is as uninspired
as its name department evidently was throughout

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.990
the entire project.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.860
But surprisingly, there is some cool stuff
here.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:02:04.229
Not the least of which David Bowie, from Labyrinth.

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.510
So the first cool thing is that it's kind
of set up like Mega Man.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.150
You have to play as Joe, because honestly,
who else is there but Joe?

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.930
But you actually get to choose your opponents,
and the path you take through them.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.780
So if one of them is giving you trouble, you
can choose someone else and go back to them

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.780
later.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.620
Which is actually effective because of the
other interesting thing about Deadly Moves.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.090
After each fight, Joe automatically levels
up based on the skills of the guy he just

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.090
beat.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.200
And yes, chances are it's a guy.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.630
There's one woman in this game, and obviously,
she's in no way a token female character inspired

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.510
by an iconic female character from a different
fighter.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.510
Nope.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.760
And I'm not trying to be Chun-Li-er, funny.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.459
Not trying to be funny here.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.500
Unfortunately, that's about where the cool
stuff ends with Deadly Moves.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.920
In terms of how the game plays, it's just?it's
a pretty standard fighter.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.540
I guess one thing that does set it apart from
Street Fighter is that there's actually some

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.730
depth to the playing field.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.600
So you have multiple planes to work with.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.959
And I mean I guess that's something.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.800
But otherwise, the game's kind of a plane
crash.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.720
In fact, I think the game's backgrounds are
indicative of the entire package.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.959
They're usually pretty empty, pretty boring
not much seems to have gone into it.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.160
The game looks awful, sounds even worse.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.280
I guess the best thing you can say about it
is that it plays okay.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.020
It's generic, and uninspired.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.110
But functionally?

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.310
Yeah, it plays okay.

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.120
Alright, maybe calling it a plane crash is
a little extreme.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.120
It's not that bad.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.640
But it's one of those games that's so average
and non-distinct, it's almost worse.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.990
It's pretty clearly a game that was rushed
out to make a couple of bucks off the Street

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.990
Fighter craze, so no matter how well the game
plays,it's still just a soulless clone.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.270
With names like Joe, and Warren.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.940
And Deadly Moves.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.940
Deadly Moves.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.810
No one even dies.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.030
Thanks to our friend Frank from San Leandro,
California, for sending it in.
