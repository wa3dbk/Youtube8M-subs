00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:10.426
&gt;&gt;Good morning and welcome
to "Forest Lake Today".

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:12.416
Alex, do you have any announcements?

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:15.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Watching the morning
TV show at Forest Lake Elementary

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:19.176
in Columbia, South Carolina,
gives you a good sense

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:20.486
of what this school is all about.

00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:23.536
&gt;&gt;Speaking of cool, Robert, what's
the weather going to be like today?

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:24.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It is a place

00:00:24.906 --> 00:00:29.276
where differentiated instruction
sparks every individual's passion

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:29.846
for learning.

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:32.636
&gt;&gt;Right now I want to introduce
you to our team, and they're going

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:34.416
to tell you about their invention.

00:00:34.776 --> 00:00:39.816
&gt;&gt;Well, the Sani-Sipper, there's a
tube that hooks up to this nozzle,

00:00:39.816 --> 00:00:46.456
and it has a detector, causing the
sanitizer to clean it at every use.

00:00:47.216 --> 00:00:50.766
&gt;&gt;Our mission is the
super-absorbent polymer.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They have partnered
with NASA and focused on science,

00:00:53.976 --> 00:00:56.696
technology, engineering,
math and geography.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.706
&gt;&gt;Here. Let's link this up.

00:00:58.156 --> 00:00:58.796
We might need this.

00:00:59.216 --> 00:01:01.556
&gt;&gt;I think many, many years
ago students who were

00:01:01.556 --> 00:01:04.656
in teacher-education programs learned
how to kind of teach down the middle

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:06.076
and do a little here
and a little there.

00:01:06.076 --> 00:01:08.916
Well, we know that that's not
right for children, and there's no

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:11.156
such thing as a regular classroom.

00:01:11.156 --> 00:01:14.946
Our school is a microcosm of
the world, so we work very hard

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:16.906
to make sure that we
know where children are.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:19.896
We don't take time to teach
things that they already know.

00:01:20.216 --> 00:01:23.446
We try to go where they are
and take them as far as we can.

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:24.496
&gt;&gt;Absolutely.

00:01:24.496 --> 00:01:26.176
Deval, did you want to add to that?

00:01:26.366 --> 00:01:28.636
&gt;&gt;You'll see the students are
at different stations working

00:01:28.696 --> 00:01:32.786
on different projects and different
tasks that they need to accomplish.

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:35.396
The students are self-directed.

00:01:35.446 --> 00:01:37.896
They know what it is that they
are supposed to be working on,

00:01:38.106 --> 00:01:42.166
and this enables the teacher to
work with children as a facilitator

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:45.576
and also provide extra attention
in areas where it is needed.

00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:46.526
&gt;&gt;Martha Washington.

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:47.646
There she is.

00:01:48.116 --> 00:01:51.926
&gt;&gt;Everybody's showing their learning
in a way that is comfortable to them.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:55.716
They're learning the subject
matter that we assign,

00:01:56.156 --> 00:01:58.196
but they're expressing
it in different ways.

00:01:58.196 --> 00:02:01.256
&gt;&gt;If you missed any, you can go
back and look at your question.

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:05.176
&gt;&gt;At the beginning of the year
we do a variety of assessments.

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:08.806
We have our MAT testing, which
is a computerized assessment,

00:02:09.126 --> 00:02:12.786
and it gives us feedback as far
as different literary strands

00:02:12.786 --> 00:02:14.166
and mathematical strands.

00:02:14.536 --> 00:02:18.186
And it breaks it down for each child
to let us know what range they're in

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:20.116
and how we can better group them,

00:02:20.116 --> 00:02:22.496
how we could better teach
them within those groups.

00:02:22.916 --> 00:02:27.286
&gt;&gt;I decided I want to be a police
officer the day two officers came

00:02:27.286 --> 00:02:27.916
to our school.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:33.376
&gt;&gt;And we also have palm pilots,
where we sit one on one with a child

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:35.366
and we assess their
reading abilities.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:37.256
&gt;&gt;They told us all about their jobs

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:40.876
and how the police dogs
work, works with them.

00:02:41.316 --> 00:02:45.406
&gt;&gt;It's work that's well worth it
when you see how far they've grown,

00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:50.436
not only in terms of numbers and
scores, but you see their ability

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:53.526
to do things at the end of the year
that they couldn't do, quite frankly,

00:02:53.526 --> 00:02:55.816
or couldn't do well at
the beginning of the year.

00:02:55.816 --> 00:02:59.526
You feel a sense of gratification,
and that's why we're in it.

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:03.956
&gt;&gt;That might be good that the classes
work as a group, collaboratively.

00:03:04.186 --> 00:03:06.766
&gt;&gt;Kappy: We've used a number of
different models over the years

00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.336
for staff development and training.

00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:10.036
At this point in our process,

00:03:10.086 --> 00:03:14.076
we use a collaborative
meeting every other week,

00:03:14.476 --> 00:03:18.466
and that is a very
honored, treasured time.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:19.946
You don't miss your collaborative.

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:22.956
Professionally speaking,
everyone expects you to be there,

00:03:22.956 --> 00:03:26.896
and it's a meeting that you don't
want to miss, because it's a meeting

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:31.286
where you kind of massage your
unit plan to be better and better.

00:03:31.346 --> 00:03:34.276
&gt;&gt;We can take an inventory of things
that they want to specifically learn

00:03:34.276 --> 00:03:35.736
about that country
and not necessarily--

00:03:35.906 --> 00:03:39.206
We're doing graphing and math, so
that'll be a great way to tie in.

00:03:39.206 --> 00:03:41.876
&gt;&gt;You want to use the pointer and
make it go up a little bit more?

00:03:42.056 --> 00:03:44.256
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Technology
is ubiquitous here.

00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:45.436
&gt;&gt;You ready to check that out?

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:46.276
Go ahead.

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:49.956
&gt;&gt;From the biometric system
used to check out library books

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:52.816
to the student response systems.

00:03:52.816 --> 00:03:56.346
&gt;&gt;Two nights plus three
nights plus one night, please.

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:59.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To white boards that
bring the world to the classroom.

00:03:59.126 --> 00:04:01.766
&gt;&gt;And my friends and I
will be so happy to start

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.886
with our Arabic national anthem.

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:09.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To the keyboards.

00:04:09.696 --> 00:04:09.763
[ keyboard music playing ]

00:04:09.763 --> 00:04:09.926
&gt;&gt;Left, right.

00:04:10.086 --> 00:04:12.016
&gt;&gt;Kappy: Actually, there're probably
a number of schools that have

00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:14.206
as much technology as we do.

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:18.436
I think the difference is that at
Forest Lake we use the technology

00:04:18.826 --> 00:04:23.686
and we maximize it, and the only way
to do that is to constantly train

00:04:23.856 --> 00:04:29.316
and to constantly think ahead to find
out what technology is applicable

00:04:29.316 --> 00:04:33.616
and helpful and can be used as
a tool for academic achievement.

00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:37.936
&gt;&gt;The first step, as I put them in
different cups, one was polymer.

00:04:37.936 --> 00:04:39.786
One they did with the Dr. Pepper.

00:04:40.086 --> 00:04:41.696
One they did with the
cranberry juice,

00:04:41.696 --> 00:04:43.506
and the other they
did with low-fat milk.

00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:45.946
&gt;&gt;What attracted you to do
this type of experiment?

00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:50.106
&gt;&gt;I always wanted to help people
and be a surgeon or a doctor,

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:54.866
and so I'm like, I really like NASA,
and so I'm thinking about being a--

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:56.236
I want to be a doctor there.

00:04:56.996 --> 00:05:01.876
&gt;&gt;Sometimes I just go to,
like, writing Web sites,

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:05.976
because I'm thinking about
being an author when I'm older.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.866
&gt;&gt;I want to be a vet or
I want to be a doctor,

00:05:08.866 --> 00:05:12.086
maybe a teacher or a librarian.

00:05:12.086 --> 00:05:14.736
I still have lots of things.

00:05:14.736 --> 00:05:16.916
My first thing was
a rocket scientist.
