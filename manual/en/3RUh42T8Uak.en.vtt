00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.580
Hi everyone, it's me Eylem and I've got a new DIY for you!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:07.360
We are going to do a cool destroyed jeans!

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.000
if you have an old one in the closet, get it out! 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.040
we are going to make something great out of it!

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.060
we are not just going to cut it, that would be way too boring. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.620
We are going to make the white threads visible! Wohoo!

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:27.634
I will show you what I mean.

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:30.614
it shoud look like this afterwards

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.960
The things you will need are: 

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.055
a cheese grater

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.920
a small or a big one, doesn't matter

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.720
a seam ripper, like this one

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.900
some taylor chalk

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.420
just a little piece

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:51.594
or just use a simple pen, we are going to cut it anyway

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.020
we will need some scissors to do that. take a large or a little one whatever you prefer

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.460
finally we are going to start now

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.140
I already marked the slits I want to cut 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.700
that's where my knee was, I think

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.780
and I draw some lines around the knee area

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:18.854
I hope you can see the markings

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.540
take your scissors...

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.320
pull up the front of the leg a bit

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.680
and start cutting into your pants

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.820
where you marked your pants

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.120
stupid scissors won't work properly

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.300
finally I cut a few holes into it

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.580
I will try if the small scissors work better...

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.200
and now try to cut very straight

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.080
before I forget it!

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.800
I've already tried it on the other side

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:13.520
be careful! Only cut through the blue threads to leave the white ones whole

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.520
on the inside you will see how the treads run diagonally

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.220
if you cut crooked then you will just have some holes in your pants

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.133
there will be only some threads hanging around a hole

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.108
so try to work very carefully

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.560
now I'm done with the cutting part

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.480
Now let's take the seam pipper 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.260
if you don't own this thing to unseam the fabric, you can use some tweezers aswell

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.760
try to pull out the blue threads very carefully

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.320
the beginning is a bit tricky

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.020
after you've got the first few it get's better

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.080
you just have to loosen the threads a bit to pull them out with your fingers

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.660
all right, I hope you can see it properly

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.680
we are going to do this for the whole part we've cut out till there are only white threads left

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.340
then it's going to look really cool 

00:03:28.955 --> 00:03:30.955
especially if it's all done :)

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.980
let's continue

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.600
I took all the blue threads out and it looks pretty good already

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.260
it took me about 10 minutes to do this part

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.740
once you have gotten into the movement you have to be  careful not to unseam the whole jeans

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.180
no worries, it is easier then it looks

00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.475
just try it

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.120
now I will show you another technique, put the scissors away

00:04:05.354 --> 00:04:07.354
take your grater

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.880
you have to be very careful to keep the white threads whole

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.580
only use the grater in one direction

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.840
and take care of your fingers

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.560
it is maybe s bit quicker than the other technique

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.840
but it roughens up the fabric pretty much

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.620
you have to decide for yourself what you like best

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:44.673
the first technique is definately a bit more precise

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.300
but I will continue with the grating a bit. Let's see how it will work out...

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:58.180
if you have totally messed up you pants now, just make shorts out of them ;)

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:05.880
here you can see the difference between the techniques

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.700
I would use the grater only for some small parts

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.960
and I think it works quite well at the rim of the pockets

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.980
let's try it

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.740
I definitely prefer the used look

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.900
Loo, the grater worked very well at the pockets

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.960
the pocket part would be way too difficult with the scissors

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.760
take your sandpaper

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.100
and just give your pants a thorough all over scrubbing to complete the used look

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.400
it's getting a bit louder now, just turn up the music ;)

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.860
Tadaaaa! That's how the pants look like after 15 minutes of "destroying" it!

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.180
if you want give your jeans a nice used look as well don't forget to: 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.260
1. try on the pants to know where your knees really are

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.980
just do a little squat to place the cuts right on the knee

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.560
2.  cut very straight otherwise you will cut through the white threads

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:34.580
3. wash your jeans after you "destroyed" them

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:39.100
they will look even better afterwards

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.900
those are the two techniques I know, with scissors and the grater

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:46.660
do you know another one? Because I have some more jeans in my closet ;)

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.840
Please let me know in the comments

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:55.120
which technique do you like best? 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.820
are you going to try it out as well? 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.640
thats all for now

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.760
I'm happy if you are going to watch my next video as well! 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.840
Thanks for your thumbs up! 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.780
Bye! See you soon!
