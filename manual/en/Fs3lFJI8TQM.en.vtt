00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.880
Okay, now we are ready to make our angled
piece. You are definitely going to want to

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.120
put an angled piece in your skirt if you want
to have any kind of twirl to it. And what

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.420
I do is I take one of the strips that I made,
this is about half a yard, or excuse me, this

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.650
is a yard cut in half, the lengthwise because
you always want to keep the stretchy part

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.470
to the smaller pieces. So the stretchy part
should be the shorter part. Because the more

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.550
you have to stretch on, or the more you have
to sew on the stretchy part, the more likely

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.100
you're going to have errors. What you do is
you lay it out flat, and this is just something

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.609
I found through trial and error that works
great. Whoops. Get your, so this side you

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:53.649
want to leave it so it's overhanging on both
sides, right here, and that is so you have

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.609
a little bit of material at the top to put
it in. So you don't want to fold it exactly

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:05.230
in half. And then you're just going to go
ahead and cut it all the way down. Now this

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.090
is one time you cannot rip it because we're
not going, we're going at an angle on the

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:19.020
material. So this is one time I'm forced to
use the scissors. But since I love making

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.509
skirts enough, I don't mind. Keep your hand
on there to hold it so it doesn't pull out

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.540
funny. If you have any little minor errors
you can always adjust when you're going down

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.689
the sides, and when you're done. This only
works also with material that is the same

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.320
on both sides. If you do this with a patterned
material you will need to do it twice because

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.689
otherwise you will have two pieces that face
this way, and what you need is a piece that

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.570
will face each way, both ways. Like that.
So when you're done it should look something

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.399
like this, one straight edge and one angle.
