00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.620
What's up? 
Welcome back to ComputerTV.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.110
And I've got a really 
cool camera.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:13.650
That they actually 
gave me to play with.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:14.480
I'm so excited!

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.120
I am really impressed 
with image quality.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.450
So clear! 
And so colorful.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.190
This is the 
A1050 Digital Camera

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.330
from General Electric. 
A great brand in technology.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.430
It has great features.
It's got 10 megpixels

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.070
and 5x optical zoom.  
Look at that.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.400
That's like...
That's some zoom.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.270
It's better zoom 
than most cameras.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.850
It has a 2.5 LCD screen.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.810
And a bunch 
of features like,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.350
Auto Scene detection.
Image reduction.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.280
And Panoramic, 
which I like.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.560
Which is one of my 
favorite features.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.420
The Panoramic view.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290
But other than that I'm 
impressed with this camera.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.090
With the image 
quality itself,

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.810
it makes it worth going 
out and getting.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.670
Let's take a quick tour.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.430
If we go to the top 
of this camera,

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.810
we start with the 
power button.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.770
And next to it is the 
shutter button.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.010
Very simple design. 
Very easy to use.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.060
And then you have your 
function selector wheel

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.580
here that you go back 
from Movie mode.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.310
So this camera actually comes  
equipped with Movie mode.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.160
And you have scene selection,
panoramic view,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.360
automatic detection, 
shake reduction.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.930
I mean, the features on 
this camera are endless.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.500
So this is a great camera 
if you're starting to actually

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.700
get the hang of digital 
camera photography.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.640
Up here on the back 
you have your

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.860
telephoto, wide and zoom 
in and out button.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440
And then you have your 
feature wheel here.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.140
These are the shortcuts.  
Your exposure right here.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.020
Your macro, your have 
your self timer,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.680
and then the 
flash option.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.150
This button is the actual 
Smile Detection mode.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.790
Where you have this cute 
little guy that comes out.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.030
With a smiley face.
Which means it's ready

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.120
to take smile capture. 
And then you have

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.470
the one without 
the smiley face,

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.430
which means it's off.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.130
If you look over 
here you know that

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.440
this is the Blink 
Detection mode that

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.440
comes automatically 
on, on this camera.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.340
You also have your 
menu features here.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.740
Which goes a little 
more in depth

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.110
as far as the aperture 
and the ISO settings.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.750
The ISO settings, 
by the way,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.920
are up to 1600, so 
it's a pretty powerful

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.950
digital camera from 
General Electric.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.720
Your movies are done 
in Quicktime and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.730
your scene selection 
modes are,

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.330
you have up to 12 
to choose from.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.130
So you have them 
down here.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.440
This is your landscaping. 
Which is where

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.440
I was really 
impressed with.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.140
Because the greens on the 
flowers and the reds and the...

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.580
I mean they came 
out so clear.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.070
I was thrown back by the 
actual image quality.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.010
The maximum aperture 
actually varies between

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.910
3.0 to 4.7

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.620
And then you have 
the panoramic view.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.360
Which is great when 
you're out camping

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.830
or you're on the 
mountainside.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.000
So if you start with 
your first frame

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.450
you point, you click, it 
takes your first frame.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.730
Then you line up.
You see that little cursor?

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.470
You have to line 
up that cursor

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.340
to where it has it 
here on this side.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.670
So you have 
your indicator.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.980
And then you line 
up your cursor.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.630
You take your 
second frame.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.590
And so on, until you get 
your full panoramic view.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.790
If you look in the front. 
Look at that.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.490
Thats the 5x zoom. 
Look how far out it can go.

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.830
So you could take 
pretty good pictures.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.100
If you wanted to 
take pictures of

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.060
your grandfather's 
nose hairs

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.890
I'm sure you 
can do it.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.900
Other than that, it 
comes equipped with

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.080
double A batteries. 
And you can stick

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.400
an SD, an SDHC card 
in here for maximum

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120
pictures. 
You have your battery slot here.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.990
And that's where the 
SD and SDHC slot go.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.960
And this is a 
great camera.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.320
I really do recommend 
buying this camera.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.340
It's the A1050 
from General Electric.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.600

by all means, email me.
