00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.280
Hello everyone today is July 3,2014 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.860
and we are going to look at this 11 cob cannon setup

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.300
unlike our usual setups today we have

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.380
a setup that has an entire row which is completely ampty

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.320
Well almost empty cause we are using it for Ice shroom spots

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.260
For this setup we must remember that the Ice Shrooms

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.200
are in a very dangerous spot because

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.240
because the zombies can just ran them over or probably eat them

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.960
also we have no winter melons on the upper half

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.800
making the Giga-gargantuars even more dangerous because

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.980
they would be able to advance even further and faster

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.660
for this setup we have 11 cob cannons

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.800
4 Doom shroom spots, 5 Ice Shroom spots

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.520
and 5 twin sunflowers

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.100
we also brought flowerpots and puff shrooms for additional delay tactics

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.440
against giga gargantuars

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.780
for this setup we need to lanch a single cob from a cob cannon

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.960
to anticipate the arrival of the disco zombies

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.760
and to prevent them from summoning any backup dancers

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.400
next we launch another cob to the bottom half

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.620
a few moments after the entire wave arrived

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.480
this should maximize the damage dealt causing the arrival of

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.320
the next wave of zombies to be triggered

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.120
next we give a coffee bean to an Ice Shroom

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.340
a few moments after the second cob hits

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.220
this should freeze the incoming wave of zombies the moment they arrive

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.620
we then launch another cob from a cob cannon the moment the zombies

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.380
arrive and this should eliminate the digger zombies  and zombonis 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.180
from the next wave

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.400
we then launch two cobs from the available cob cannons

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.820
a few moments after the freezing effect of the Ice Shrooms wear off

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.360
this should eliminate the dolphins and deal some extra damage

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.280
thus triggering the arrival of the next wave

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.220
Doom Shrooms should deal extra damage to the incoming wave

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.480
of zombies but should detonate before

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.480
the disco zombies would be able to summon their backup dancers

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.460
we also need to launch cobs to the imps on the lower half

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.680
of the setup every now and then to avoid them from reaching the house

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.160
The entire setup is designed to be more stable

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.780
 the more Ice Shrooms are stored for future use

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.420
and the Doom shrooms are just there to help you out

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.760
When there isn't any Ice Shrooms available

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.780
they both help each other out bt you also need to remember that

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.280
the entire setup need to maintain a certain rythmn 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.660
to keep every single wave of zombies under control

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.140
for bungee zombies it's best to freeze them the moment they land

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.200
or you can use cob cannons to eliminate them as soon as possible

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.640
for ambush pool zombies it's best to use Ice shrooms

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.040
to keep them from arrive and for freezing the Final wave

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.400
but you may also use cob cannons if you like

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.940
certain modifications for the setup wold be

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.400
well, to add wintermelons :)

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.380
it makes the entire setp safer and a lot easier to use

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.360
or you could add a few laddered plants on the lower half

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.660
just to make it even easier

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.100
overall the setup is a bit intimidating but

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.740
but also pretty simple once you get the pattern

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.820
for the Ice Shrooms and Doom Shrooms
