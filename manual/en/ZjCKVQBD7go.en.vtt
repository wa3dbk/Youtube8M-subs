Voiceover:The Wood
Whisperer is sponsored by

00:00:02.135 --> 00:00:06.720
Powermatic, the gold standard since 1921.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:20.186
(fast paced music)

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:21.488
Voiceover:Welcome to the Association

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:24.191
of Woodworking and
Furnishing Suppliers Fair.

00:00:24.291 --> 00:00:27.260
Better known as AWFS 2009.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.699
The show takes place every
two years in Las Vegas

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:33.133
and features tools and innovations from

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.301
around the world.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:35.835
Let me give you a quick tour.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.704
There were two halls this year.

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:42.177
Basically, one with
machines and one without.

00:00:43.377 --> 00:00:45.879
Now, one of my favorite parts of AWFS

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.948
is the student furniture competition.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.850
And we'll have an entire video dedicated

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.170
to that later.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.687
And this year's show
featured the green desk,

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:55.155
where people can ask questions about

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.589
products and practices.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:00:58.826
And remember that wooden race car called

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:00.227
The Splinter?

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:02.629
I actually had a chance
to see it in person.

00:01:02.963 --> 00:01:04.832
This is simply a stunning piece of

00:01:04.832 --> 00:01:07.330
craftsmanship and I'll
just shut up and let you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.201
enjoy the view.

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:21.148
(quiet piano music)

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.450
During the show we
decided to have a little

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.318
Wood Whisperer meetup which turned out

00:01:24.318 --> 00:01:25.552
to be a blast.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.487
We had a chance to meet
some of the chat room

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.390
and forum regulars, as well as some folks

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.291
who just enjoy watching the show.

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.560
We had some lunch, gave away some shirts

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.295
and DVDs, and pretty much talked about

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:38.565
woodworking and AWFS the entire time.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:40.600
Nicole and I would like to thank everyone

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.469
who took the time to hang out with us.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.710
So stay tuned for a
number of product reviews

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.508
and demonstrations as we
show you all the stuff

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:50.877
we found interesting at AWFS 2009.

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:57.653
And since you guys requested
it, here's a little

00:01:57.653 --> 00:02:00.190
footage from the belt sander races.

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:15.636
(fast paced music)

00:02:15.636 --> 00:02:18.638
(cheering)

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.850
(cheering)

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.889
(cheering)

00:02:40.594 --> 00:02:41.929
Matt:This is Matt from
Matt's Basement Workshop

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.731
and you've been watching some guy

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:45.634
who whispers to wood or something.

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:47.368
And I like him, I hope you do.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.902
Well, I don't really like him.
