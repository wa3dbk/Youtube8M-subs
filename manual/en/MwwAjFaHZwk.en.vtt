00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.440
I don't know what to say, just because...

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.740
it's the shit, my dear!

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.280
It's exactly what we need and and want to have.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.220
So much better, than I expected it to be!

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.040
You're on vacation and get concerts on top and all over the place.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.400
That's madness!

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.380
You meet musicians, have a chat with them or enjoy drinks.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.380
Wacken with luxury.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.800
There we have the pool.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.380
An awesome whirlpool.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.860
You don't have that at a regular festival.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.100
Bands, food and your cabin are all close by.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.240
It's not like a festival where you have to walk quite a bit.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.220
Great food, even when it comes to pizza or pasta.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.320
It's all very well organized. That's what I like.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.280
You're actually getting something for your money.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.040
I hope for more ships. All next to each other.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.840
To jump over to the next ship, where Rammstein is playing...

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.300
Well, go get Rammstein. How should they perform on board without pyro?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.100
It's a challenge to enjoy everything on board.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.980
If you do shore leaves you wouldn't see all of it.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.740
Many highlights. Hard to tell!

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.480
Every day is a new highlight.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.120
Piles of highlights!

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.420
Form your opinion about this, but it's not half as...

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.860
Half as fabulous...

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.240
...as it really is!

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.660
It's truely unique and we're going to be here again and again!

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.720
Every Full Metal Cruise.
