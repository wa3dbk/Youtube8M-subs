Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we are
going to cut out another heart to place on

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:14.719
the blanket side of the asleep bear. We are
going to embroider good night on it. So let's

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:26.980
again fold your filth in half and cut out
a nice little heart shape. We are going to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:37.699
apply that right to center of one side of
the blanket. So if put this here now you want

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.379
to make sure you place it about three quarter
of a inch down from the top. So it does not

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.199
get caught while we are sewing on the top
of the blanket. So you want it to be three

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.369
quarters of a inch down in the center of the
front half of the blanket. So put a little

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:05.519
pin to hold that in place. Then open it up
to work on it. Knot your thread and start

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.549
from the back section and come up through
the front. Then just a nice little in and

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:24.170
out stitch gives it a really nice homemade
look. But you can attach this with a machine

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:33.999
stitch if you like. A little bit quicker but
this is, has a lot more character when you

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:45.600
sew it by hand.
Now in this heart we would probably embroiderer

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.119
good night or you can embroider sleepy time
or if you want you can just embroider a child's

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:13.030
name on it. We would just finish up this embroidering
it on and just go to the back and tie a knot.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:23.170
Just take a little bit of the fabric and make
a loop, we would pull that loop down to make

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:33.489
another loop. Then put your needle through
and pull that last loop.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.709
Next, we would be embroidering the faces of
our bears.
