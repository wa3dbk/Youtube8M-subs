Marcus: “That’s a bit of a difficult one. You need to really be able to work together and discuss things together."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.500
"But he is also the one you will first be compared against. So he is always the one you want to beat.”

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.500
Felipe: “The job is to be the best on track. But if our relationship is good I think it can only bring benefits to the team.”

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.500
Beat (Team Manager): “It was always important to share our experience with the young drivers"

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
"always hoping to turn a talent into one of the sports' greats.”

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.500
And the desire for that has rarely been bigger than today.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.500
Monisha (Team Principal): “2014 was the worst year in our history. We could have done much more last year.”

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Marcus: “The closer you get to the season, of course, there is also more pressure. That’s part of the job as well."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.500
"It’s not anything that holds me down. It’s just something that motivates me, really.”

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.500
Monisha: “I expect that they put into performance that motivation and the aims they have for themselves and show it in their performance.”

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.500
Beat: “What we expect is for them to show a learning curve. A steep learning curve.”

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.500
12 days of testing with a learning curve as well. A curve from reliability to speed. For both the car and driver.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Marcus: “The last couple of test days were more performance-related. So far, it is very promising, but as always in Formula 1"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.500
"you never really know where you are until the racing starts.”
