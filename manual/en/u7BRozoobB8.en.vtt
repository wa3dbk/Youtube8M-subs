00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:09.743
Hi, I'm Marci from Cleanwaste. I would like to show you a great way to manage human waste when normal facilities aren't available or easily accessible.

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:14.848
You may be headed outdoors, planning your emergency preparedness kit, or simply heading out on the road.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:19.786
In any case you will need a safe and dignified method to deal with human waste.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:23.524
Allow me to show you the Cleanwaste Go Anywhere Toilet System.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:29.329
The great thing about the Cleanwaste Go Anywhere Toilet System is that you can use as much or as little as you need.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.899
These are products that you can build on.

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.907
Start with our Poo Powder waste treatment, that contains a natural deodorizer which helps control odors,

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:43.953
a decay catalyst that breaks down solid waste, and a gelling agent that turns liquid waste into a solid.

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:48.281
You can add Poo Powder to your own bag to gel and treat liquid and solid waste

00:00:48.281 --> 00:00:52.853
or add additional Poo Powder to our Go Anywhere Waste Kits to extend the life of the kit.

00:00:52.853 --> 00:00:58.524
One scoop of waste treatment powder gels and treats up to 21 ounces of liquid waste in seconds

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.295
making your waste safe and easy to transport.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:06.233
If you don't want to make your own kits our biodegradable Go Anywhere Toilet Kits have everything you need.

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:10.068
Each kit includes: a waste disposal bag

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:14.901
toilet paper

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.388
a hand sanitizer

00:01:20.004 --> 00:01:25.243
and the waste collection bag. Which contains enough Poo Powder to gel 32 ounces of waste.

00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:27.180
Enough for multiple uses.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.659
Our kits can be used on the ground, in a bucket, or with any portable toilet.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.930
It can also fit a standard non working toilet.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.205
Use it! Seal it!  andToss it!

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:41.381
Wanna go in comfort?

00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:48.909
The Go Anywhere Toilet folds up to the size of a briefcase. 5 Inches by 14 by 19 and is the same height as a standard toilet.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.703
Simply fold open the legs until you hear a clicking noise.

00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.943
Remove the top cover

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.062
and place behind the back two legs for stability on soft ground.

00:02:08.062 --> 00:02:10.897
Next, lift the toilet seat

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:15.201
place your disposal bag in the bottom of the mesh for safe keeping

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:20.974
and then, place the waste collection bag inside the toilet.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:25.846
Simply open it wide to expose the Poo Powder

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:30.584
close the lid and you are ready to go.

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:36.356
An alternative method for inserting the collection bag is to place it over the top of the seat

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:41.644
this keeps a safe sanitary surface when using with a group.

00:02:44.198 --> 00:02:48.801
Need a little privacy? It's not a problem with the Go Anywhere Privacy Shelter!

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:53.712
The Go Anywhere Privacy Shelter is easy to assemble.

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:10.284
And the shelter comes with ropes and tent stakes that you will need in case you should ever need to secure your tent to the ground.

00:03:10.284 --> 00:03:13.760
To deploy the shelter make sure the elbows are facing upwards

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.281
then locate the rope that is in the center of the tent.

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:27.382
As you pull up start locking the hinges into place by applying pressure to both above and below each hinge

00:03:27.382 --> 00:03:29.303
locking them into place.

00:03:34.303 --> 00:03:36.019
Then do the same for the bottom hinges.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.294
Ground secure flaps can provide additional security when you are using your tent on a solid surface.

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:18.379
Notice there are three windows that can help with cross ventilation

00:04:18.517 --> 00:04:21.451
that can also be closed.

00:04:22.297 --> 00:04:27.273
There is also a storage compartment that you can put additional waste kits in.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.568
In the top there is a sealable opening that can be used for a shower attachment.

00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:36.110
and a loop to hold the shower head.

00:04:36.202 --> 00:04:38.377
Need a place to stow and carry your Go Anywhere Toilet System?

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.201
We offer a backpack where you can stow the shelter

00:04:43.293 --> 00:04:44.901
your waste kits

00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:46.970
the toilet

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:51.885
and even a place for your used waste kits.

00:04:54.147 --> 00:04:56.216
The backpack has padded straps

00:04:56.216 --> 00:05:00.968
and best of all it only weighs 18 pounds.

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:02.502
