00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:11.090
Rafter layout; one of the most interesting
parts of construction. I'm Robert Markey,

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.510
I've been doing instruction, especially framing
and rafters, for many years. I'm going to

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:24.710
talk about common rafter layout. Okay, we'll
assume that you know your roof pitch which

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.369
is something and twelve. Let's say it's nine
and twelve. And we'll assume you know your

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.710
rafter length, okay. And your rafter length;
if you don't have it and you just know your

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.960
height and your horizontal distance it's the
Pythagorean Theorem, A squared plus B squared

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.649
equals C squared. It gives you your common
rafter length, okay. In order to lay it out

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.750
well you can just use a framing square, but
if you have these nice little brass thingies

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:07.549
it makes it much easier. So, we've got em'
set at nine and twelve, put the top of our

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:23.459
rafter.
It's our ridge, and actually you want to cut

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:30.909
that first so you got somethin' nice to hook
your tape on, and then you measure your rafter

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:43.279
length to the outside of your top plate. And
let's assume it's a seventy two inch rafter,

00:01:43.279 --> 00:02:09.619
so we now make a mark there from the top,
come down, okay. So, this is this is your

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:18.360
length. Now, once you have this, the rafter
tail, the bird's mouth needs to be dealt with

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.780
if you're using two by four walls say, or
let's say two by six cause' we want more insulation

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.980
you could come over five and a half inches.
If you got plywood on the outside you'd come

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.959
over six, but let's just work it this way.
Here's your bird's mouth right there, so the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:45.980
rafter sits, the rafter's going to sit like
this for your rafter tail, and then it depends

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.290
very much on what your what your trim work,
what your corners work is like. And you may

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.099
come over here and you may cut this this way,
you may cut it straight. You may come back

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:01.299
here and straight up for for something like
that, and that's all in the design work, but

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.920
the essential mathematical piece of laying
out the rafters; here we got it. I'm Robert

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.379
Markey, and we've been talking about common
rafter layout.
