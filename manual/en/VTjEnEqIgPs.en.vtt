"Cannabis Receptors &amp; Food"

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.740
In 1973, scientists discovered that we
have specific receptors in our brain for

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.690
opiate drugs like
heroin and morphine.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.139
Since we didn’t evolve shooting up,
it stood to reason there were

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.440
natural compounds produced by
our bodies that fit into those receptors.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.611
So we went looking,
discovered them,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.720
and named them
endogenous morphines—

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.060
or endorphins, for short.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.600
And endorphins are good;
they’re our natural pain relievers—

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.430
released during exercise,
the consumption of spicy food,

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.510
and orgasm.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.800
So, there are healthier ways to stimulate
these receptors than shooting up heroin.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.109
In 1990, scientists discovered that we
have specific receptors in our brain for

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.850
the active ingredient in marijuana
as well—cannabinoids like THC.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.949
Since we didn’t evolve toking up,
it stood to reason there were

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.089
natural compounds produced by
our bodies that fit into those receptors.

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.680
So we went looking,
discovered them,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.170
and named them endocannabinoids—
endogenous cannabinoids.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.550
And endocannabinoids are good;
they’re one of our bodies’ ways

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.880
to ease nausea, ease pain,
generally chill us out.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.210
The question is; is there a way
to get the good without the bad—

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.909
stimulate these receptors
without smoking marijuana?

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.440
What’s so bad about
smoking marijuana?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.750
Lung cancer.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:24.320
Smoking just a single joint is like
smoking an entire pack of cigarettes.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.829
The worst death I ever witnessed
in my medical career,

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:31.350
the one that gives me
the most nightmares,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.750
was a lung cancer victim
gasping for breath,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.500
being drowned 
by their tumors.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.939
It was hideous.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.170
Please don’t smoke—anything.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.310
Smoke inhalation is bad,
no matter what the source.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.030
Thankfully, researchers
discovered a food this year

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.490
that stimulates
cannabinoid receptors,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.710
so you can get the benefits
without the risks.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.990
Which food was it?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.799
Was it broccoli, coconuts, garlic,
green tea, mushrooms, or tomatoes?

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.829
It was the tea.
