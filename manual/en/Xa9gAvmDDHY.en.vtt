00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.930
Who wouldn’t want to spend more time in
the world of Finding Nemo, spending your time

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.130
under the sea?

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.540
Oh wait, wrong movie.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.290
The world of Finding Nemo was one of the most
beautiful, creative and unique worlds ever

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.290
created.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
It is disappointing to not being able to say
the same about the video game counterpart.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:01:01.510
But the game does retain the thing that made
the movie so special, and that was its style.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.680
The game starts with you playing as Nemo but
soon after Nemo is captured, you switch control

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.670
to Marvin as he searches everything in the
big blue ocean for his son.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.290
The story line follows the same path as the
film, with footage from the movie being used

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.140
for many of the game’s cutscenes.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.720
The game also does a great job recreating
the ocean.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.280
The water looks blue and there are plenty
of collectables and fish to find throughout

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280
the levels.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.240
It all builds together to make you feel like
you are playing the movie, which is a great

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240
thing.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.000
The downfall of the game is the gameplay itself,
and even that is not so bad.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.420
The film pushed what could be done with animation
forward, showing new ideas that would become

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.430
staples.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.229
The game does not do that, instead offering
very familiar gameplay, and while it is not

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.380
innovative, it is functional and entertaining.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.640
The majority of the game is played from a
side-scrolling perspective.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.530
You will swim all around, looking for shells,
battling clams, and of course swimming through

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.050
bubble rings.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.140
The game also has some parts that are more
3D, with you swimming either towards or away

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.510
from the camera.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.880
These sections are great but do bring back
some painful memories of Superman 64, on rails

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.420
and having to swim through rings.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.520
Bad, bad memories.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.000
Thankfully, unlike Superman they control wonderfully
and there is no time-limit, allowing you to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.540
move at your pace which you will have to to
avoid the enemies.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.190
You gain health by finding shrimp, each one
being a hit you can take.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.340
But you won’t really need to worry about
them and that bring up the game’s biggest

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.880
fault and that is its difficulty.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:57.860
It is obviously geared towards a younger audience,
and its difficulty reflects that.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.900
The game just needs to be enjoyed.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.550
It’s like playing an interactive version
of one of the most enjoyable movies.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.120
The difficulty may be lacking and the gameplay
may feel a little limited but the overall

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:23.019
experience will have you playing with a smile
on your face.
