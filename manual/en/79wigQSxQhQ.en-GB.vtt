00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:12.410
Little Orphan Annie 
has come to our house to stay.  To wash

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.570
the cups and saucers up and brush the crumbs
away.  and shoo the chickens off the porch

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.710
and dust the hearth and sweep,  and make
the fire and bake the bread to earn her board

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.740
and keep.  And all us little children, when
the supper things is done,  we sit around

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.640
the kitchen fire and has the mostest fun,
 a listening to the witch tales that Annie

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.440
tells about  and the goblins will get ya
if ya don't watch out! Once there was a

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.220
little boy who wouldn't say his prayers,  and
when he went to bed at night away up stairs,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.940
 his mummy heard him holler and his poppa
heard him bawl,  and when they turned the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.300
covers down,  he wasn't there at all!  They
seeked him in the rafter room  and cubby

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.080
hole and press  they seeked him up the chimney
flu and every wheres, I guess, but all they

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:09.189
ever found was just his pants and that's a
round and the goblins will get ya if ya

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:18.350
don't watch out!! At one time there was
a little girl who'd always laugh and grin and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.049
make fun of everyone, of all her folks and
kin,  and once when there was company and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.119
old folks was there,  she mocked them and
she shocked them and said, she didn't care.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.909
 And just as she turned on her heels to
go and run and hide,  there was two great

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.840
big black things a standing by her side.  They
raced her through the ceiling fore she knew

00:01:40.840 --> 00:02:15.000
what she's about,  and the goblins will
get ya if ya don't watch out!!
