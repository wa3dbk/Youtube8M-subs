Hello my YouTube friends, how are you?

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.820
Today it is time for another faceup stories

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.500
In this episode I will repaint my Monster High Rochelle that I have unboxed some time ago

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.520
But before we dive in, I'd like to mention that this video is a mini collab

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.460
with the lovely Debby, from Debby Arts on YouTube

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.940
She made a new tutorial on how to draw my custom Rochelle

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.840
If you want to see it, you can click on the annotation below

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.720
but I also left a link in the description box

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.500
Okay, so let's go back to the tutorial

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.660
After removing Rochelle's factory paint with acetone

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.220
I've wrapped her hair in plastic to make sure it doesn't get ruined by the sealant

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.400
Then, I spray her face three times with the sealant

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.720
to protect the vinyl and give it tooth for my materials to stick on

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.400
If you do not do this step the right way, then it will be very difficult to build strong colors

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.500
I show my method of sealing in one of my past videos, so check the description for the link to the tutorial

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.620
The rest is as usual

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
I sketched the basic eye shape with brown watercolor pencil

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.860
It is important to get this step right, since after you've sealed the face

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.200
it will be very difficult to modify

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.180
Here you can see I wasn't pleased with my first try

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.360
and decided to redraw the iris

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.500
At the same time, I start laying down some basic colors with pastels

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.220
And don't forget that I have all my materials and tools listed in my doll FAQ in the description box

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.300
After I am happy with the foundation, I start working with my airbrush

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.660
You do not necessarily need to use one to paint a faceup

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.900
You could do everything with pencils and pastels if you wanted

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.660
After using the airbrush I go back to using the watercolor pencils and pastels

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.180
All the way 'til the end

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.040
For the final touches, as always, I use some glitter for some glow

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.060
And gloss on the lips

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.580
And this is her final look

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:43.540
Pretty simple

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.360
I kept most of the original color scheme because I liked it so much

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.020
and it goes so well with her hair

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.480
Then, I gave her an Atelier Momoni dress, an Azone headpiece, and some lace leggings by SMP doll

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.040
She did, however, keep her original shoes, because they are so amazing

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.520
And just because I'm crazy, I had to get another Rochelle

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.460
This way you can see the original next to my custom

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.040
I really hope that you've enjoyed this video

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.840
If you'd like to see more, don't forget to give this video a thumbs up, just a little one, it helps a ton

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.460
Or, you can be extra awesome by commenting and sharing

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.460

This way, you won't miss out on any of my future videos

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.640
And believe me, I have a ton of things coming up as part of my Patreon launch

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.000
And before I go, I'd like to say a big thank you to Debby Arts for suggesting this collab

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.340
I hope to be doing more of them in the future

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.140
Well, this is it! Take care, and I'll see you in the next video. Bye!
