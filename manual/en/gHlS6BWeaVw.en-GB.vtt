00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.949
In the year 2012, it's hard to believe that 783 million 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.210
do not have access to safe water and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.210
2.5 billion don't have access to a toilet. 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.170
The next three minutes are not an experiment, 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.550
but we'd like you to pay attention. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.570
Poor households across the developing world, waste hours every day collecting water. 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.510
This work is arduous and repetitive and can prevent children 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.980
from attending school. 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.150
Where there are no clean and private toilets, people are forced to defecate in the open. 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.140
Not only is this an indignity, 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.830
it puts women and girls in danger of sexual violence, as well as disease.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.110
Lack of water causes conflict and tension. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.420
And drinking dirty water causes diarrhoea. 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.660
Keeping adults out of work and children out of school. 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.780
It also kills 4,000 children every single day - 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.620
more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.620
That's four children since you started watching this film. 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.419
WaterAid transforms lives by improving access to safe water, 

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:51.140
hygiene and sanitation in 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.490
the world's poorest communities. 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.920
We work with local partner organisations 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.840
who understand local issues, 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.400
providing them with skills and support 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.790
to manage their water and sanitation projects. 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.610
We also influence decision makers to maximise our impact. 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.889
Clean water sources within communities, 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.869
means women no longer waste most of the day collecting water. 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.879
Giving them time to earn a living for their families. 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.589
Safe water also means that communities no longer get sick, 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:21.780
children are healthier and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.249
are able to attend school. 

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:26.199
Clean toilets, 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.759
restored dignity and privacy, 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:31.269
vastly improving health in the community. 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.629
Hygiene education 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.629
means that diseases are reduced and 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:41.589
children pass on the information to the next generation. 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.869
WaterAid believes that access to clean water and sanitation 

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:52.269
are basic human rights. 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.199
The world is making progress 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.729
but on World Water Day 2012, 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.959
there are still 783 million people worldwide 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.529
who do not have safe water and 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:08.319
2.5 billion people with nowhere to go to the toilet. 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.559
WaterAid believes we can reach these people within our generation. 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.939
Do you?
