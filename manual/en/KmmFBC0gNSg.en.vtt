SPEAKER 1: He can
spin in circles.

00:00:28.497 --> 00:00:29.285
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:00:29.285 --> 00:00:30.493
Let's see what this one does.

00:00:33.986 --> 00:00:35.982
SPEAKER 3: That
makes [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:38.477
SPEAKER 2: He's making
really weird noises.

00:00:38.477 --> 00:00:39.475
SPEAKER 4: Hello!

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:41.471
SPEAKER 1: Try and
take a picture.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.970
SPEAKER 2: No, stop!

00:00:51.756 --> 00:00:55.012
SPEAKER 3: It's made
out of a bunch of things

00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:56.970
that you'd have around
the house, like an alarm

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.560
clock, a hair dryer,
a coffee machine.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.811
A lot of things that
have everyday uses.

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:09.510
SPEAKER 1: A microphone, the
silver band from a coffeemaker.

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:17.764
SPEAKER 2: They had
bottlecaps, and then

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:19.880
other pieces of the bottle.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.690
And they had some parts
from a hair dryer,

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.780
and it also has a speaker
from an alarm clock.

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:30.020
SPEAKER 4: On the
count of three.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.935
SPEAKER 1: No, let me do it.

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:33.420
Let me do it.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.770
SPEAKER 3: All three of us.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.895
SPEAKER 2: One, two, three.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.380
ALL: Me!

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.865
SPEAKER 5: Hello there!

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.350
SPEAKER 2: OK, ready?

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.825
BIT-ZEE: Me!

00:01:42.825 --> 00:01:45.300
SPEAKER 5: Wait, can
I have the remote.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.280
SPEAKER 1: No, I want
to say, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.357
SPEAKER 2: It has a lot of cool
science and math stuff in it,

00:01:55.357 --> 00:01:57.440
which I don't know yet,
because I haven't learned.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.700
Whoa!

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.636
SPEAKER 5: I think
that's from the band.

00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:09.550
Is that from the band?

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.490
My favorite thing about Bit-Zee
bot is probably all of it.
