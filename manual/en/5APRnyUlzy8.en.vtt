Hello everyone.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:03.139
Michael here with the Daily Note YouTube channel.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.250
Welcome to part 4 of what's new on Android
4.4 for the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.980
With the exception of a few carriers, most
of you should have gotten the update through

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.119
Samsung Kies or Over-The-Air.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.529
In this video, I'll go over a few tricks and
some other updates that I've noticed.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:27.160
So let's get started.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.880
To start things off, I want to show you a
hidden gesture that I just discovered yesterday

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440
for the new music lock screen widget.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.600
When you update your Note 3, there will be
an updated lock screen music widget that only

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.910
appears when you are playing music and you
turn your screen off and on.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.150
There are some differences to what you had
before.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.329
You no can no longer select tracks on a list,
but you can do this.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.500
If you long tap on the widget, you will get
this bar to jump to a part of a track.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.399
Long tap on it again and it will disappear.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.010
It may not be that necessary for music, but
I've been listening to a lot of podcasts lately

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.470
that are over an hour in length, and it definitely
comes in handy.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.250
Along with the new buttons, if there is an
album cover attached to the music file, you

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.770
will see it as the background.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.340
One thing I do want to mention is that if
you are running an app called headset button

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.200
controller, it seems to conflict with this
widget.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.000
The music widget doesn't show up when the
earphones are plugged in, so in the meantime,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.320
if you like controlling the music through
the lockscreen, you should uninstall the headset

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.550
button controller app.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.259
Next, I'm not sure if this may be a Note 3
feature, but it's the first time I noticed

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.259
it, so I'll mention it anyway.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.649
In the stock Email app, there is a new feature
to translate when you hit the menu button.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.649
So when you get an email in a foreign language,
you can translate the email, and it will open

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.950
up the translation in the S Translator app,
as long as both languages are supported.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.310
The rest of the updates are minor things.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.010
You will see there are new background wallpapers
for your Note 3.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.009
When I originally got the Note 3, I only had
4 wallpapers, but you can see they added a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.200
few more.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.030
Another update that I've noticed was that
the video player now works in multi window.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.510
I like watching movies and TV shows on the
side while I surf the web on my computer at

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.510
home.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.990
With the Note 3, you can even do that on a
mobile device.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.230
Next, if you use your Galaxy Note 3 to connect
to your dedicated camera like the GoPro or

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.870
maybe your DSLR with wifi remote capabilities,
you will notice that by default, it will not

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.260
stay connected to your GoPro network because
it will detect that your wifi connection does

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.640
not have an Internet connection.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.220
So to make sure it stays connected to the
your camera's wifi connection, go to your

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.650
advanced wifi settings, and you'll see they
changed this around a little bit.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.230
Disable Auto Network Switch, and now it should
just stick to the network even if that access

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.780
point does not have an internet connection.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.370
One very last thing that I'll mention.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.960
If you use folders inside of TouchWiz, if
you hover over the folders with the S Pen,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.000
you can see what's inside of it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.680
This was something you were always able to
do, but now you get a popping for a little

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.750
extra feedback.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.120
So that's it for all the changes I've noticed
so far for Android 4.4 on the Samsung Galaxy

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.120
Note 3.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.120
It looks like most of you should have gotten
the Android 4.4 update by now.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.940
I know some carriers are late as always.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.060
If you haven't got the update yet, make sure
to check Samsung Kies for the latest firmware

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.060
updates.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.650
Some carriers like to do updates only over
the air, so make sure you check in your settings

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.310
as well.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.340
That's it for today's video.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.480
