00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.540
This is a story about a boy named Charlie
who lives with his parents and grandparents

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.900
in a tiny shack in the outskirts of the city.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.450
The family is poor, as Charlie's father works
as a toothpaste capper, and they eat very

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.170
meager meals.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.250
In the newspaper, Mr. Willy Wonka, owner of
a successful candy company, has announced

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.939
a contest in which five golden tickets have
been placed in Wonka candy bars.

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.789
The five children who find the golden tickets
will be allowed to enter the chocolate factory

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.479
and will win a lifetime supply of candy.

00:00:26.479 --> 00:00:30.349
Charlie is excited about the news, but then
realizes that because his family is poor and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.500
can't afford to buy candy, he will most likely
not win.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.910
Soon, the newspaper reports that tickets are
being discovered by various children.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.770
Charlie tries to win by opening two chocolate
bars, but finds no ticket.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.850
Weeks go by and the family has seemingly forgotten
about the golden tickets as Charlie's father

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.260
has lost his job.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.960
Starving, Charlie walks outside and finds
a dollar on the street.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.780
He goes into the candy shop and buys two candy
bars.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.740
Miraculously, he finds a golden ticket.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.530
Charlie's family is excited about the discovery
and Grandpa Joe agrees to accompany Charlie

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.450
to the chocolate factory the next day.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.310
The long-locked gates of the Wonka factory
are opened and the five children and their

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.930
families are greeted by Wonka, a exuberant
fellow with flare and wit.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.350
Wonka shows them around his chocolate factory,
introducing them to all of his candy inventions.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.840
He also introduces the group to the Oompa-Loompas,
a small race of people who love chocolate

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.930
and work in the factory.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.139
As the tour goes on, however, all of the children
except Charlie misbehave and get taken away.

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.770
In the end, Wonka explains that the golden
ticket contest was his way to find someone

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.709
who could inherit the factory.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.270
Charlie accepts and his entire family moves
in.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.149
First, this story highlights poverty.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.789
As readers, especially young readers, the
concept of poverty may not be fully understood.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.521
The term "poor" is often used loosely as in
"I'm so poor that I can't buy that toy".

00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:52.509
But this story better defines the term by
portraying a family that better reflects the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.469
actual definition of the word.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.409
Charlie's family is destitute.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.799
Living in a two-room shack, they are getting
by with one paycheck to feed seven people,

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.759
eating bread and cabbage stew for each meal.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.369
More importantly, though, destitution does
not come to define Charlie.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.760
Yes, it limits him from buying a large amount
of candy bars, but he still is a smart and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.680
hardworking individual with good character.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.370
In contrast, there are the other golden ticket
winners.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.710
Collectively, the children represent the different
types of misbehavior that children often engage

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.710
in.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.810
There is the overeater, spoiled brat, gum-chewing
competitive kid, and TV watcher.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.820
Each of these characters are over-exaggerated
to a satirical level in hopes that children

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.230
can understand that these behaviors are unacceptable.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.360
But the children aren't the only ones responsible
for their bad behavior.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.680
It's the parents.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.290
Wonka invites two parents to accompany each
golden ticket winner not just for supervisory

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.990
reasons, but so that we can see where these
children learned their bad behavior.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.490
They had to learn it from somewhere and these
parents are enablers, doing nothing to stop

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.490
it.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.050
And so even though the contents of this story
may be for children, there is a sprinkle of

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.920
meaning in it for adults.
