00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.549
Setting up lavalier mic and
connecting it to a camera or smartphone

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.080
can be the simple fix to improving the
quality of the audio recordings

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.969
Now RODE microphones have just released
the smartLav+

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.900
it's an improved version of the very
popular smartLav

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.650
so you'd like to check out what's in the
box and how to set up the mic

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.490
then this audio tip is just for you

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.760
I've chosen the smartLav+ microphone
because it's so versitile in the sense

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:35.420
that you can

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.110
directly connect it to a smartphone without having any extra adapters involved

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.899
the principles of setting up any lavalier microphone are basically the same

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.439
so let's have a look in the box and see
what you get

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.899
Inside the box you get a storage pouch

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.539
a little windscreen and inside the pouch
itself

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.000
you get the lavalier mic itself and also

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.630
a little mic clip which we'll
have a look at later.  An instruction pamphlet 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.290
and that's all the gear you get in the box.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.640
The metal clip has a built-in cable restraint

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.610
the capsule is broadcast quality and is
fitted with a

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.110
reinforced cable that is easy to thread through and

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.700
hid under any clothing. RODE have

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.800
implemented a gray sleeve to identify all

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.909
of the tip- ring- ring sleeve smartphone plugs and
sockets

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.380
Now how do you put it together. What you do is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.280
you thread the microphone capsule in
through the little clasp

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.890
making sure that you fit it into the

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.110
manufactured grooves. Once you've got that in place it's quite firm.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.460
Then you can

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.060
fit the little microphone windscreen
and it has a little manufactured groove

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.950
to settle in

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.950
once you've done that

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.629
you can set up the cable restraint.
Open up the clip

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.870
and thread in the cable making sure
that it goes

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.620
inside the clip and then very carefully

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.690
role the cable are over so it goes

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.989
into this little cable restraint groove.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.830
you can use a credit card or your fingernail

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.150
just be careful that you settle it in
without damaging the cable

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.580
and there you have it. The microphone is ready for fitting

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.740
Let's look at fitting it to
ourselves

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.540
Thread the cable through your shirt or your garment

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.670
and then clip it into place. Once it is settled into place

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.230
thread the cable out of a place that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.810
is not visible to the camera and you can
plug it into your recorder

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.260
in this case I'm just using a smartphone.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.000
There you have it you really for recording. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.340
The position of the mic can vary considering

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.089
a number of factors if there's a lot of
noise around you in the room

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.239
you might need to lift the position of
the mic up

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.090
if the person tends to move their head up
and move it down

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.849
you may have to lower the mic just so you can get a more even recording

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.959
and if the talent as a very strong voice

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.290
you might even need to invert the microphone upside down

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.150
to minimize the chances popping all what
they call plosives

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.750
in some cases you might not even be
able to clip

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.220
the microphone on to the garment, for
example if they're wearing a t-shirt well you can

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.549
tape the mic

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.590
underneath the garment underneath the
fabric. RODE microphones have even made a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.230
special stick on mic holder called and invisilav to minimize noise when the mic

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.810
is mounted under fabric

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.629
now in some situations the lavalier mic

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.010
might not even be an option at all
because of the loud background noise

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.799
around you

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.879
now if that's the case you may have to
choose a headset

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:22.389
type microphone to capture good audio. If
you'd like to have a closer look at the

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:23.590
smartLav+

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.949
I'll leave some links in that description
below

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.440

or comments that you'd like to share

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.030

Make sure you type that in the comments
