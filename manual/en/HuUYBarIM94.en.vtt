00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
Hello. My name is Alexander Kurgan.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm a game designer for World of Tanks.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.040
Today, I'll tell you about Strongholds.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.240
1. What are Strongholds?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.560
First of all, Strongholds are absolutely free

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.320
and available to any clan with more than 20 clan members.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.440
The 20-person limit is imposed because a clan just wouldn't be able to build

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.920
or do anything effective with less than 20 clan members.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.240
So 20 people is the minimum number of players for a clan

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.960
to start developing its Stronghold.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.120
A stronghold is a kind of clan base.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.080
It's a clan possession that you need to protect.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.760
The development of the Stronghold will be one of the main goals of the clan.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.280
Players will be able to build structures and receive bonuses.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.520
Bonuses can vary.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.480
They can be bonuses to credits, to experience or free experience;

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.960
to crew experience or bonuses that allow you to advance the development

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.960
of your Stronghold or plunder other Strongholds more effectively.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.200
2. How can players get these bonuses?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.160
To receive bonuses, you will need Reserves

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.480
that work as events and are active during a certain period of time.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.720
The clan Commander or Deputy Commander can activate a Reserve

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.280
at the time that is the most advantageous for the clan.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.280
If you want a bonus active from 7 pm to 9 pm,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.880
you can activate it at 7 pm

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.360
and the increased economic bonus will be available for all clan members

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.520
for the next two hours.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.680
Bonuses apply to all type of battles: Random Battles,

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.360
Tank Company Battles, Team Battles, and Skirmishes.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.200
3. Reserves are prepared in structures;

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.520
what types of structures are there?

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.160
When you build a structure,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.000
you can see the maximum bonus that this structure can provide.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.480
Put some serious thought into what bonuses you need.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.560
The number of sites for building structures is limited.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.920
To build a new structure,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.760
you will need to open a new Zone

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.240
and this involves a certain risk.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.240
Make sure you plan your development in advance.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.760
To build a structure, you will need Industrial Resource.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.800
4. What is Industrial Resource?

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.840
Industrial Resource is the new in-game currency

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.200
that is used in the Strongholds game mode.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.680
Industrial Resource is needed for almost all

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.720
operations connected with Strongholds, such as building, upgrading,

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.640
and repairing structures; preparing Reserves and so on.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.280
5. How can players earn Industrial Resource?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.240
Industrial Resource is earned in a special type of battle called Skirmishes.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.560
Skirmishes are battles similar to Tank Company Battles,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.320
with the exception that only members of your clan can take part in them.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.480
Skirmishes are available in three divisions: medium, champion, and absolute.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.480
This game mode has no restriction on vehicle type or number of vehicle points.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.240
The only limitations are according the Skirmish division:

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.480
vehicles up to tier six for medium division,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.760
vehicles up to tier eight for champion division,

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.520
and vehicles up to tier ten for absolute division.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.000
Every division has its special Industrial Resource earning power.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.320
Fighting in the absolute division will bring you more Industrial Resource

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.920
than fighting in vehicles of tiers six or eight.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.320
You'll be able to spend Industrial Resource you earn in Skirmishes

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.160
on building and upgrading structures,

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.520
creating consumables, developing your Stronghold the way you want.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.240
In this game mode, you will fight with similar clans

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.200
that also decide to engage in Skirmishes.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.720
6. Tell us about testing Strongholds.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.400
Strongholds are probably one of the most extensive in-game functionalities

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.720
we're going to introduce, so we need to give it extensive testing.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.720
We want it to be a polished product,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.800
so we're launching a long common test for testing Strongholds.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.640
During this test, we want to assess certain decisions we made in the design process.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.440
This test will give us a chance to fix any bugs and make improvements

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.200
to the interface or gameplay features.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.360
For players, it's a chance to get a head start.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.040
Although test Strongholds won't be transferred to the main server,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.800
they will give players the chance to learn how this game mode works,

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.880
how to engage in Skirmishes and what structures they need to build.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.600
You can study the mechanics and, when the update with the Strongholds is out,

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.800
you'll already know what to do, so this will give you a certain advantage.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.600
You'll be able to develop your Stronghold efficiently,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.040
while other clans that didn't participate in the test will just be

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.880
starting to understand the interface and features of Strongholds.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.200
7. Can you create clan during this test?

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.200
Clan management will be open for the duration of this test.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.480
You'll be able to create and manage clans.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.800
If you want to know what a Stronghold is,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.000
you can either create a new clan and study all its features

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.280
or you can invite your friends and play together.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
You'll find a special link on our official website.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.600
8. Can Industrial Resource or Reserves be purchased with in-game Gold?

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.840
Strongholds don't depend on Gold in any way.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.000
Operations like creating a Stronghold, building structures

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.480
and preparing Reserves don't require any Gold transactions.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.480
Even a premium account doesn't provide increased earnings

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.000
of Industrial Resource in Skirmishes.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.040
Industrial Resource is earned only in Skirmishes

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.880
and all economic bonuses will be available in battles only.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.400
9. Why the level of Strongholds limited to Level 4 for now?

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.640
At the start, the maximum level of Stronghold development will be Level 4.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.960
This will help us to gather more information on the actions

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.080
of players and to see what features we need to improve

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.800
and what problems we need to fix.

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.480
During the first stage, you'll be able to engage in Skirmishes

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.880
and earn Industrial Resource. However,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.200
you won't be able to attack the Strongholds of other clans or lose yours.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.680
We're giving players an opportunity to develop

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.120
their Strongholds up to Level 4 to prepare them for further events:

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.560
for unlocking Level 5 and attacking the Strongholds of other clans.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.320
10. How will Strongholds be developed?

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.840
As soon as we see that Strongholds up to 4th level of development work well

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.160
that players engage in Skirmishes and earn Industrial Resource

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.720
we'll make available further levels of development.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.840
These are levels five to ten.

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.240
At that stage, clans will be able to attack each other's Strongholds

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.040
and earn Industrial Resource by plundering them.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.520
Then, at the third stage, players will be able

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.360
to create combat consumables in their Strongholds.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.280
These combat consumables are bombers, reconnaissance aircraft,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.040
mine fields and tank-turret pillboxes.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.760
You'll be able to use them in the battles

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.000
and they will help you to defend your Stronghold

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.920
or to successfully attack and plunder the Strongholds of other clans.
