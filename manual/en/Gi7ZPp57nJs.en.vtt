Hi! Kathleen Wright here, Kathena Body Art,
hennaparties.com in Miami, New York City.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.830
We’re getting ready to outline this simple
one that we did, we’re going to do a little

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.610
more color here I’m going to do the blue.
It’s good to wait a few seconds you know

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.920
it’s like kind of set a little bit already.
so you want to get some blue in there, make

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.100
it look pretty and I’m going to outline
these swirls, try to make sure the hair are

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:42.449
really back as far as possible. It’s just
kind of a shadowing of a color that I did

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:50.640
already and you can improvise with this you
could do more jewels inside as well, inside

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.480
the face rather than just on the top. Some
people don’t want this much you can just

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:11.540
do one jewel and do little dots above her.
Now while the paint is a little bit wet is

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.230
when you want to do your glitter, lean back
honey lean back and close your eyes. I put

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.890
a lot of glitter right there but that’s
okay, that’s going to be the middle and

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.260
then you’re going to lean them back. It’s
going to grab and then what’s another thing

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.680
you can do is another jewel right there in
the middle. It’s a really, really simple

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.020
face paint, like I said if they want a whole
bunch as much as I did here I only did one

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.630
side and the crown but if you don’t want
to do the crown come over here just do your

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.320
bendy what we call the jewel and then do some
dots that’s always fun too, right along

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.450
the squeezable glitter dots okay. So we’re
pretty much done here this is our other sample

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.210
that we did today, take pictures of everything
you do, grab a bunch of kids one day do as

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.690
much as you could do, take pictures, make
a collage and do a book and then you’re

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.890
going to be very, very set for starting off
with face painting. The only other thing I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.280
can stress with starting out face painting
is really give yourself a lot of time to learn

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.420
how to do each one. Don’t get frustrated
everybody starts off doing simple things and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:41.980
then these simple designs I showed you are
very quick and easy to do. On behalf of expertvillage.com

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.770
thanks for watching.
