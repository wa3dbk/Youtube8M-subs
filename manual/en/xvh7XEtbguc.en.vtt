Dear Diary,

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:03.860
The date is September 1, 2013, and this is
my first entry.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.009
I've decided I'm going to start keeping an
online video diary of my life because I make

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.620
so many for other people's enjoyment. It's
time to start doing something for myself.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.730
You know what I'm saying!

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.260
I've been kinda busy actually. I went to New
York City for the first time. It was cool

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.660
though because I got to hang out with some
of my friends from high school.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.400
But the main reason I was there is because
I was picking up these right here: Google

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.929
Glass.

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.859
I was actually one of the Google Glass #IfIHadGlass
participants. I had to go to New York City

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.560
because they won't ship the Google Glass out.
You have to go to LA or New York City to pick

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.880
it up.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.720
They're pretty cool and actually all this
footage that you're seeing right here I shot

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.130
on Google Glass. The Glass does have some
drawbacks. For one, I look like a gosh darn

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.630
fool, but some other drawbacks: it only shoots
in 720p and basically if you have a phone,

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.540
you can pretty much do everything on glass,
except for a lot faster.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.740
I would just wait it out. While I was in New
York City, I met MaxNoSleeves. I also saw

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.830
a guy wearing 12-inch heels, which I hear
is pretty much the norm in New York City.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.210
I don't know if I could ever live in New York
City though. It's a cool place to visit. It's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.730
just so fast and so busy all the time. Plus,
if you make $100,000 there, that's minimum

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.980
wage.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.460
I also visited Los Angeles for the first time.
I was over at the YouTube Space LA shooting

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.070
some videos. And that was an amazing experience.
I met a lot of people.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.280
I met Casey Curtiss from ShotScience. I met
the Professor from the And1 Mixtape. Got a

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.290
picture with Christina Milian. Just balling,
just taking pictures with Christina Milian

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.860
for no reason.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.020
I met a ton of beauty gurus there. I'm trying
to make BroMakeup a thing. Think about it.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.130
I don't know if my subscribers would like
it, but I'm thinking about coming with the

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.100
BroMakeup though.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.210
I also met some fellow Gators: Cody Johns,
he's a popular Viner and Brodie Smith. Brodie

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.080
is the man though. So I'm definitely planning
on doing a bunch of videos with some of those

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.990
people so be on the lookout for those, especially Brodie because Brodie's just a couple

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.880
of hours away from me.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.380
I drove to Mississippi ten hours to see my
grandma turn 80.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.540
What is, what is that?

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.299
It's a video camera.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.130
You videoing me?

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.740
Yeah.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.350
What?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.240
It was kinda cool because all the family members
came out and it's always good to see your

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.520
family.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.070
Yes, I still have free gas, I still have a
free car and free insurance until the end

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.670
of the year because the Fiesta Movement is
still strong and going on.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.700
This month's theme was adventure and for my
adventure I was supposed to go bungee jumping,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.010
but I did not go bungee jumping because apparently
in Florida, a bungee jump above 75 feet is

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.290
illegal.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.740
So, my program coordinator he's like "You
just wanna go skydiving?"

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.870
Yes! That's what I wanted to do in the first
place. DAHECK! Let's go skydiving though!

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.760
And I told him, I was like "Look, I have these
friends from high school. They go skydiving

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.540
every week."

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.340
And so he hooked it up. I drove about an hour
and a thirty minutes to Skydive Sebastian.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.040
Next thing I know, I'm signing my life away,
saying my family can't sue if I die.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.060
And then next thing I know, I'm jumping out
a plane. Now of course there were some steps

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.459
in between. This is probably the only time
I would be comfortable having another man

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.520
behind me for an extended period of time.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.780
But I will say this. I was not scared. I was
not scared at all. But, I didn't know we were

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.760
going to be jumping from so high. While we
were going up in the plane, I was looking

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.520
out the window and I was like:

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.800
"Are we jumping yet? This is high!"
The guy next to me was like:

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.629
"Nah, this is 2,000. We're going to be jumping
in about 11,000 more feet."

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.950
Now I actually tried to say Throw Me The Alley
as well as do the Magruder Pose while skydiving.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.950
It didn't really work out as I had planned.
Why don't we just take a look at some of the

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.099
footage.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:35.099
Now I'm not going to lie, by the time that
I landed I was feeling very nauseous, but

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.010
I would go skydiving again. I'd recommend
it, but I would not do it with someone attached

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.650
to me. I wouldn't do it tandem.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.800
What else is new?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.470
Football is back! I am VERY happy about that!
Out of all my years of life, this felt like

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.639
the longest amount of time that football has
been gone.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.330
I don't know what happened. Maybe it's just
me. Maybe it's my diet. Florida, we're looking

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.979
good. We just beat Toledo. So if we just win
the games we're supposed to win, who knows

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:44.790
what could happen?

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.900
Also, I have complete confidence the Dallas
Cowboys will win the Super Bowl. I'm not even

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.740
playing games. I'm not playing games. Mark
it. Book it. Scooter Magruder said it first

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.729
in his first Dear Diary entry. Let's go!

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.290
But until the next entry remember:

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:03.780
Real guys keep diaries.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.780
I'm a grown man.
