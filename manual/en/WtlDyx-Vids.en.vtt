Hi. My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.540
how to make the holiday favorite, Spiced Apple
Cider. OK there is not really a great deal

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.130
in the way of ingredients to this. But that's
what makes it fun. It's easy to make. Over

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.410
here I've got one quart of apple juice. This
is actually fresh squeezed apple juice. You

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.239
can buy the stuff from the store. Just make
sure if you get the stuff from the store it

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.099
is the no sugar added variety. Because when
they add the sugar to it, it's going to throw

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.800
this recipe off because we're already going
to add sugar to our recipe, so try to get

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.239
the cleanest apple juice you can get if you're
going to buy it. Like I said my recommendation

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.399
is fresh squeezed. We're also going to add
one cinnamon stick. You can buy these in your

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.660
grocery store in your spice aisle. Pretty
common stuff. Don't ever try to eat one of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.559
these. Resist the temptation to think that
this would taste good on its own, because

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.809
i assure it would not. Cinnamon by itself
is a horrible, horrible tasting thing. Mix

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.339
it with sugar though and you have a different
story. Now these are black peppercorns. Like

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.799
the kind for black pepper. Like the stuff
you put on vegetables, like salt and pepper.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.439
We're going to need twenty of these. You can
buy these at the grocery store as well. They're

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.939
just plain black ones. Don't get any other
color besides black. Sometimes they will sell

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.340
like a mixed variety at the store. Like pink
and white or like green in there. Those have

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.310
very different flavor profiles, just black
only for this. Also you'll need four cloves.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.960
That's these little tiny things like this.
You can get these from the grocery store as

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.340
well, in the spice aisle. These are really,
really strong and if you try to eat these

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.149
also, they smell delicious but you try to
eat them, once again , they taste really horrible.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.180
So you only want to get these and use them
in stuff, not to try to eat them separately.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.070
Here i have two tablespoons of just plain
light brown sugar. I use light brown because

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.259
it doesn't effect the coloring so much. If
you use a dark brown, it will actually turn

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.780
your cider a different color. So be aware
of that, so just two tablespoons of that.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.500
And I've also got a lemon here. And now this
lemon is we're not going to use the lemon

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.390
juice, we're just going to use the lemon zest,
the lemon rind, so if you already have a lemon

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.030
laying around or half a lemon laying around,
we're not going to use the whole thing. We're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.950
just going to use basically about a teaspoon
to a teaspoon and a half of lemon zest. So

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.730
if you already have a lemon laying around
that you've only used half of or something,

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.500
then that would be fine. I'm just going to
go ahead and use a whole one. So with that,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.340
let's move on to the equipment that we are
going to need.
