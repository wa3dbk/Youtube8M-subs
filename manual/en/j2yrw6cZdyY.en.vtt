00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.700
Hello, and welcome back. I'm Joseph Hoffman.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.899
Today we're going to be doing some rhythm
practice.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.550
I have my rhythm cards and we're going to
be learning

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.369
how you can compose your own rhythms.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.309
If you go to our website you'll be able to
download and print

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.340
out these rhythm cards so you can practice
composing

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.710
and playing, and even improvising with your
own rhythms.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.330
Let's come and take a look at my cards and
I'll show you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.050
how you can compose with them.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.660
I'm going to draw a rhythm that is four beats
long.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.660
Remember that each one of these cards represents
one beat.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.719
Even though you see five notes here, these
two notes,

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:09.390
because they have a beam connecting them,
these two notes share a beat.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.390
and they have to go twice as fast which is
why we give them the special name TI-TI.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.139
Let's practice saying this rhythm that I just
wrote.

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:24.639
TA TA TI-TI TA.

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:28.289
Now will you try it with me?

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.590
TA TA TI-TI TA.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.329
Good. I just made up that rhythm.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:41.329
Let me show you how you can compose other
rhythms.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.850
Here's another rhythm I made up. Let's try
this one.

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.649
Can you say it with me?

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.799
TI-TI TI-TI TA TA.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.109
Good, let's try it one more time.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:02.029
TI-TI TI-TI TA TA.

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:04.979
With your hands, try clapping that rhythm
now.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.440
Ready. TI-TI TI-TI TA TA.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.820
Great, now stand up and with your feet stomp
that rhythm.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:21.820
TI-TI TI-TI TA TA.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.330
Touch your elbow with that rhythm.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.280
TI-TI TI-TI TA TA.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.280
Great, let's try one more rhythm.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.990
Do you remember what this is? This is called
a quarter rest.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.950
It's a picture of silence, so there will be
one beat at the end of this rhythm with silence.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.570
Sometimes I whisper rest just to remind me
that there is no sound there.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.050
This rhythm will sound like this. TA TI-TI
TA rest.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.050
Now you try saying it with me. TA TI-TI TA
rest.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.150
Now let's try touching two fingers together
with that same rhythm.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.760
Here we go. TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.210
Now try touching your chin with that rhythm.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:33.310
Go. TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.690
Very good. Now I'd like you to try composing
some of your own rhythms at home.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.810
Also, let me show you how you can take a rhythm
that you make up yourself

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.510
and you can use it to make up your own song.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.140
Let's take the rhythm that I just composed
and I'll show you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.810
how I could make up my own song.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.740
My very own song that no one has ever heard
before at the piano.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.650
When you make up your own song,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.319
right on the spot without even practicing
it ahead of time, we call that "improvising".

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.680
So we're going to improvise a song using the
rhythm that I just composed.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.890
And you can try this on your own piano too
along with me.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.160
So here is the rhythm that we were working
on just a second ago.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.880
I'm going to put my right hand in C-major
position.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.760
On the C pentascale, C D E F G.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.460
And I'm going to play any note I want using
this rhythm.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.790
Here I go. TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.290
When I finish, I'm going to just keep repeating
that rhythm again

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.880
and again on any note I want.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:49.880
TA TI-TI TA rest. TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.380
TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.440
I decided to end my song there because it
sounded like a good note to end on.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.220
You can make your song as long as you want
and when it sounds like it's done,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.600
you're done. You decide. You're the improviser.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.400
Now another fun thing to do is to try to improvise
a song

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.880
while someone else plays chords.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.450
So I'll play the chords for you,

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.790
while you improvise a melody using the rhythm
that I composed.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.410
Then after we've tried that, I hope you'll
make up some more rhythms of your own,

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.090
and make up lots more songs on your own.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:36.240
So, I will play the chords with the rhythm
that we just tried,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.130
and you try making a melody using any note
you want in the C pentascale.

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.790
You can repeat notes, you can do notes stepping
up,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.600
you can do notes stepping down.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.960
You can do skipping notes, it's all up to
you.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.960
But try to use the same rhythm for your melody
as me so it sounds good together.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:03.250
I'll play the chords and you play any notes
you want in the C pentascale.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.250
Here we go. One, two, you know what 
to do.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:18.270
TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.560
TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.850
TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.139
TA TI-TI TA rest.

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.790
[Playing piano]

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.290
Last time.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.740
[Playing piano].

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.620
Our song is done.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.919
Great.

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:43.110
If you want to try that again just rewind
and do it as many times as you like

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.840
until you are really happy with one of your
improvisations.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.340
Like I said, if you go to our website, you
can download these cards,

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.000
and also heartbeat pages where you can draw
your own rhythms

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.990
and make up lots of your own songs.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:03.990
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you again
next time.
