00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:07.880
Run-run!

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:14.784
Today, on of the 7th of June,

00:00:14.784 --> 00:00:16.624
another Heroes' Race is organized.

00:00:16.624 --> 00:00:19.740
It will be a cross-country race at the Alabino polygon, Tamanskaya division.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.034
I feel literally like a T-34.

00:00:22.034 --> 00:00:24.377
Firstly, it's our age, as we are no children anymore,

00:00:24.377 --> 00:00:26.605
and secondly, we are also set up for winning.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.805
It means more sports in our lives, a reason to get ourselves off the chair more often!

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:30.800
We decided to take part in it, we've never done it before.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680
We've seen the announcement, and my friend's feedback was positive,

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:34.788
so today we're here.

00:00:34.788 --> 00:00:37.371
It's really great, so many young people,

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:40.982
many came here with their families to practice sports activities.

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:43.428
All for one and one for all!

00:00:43.428 --> 00:00:44.925
There were lots of teams

00:00:45.222 --> 00:00:48.434
and, surely, it's a pleasure that the World of Tanks team was among them.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:50.640
It is especially pleasant to see that people have proven in real life

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.982
that they can be just as much heroes here

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:54.034
as in virtual games.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.628
In real life, that's what is most important.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:00:58.537
Fight!

00:01:08.388 --> 00:01:10.537
It's relatively cold in there.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.274
Excuse me, where is the field kitchen? Where, where did you say?

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:20.662
You want more and more of it.

00:01:21.497 --> 00:01:22.948
Go ahead, for the win!

00:01:30.114 --> 00:01:32.262
We have a very interesting obstacle.

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:36.640
First, the participants need to run with stretchers and wearing helmets,

00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.400
then they throw it all down, jump down into a ditch,

00:01:40.537 --> 00:01:43.291
and run through BelAZ truck tires.

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:44.651
Then they again jump into a ditch,

00:01:44.948 --> 00:01:47.920
where the instuctor gives them bullet shells,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.474
and so they end the race by climbing up a hill.

00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:01.394
Many people who register for the race end up in a team

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:03.040
where they don't know anyone at all.

00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:05.222
So they just get acquainted,

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:07.074
and I think it's a wonderful thing,

00:02:07.074 --> 00:02:10.731
as it allows you to join a group of fellow thinkers.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.451
In fact, you can walk, run,

00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:16.137
or pass the obstacles in any other way.

00:02:16.708 --> 00:02:18.651
Still, everyone is running at their limit.

00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:20.811
They are determined to give it their best shot; they're running their hearts out.

00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:23.702
That's why, you see, people are most happy right at the finish,

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:27.440
when they ring the bell, get out of the water, and jump on a trampoline.

00:02:27.702 --> 00:02:29.600
I think they all are happy, and that's the most important thing!

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.605
It's a sports holiday.

00:02:30.605 --> 00:02:33.531
We... went for the victory slowly, with no haste, but steadily,

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:35.074
just like tanks.

00:02:35.508 --> 00:02:37.348
Now we are going to tuck in to our porridge.

00:02:37.348 --> 00:02:38.514
Well, the whole thing was awesome!

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.868
Your sweat pours like rain, it streams into your eyes.

00:02:40.868 --> 00:02:42.240
The dirt flows there too.

00:02:42.434 --> 00:02:44.331
If you have no idea of how to spend your honeymoon,

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:47.725
you should come right here! The race track is just amazing!

00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:52.365
So practice sports, come join us at the Heroes' Race, partake and win in everything!

00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:58.342
On June 21, we invite you for yet another Heroes' Race.

00:02:58.582 --> 00:03:00.777
Come join us to become heroes!

00:03:01.245 --> 00:03:03.188
