[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.620
-Hi, guys.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.027
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:12.110
We're Brooklyn and Bailey.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.780
And today we've decided to do
Babysitting 101 because we've

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.480
been getting lots of babysitting
jobs during the summer.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.040
And it is very important
to do your best

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.700
when you're babysitting
because then the parents will

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.040
be so happy, they'll
want to hire you again,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.170
and then they'll go tell
all of their friends.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.372
-It's like free marketing.

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:30.080
-Honestly, it is.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.535
-Free marketing for your
own little business.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:34.010
It's so cool.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.510
-OK.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.050
So first off, you'll want to go
to one of your local community

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.739
centers or hospitals.

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.280
And they have a class you can
take that shows you and teaches

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.000
you how to do CPR, in
case one of the kids

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.830
gets in an emergency
and they need it.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.270
And after you do
that class and you

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.037
learn how to do all
of the medical things,

00:00:51.037 --> 00:00:53.370
you should have your parents
spread the word that you're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.951
ready and want jobs
for babysitting.

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:57.700
-So once your parents
have spread the word

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.600
and you finally get
a babysitting job,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.730
it's very important that you
ask the questions, like, what's

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.400
their schedule, what's
their bedtime routine, what

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.500
do they eat, are
there any allergies?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.230
-It makes you seem like
a responsible, interested

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.200
babysitter.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.670
And it makes the parents
like you more because you're

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.044
on the ball and
you know what all

00:01:16.044 --> 00:01:17.660
of the kid's needs
and wants are.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.725
So it'd be good.

00:01:18.725 --> 00:01:19.225
-Yeah.

00:01:19.225 --> 00:01:23.270
So it's very important for you
to be the one asking questions.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.770
-So when the parents
leave, try to get

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670
to know the kids-- like
their ages, their names--

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.900
so they feel more
comfortable around you.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.720
And be their friend, be
cheerful, make them happy,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.406
do something funny,
so they feel like they

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:37.530
can get to know you better.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.820
-But also make sure that they
know that you mean business.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.610
-So you're not all fun
and games and no business.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.930
Be fun and games and
business, so that it's like--

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.320
-You're in between.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.930
-It's a double package.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.790
-Double for one.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.570
-So here are some
things you definitely

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.740
do not want to do while
you're babysitting.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.199
-Turn the TV on because
it distracts you

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.240
from watching the kids,
and then the kids are not

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.790
doing anything active-- they're
just sitting on the couch.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.290
-Yeah.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.400
Another thing is you do not
want to have guests over.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.389
No family, no friends, no
boyfriends or girlfriends.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.930
None of that.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.430
-Nothing that will distract
you from watching the kids.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.930
-Mhm.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.330
-And also, no long phone
calls or texting your friends

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.010
while you're babysitting
because that also distracts you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.505
from actually babysitting.

00:02:20.505 --> 00:02:21.840
-Mhm.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.130
-You also want to
stay home, preferably.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.710
If you have a car, preferably,
stay in the house or the house

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.000
premises, like the backyard.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.460
-Yeah, because if you go out
on long walks to the park,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.770
that's fun for the kids but
it also invites accidents,

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.510
and it's kind of hard to
keep all of the kids wrangled

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.710
together when
you're at the park.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.500
And another major
don't is do not snoop.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.030
Do not snoop.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.950
Do not try on clothes.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.190
Do not ruffle through
their personal items.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.800
-Because you are an invited
guest in their house,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.390
and you should not
be the one looking

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.010
through all of
their private stuff.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.280
-You have no rights to do that.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.390
Some things to do, while
you're babysitting,

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.680
are fun activities
with the kids.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.220
You want to interact
with them and give them

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.805
some fun active things to do.

00:03:05.805 --> 00:03:06.305
-Yeah.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.540
So you can do crafts
or play games,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.550
or if you're with little
girls, you can play dress up

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:12.051
or princess.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:12.550
-Yeah.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.530
And you can download
apps on your phone,

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.660
or you can make fun music
videos or just funny videos,

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.220
in general.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.720
And you can usually
distract the kids

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.255
for like an hour with those--
those fun apps and stuff.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:24.920
-Mhm.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.170
And some other things to do,
while you're babysitting,

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.770
is to certainly pay attention
and to also be kind to the kids

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.960
so that they know that
they can trust you.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.530
-And you can periodically
text the parent updates,

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.070
like, I just fed
the kids, now we're

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.670
going to go play a board
game because lots of parents

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.500
usually worry about
what the kids are doing

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.680
or how the babysitter is
doing while they're gone

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.800
and it's really good for them
to know what you're doing.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.390
-I would worry about my kid.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.340
-And last of all,
you want to clean.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.230
-Clean.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.940
-It's really good
when you clean.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.960
Parents don't usually
feel like they

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.095
need to rehire you
when they come home

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:02.751
to a dirty, messy house.

00:04:02.751 --> 00:04:03.250
-Yeah.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.700
I once had a
babysitting job, where

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.699
the parents had just--
they said, oh, it's okay.

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.470
When the kids are in bed, you
can just sit around and relax.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.840
But I saw that the house needed
a little bit of cleaning.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.130
And so I went ahead
and vacuumed the floor

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.029
and put the dishes
in the dishwasher.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.450
And when they got home,
they were so happy,

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.920
they paid me extra.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.760
So cleaning is very important
when you're babysitting.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.260
-Yeah.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.220
And I had an experience
like that, one time.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.870
And they actually
called my mom, the day

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.269
after, and were raving
about how awesome it

00:04:32.269 --> 00:04:34.310
was to find you were a
babysitter that cleaned up

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.460
their house without them
having to ask them to do it.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.780
And it's just a really good
thing to get you rehired.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.850
And it makes the parents
like you a lot more.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.050
And then they go tell their
other friends about you.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.438
And it's the free
marketing again.

00:04:47.438 --> 00:04:49.630
Yay.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.120
-So when bedtime rolls around,
if the parents give you

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.510
a specific time to
put the kids to bed,

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.515
you need to put them
to bed at that time.

00:04:57.515 --> 00:04:58.020
-Yeah.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.500
-And if you have a kid that's
having a hard time going

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.000
to bed, there are things you
can do, like read them a story.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.310
-Read them books.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.290
I mean, you can sing them songs.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.120
I sing them lots of
fun songs, sometimes.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.069
-And if the kid's
having more trouble,

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:12.360
after you've tried everything,
you can text the parents

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.130
and ask them what they
do with their kids.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.720
-Mhm.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.870
And just try to keep them--
try to calm them down,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.750
so they feel like
they can go to sleep.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:20.250
OK.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.220
So when the parents
come home, give them

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.180
an honest report about what
happened when they were gone.

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.140
And be like, your kids are so
adorable, we had so much fun,

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.062
we made this video--
here, watch it--

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:32.270
so they know that you had
a good time with their kids

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.980
and you interacted with them.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.100
And if you did have trouble
putting one of the kids to bed,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.619
just tell them that
you had trouble.

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:41.660
And be like, what can I
do better next time, when

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.919
you call them-- or call me-- so
that you can fix it, next time.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.460
And then the kid
will go to bed easy.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.000
-Yeah.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.987
Every parent wants to
see their babysitter

00:05:49.987 --> 00:05:52.320
and see that they're as
involved as they would have been

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.420
or that they care for their
kids as much as they do.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.650
So the big question that we
know you've been asking is,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.560
how much do we charge
for babysitting?

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.694
And it honestly
depends on the family.

00:06:04.694 --> 00:06:07.110
Generally, you don't want to
be the one to bring up money.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.930
You want the parents to
be the one to bring it up.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.430
And if they give you a price,
and you think it's reasonable,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.490
then go ahead with it.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.540
But if they ask you
now, what do you usually

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.320
get paid for babysitting,
our general idea is--

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.901
-If they have three kids and
under, just say, $4 to $5

00:06:22.901 --> 00:06:23.400
an hour.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.010
And if they have three
kids and above, say,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.380
it's usually $1 an
hour and $1 per kid.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.580
So that's our general
consensus for money,

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.430
but not everyone has to do that.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.150
-Yeah.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.230
Honestly, just make sure that
you do the best that you can

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.794
and have it be as
much fun for the kids

00:06:41.794 --> 00:06:43.710
and make sure that you
leave the house cleaner

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.850
than when you came.

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.450
Your goal is to have either them
texting your parents about what

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.480
a great babysitting you
are or have their kids

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.701
telling their parents,
wow, we had so much fun

00:06:53.701 --> 00:06:54.635
with this babysitter.

00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:54.809
Bring her again.

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:55.600
We had so much fun.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.440
-I want her to come again.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.430
-That is like your
bottom line goal.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.664
You want that.

00:07:00.664 --> 00:07:01.164
OK.

00:07:01.164 --> 00:07:02.630
We're going to LA this weekend.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.415
And we're so excited to meet
all of you guys at VidCon.

00:07:05.415 --> 00:07:06.790
And while we're
down there, we're

greet on Saturday.

(SINGING) Say it like
you know it's true.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.360
Only you can decide
if you'll see this

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.060
through because you
can do anything.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.419
Yeah, you can do anything.

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:35.960
