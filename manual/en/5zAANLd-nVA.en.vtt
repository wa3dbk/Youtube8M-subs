00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.200
This animation will show how your sight can
be corrected using LASIK.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.870
This procedure involves using a laser to change
the shape of your cornea,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.849
which is the clear covering over the front
of your eye.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.370
Click the navigation arrows below the animation
screen to play, pause, rewind

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.431
or fast-forward the animation.

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:24.360
This animation contains sound.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.730
Short-sightedness (myopia) occurs when the
cornea is too curved,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.860
so light rays focus in front of the retina.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.219
Close objects may be clear, but distant objects
become blurred.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.300
LASIK can make the centre of the cornea flatter

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.309
by removing more tissue from the centre than
from the edge.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.700
Long-sightedness (hyperopia) occurs when the
cornea is too flat,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.680
so light rays focus beyond the retina.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.780
Vision is blurred for both near and far objects.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.619
LASIK can make the centre of the cornea more
curved by removing more tissue from

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.340
the edge than from the centre.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.210
Astigmatism occurs when the cornea is curved
irregularly, so light rays focus

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.870
at several points instead of one.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.470
The eye is unable to focus evenly.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.560
LASIK surgery corrects the shape of the cornea.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.850
Before LASIK begins, local anaesthetic is
used to numb your eye.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.770
This can be given as drops or as an injection.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.789
A special frame is put over your eye to prevent
you from blinking.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.450
A highly precise instrument (called a microkeratome)
is used to make

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.030
an ultra-thin flap in the cornea.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.390
The flap is opened

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.450
so that the laser can be used to shape the
cornea underneath.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.880
The computer-controlled laser (called an excimer
laser) will remove precisely the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.010
right amount of corneal tissue.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.530
The flap is repositioned and seals to the
cornea within minutes.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.409
Stitches are not needed.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.080
Antibiotic eye drops will be put in your eye
as a precaution to prevent

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.450
infection.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.170
After the procedure, your eye may be covered
with a protective dressing.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.629
This is the end of the animation.

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.870
