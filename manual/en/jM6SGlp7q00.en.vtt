00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
What do you mean ''I shouldn't take this too seriously''?

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.580
When you stand before these doors,
the one opening the door is all that matters.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.500
Your audience, and your goal is to entertain them.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.400
You want anything but to disappoint them, isn't it?

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.000
Would you risk receiving an apple?
-Never!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.360
That's the spirit.
It's showtime.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.160
Hello?

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.620
Hey babe, you know I love you.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.320
But today is 11 November.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.780
Bitch.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.460

-Wow

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.660
What's this bullshit?
Don't you see we're busy?

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.000
Stop the music!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.520
I hope you're proud of yourselves,
because you have ruined our show!

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.880
And we're only at the first song!

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.800
It's okay, take some sweets.
-No.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.880
Ik have disappointed you and myself.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.140
But honestly, I knew this would happen.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.540
I fooled myself.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.040
Every year I try to improve.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.680
Knowing I couldn't keep up.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.520
Perhaps it's time for others to step in.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.560
The new generation, the youths, the future.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.080
And yet again, the Rock-'n-Rock life style took its toll.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.920
They knew the risks when they began.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.000
You wanna go to the next home?

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.540
No, but it'll take some months to catch those pigeons.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.880
