JESS LIZAMA: Hi, my name
is Jess Lizama--

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.400
Exotic Jess on YouTube.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.330
I chose that name specifically
because I'm half Chamorro,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.315
half Islander, and half Irish.

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:14.020
MALE SPEAKER: Huh?

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.620
JESS LIZAMA: My dad kind
of looks like you.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.630
Not like you, you're very
much younger, handsomer.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.635
I am not from anywhere, I'm an
Army brat so I've traveled

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:24.870
everywhere.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.720
I've been doing YouTube for
two and a half years.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.900
I have 150,000 subscribers and
I've gotten 10 billion--

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.720
whoa, that's a large number--

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.920
10 million views.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.410
I started doing green screen
with characters, making fun of

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500
love and relationships because
those are really funny to me.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.640
I put up one video of me
going on a pretend

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.600
blind date with myself.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.040
[BURPS]

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.080
Wow, that's sexy.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.290
And it kind of took off.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.065
And three months later Michael
Gallagher, Totally Sketch, he

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:55.744
asked me to come to
LA and collab.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:57.643
Hey, mister.

00:00:57.643 --> 00:00:59.500
Eyes up here.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.570
Thank you Michael Gallagher for
doing a sex interactive

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.010
video with me.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.060
And it got a lot of
attention for me.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.780
The video that took off the
most is the one of me

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.210
dressed as a cop.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.130
It's a lot of bare midriff
and cleavage.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.074
How about you and I co-exist?

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.504
I was going to give you
a ticket, but--

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.490
OK, I'm not as proud of that
video, but I still love it.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.430
Now I've switched more to
vlogging, Q&amp;A, vlogging,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.440
sketch, vlogging, vlogging,
beauty.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.010
I don't know what I do.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.130
It's a trick question.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.820
I don't know where I am.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.870
I really like my vlogs.

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.510
I feel like I can take a subject
and kind of put my

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.250
spin on them.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.200
I dance everywhere.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.820
I even dance sometimes
in store aisles and

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.695
embarrass my child.

00:01:42.695 --> 00:01:43.640
But it's fun.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920
You blast your favorite
booty-shaking tunes and you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.880
dance away.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.190
My Mother's Day video is the
one I'm most proud of.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.290
Because nobody knew I had a
daughter until very recently

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.130
because I'm super private.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.540
Ta da!

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.970
I'm a hot mom, what can I say?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.760
I have a 14-year-old.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.100
I know, I had her when
I was like 5, OK?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.560
So, let's just get that
out of the way.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.300
I think I raised the most
brilliant human being ever.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.070
I'm not even joking.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.979
I was a teen mom, and I did
something right in this life

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.870
because she's fantastic.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh, I love
you, I love you.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.360
JESS LIZAMA: That's actually
where my winnings is going to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.230
go to, OK America?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.680
I'm going to get her braces
and two years

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.640
to a private school.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.516
I'm sure a lot of people are
donating to charity, and

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:25.350
that's super noble.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.680
But my child is my charity.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.080
I have loads of hobbies.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.790
I love to hike.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.840
I like going to the beach,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.760
exploring, geocaching, vlogging.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.900
I like to knit.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.320
I've been skydiving three
times, vlogging.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.050
Read--

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.930
I mean there's so many
books, right?

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.630
I could totally get
back into reading.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.440
I am a professional chocolate
connoisseur.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.680
Making it rain chocolate.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.350
It's probably 70% cocoa.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.620
Oh my god, I'm so good!

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.370
I want to do this show for
a couple of reasons.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.350
One, I think dancing is almost
as expressive as music.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.510
Two, you're connecting with
another human being, and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.510
you're creating a story.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.430
Hopefully my story doesn't end
up with me falling on the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.190
floor and tripping over
a dance move.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.710
My strategy for winning, I want
to bedazzle everything.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.330
I want to walk in the room and
every light to be so beaming.

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:13.990
Everyone will be like,
she's so angelic.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.500
No, it's the Swarovski
crystals.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.320
So I'm interested to see what
this competition brings out as

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.600
far as the other sides of me.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.250
Like the serious Jess, dedicated
dancer, Jess, the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.706
barely dance.

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.750
It's going to be an
interesting show.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.570
Hey, guys, I'm Exotic
Jess, and you are

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.470
