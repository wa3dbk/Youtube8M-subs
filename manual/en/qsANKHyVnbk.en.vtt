00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.837
- [Man 1] This is a video aimed primarily
at those of you new to the sport of

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:11.590
cycling, particularly if you've just begun
a regular commute in a busy town or city.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.840
There, of course, you're going to
encounter multiple junctions and traffic

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.780
lights where you'll need to stop and
unclip your pedals before continuing when

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.050
it's safe to do so. So here is
GCN's guide on how to do that as

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.610
smoothly and safely as possible. Before
you come to a stop, get yourself into a

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.800
gear in which you'll be comfortable when
you set off again. With a double chain

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.730
ring, this would normally be the small
ring and well up the cassette at the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.420
back. As you're gradually slowing down
towards the junction, remember to unclip

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.320
your foot in readiness. This will avoid
any embarrassing moments when you finally

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.560
come to a stop. I missed the bean bag. We
recommend always unclipping from the pedal

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.960
that is on the inside of the road. So for
those of you in countries where you drive

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.000
on the right, that means your right foot,
and for those of us who drive on the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.240
correct side of the road, the left foot.
If there's a curb next to the road,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.900
stop near to it so that you can place your
foot on top of it. This should enable you

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.510
to remain seated whilst you wait for the
light to turn green. In some cases there

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.010
may be a pole, post, or fence which you
can hold onto so that you can remain

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.330
clipped into your pedals whilst you wait.
However, don't be tempted to prop

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.660
yourself up on the car next to
you, or even a fellow commuter.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.400
Getting going again can be the tricky bit
if you're just getting used to clipless

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.610
pedals. This is where having it in the
right gear is really going to help.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.200
Push down on the pedal that you still have
clipped in, giving yourself enough speed

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
and momentum to allow time to clip the
other foot in. Try and avoid looking down

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.960
at the pedal if you can, as you
risk then drifting into the curb or,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.470
even worse, the middle of the road. If
you have one-sided road pedals such as

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.170
Shimano, Look, or Time, then it
can take some time to get used to.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.500
You want to try and push the top of the
pedal forward with the front of your shoe,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.620
and then engage the front part of the
cleat with the front of the pedal.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.300
Finally, push down at the back to fully
engage. If commuting is how you spend the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.280
majority of your time on the bike, then
it's worthwhile considering the use of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.310
mountain bike pedals or double-sided
road pedals such as Speedplay.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.680
This will make it much easier for
you to clip in each time, and also,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.240
if you go for the mountain bike option, it
will allow you to walk more comfortably

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.887
and not wear the cleats out so quickly.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.842
- [Man 2] When you get to the bottom of
the pedal stroke, you should pull your

00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:29.525
foot back and then up. The technique here
feels like scraping your foot back. You

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:33.000
should feel this effort in your
hamstrings at the back of your legs.
