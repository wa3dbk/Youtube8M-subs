Hallo everyone, this is Kevin from Kage Ninja
Gear.com, that's Kage with K. And today I'll

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.770
be showing you our exclusive Shinobi Ninja
Shoes.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.670
So let’s go ahead and get into it right
now.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.529
Okay, to start off with, this is going to
be the packaging it’s going to come in when

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:18.689
you open up the box.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:20.849
Let’s go ahead and see what’s inside.

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:27.050
Okay, so you are going to get a ninja shoe
for each side, let’s go ahead and pick one

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.560
for the left foot, which is right here.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:42.199
Now, this is what it looks like, it’s going
to have the traditional ninja tabi split toe

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.309
design, and it’s has three Velcro straps
so it can fit your calves whether you have

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.030
small calves like me or whether you have large
calves.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:02.329
Let’s go on and put it on.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:10.570
Okay, so once you have it on your foot, start
with the bottom, then the middle strap, and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.550
the top velcro strap and there you go, it
fits snuggly.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.740
Now, just as a note, is that these do run
a little bit small.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.229
For example, I typically wear 10.5, and this
is a size 11 that I’m wearing.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.200
So if you tend to wear a size 11 for example,
order a size 11.5 or 12.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.690
Now one thing that I really like about these
is that they’re light, they’re comfortable,

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.570
and they are actually designed for indoor
training or light outdoor training.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.240
They don't have a heavy thick sole that our
traditional Ninja Tabi Boots have.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.479
They’re light, they’re good for quick
movement or for proprioception.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.909
There you go, these are our Shionobi Ninja
Shoes.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.520
If you want to order a pair of these for yourself,
go straight to our website which is kage ninja

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.530
gear dot com, that’s Kage with a ‘K’.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.640
Thank you and have a great day.
