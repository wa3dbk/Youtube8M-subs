00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.660
I want to hear Unreal Engine 4 pros and cons.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.880
In 2014, Unreal Engine 4 came out for $19
a month, whereas you have to pay for the Unity

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.950
Pro version if you make a hundred thousand
dollars.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.220
That’s a pretty good deal.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.680
I’d love to have that problem when I have
a hundred thousand dollars.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.730
Unity 3D has more 3rd party extensions, components,
prototypes and even complete projects.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.550
Unreal Engine does not have as large of a
user base or marketplace for importing existing

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.590
scenes, roads and so forth.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.300
If the tool is easy to use, I can make my
own scenes.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.890
Unreal Engine 4 brought out Blueprints, a
type of visual scripting.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.329
What is blueprints, aside from the obvious
diagramming reference?

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.010
It lets you set up game functionality without
having to do much if any programming.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.040
You can do everything if you know C++, while
in Unity, you have to know JavaScript or C#.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.119
I’d love something that lets me avoid programming
in C.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.740
Unreal Engine has an easier to learn user
interface.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.050
And it has good graphics.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.100
It’s a game development engine.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.760
That should be a given.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.549
Unreal Engine is better at first person view
games, assuming you have a small virtual world.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.400
Need a big world, overviews of the scenes
like a flying game or role-playing, Unity

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.780
or another engine is the better choice.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.510
Unity’s price tag makes Unreal Engine seem
like a better choice.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.770
Unity is better if you want to create new
tools or workflows.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.390
With Unreal Engine 4, you get a good built
in physics engine and special effects like

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.780
sprites, but it is harder to find existing
effects and create your own.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.340
I’ve heard the particle effects and explosions
are not that good.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.060
It can be a deal if you do not have to hire
other people to do that effect for your game.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.960
Not having to hire a team to make special
effects or code as much is a plus.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.700
Some people consider the pay once and be done
cost of Unity to be a better deal.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.350
Then again, UE4’s Asset store is weak, so
Unity is more likely to have all the effects

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.180
you need for sale in their asset store.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.270
Having to pay for assets can add up to as
much as the subscription.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.880
At least Unreal Engine is cheaper for a year’s
subscription.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.250
I can try Unreal Engine 4 on subscription,
and cancel it for less than trying the full

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.390
version of Unity with a one year up front
subscription, or free Unity version you cannot

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.070
do much with.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.060
If you plan on working solo, both as a person
and as a software tool, Unreal Engine 4 is

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.450
a good choice.
