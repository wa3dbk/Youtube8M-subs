00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.640
Not Robotech, not Robotron, not Star Trek,
but Robotrek a somewhat obscure Super Nintendo

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.550
RPG title from 1994, published by Enix and
developed by Quintet and Ancient.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.140
Enix and Quintet teamed up to bring us some
really great SNES games, Actraiser, Soul Blazer,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.590
Illusion of Gaia and Terranigma and this one
is probably one of the lesser known titles,

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.440
which is a shame because Robotrek is a really
great game that is a lot of fun to play.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.930
You take on the role of the son of a great
inventor and are charged with dealing with

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.430
the local ruffians which eventually leads
you to an intergalactic, time traveling adventure.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.930
To do this however, you won’t be swinging
a sword or casting magic yourself, instead

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.020
you build robots to do your dirty work for
you being a sideline protagonist kind of similar

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.420
to the Pokemon games.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.830
You can build up to three robots and also
create other equipment and items to use with

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.040
your Invention Machine, shaped like a giant
nintendo controller.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:36.460
The game’s battle system is pretty unique,
especially for the time it came out.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.340
Battles are fought on a map and use a type
of ATB system.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.960
When your robot’s charge meter is full they
can take an action which will use up some

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
of the bar.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.850
While the bar charges the enemies get to go
also moving around the map to attack.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.020
There are a few added twists as well.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.420
A timer will give you a bonus if the battle
is won before it runs out and capsules will

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.830
contain bonuses and traps while the timers
ticks down.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:14.560
So there’s a touch of tactical strategy
as well giving it a unique feel.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.980
The robots are really customizable too even
down to what color you want them.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.129
As you level up from “Megs of Data” instead
of experience points, you can allot more points

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.060
into the robot’s attributes anyway you like.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.760
Different weapons options, special attacks,
and macro commands further add to customization.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.050
Also as you level up you can learn new things
to make in your lab.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:46.860
This along with lots of secrets adds a good
deal of replay value to Robotrek.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.360
Another high point is the game’s style.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.780
Anime influenced characters and sprites, and
a really good soundtrack further add to the

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.910
game’s charm and appeal.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.580
The Japanese title of Robotrek is actually
Slapstick.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.890
Which is fitting since the game is really
light hearted and often intentionally humorous.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.420
I think it’s meant for a younger audience,
but anyone that enjoys RPGs and games that

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:29.180
don’t take themselves too seriously will
definitely enjoy Robotrek.
