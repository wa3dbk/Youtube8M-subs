[Episode 5]

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:09.757
When did you switch your job from
an anchor to a social philanthropist?

00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:15.757
- It's not like that.
- Why are you raising a stranger's kid?

00:00:15.757 --> 00:00:21.633
He's not a stranger. He's the son of
someone I love. He's like my own son.

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.757
Besides, he is too young
to be homeless.

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.883
No, he's not.

00:00:25.883 --> 00:00:30.757
When I was his age, I worked and put
all my younger siblings through school.

00:00:30.757 --> 00:00:34.757
- Father, aren't you the youngest?
- You hush!

00:00:34.757 --> 00:00:37.633
Father, please let him live with us.

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:40.757
- If you don't...
- And if I don't?

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:48.216
You'll run away from home like last time?
Fine, leave! Take all of your stuff with you!

00:00:48.216 --> 00:00:53.757
But don't take what I've paid for, like
the lamp, toothbrush, and facial pads!

00:00:53.757 --> 00:00:55.757
Then since bro bought the dinner table,
fridge, air conditioner, TV, sofa...

00:00:55.757 --> 00:01:00.258
...laptop, and your expensive watch,
he should take all of it with him.

00:01:00.258 --> 00:01:02.757
The house is going
to look pretty empty, huh?

00:01:02.757 --> 00:01:05.757
- Come here, you!
- Your legs are so short!

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:09.757
- I thought they were arms.
- Gosh, I call these my sons!

00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:15.757
Anyway, there's no way I will approve,
even if hell freezes over!

00:01:15.757 --> 00:01:17.883
You got that?

00:01:34.757 --> 00:01:37.091
Why are you packing?

00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:39.757
You can't leave.

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:43.757
- Actually, I'm unpacking.
- Oh, really?

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:49.757
I came here with the intention to stay,
so I won't go anywhere.

00:01:49.757 --> 00:01:53.425
I'm sorry about this. Just know that
my father doesn't hate you.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:56.008
It takes awhile for him to warm up
to people, so just give him time.

00:01:56.008 --> 00:01:59.757
Should I stay at the sauna
in the meantime?

00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:06.966
No, no. My friend lives next door, so
you can stay there while I persuade him.

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:12.757
I'm hungry.

00:02:12.757 --> 00:02:16.757
Hey, go get two servings of spicy rice
cake, soondae, and fish cake to go.

00:02:16.757 --> 00:02:20.757
- Here you go and keep the change.
- Really?

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:24.757
Wait, it's only a dollar.
Give me more money!

00:02:24.757 --> 00:02:29.883
Kyung-pyo, I spent all of
my monthly salary feeding you.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.508
Does it make sense for me
to use my credit card for this?

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.757
So, get going before I get upset.

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:40.841
You wasted your salary
on drinking and shopping.

00:02:40.841 --> 00:02:43.258
Who is it?

00:02:43.757 --> 00:02:47.133
It's the anchor guy next door.

00:02:49.757 --> 00:02:51.133
Hello.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:55.216
Oh, what are you doing
here Jin-haeng?

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:57.592
Hello.

00:02:58.757 --> 00:03:00.757
Oh, I see.

00:03:00.757 --> 00:03:04.757
Don't worry, he can stay here
until you get the approval.

00:03:04.757 --> 00:03:08.133
My, you are so good looking.

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:12.592
Isn't he?
He looks just like his mother.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:16.757
Did you get much editing done?

00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:21.757
Oh! What are you doing here,
Director Kim?

00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:24.008
I'll take over from here,
so head home.

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:29.841
I have a lot on my mind,
so I want to work it off.

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:35.300
Okay, since you insist.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.758
- But I have a favor as well.
- What?

00:03:37.758 --> 00:03:41.757
Give the edited file to Mr. Oh
in the special effects team.

00:03:41.757 --> 00:03:45.757
And give the finished captions
to Mr. Jo of the CG team.

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:47.091
But, why?

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:50.757
Since you're closer to them.
I'm still awkward around them.

00:03:50.757 --> 00:03:54.133
That's true.
Alright.

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.757
Goodbye, then.

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:03.757
Wait, I feel like
I've just been cheated.

00:04:03.757 --> 00:04:06.717
Gosh, whatever!

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:11.757
I need to get over Jin-haeng, right?

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:17.341
He was almost married. And now,
her son's going to live with him.

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.757
Yeah, I'm going to forget it all.

00:04:19.757 --> 00:04:22.757
Let's just focus on work.
