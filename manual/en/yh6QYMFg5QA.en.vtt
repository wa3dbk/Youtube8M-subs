00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.080
Today I will be making hara bhara kabab.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.020
This is a very popular snack in all Indian restaurants.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.160
This is made with spinach, potatoes and flavored with spices.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.120
Spinach gives it lot of crispness

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.440
and this is very delicious appetizer.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.620
This recipe will make 20 hara bhara kababs

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.720
and will serve 4.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.700
To make hara bhara kabab we will need:

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.209
6 cups of finely chopped spinach
(do remove the stems)

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.700
1.5 cups of shredded potatoes.
I have already boiled, peeled and shredded.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.340
2 teaspoons of oil

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seed (jeera)

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.620
3/4 teaspoon of salt (namak)

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.760
1 teaspoon of ginger finely chopped

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.280
2 tablespoons of green chillies finely chopped

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.160
1/4 cup of chopped cilantro (hara dhania)

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.860
3 tablespoons of cornstarch

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.280
And we also need oil to fry.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.060
First I will saute the spinach.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.260
Heat is on, medium high.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.820
Let’s put the oil.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.640
Oil should be moderately hot before we add the cumin seeds.

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:37.879
I will put the cumin seeds.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.820
And just after they crack.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.100
I am going to put the spinach.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.600
So stir the spinach and keep pressing

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.460
because we want to evaporate all the water from the spinach.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.940
Spinach leaves lot of water

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.080
and this should take about 3 minutes

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
before spinach should be ready.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.300
This has been about 4 minutes.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.560
And keep pressing it. Still little bit water is coming.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.740
So I should stir few more seconds or maybe half a more minute.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.700
Spinach is looking good.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.360
It is still moist

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.060
and the water has evaporated.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.680
So turn off the heat and let it cool off at room temperature

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.620
before we will add the potatoes and other
ingredients.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.840
Spinach has cooled off at room temperature.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.380
And now I am going to add all the other ingredients.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.300
Potatoes

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.480
Cilantro

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.240
Ginger

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.680
Green Chillies

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.720
Salt

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.700
And cornstarch

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.720
Cornstarch is a binder and also gives the crispness.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.560
So mix everything really well together.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.720
It is going to be like a soft dough.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.540
We add the potatoes and other ingredients in the cold spinach

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.160
because otherwise it will become soft.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.540
Name is hara bhara kabab

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.200
so as you see the mix is looking green, nice color.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.840
Spinach and cornstarch gives a very crispy texture.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.300
Mix is looking good.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.940
And like I said it will be like a soft dough.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.380
Now I am going to divide them in 20 equal parts.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.100
It should be smaller than the golf ball.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.740
So I have already divided the mix.

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.680
And now I am going to just make them in oval shape.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.980
Heat is on, medium high.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.760
Oil should be moderately hot, not very hot.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.680
So oil is ready.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.700
So these should sizzle.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.580
But not come up right away if oil is very hot

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.740
they will cook fast and will not get crispy and will not cook through.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.540
And don’t overcrowd them.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.240
Hara bhara kababs are looking good.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.040
It should take about 3-4 minutes.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.640
And you should turn them in between few times.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.520
So they are golden brown all around the same.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.380
Hara bhara kabab is ready and they are looking really nice, very nice color.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.060
And it has taken me really about 6 minutes.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.460
And I am ready to serve them.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.960
Hara bhara kababs are looking great!

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.100
They are delicious.
They are crispy outside and soft inside.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.160
Today I will be serving them with tea to my friends

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.860
and I like to serve hara bhara kabab with tamarind chutney.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.100
Enjoy.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.180
Thank you.
