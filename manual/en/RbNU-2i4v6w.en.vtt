Hi everybody!

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.590
This is Jessica from JewelryTutorialHQ.com
and Bespangled Jewelry.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.370
Today we're going to learn how to make these
diamond shaped ear wires using a specialty

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.390
pair of pliers called Wubbers square mandrel
pliers.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.670
In this video we're just going to learn how
to make the ear wire part - I have a different

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.020
video that will show you how to wire wrap
the briolettes that you can attach at the

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.020
end.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.960
I'll link that in the notes along with a link
to the blog post where you can find a list

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.120
of supplies and more tips.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.219
I'm starting with two 3 inch pieces of 20
gauge wire, and using the back of my flush

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:46.239
cutters to trim the ends to make them flat
before I get started.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.960
I just want to check that they are still the
same length.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.530
And we will need to smooth one of the ends
of each piece.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.379
This is a cup bur and I have it in a pin vise.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.960
And to smooth the end, you just twist like
I'm doing here - in one direction, until it

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.970
smooths the sharp piece off the end.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.830
I'm going to show you a different way to do
this on the second piece of wire:

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.960
If you don't have a cup bur, you can just
use a needle file.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.560
Just make sure that you only make contact
with the metal on the down stroke.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.640
If you use it in a sawing motion back and
forth, too much metal gets caught in the teeth

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.940
of the file and it doesn't last for very long.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.980
And one final option, if you don't have a
needle file or a cup bur, you can just use

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:50.670
a nail file which is basically very fine grit
sandpaper - and just smooth the end, just

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.020
like this.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.510
And by the way the reason that we're doing
this is because this is the end that goes

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:06.659
through your ear and you always want to make
sure that end is smooth so it doesn't hurt.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.100
So now for the fun part!

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.219
We're going to make this into an ear wire.

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:21.750
Insert the smooth end of the wire about half
the width of the smaller jaw of your jumbo

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.180
Wubber's square mandrel pliers.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.879
Squeeze the pliers together and hold the and
rotate, pressing the wire against the mandrel,

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.450
especially against the corners as you turn
slowly.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.639
After you finish the third side, you'll need
to take the wire out and reposition in the

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:49.370
pliers so you can bend that last little piece.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.580
And when you remove it, you'll have a square.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.349
You'll see that one piece is overlapping,
and we're going to take the flush cutters

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:04.159
- always using the back side toward the end
of the wire that you want to keep flush.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:11.010
And we're going to trim it, leaving just a
tiny little space about 1 millimeter just

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.959
like this.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.959
Grab the end that you just trimmed with your
round nose pliers making sure that it doesn't

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:30.340
stick out on on the other side of the jaws,
and grip it about 4-5 millimeters down on

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:40.920
the plier jaws and twist away until the end
touches the other side.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.079
Now if you're using dead soft wire, you definitely
want to work harden the metal.

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.739
You can hammer it against a bench block, and
this is just a regular ball peen hammer that

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.290
I'm using.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:01.349
This helps stiffen the metal and makes sure
that it will hold its shape.

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.299
I'm actually using half - hard wire, and I'll
have more information on all of these tips

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.650
in the blog post that's linked in the description.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.430
Just give it a few taps against the bench
block and make sure that it retains its shape.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:21.450
Sometimes hammering can distort the shape
and stretch it a little - if that's the case

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:27.670
you can just use your square Wubber's and
just squeeze it against the sides to put it

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.010
back in its shape.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:39.170
Now we have finished one ear wire - you obviously
are going to do the exact same for the other

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.880
piece - and to attach your drop, you can use
your round nose pliers to open up the loop

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:56.160
that you made, slip on the briolette or other
drop or charm, squeeze that loop back in place,

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.420
and you have a really unique earring with
a cool diamond shaped ear wire!

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.690
I hope you enjoyed this project and that you'll
come back and see me again soon.
