00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.100
OK. Can you just slide your hand through that?
OK. Perfect!

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Can you grab my hand with it, or not? Oh wow, that's pretty cool.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Do it one more time. Ah, cool.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.220
I said I've got to do something because I
can help.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.000
So, you want to try it out? Yeah? OK!

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.000
I saw all these videos of kids picking up
stuff and I thought it'd be cool.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's good!

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I tell all of my students that we can change
the world; we can do something important;

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.389
we can do something impactful. And they come
in and they're just ready to jump in and try

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:54.429
something new.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.909
Shea and her class have come and visited our
class and we get to talk to her and interact

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.449
with her and it's really cool to see her put
on the hands that we've designed and use them

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.490
and really react to that.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.329
What I really want to do is to streamline
everything and make it so it's actually the

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:20.250
same size as her other hand so it feels like
it fits and it's a functional part of her

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.500
body.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.409
I knew that they would come up with better
ideas than I could come up with because that

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.799
is what our young people and our students
do here at UWM. They come up with ideas that

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.600
are grand and that brings a richness to the
project that I can't. I'm too old in some

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.109
ways to do that, to have a fresh perspective.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:46.159
None of the students have ever 3-D printed.
None. And so that entire production process

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.409
is different. None of them have ever used
a foam cutter. So it's a really fun thing

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.000
to see them all out of their element but willing
to work together and help each other.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:04.200
There's a Google+ community called E-Nable
and E-Nable is a group of about 400 members.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.450
I can talk to people from around the world,
I can download the files for (the hands).

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.970
We had our students join E-Nable and almost
immediately people who I would be intimidated

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.280
to talk to at first would chime in on their
sketches and their ideas. And the students,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.830
you could just see, they came in and they
were proud of the fact that they were part

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.349
of this and I think that that's really empowering.

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:33.349
I think just that rapid pace with which we
can develop and research, it's wonderful,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.629
it's marvelous.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.000
Pull them out and stick them on the finger
that you want them.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.300
I don't think there are a lot other kids out
there who can say that they get to be a part

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.840
of making their own hand and give feedback
back and can have choices. Just seeing her

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.689
joy - as a mom that's all you want is for
your kids to be happy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.159
Have you ever seen a laser cutter work? It's
pretty fun.

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.450
They're the ones who can sit here and spend
hours and hours and hours away from their

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.689
families working on stuff. It's just absolutely
incredible, absolutely incredible. It leaves

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:17.239
us speechless.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.909
Is that too tight or are you OK? It's OK?
OK.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:27.909
Yes, Frankie and I are giving them these hands
and sort of gifting them with our work, but

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:35.000
I think in a real way they are giving us the
bigger gift. This is the type of opportunity

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.549
that lets you re-fall in love with a discipline.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.159
Would that be cool? Put little charms in there?

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:46.030
There's so much more we can do. There are
so many more problems to solve. Being here

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.129
and being able to engage with our students
to do that, that's the greatest job in the world.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.379
