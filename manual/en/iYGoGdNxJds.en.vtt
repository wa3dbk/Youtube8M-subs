00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.400
&gt;&gt;MARLIN
Well, okay. I live on this reef, a long long way from here.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.700
&gt;&gt;DORY
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.900
&gt;&gt;MARLIN
And my son, Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.900
I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when he was out there,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.100
these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast. So we swam out in the ocean to follow them...

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.000
&gt;&gt;TURTLE KID
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into...

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.300
&gt;&gt;SMALL FISH
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.600
&gt;&gt;BIG FISH
Golly, that's amazing!

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.800
&gt;&gt;SMALL FISH
And then dives thousands of..

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.350
&gt;&gt;LOBSTER
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing. How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.930
&gt;&gt;SWORDFISH
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man. And then he has to blast his way...

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.580
&gt;&gt;DOLPHIN
So, these two little fish have been...searching the ocean for days...On the East Australian Current.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.000
&gt;&gt;FEMALE BIRD
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.330
&gt;&gt;MALE BIRD 1
..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.270
&gt;&gt;MALE BIRD 2
..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.500
&gt;&gt;MALE BIRD 3
That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
Nemo! Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.100
&gt;&gt;NEMO
What? What is it?

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.900
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.500
&gt;&gt;NEMO
My father? Really?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.000
&gt;&gt;GILL
Really?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.018
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and all sorts of--

00:01:20.018 --> 00:01:22.150
&gt;&gt;NEMO
Sharks? That can't be him.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.900
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.500
&gt;&gt;NEMO
Marlin?!

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.501
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.825
&gt;&gt;NEMO
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:32.651
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
I heard he took on three.

00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:33.895
&gt;&gt;DEB/BLOAT/GURGLE
Three!?

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:34.961
&gt;&gt;GILL
Three sharks!?

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.299
&gt;&gt;BLOAT
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.500
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat you were on like a maniac.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.357
&gt;&gt;NEMO
Really?

00:01:41.357 --> 00:01:46.313
&gt;&gt;NIGEL
He's swimming and he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic sharks capture him and he blows them up!

00:01:46.313 --> 00:01:55.500
And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a reward? He gets to battle an entire jellyfish forest!

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.727
And now he's riding with a bunch of sea turtles on the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right now, to Sydney!

00:02:01.727 --> 00:02:03.541
&gt;&gt;BLOAT
Wow! Ha ha ha!

00:02:01.727 --> 00:02:03.541
&gt;&gt;DEB
Oh, what a good daddy!

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.037
&gt;&gt;GILL
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.
