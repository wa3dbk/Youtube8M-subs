00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:15.200
The devil has cleverly deceived people into thinking
and saying that the Bible is the word of God.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.801
It's not the word of God, My Friends.

00:00:17.802 --> 00:00:21.300
The Bible was written by men.

00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:26.600
It is the word of men who have
met with God.

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:28.900
That is what the Holy Scriptures are.

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:34.900
It is what people wrote who had a meeting
with God, who heard from God.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:40.999
It is what people wrote regarding God,
but it's not the word of God.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.100
Those people testified in the Bible
that Jesus Christ is the Word of God.

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:57.900
It is written in John 1:1 - "In the beginning was
the Word, and the Word was with God,
and the Word WAS God."

00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.700
Jesus Christ is the Word of God, 
My Friend, nobody else.

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.900
The Bible is not the word of God.

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:07.200
You see, this is why the devil
is so clever.

00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:13.900
Because now people believe that if they've
got a Bible, they've got the word of God
and they don't need Jesus.

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:17.100
So they don't seek Jesus because they
believe they've got the word of God -

00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:22.400
- and they will categorically tell you that what
God wanted to say, He has said in His word.

00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:24.700
But God didn't say anything there.

00:01:24.701 --> 00:01:26.900
It was written by people.

00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:31.700
Each and every book of the Bible
has an author.

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:34.100
And none of them is God.

00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:37.300
The Holy Spirit inspired those people, oh, yes.

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:41.600
Because they got to know God, and therefore
they wrote about God.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:43.001
But none of that is the word of God.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:47.700
It is the word of people, it's not
the word of God.

00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:50.300
Jesus Christ is the Word of God.

00:01:50.301 --> 00:01:59.999
And as John wrote in John 10:27 -
"My sheep know My voice and they 
listen to Me."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.900
The sheep of Christ listen to Christ Himself.

00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:13.600
And as Paul wrote in Romans 8:14 - 
"Those who are led by the Spirit of God,
they are the sons of God."

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:21.700
So My Friend, if you do no know
Jesus Christ and hear His voice -
you've never heard the Word of God.

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:27.600
Don't think that you've got a book, which is
called the word of God - which is a LIE -

00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.200
- because God didn't write it,
men wrote it.

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:32.901
Jesus Christ is the Word of God.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:36.999
If you want to know the truth, and if you
want to know the Word of God -

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.300
- you've got to get to know Jesus, My Friend.

00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.700
You've got to be led by His Holy Spirit,
you cannot be led by a book.

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:49.500
That book was written by people who
knew God, who had seen the works of God.

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:54.100
It is not the word of God, My Friend -
you've been deceived.

00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:58.600
Get to KNOW the Word of God -
Jesus Christ!

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:07.800
Invite Him into you life, and He will
reveal Himself to you and you will hear
the Word of God.

00:03:07.801 --> 00:03:10.900
God never wrote, My Friend-
people write.

00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:19.200
They wrote the truth, they wrote about Jesus
and the Holy Spirit will confirm to you what
they wrote, but it's not the Word of God.

00:03:19.201 --> 00:03:23.600
Jesus Christ IS the Word of God, My Friend.

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:25.400
May Jesus Bless You.
