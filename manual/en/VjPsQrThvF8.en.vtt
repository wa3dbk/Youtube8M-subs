00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.300
Cycling shoes can be the biggest upgrade you
can make to your bike.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.490
It's going to increase your performance when
climbing, as well as sprinting.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.010
And it pretty much connects you in a much
better way to your bike.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:25.630
Two different options for choosing cycling
shoes are road shoes, such as this.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.349
The cleat is not recessed.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.740
It's going to be sitting on top of the bottom
of the shoe.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.929
It's going to be a little bit harder to walk
on.

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.630
Second option is going to be a mountain bike
shoe, such as this.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.840
The cleat is going to be recessed within the
tread of the shoe.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.770
Mountain bike shoes work really good, obviously
with mountain biking.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.930
But, it also works really well with recreational
cyclists.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.790
Road shoes are definitely the way to go if
you're planning on racing.

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.070
Another big difference between road and mountain
bike shoes are the cleats they accept.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.420
Road shoes only accept road cleats.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.990
They're going to be a little bit larger.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.510
They're in a delta form.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.500
Mountain bike shoes are going to be a little
bit smaller.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.100
They have four holes.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460
They are going to be a little bit more recessed
into the shoe.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:11.790
This is a road pedal.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.840
It would be compatible with a road shoe.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.310
It's going to connect with your road shoe.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.590
Your road shoe is going to have a cleat.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.719
It's going to lock in.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.479
It's going to be very easy to pedal with this.

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.630
It's also going to be very easy to unclip.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.020
All road shoes and road pedals are designed
for you to unclip when you crash, if you do

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020
crash.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.109
Also, it's going to be very easy for you to
unclip at a stoplight.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:39.850
When deciding which shoes you want, you can
think about a number of different applications.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.010
Road shoes are usually going to be lighter.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.799
They're usually going to be stiffer.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.869
At the same time, they're going to be a little
bit harder for you to walk around in.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.329
Mountain bike shoes, on the other hand, are
going to be a little bit heavier.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:56.970
They're going to be a little bit more flexible,
which might make it a little bit more comfortable.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.840
Yet, they're also going to be really easy
to walk in and a little bit easier to clip

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.840
into.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.030
I would recommend if you're looking to get
into competitive cycling, going for the road

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.030
show.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.520
If you're looking to just start recreationaly
riding, get the mountain bike shoe.
