00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.570
Hello, I'm John Wascher and I'd like to talk
to you about Hunter Smart Controllers.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.720
First, you might ask what is a Smart
Controller?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.840
Simply stated, a Smart Controller has
automatic

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.329
water savings features to include a
sensor

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.489
that optimally adjusts run times based on
local weather conditions.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.719
Smart Controllers help provide healthy,

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.260
beautiful landscapes, reduce water waste,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.180
save money, are environmentally friendly

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.920
and offer convenience to the homeowner.
All of Hunter's AC-powered controllers

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.100
like this previously installed Pro-C, are
capable of adding on Solar-Sync,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.100
transforming it into a Smart Controller.
Hunter controllers paired with Solar-

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.869
Sync

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.390
have been approved by the EPA as
WaterSense

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.290
Smart Irrigation Controllers. These
Hunter controllers

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.380
include X-Core, Pro-C

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.770
and PCC, I-Core and ACC.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.179
Remember, smart irrigation starts with
properly

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:26.689
designed, installed, maintained

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.920
and operated irrigation system. The
controller is fundamental to

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.399
operating the amount of time for each
zone and consequently, the amount of

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.069
water applied to the landscape. It is
important that an irrigation

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.899
professional

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.539
installs a Smart Controller and ensures it
is set up properly for the water

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.389
scheduling on the landscape. Once you
install

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:53.649
a Hunter Smart Controller paired with
Solar-Sync, you

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.670
can sit back and enjoy your landscape.
