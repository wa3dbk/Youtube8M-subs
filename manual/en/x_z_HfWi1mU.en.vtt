Welcome to Tuesday's tips from SewVeryEasy,
my name is Laura.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.060
Jelly roll, jelly roll, jelly rolls...I think we all love these jelly

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:16.600
rolls. And a jelly roll is a roll of fabric that is 2½" wide

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.000
with the entire line of fabric. So if there's 40 pieces of

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.880
fabric in that lineup, there'll be 40 in here. If there's 20.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.500
there'll be 20. Sometimes the companies will double up

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.840
on them if they have a smaller amount in their fabric

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.420
lineup. However, you can make your own jelly rolls and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.180
keep them handy for projects like this one. What I did is

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.140
whenever I finish a project, I just take whatever's left

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.780
over and I cut them into 2½" strips. I just take my rotary

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.240
cutter and I just finish cutting them all at 2½" strips.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.980
Then I keep them all in piles. So I have a light, a medium,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.980
and a dark. And I just keep accumulating them

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.480
until I have enough to do a project. And every once in a

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.580
while I'll purge through my fabric and take that fabric

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.680
that I thought Why did I buy it, what was I thinking?

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.020
I obviously liked it at the time, so I cut the entire piece up

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.180
into 2½" strips. So unlike a jelly roll where I'll only have

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.320
one fabric in each roll, I might have 10 or more.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.360
But that's fine because I can still use them for binding

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.680
and many other projects, but having them already pre-

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.320
cut, it's very easy to grab a pattern and make it.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.900
Just remember to keep your stacks into medium, light,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.080
and dark, and at any time you can grab that stash

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.960
and start sewing.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.960
