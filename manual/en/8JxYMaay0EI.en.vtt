00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.910
Researchers have discovered how to reuse paper
by creating a printer that uses water instead

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.359
of ink so the print fades within a day.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.090
And Korea is planning to build a new 1.23
billion dollar city that will include a theme

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.810
park and hotels....

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:15.810
FOR ROBOTS.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:16.810
Vsauce!

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.690
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.570
Scientists at the Albert Einstein college
of Medicine were able to see how the brain

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.460
makes memories using advanced imaging techniques
by tagging memory molecules in a mouse model

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.079
with fluorescent tags.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.649
Eyes On glasses let you see through skin to
get to veins.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.659
Evena Medical created the glasses that work
by pulsing four different kinds of light into

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:46.730
the skin and then combining it into a single
composite image.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.600
This gives healthcare workers a clear, real
time, anatomically correct image of the veins

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.909
beneath the skin to reduce issues like multiple
needle sticks.

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:02.449
The AKA24 is a future driving concept featuring
a magnetic road you drive sideways on next

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:03.960
to a traditional road.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.770
&nbsp;Designed by Chuang Dong and winner of the
Michelin Design Challenge drivers can choose

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.050
to stop controlling their vehicle and instead
ride the maglev-like railroad system.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.159
Once connected to the railway the car is flipped
on its side into the undriven position where

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.180
the driver would rotate to stay upright.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.289
This robotic ankle mimics the muscles, tendons
and ligaments of the lower leg.

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:33.579
A collaboration between Harvard University,
USC, MIT, and BioSensics have developed an

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.390
orthotic device to help those with ankle and
foot injuries.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.179
It uses pneumatic artificial muscles and soft
materials that are able to act like real muscles

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:49.289
by expanding and contracting but work is still
being done to make it wearable for patients.

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.399
Peanut allergies have been essentially cured
in 9 out of 10 kids with a new treatment that

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.979
gradually escalates the amount of peanut protein
the body can handle.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.759
Glyph is a mobile personal theater.

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.270
The virtual retinal display uses one million
micromirrors in each eyepiece and projects

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.920
images directly onto your retina creating
super sharp imagery.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.000
Users can connect to their personal content
library or stream movies from a smartphone,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.530
and even use it for gaming.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.440
It can also be used as an audio device and
worn like headphones and all you have to do

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.580
is pull the visor down over your eyes to start
the visual display.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.030
Researchers at MIT have created a wearable
book that makes the reader feel the same sensations

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.860
that the characters in the book are feeling.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.350
It uses 150 LED lights and a series on sensors
attached to a vest worn by the reader.

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.320
During scary parts the vest contracts around
the chest and waist, vibrations occur during

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.370
exciting passages to raise the heart rate,
and somber moments trigger soft dark lights.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.580
This new device is designed to harvest energy
from your organs.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.120
The piezoelectric device has been created
to constantly recharge pacemakers and other

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.100
implanted devices.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.610
It's sewn directly onto the heart, lungs,
or diaphragm because those organs are in constant

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.610
motion.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.910
The device has nanoribbons made of lead zirconate
titanate which bend slightly as the organs

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.620
move creating small amounts of energy to power
the implanted device.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.570
Triton is an oxygen respirator concept that
uses an artificial gill model.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.520
It extracts oxygen through a filter in the
form of fine threads with holes smaller than

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.350
water molecules.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.810
Just by simply biting on it, the user is able
to breath for long periods of time underwater

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.550
just as if they were on land removing the
need to learn how to use complicated scuba

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.550
equipment.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.450
Vigo can gauge your energy level and tell
you when to nap.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.840
The wearable device monitors your alertness
throughout the day by tracking patterns in

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.650
blinks and your body's movements so that it
knows you're drowsy before you do.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.950
And it can also make suggestions on how to
change your routine to be the most efficient

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.880
based on your average level of alertness over
the course of a day.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:26.500
Finally, Antimedia created a reel of footage
using Cinedrones - an aerial camera system.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:05:15.470
I'm gonna leave you with Rynocycle an electric
unicycle - and as always - thanks for watching!
