00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:06.420
hello

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.059
namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.059
with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today I'm going to cook seena

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.050
the seena is basically part of a lamb where it is removed from the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.090
lower rib which is got little fat lot of times when you want to make

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.970
vindaloo or something you can substitute

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.529
pork with this seena meat and you'll
get similar kind of

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.939
flavors, add few raisins do not add too
much

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.860
into a blender, some chopped onion, add red chillies

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.290
little bit of vinegar and blend it

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.030
into a fine paste; today I'm going to cook this seena by adding little bit raisins

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.860
so add little bit oil into them the pan

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.079
to hot add little bit of garam masala,

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.160
cloves, cinnamon and cardamom and add

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.660
half a teaspoon of cumin seeds I added half a onion into the blender

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.690
the rest half onion chopped one I'm good at it here

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.690
add Salt

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.030
now these onions are slightly brown

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.700
add ginger garlic paste, add pinch of turmeric

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.820
to this add this paste of red chilli, raisins, onion

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.369
and vinegar, adding this

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.960
red chilli paste to this oil brings out a very nice red color

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.380
now you can add this seena pieces, to
this add

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.869
1 tablespoon of coriander powder, half a tablespoon of cumin powder

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:42.670
and mix it up

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.890
add coconut powder

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.500
1 tablespoon of it now if you want to
add little bit water you can add

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.040
but in the paste itself there is lot of moisture for me and

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.329
cover it up with your pressure cooking
pan if you do not have a pressure cooker

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.759
just put a lid on it and let it cook on a
slow flame

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.399
till the meat is tender; after cooking for around 30 minutes

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.420
the meat is all cooked and since this seena has got lot of fat it may ooze out

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.599
oil

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.620
so to start off with you can use little less oil

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.860
and even if you see lot of oil just you can skim off this oil with a spoon

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.730
going to add little bit salt run out of salt this time

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.640
when most of the moisture is evaporated these

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.340
masala stick to this seena meat and then add

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.390
little bit of garam masala powder and finish it off with chopped coriander

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.580
ok now you can see how this pieces of seena

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.260
with all this masala attached and they become very juicy

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.239
even these bones are cooked to such a point that they literally melt away when you

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:50.970
chew on them

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.170
these seena bones with are chewable bones

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.170
I call them are very juicy and very nice

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.840
