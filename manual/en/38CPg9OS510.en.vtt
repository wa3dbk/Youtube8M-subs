00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.550
I met Doris in the park, like, my first week out there.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.310
Doris: He was, um, doing his puppets in the park,
and I'm very interested in puppets. I brought

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.400
him a couple of my articles that I had
written for the paper.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.860
She was a columnist I guess, way back.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.320
So the next time he saw me, he said, "Oh,
I have something for you." I sat down next

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.180
to him and he pulled out the
Little Doris puppet.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.980
Ricky: I decided to make a marionette of her, just
to wow her, like all right you want to be

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.740
nice to me, well here we go.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.320
Come on inside. I'll show you the place. Sometimes
I call it "the garagenous zone."

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.870
This is what would normally be like my little
general store, you know. Nothing you have

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.260
to buy, but I keep little chips over here
on a little rack here, you know.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.950
Look at Little Red. Watch Little Red.
Oh, he's wicked. Look at him.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.600
Hey, why don't you help Stix out with hisâ€”
oh. Never mind.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.979
This is my very, very first marionette, Elwood.
As I carved out, he started to take on this,

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.030
like, Haitian artwork. That's what it reminded
me of. So I said, you know, I said I'll make

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.610
him a little beachcomber. A little
Haitian beachcomber.

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:41.159
Turn on the little house light here in the
center and, you know. I'll show you a little

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:49.719
bit of inside the dog here. Wood, and string,
and eyelets, uh, you know, a piece of rubber

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.509
hose. This is a Glade Air Solid cover. I sculpted
the mouth and the lips and the whole head

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.780
out of tin foil and then little glass marbles
I used for the eyes. Then there's this really

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.240
wicked looking control that just looks like
it wasn't built overnight, for sure.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.400
I hated work more than anybody. Hated being
there. Hated having to be there, driving there

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.319
when everybody else was driving there. Ah,
man, being in the rate race was justâ€”and I

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.810
wanted to be out so bad. So you know what?
Music was my halfway step out. Doing my music

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.709
gig. During all that time I had all week to
do what I wanted to do, and these marionettes

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.680
I started making. And I took them to the park
when I was going to street perform and, you

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.819
know. I would rather die on the street as
a street performer than try to create some

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.179
sort of life that's going to satisfy
somebody else.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.760
This guy's name is Chops. He was a prop for
this music video I did. This is actually my

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.729
face. See, this was me under all this. Without
the bandana and this, it's really me.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.140
Come on in.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.019
I grew up up until high school in Queens.
And then my folks moved to Massachusetts.

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.769
And small town was not for me. I came back
to New York. I got married to the guy who

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.769
had this apartment. We never had any kids.
We had sex, but nothing happened.

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:48.269
I have no sense of age somehow, which everybody
gets a kick out of. I can't tell whether they're

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:55.370
25 or 45. When I go to the park, any number
of people from different groups and ages and

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.239
so forth come over and greet me. If the person
is interesting, that's what I relate to. Not

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:09.700
whether they are black or white or 60 or 15.
Well, 15 maybe is a little bitâ€”20.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.700
Oh, I think Ricky is supposed to be coming.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.340
Doris: Hello?
Ricky: It's the IRS. Hey!

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.360
Doris: Well hi there!

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.450
Ricky: Hey.

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.300
Doris: Oh and here's the puppy, too.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.630
Little Doris has curly hair now, and I don't
anymore.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.060
Yeah. Are you going to make me change the
hair, or are you going to change yours?

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.250
Doris: I guess it was about two weeks after he made
it that he said he was going out and get something

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.370
for lunch, could I watch the puppets while
he was gone? So he came back and he discovered

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.810
that I had a whole line for the puppet that
he hadn't even thought of. I had the puppet

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.000
waving to people when they came by, you know,
and people would wave back to the puppet.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.380
Ricky: She likes to do her thing where she doesn't
want to dance with Stix. Like, Stix goes to

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:01.470
dance with her, and she moves away. And then
she gets her cane and shakes her cane at Stix,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.910
you know, and then Stix walks over to the
bench all bummed, you know, and I'm like,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.479
"That's all right, buddy, just drink it off,"
you know.

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:13.610
People would walk by and take pictures of
her with the puppet, and she just felt like

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.150
a queen, you know. And her friends are telling
me that, you know, since this puppet, man,

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.970
you know, she's really, it's like she's getting
younger, you know, and I'm going like, oh

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.380
wow, like, you know, did I do that?

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.830
I went from having to play gigs and, you know,
pull concrete and all that to I'm doing this

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:41.759
and people are putting money in my hat and
people feel like this. I was just overwhelmed.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:47.530
All these years I haven't been a laborer trying
to be an artist or a, uh, steelworker trying

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.950
to be an artist, you know. I was an artist
trying to be all those other things.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:55.560
So that's who I really am.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:08.110
(singing) Your Cheatin' Heart will make you weep. You'll
cry and cry and try to sleep. But sleep won't

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:19.750
come the whole the night through. Your cheatin'
heart will tell on you. When tears come down

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:33.250
like falling rain, you'll toss around and
call my name. You'll walk the floor the way

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:41.710
I do. Your cheatin' heart will tell on you.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:42.880
Hahaha.
