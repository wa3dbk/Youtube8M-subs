It's Local Edition, I'm Brad Pomerance. Thank
you so much for joining us. We are going

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.069
to have so much fun right now. We are
meeting with Cheryl Hayashi, she is a

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:21.899
professor of biology at UCR, she has
brought a doctoral student in genetics

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:26.789
Jim Starrett, and we're talking about
spiders and we have spiders to play with.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.429
Before we get to the spiders, talk to us
about your research.

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.790
[Hayashi] My lab studies the evolution of
spiders and spider silks.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.070
[Pomerance] Which is the webs?
[Hayashi] Exactly.
[Pomerance] So what are you looking at?

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.820
What are you looking for when you do your
research?

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.690
[Hayashi] Well, there's kind of two aspects. One is We
try to figure out

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.090
sort of the performance properties of
spider silk,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.120
so of how strong, how stretchy, how 
tough is it. And the other aspect is we

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.309
want to understand how's it made. So, most
people don't realize this but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.120
spider silk is made of protein.
[Pomerance] Really?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.670
[Hayashi] Proteins are encoded by genes so, we
can clone the genes, 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.890
that actually encode, that are the
blueprints of the spider silk.
[Pomerance] I have to tell you

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.520
my family and I love spiders and love spider webs.
We have a certain location in our home

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.120
where they're spider webs. We think
they're miracles.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.590
We really do think they're miracles, they are
so beautiful. Let's talk about these

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.430
miraculous creatures. The first one
I'm going to hold up right now. This is the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.780
Western Black Widow. It is so beautiful

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.910
tell us about the Western Black Widow.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.320
[Hayashi] Well the Western Black Widow is a spider

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.510
probably pretty familiar to most people
that live around

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.880
Southern California.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.530
So they're

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.549
quite common, they come out at night.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.830
And they make fabulous, fabulous silk.
[Pomerance] Do they?

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.980
[Hayashi] Yeah.
[Pomerance] Now, I must say they are poisonous.
Is that right?
[Hayashi] Yes, so...

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.510
[Pomerance] No touch.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.550
[Hayashi] Virtually all spiders have venom, but
most spiders, their venoms aren't actually

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.000
active against people.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.910
[Pomerance] OK.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.040
[Hayashi] But black widows, widows in general,
actually, widow spiders, there's

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.630
a component in their venom that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.070
actually works on

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.740
vertebrates. So that's why it works on our
neurons too.
[Pomerance] So what would happened if we were
bitten by a black widow?

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.679
[Hayashi] It would be very painful
and, you know, if you get enough venom in you
then you probably would

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.390
want to go to the doctor some medical treatment.
[Pomerance] OK, so let's be careful.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.290
[Hayashi] Yeah, it's a neurotoxin.
[Pomerance] OK, let's talk about this. This

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.089
is a brown widow, a little smaller,

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.850
but just as beautiful. I feel like I see
some orange there?

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.189
[Hayashi] Yeah!
[Pomerance] So talk to us about that.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.419
[Hayashi] So the brown widow, their hourglass...
on the black widow you can see the red hourglass,

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:33.709
on the brown widow, their hourglass is often
colored orange.
[Pomerance] Hmmm.

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.249
[Hayashi] Brown widows, they have been
transported all around the world just by,

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.760
you know, human shipping activity. So they're
not native to this area.
[Pomerance] But are they in this

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.549
area?
[Hayashi] Yes, yes, yes. This particular one was
found, I think 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.509
around San Diego County, but you can find
them in

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:55.429
the Inland Empire, Los Angeles and also
San Diego.
[Pomerance] Talk to us about the importance of

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.159
spiders. When I found a spider in my
house

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.190
I somehow capture it and take it outside.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.099
Just in my mind I know that they are
so important, just for the ecosystem.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.400
[Hayashi] Exactly.
[Pomerance] Tell us.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.730
[Hayashi] Well, spiders, their main role, what they do is

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.459
they eat insects.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.430
And so that is very valuable. If all
the spiders were to disappear,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.519
you know, we would be just

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.079
awash...
[Pomerance] Overrun.
[Hayashi] Overrun, exactly. So
spiders play a very important role that,

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.989
where they eat insects. But on the
other hand, spiders are also, they

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.819
themselves are prey for

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.859
other organisms.
[Pomerance] Such as?

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:33.079
[Hayashi] Birds and lizards,

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.949
and there's many kinds of insects
that actually parasitize spiders or even
pasasitize the

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:43.069
eggs of spiders, so there are certain kinds...
[Pomerance] I have seen... I have watched "Life" on
the Discovery Channel, as well as "Planet

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.479
Earth" on the Discovery Channel, and I have

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:49.050
seen how other organisms will, how do you say it?

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.050
[Hayashi] Parasitize.
[Pomerance] Yeah, and it's just
remarkable. Let's take a look at this.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.220
This is a, I guess, a traditional 
garden spider?

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.849
Can you see this, John? Right here?

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.319
Can you see it?
[Hayashi] That's a juvenile garden spider.

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.169
So, she'll grow up to be

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.929
probably about as big as my thumb when
she's full grown.

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:12.439
And this is a garden spider, but today she
decided not to make that beautiful orb web

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:17.079
[Pomerance] That's OK. She's beautiful.
[Hayashi] And one of the things that
I love about garden spiders is

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.459
that they can spin seven kinds of silk.
[Pomerance] I love it. OK, we're going to
do another fun

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.589
segment with you, so be sure to take...

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:26.689
stay tuned to Local Edition.
I'm Brad Pomerance, thank you for joining us.
