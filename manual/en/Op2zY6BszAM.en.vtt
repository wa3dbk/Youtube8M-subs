00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.110
My name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:14.469
to make gingerbread. It's been two hours.
Here's our dough. It's going to be nice and

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:21.820
hard which means it's going to be a little
difficult to work with, but it won't be impossible

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:29.590
to work with. What we'll do now is grab our
rolling pin. What we're going to do now is

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.540
roll it in the pan. Start in the middle. With
it being firm like this, it will be a little

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.300
harder to roll out. You want to make sure
that you keep your thickness of whatever you're

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:54.400
rolling out the same, so apply even pressure
as you roll it. This doesn't necessarily have

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.390
to go all the way out to the edges. We just
want to get it to where it goes to the thickness

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:11.330
we're looking for. Depending on what you're
doing with it, You want to go anywhere between

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.740
a quarter of an inch and a half an inch. Right
now, we're at half an inch. I'm going to go

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.640
down to a quarter, because half is a little
bit big for what I'm doing with it. We're

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.590
just going to keep working it out. Something
else you can do; you can actually get a dowel.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.910
It measures the diameter that you're working
toward. Put that dowel in your pan, so you

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:46.210
can see when you reach the depth that you're
looking for. You'll be able to see it easier.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.570
We want to move fairly quickly as we do this,
because as it starts to warm up, it gets a

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.710
lot tackier, or stickier; it becomes harder
to roll. You also want to make sure that when

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.500
you roll, you roll all the way over your edges,
too. You don't want to stop before your edges,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:11.610
and put a lip on the edge. I think we're pretty
much done for rolling it out. You just want

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:18.819
to get a nice even layer here on the top,
and you see, I didn't go the whole length

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.700
or width of the pan because I didn't need
to. This is the time in which you would cut

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.071
the shapes out that you're looking for, unless
you just want to do big pieces of gingerbread,

00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:33.069
like this. What I'm going to do is take a
knife and...you know what, because I don't

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.870
want to hurt my pan, I'll just take a spatula,
and we're going to cut this in half, and go

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.230
from there.
