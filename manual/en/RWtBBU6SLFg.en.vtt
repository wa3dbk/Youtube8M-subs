00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:10.760
Even from watching videos on Youtube, people
have seen the people who testify for Jesus!

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:18.930
If you have heard the message, and seen those
who preach Jesus and HIS Righteousness,

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.470
but you reject, you will certainly NOT be
held faultless, you will be held accountable

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.150
to every word that you heard.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:35.460
You will be held accountable to every thought
that you though after you watched that message.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.320
You will be held accountable before Jesus
when you die on judgment day.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.300
MANY people hear but then REJECT
because they HATE the message of repentance.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.309
They donâ€™t think that to follow Jesus means
they need to REPENT of ALL SIN!

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:01.250
They have bought the life of Satan that you
can continue to sin and somehow you will be

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.760
righteous in the eyes of Jesus.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.799
THAT IS A LIE!

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.140
IF you choose to follow Jesus and be HIS disciple,
you have to TRULY REPENT,

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.230
which means LEAVE YOUR SIN BEHIND and choose
to follow JESUS in Righteousness.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.540
If you want to be a disciple of Jesus then
start PRAYING, and ask the Lord HOW to be

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.470
pleasing to HIM.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:31.990
It is impossible for a man to be without sin
without asking the Creator HOW to be pleasing

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.090
to HIM!

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.630
GOD is the One who defines SIN, and if you
want to know if you are pure or impure

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.840
you go the Lord Jesus in prayer and you just
start pleading with HIM for the Holy Spirit.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.659
Jesus DOES promise the Holy Spirit to convict
of SIN, Righteousness and Judgment,

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.140
and if you are TRULY seeking the Lord He WILL
show you if you are in sin,

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.310
and if you are you have to choose, either
to follow Jesus and leave that sin BEHIND,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.840
OR to continue in sin.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.259
Will you be found righteous?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.999
Or will you be found in your sins?

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.890
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
