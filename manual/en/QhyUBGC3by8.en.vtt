00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.860
Your doctor has recommended that you undergo
a biopsy procedure - or lumpectomy.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.420
But what does that actually mean?

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.640
Biopsy is a general term which simply means
"the removal of tissue for microscopic examination."

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.860
Your doctor intends to remove tissue from
your body, not because you're necessarily

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.860
ill,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.940
but because biopsy is a very accurate method
for analyzing unusual growths or other suspicious

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.410
tissue.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.019
Because it provides such accurate diagnostic
information, biopsy is an important diagnostic

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.610
tool in the fight against cancer.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.440
In your case, you have a suspicious lump or
other tissue which needs to be examined.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.730
It may have been felt by you or your doctor...

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.690
... or spotted using other diagnostic tools
such as x-ray.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.390
Let's take a moment to look at the reasons
why lumps or growths form.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.580
The body is made of many different kinds of
tissues and those tissues are all subject

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.300
to change during the course of a normal lifetime.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.610
Usually, a thickening or lump turns out to
be benign, or harmless, and often requires

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.640
no treatment.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.600
In some cases, lumps are malignant tumors,
caused by the growth of cancerous cells.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.720
These growths need to be treated as rapidly
as possible...

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.920
In order to learn more about the nature of
the suspicious tissue, your doctor would like

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.171
to surgically remove it.

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:47.171
Most likely, you're feeling some anxiety about
this procedure, which is perfectly understandable.

00:01:47.171 --> 00:01:48.171
You should realize that it's natural to feel
apprehensive about any kind of biopsy.

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:49.171
But ignoring a suspicious growth won't make
it go away.

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.171
If you're feeling anxious, try to remember
that the purpose of a biopsy is simply to

00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.171
find out what is going on in your body - so
that if you do have a problem, it can be diagnosed

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.171
and treated as quickly as possible.

00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.171
If you should decide not to allow your doctor
to perform the biopsy, you'll be leaving yourself

00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:54.171
at risk for medical problems.

00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:55.171
If the suspicious tissue in your breast is
benign, most likely you'll suffer few if any

00:01:55.171 --> 00:01:56.171
complications.

00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:57.171
However, if it is cancerous, and it is allowed
to grow unchecked - you might be putting your

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.171
own life at risk.

00:01:58.171 --> 00:01:59.171
The bottom line - trust that your doctor is
recommending this procedure for your benefit

00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.171
and above all don't be afraid to ask questions
raised by this video and to talk openly about

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.171
your concerns.

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.171
After allowing a few minutes for the anesthetic
to take effect, the surgeon will make a small

00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:03.171
incision.

00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:04.171
Once the incision has been made, your doctor
will begin looking for the lump.

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.171
You will feel some pressure or even slight
tugging or pulling - but you should not feel

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:06.171
any sharp pain.

00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:08.090
Once the lump is removed, the doctor will
close the skin over the incision as neatly

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.781
and as cosmetically as they are able.

00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:16.940
Finally, a sterile dressing is applied.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.280
Your tissue specimen will be sent immediately
to a lab for microscopic analysis.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:47.099
Your doctor will tell you when to expect results
from the tests.
