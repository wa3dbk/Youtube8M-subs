00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.240
Today on BRStv we are going to discuss filter
socks and the reef tank.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.860
Hi, I'm Ryan host of BRStv where each week
we cover a new topic related to reefing.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.289
This week we are going to hit on filter socks.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.130
We will talk about why reefers use them, why
some reefers don't and how to clean them.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.070
Filter socks are a pretty common piece of
equipment on a reef tank.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.880
They're used primarily to keep the water column
free of suspended particles so the water looks

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.300
crystal clear.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.300
If you are good about changing them frequently
they can also be a component of your nutrient

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.110
export maintenance cycle.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.280
Most often they are placed on the output of
your overflow pipes so all the water leaving

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.269
the tank has to pass through them.

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.920
The sock is made out of a felt like filter
cloth which will capture food, fish poo, floating

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.549
particulate matter and other waste that goes
down the overflow.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.319
Capturing all this will prevent it from being
recycled back into the tank by the return

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:57.819
pump and ultimately the water column will
be much clearer which is the primary reason

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:58.819
I use them personally.

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:03.010
If you are good at swapping them out they
can also be a really solid nutrient export

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.100
method as well.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.860
Since the sock is trapping the food and fish
turds you can remove the sock which will effectively

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.180
remove the waste before it has a chance to
break down into nutrients like nitrate and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.180
phosphate.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.080
Now there is a caveat to this, if you leave
the socks in too long the organic matter will

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.670
breakdown within the filter sock and add nutrients
anyways.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.230
So how long is too long?

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.530
Really depends on what you are feeding and
the type of livestock you have.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.750
If you changed them every day it would likely
be very effective however most people wouldn't

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.360
be that diligent about it.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.420
If you changed them a couple times a week
it would likely still be pretty effective,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.500
once a week somewhat effective and beyond
that who knows but I don't think it's likely

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.920
to have a tremendous impact on nutrients if
you change them every two weeks or longer.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.930
The fact that food and waste breaks down within
them and produces nitrate has some people

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.600
referring too them as nitrate factories.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.260
I don't think that is entirely fair because
they certainly are not adding nitrate to the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.870
water themselves and the organic waste in
the tank is going to turn into nitrates whether

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.840
it happens in the sock or somewhere else in
the tank.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.030
The one concept that gives this line of thought
some credibility however is some of the food

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.340
and waste is getting caught up in the sock
before the skimmer has a chance to remove

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.340
it.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.769
While that is true to some degree because
I have seen skimmers pull out some small particles

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.219
of food like plankton additives, the skimmer
isn't going to pull out whole pellets of food

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.959
or whole Mysis shrimp they are going to have
to breakdown first.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.139
Skimmers are really designed to remove small
molecules like proteins, amino acids, and

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.760
organic and inorganic molecules not chunks
of food.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.319
As far as implementing them goes, they are
included in a wide variety of sump designs.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.569
If you are looking for one that will connect
to a pipe CPR makes one called the Sock--it

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.439
which comes with a bracket, and a pipe attachment.

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.700
Vertex makes one that is pretty stylish using
their signature titanium screws.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.249
Which comes in a 4 inch and 7 inch version.

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.340
Like everything they make it absolutely has
to look sharp.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.060
So once you start using these you will have
to clean them.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.340
My suggestion is to buy a couple month'sworth
so figure out how often you are going to change

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.469
them and buy that many.

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.720
You can clean them out by hand in the sink
but that doesn't really work that well a better

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.379
bet is to use the washing machine.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:13.799
I like to run a empty cycle on my washer to
rinse any soap that might be in there out

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.739
and then throw all my socks in.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.590
They come out remarkably clean.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.609
If you don't change them out frequently or
the tank is at the office we do sell them

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.609
in bulk so it isn't a huge cost to just replace
them as needed as well.

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.670
They do come in a couple types, draw string
and plastic ring.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.110
Most people will use the plastic ring if they
have a bracket or sock incorporated sump.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.809
The draw string versions can be used to tie
around the end of a pipe or other unique solutions.

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.950
Lastly they come in a thin mesh and felt material;
most people use the felt version for the uses

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.400
we talked about today.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.969
The thin mesh is more commonly used with a
draw sting to hold filtration media like carbon

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:50.969
and GFO.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.040
The mesh however can be used with the plastic
rings to capture large particles like whole

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.989
food pellets and shrimp which you can swap
out frequently and the mesh versions are super

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.010
each to rinse out.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.499
So this is a hotly debated topic, stir up
some drama and share your thoughts with filter

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.670
socks with everyone in the comments down below.
