Welcome to another cajon lesson!

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.040
My name is Ross McCallum

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.080
This is the 50th cajon lesson on my channel.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.560
So there's actually a playlist now with 50 videos

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.280
called "My Cajon Lessons".

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.740
So with that out of the way

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.460
Let's talk about what we're doing today!

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.280
I thought that the most interesting thing or no, I don't know the most stupid thing I could do celebrate my big 50 of cajon lessons

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.000
was to think of the most outrageously difficult, unusual beat that I could come up with on the cajon

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.200
So that's what we're learning today

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.360
You can use it to make people go "what the hell is he doing"

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.080
Have fun with this groove it comes in 2 parts:

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.460
The first part is a couple of bars of 5/4 and then the second half is 11/4.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.180
So 5/4 5/4 11/4!

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.060
And I'll show you guys how it sounds

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.640
I'll slow it down a little bit, show you on the metronome.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640
And let's see if we can put it together!

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.020
So there you go, that's the 2 elements of that beat!

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.340
Slow it down as much as you can when you start to learn it.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.220
Try to figure out where each of those finger strokes is landing.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.100
And how it comes together.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.340
I know that's a very short explanation for what's going on there.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.660
So now let's see what happens if we speed it up from that point

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.880
And get an idea of how it came from there to what you heard at the start of the video.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.940
So thanks very much for watching guys!

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.260
