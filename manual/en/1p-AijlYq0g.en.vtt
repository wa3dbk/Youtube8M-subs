00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.819
My todays video is dedicated to St. Valentine's day and it's going to be about

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.649
How to draw a cartoon style awesome cupid sketch.

00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.329
This is the final look of this sketch,

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.739
I've decided to colorize it, just to show you how it can look in color.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.449
I will start from drawing this oval shapes,

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:25.670
it is going to be Cupid's eyes and nose.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.359
Above the eye s there gonna be eyebrows.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.060
Face is made of two ovals - bottom one

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.150
is for a mouth and cheeks and the top one is for forehead. I will draw one ear,

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.540
because the second one is hidden behind the head.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.059
To made his hear curly,

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.480
I will draw some circles and ovals

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.390
at his currently bold head.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.190
This shape reminds me a cloud.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.610
Our Cupid is a funny guy, so I will draw him a big happy smile,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.610
like he shot someone and enjoying.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.560
Time to draw him

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.799
 a body with a belly button,

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.900
it's going to be round too.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.980
the right hand

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.500
will be holding an arrow

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:17.500
and the left one - his magic bow.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.850
Don't forget about his wings,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.690
any real Cupid have them,

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.750
 so do ours.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.600
Ok, this is not the best arrow I can draw,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.600
but it's too late to fix it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.650
i've decided

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.799
to place him on the cloud,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.799
but it also can be a bush, just draw some stems under it.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.590
Love is in the air, so let's draw some floating hearts for decorations.

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.339
Few freckles and we are done!

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:27.339
Now I'm going to erase extra lines and clean up this image

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.969
We are done sketching,

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:36.339
usually at this stage I'm sending this drawings to Adobe Illustrator

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.359
to work on final image.

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.329
 I'm tracing contours and adding colors to it.

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.369
But this video is about sketching.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:50.079
Don't worry, the sketch can be colorful too. I've picked some colors and

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:57.079
going to colorize our Cupid.

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:25.789
Add some Photoshop magic and our final sketch is done.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.550
