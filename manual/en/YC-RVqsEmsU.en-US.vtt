00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.130
hey, I'm Eric Triplett the Pond Digger welcome to
our demonstration set

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.550
we're gonna teach you how to build a pond
step-by-step in great detail

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.449
we're gonna cover fundamentals

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.460
we're gonna take it from the design
layout process all the way through

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.730
excavation skimmer installation

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.960
you'll be glad to know that we're going to take
great time in showing you proper

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.180
placement of underwater lights so you're
get that real pop in that pond at night

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.460
we're gonna cover waterfall construction

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.660
we're gonna talk about aquatic plants
that can make or break your pond and

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.890
we're gonna show you some some tips and
tricks that the top contractors across the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.770
nation use

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.720
on edge treatment to make their ponds
look so amazing

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.640
in this video series you're gonna learn how to
build a pond right the very first time

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.460
so whether your that weekend warrior

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.179
that's tackling the project all by yourself
or you're having it professionally installed by

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:04.379
a contractor

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.920
you gonna have a really good idea of how the
whole process comes together

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.730
let's get started

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.960
this is an eight by eleven pond kit it's
an extremely popular size for beginning

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.540
hobbyist all the way up to advance hobbyists we
have a waterfall filter we have a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.030
skimmer with the piping the pumps
underlayment underwater lights the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.490
works in here its a standard kit

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.860
now what we're going to do is place
this waterfall behind me

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.400
typically when you get ready to design your pond
I wanna make sure that you evaluate

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.350
where that waterfall is gonna go i want you to
see it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.750
from a lot of areas inside the home I want it
to have maximum impact on your life

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.109
i want you to see it from the kitchen if
possible

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.500
maybe the dining room I want the
audio to resonate into the home

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.970
when you're sleeping in the evening time, so

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.880
imagine that that's the area we're gonna
place at waterfall behind us and then

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.750
we'll put out the parameters of the pond
eight by eleven

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.549
now we want to be careful not to put in
the lines with a straight line across

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:01.470
the back

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.659
so i'm thinking this pond is gonna have this nice
curve coming out like this I wanna avoid

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.659
lines to match fence lines that gives it allot of interest and contour in the yard

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:17.189
Ok we're gonna set this waterfall

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.650
in the prime location we're gonna angle it
towards the house it doesn't have to be

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.040
directly towards the window

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.519
we want to give it an angle may be a
window here at the sliding glass door

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.510
there so you can multiple attractions

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.409
i want to set off this fence wanna be
real careful in the fact that

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.069
we don't throw dirt on the fence

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.529
because it'll start to... make the fence
deteriorate and breakdown

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.969
so were probably gonna put a small
retaining wall back here

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:48.760
and we set this of just enough
waterfall placements real critical

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.469
once you get the waterfall placed
we're gonna grab a garden hose

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:54.980
and we're gonna lay out an interesting shape

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.950
and then you can kinda reflect on that a
little bit will spray painted

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.279
and you can see how it's gonna look
before you start digging

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:07.499
okay so i don't want this line of this
side of the pond to be right at the edge of

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.090
the waterfall I wanna have it come pass a
little bit

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.599
so this will be one of the

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:19.599
the parameters of my shape and what
i'll do is I mark out my eleven foot run

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.089
there's eleven feet

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:29.789
and then I establish

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:32.379
this side of the pond

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.930
where

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.369
will probably have this be part of the
line and then what i'll do is

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:41.419
I'll mark this side

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:48.419
of the pond as well

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:51.909
 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.749
ok for starters what i've done is that

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:56.519
put a little bit of paint on the ground
these locations

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.979
what I have is eight-foot by eleven foot

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.019
and i can see pretty much the rectangle
that's their and now what i'll do is I

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.319
grab a garden hose and will create an
interesting shape inside this um...

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:14.319
parameter

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:31.269
its a nice interesting shape of the big
opening for the waterfall to spill into

00:04:31.269 --> 00:04:34.680
and then will put the skimmer on the
opposite side of that

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.509
the skimmer is going to be located

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.860
on the opposite side of the waterfall

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.210
and then we can pull these curves around

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.060
together just the way we want to

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.670
to make for an interesting shape

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.830
inside the parameters there

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.100
now once the hose is set in place

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.060
i would advise you the stand back in a
destination area

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.199
evaluate that you're really gonna fall
in love with that shape

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.010
then we're gonna spray paint that line

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.830
and then we would begin excavation

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.099
so we're gonna place the skimmer at the opposite
end of the waterfall on this pond

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.490
I want you to do that after you've

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.509
really fell in love with the shape

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:16.830
once you know you love the shape

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.770
we set the skimmer in place

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.909
we're gonna spray paint this out

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.790
and before we do excavation

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.840
we're gonna plum that waterfall filter

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.920
so that we we take this dirt

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.000
everyone thinks they started with the excavation
first but its really important we're

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.590
gonna

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:31.979
set that waterfall

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:36.070
put all the plumbing in it and as we dig
we can be burying the plumbing

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.039
and burying the waterfall filter

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:45.039
as we do it its go save you a lot of time and
lot of money

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:59.970
so at one of the big box stores Home Depot or Lows

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.719
you can get this mark down paint and you
can walk around the edge of the pond

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.969
you can mark it down so it's designed to
spray paint it out

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.090
you know the Krylon stuff you use for
other kind of art

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.009
is not quite as good as this so

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:20.009
you wanna mark this out extremely well so
we know where to dig

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.160
and now we can start to plumb that waterfall
filter

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.000
 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.830
