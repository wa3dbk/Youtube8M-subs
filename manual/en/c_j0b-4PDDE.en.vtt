00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.200
There are three really good reasons to
use a drip irrigation system in your garden.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.129
It will save you time, water and money. Using a drip irrigation system

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.340
is far more efficient than using a hose
pipe or a sprinkler system

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.500
because it delivers water right to the
base of the plant which is precisely where it's needed

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.700
And if you hook it up to an automated
timer you won't even need to be in your garden

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.800
to turn it on and off.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.560
You can install
drip irrigation at ground level

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.210
throughout newly planted borders and
vegetable patches

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.800
or you can attach it to a fence and run
it among your containers and hanging baskets.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.050
Installing a drip system is fairly
straightforward and you won't need any

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.660
specialist tools or knowledge

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.180
but it's worth familiarising yourself
with the pieces before you start.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.000
Here are the components of your system.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.079
When you choose a location for your system

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.640
check to see that you have enough of the large supply hose to run back to the tap.

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.640
In order to maintain sufficient pressure
within the system

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.100
it's best to make sure that this doesn't
run for more than 50 metres.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.290
Begin by attaching the computer control
unit to the tap

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.820
and then add the pressure regulator. If
you don't have a computer control unit

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.850
then just attach the pressure regulator
straight to the tap.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.900
The main supply pipe then connects to
the pressure regulator.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.780
You may find it helpful to soften the
supply pipe

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.000
in hot water for a few minutes before
attaching it.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.240
Now you can begin to create your network of water pipes.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.329
First of all, lay out the large supply pipe.
Don't try to bend the tube as this will

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.000
restrict the water flow.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you need to go around a corner
then use strong scissors or secateurs to cut the pipe

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.000
and add an elbow connector.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you want to add another piece of supply tube at a 90 degree angle then you can use a T-bar connector.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.920
Most importantly

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.750
once you've created your pipe network
make sure that you seal off the end of the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.000
supply pipe to prevent water pouring out of the system.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.899
Simply take one of the end
pieces, put it onto the end of the pipe

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.000
before folding the pipe over to secure it into place.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.750
Next you can start to add the
micro tubing which will direct water

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.160
from the supply pipe to the individual containers.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
Cut each piece to the required length.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.310
Punch a hole in the supply pipe

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.500
then screw a tube adapter into the hole.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.900
Use the bottom of the red hole punch to help you with this.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.940
It's important to make sure that tube
adaptors are inserted into the supply pipe

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.800
at a 90 degree angle to prevent the
system from leaking.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.879
If you make a mistake then fill unwanted
holes with blanking plugs.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:53.879
Next, attach a micro tube to each tube
adapter.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.950
Next you need to attach the drippers to
the end of the micro tubing.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.300
Of course if you're running a system
through a border along the ground then you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.270
may decide you don't need the
micro tubing

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.900
in which case attach the drippers
directly into the supply pipe.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.010
Finally you can secure the main pipe in
place.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.880
If you're laying it on the ground in a
border then use the large stakes.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.500
If you want to attach it to a wall use
the white wall clips provided.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.400
You can hold the
micro tubing in place with the smaller stakes.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.000
So now your system is ready to go.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.500
Program your timer and then turn on the tap to check that everything's running properly.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.650
The dripper nozzles are like mini sprinklers

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.000
but you can adjust the flow rate by
turning them.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.830
Now once your system is setup you'll need to give it a try a few times to get an idea of how long to run it for

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.000
and this will all depend on the type of 
plants you're growing, the size of your containers

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.090
and even what the weather's like. But you'll soon get a feel for it.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.900
So while your neighbours are frantically
running around their garden with the watering can

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.380
all you need to do is turn on a tap, sit
back and relax.
