Welcome to Cocina Identidad.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.220
Today we are preparing something that for me is very important. 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.340
When one speaks about cuisines, 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.220
one always speaks at a very high level 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.400
like when we refer to "salseo" 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.320
or preparing a sauce. 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.160
Today we are going to make a molcajete sauce. 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.840
In the Mexican cuisine, there are two categories for sauces, 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.200
the one that is put at the table that is usually very hot and the sauce for dishes...

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.540
like the different types of mole, clemole and pipian.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.400
So we need to think of a wide variety of sauces, 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.880
but we are going to prepare a sauce in molcajete ideal with grilled meat,

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.820
pork skin, some tortillas or a sope. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.800
It is a very hot sauce but with an extraordinary flavor. 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.960
We are going to roast the hot peppers,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.340
serrano Green peppers, 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.180
we are going to roast them in a griddle...

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.480
We are going to roast a garlic clove 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.460
and some onion.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.700
In the molcajete we are going to grind 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.880
some allspice 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.140
or pepper from Tabasco,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.580
we are grinding all

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.140
and we add a pinch of sea salt 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.800
and we grind this first.  

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.120
Once the hot pepper, the garlic and the onion are well roasted, 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.320
we are going to grind each ingredient separately in the molcajete, 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.700
so they are well integrated

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.800
and the salt and pepper are dissolved into it... 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.840
It is very enjoyable preparing this sauce

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.560
because we are feeling all the different perfumes 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.620
and how they are being integrated into the molcajete. 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.660
And yes, it is a sauce that only contains hot pepper... 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.320
Once we have grinded the hot pepper,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.200
we add lemon juice... 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.400
One by one, we are integrating them,

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.000
the necessary quantity... 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.740
I have always preferred to squeeze the lime with my hands because I enjoy it. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.540
In this way, we have an exquisite sauce

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.960
that you can enjoy and share... 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.040
Enjoy Cocina Identidad.
