00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.061
Hey guys, what's up, it's Mike.

00:00:01.061 --> 00:00:02.644
So the other day my
girlfriend decided

00:00:02.644 --> 00:00:04.750
to get a little bit
creative, and she said to me,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.291
you know what, I'm
actually surprised

00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:07.707
that you don't
already have a pet.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.335
I said, OK, I'll bite.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:11.501
What pet would you already
assume that I would have?

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:14.084
And she said, well I don't know,
with the hair and the goatee,

00:00:14.084 --> 00:00:16.443
and all the tattoos, I
would think maybe a snake,

00:00:16.443 --> 00:00:17.401
something like a snake.

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:19.771
Which is awesome to think
that my girlfriend sees me

00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:22.725
as Alice Cooper or Brittney
Spears in that slave video.

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:25.141
So I said, I don't know if
you've actually see my tattoos,

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:27.201
but it's pretty much just a
bunch of flowers and the house

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:27.851
I grew up in.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:29.351
Which is not really
intimidating,

00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:30.911
or threatening to
anyone whatsoever.

00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:32.491
I mean, I look like hotel art.

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:33.741
But that's not even the point.

00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.407
The fact of the matter
is, I would never

00:00:35.407 --> 00:00:39.341
get a snake, because a
snake is a wild animal.

00:00:53.311 --> 00:00:55.711
Over the course of a year,
at least 20,000 deaths

00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:57.781
occur worldwide from snakebites.

00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.061
I don't know how many
people die annually,

00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:02.561
but that sounds like
at least most of them.

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:03.946
And it's from snake bites.

00:01:03.946 --> 00:01:06.321
Now you just want to open our
door and let the snakes in.

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.367
Come on in snakes,
we have a couch,

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.741
and two more people
you can kill.

00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:11.541
Let's start talking
about some more well

00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:14.171
known dangerous aspects
of snakes, like venom.

00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:16.261
The venom of the
African black mamba

00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:18.071
has like a 50% mortality rate.

00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:20.823
And that's only the second most
venomous snake in the world.

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:22.906
Do you know what the first
most venomous snake is?

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:25.501
Neither do I, doesn't
matter, we're not getting it.

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:27.121
For each square
inch of his body,

00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:30.621
a boa constrictor can exert
up to 12 pounds of pressure.

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.791
Boa constrictors can
grow up to 13 feet

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.751
long and be well
over 100 pounds.

00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:36.461
So you combine the
last two things

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.101
that I said and do the math.

00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.731
It's scary.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:40.471
It's like getting
killed by fire hose.

00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:43.361
You know that deep sleep you get
into on the couch when you wrap

00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:45.361
yourself in a blanket, and
you've been watching Netflix

00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.291
all night, and you wake up, and
you have no idea where you are,

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:48.791
but you do know
that you're trapped?

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:52.012
Imagine that, but a snake, and
you never getting out of it,

00:01:52.012 --> 00:01:52.511
ever.

00:01:52.511 --> 00:01:53.811
I don't want to die like that.

00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:55.269
I hate when I fall
asleep in jeans.

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:57.971
It's basically a
noose that eats mice.

00:01:57.971 --> 00:01:58.911
They're just not good.

00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:01.643
Eventually she says, I've never
even said we should get one.

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:03.851
You just, kind of look like
a guy who would have one.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:05.991
And I'm like, it
doesn't even matter.

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.561
I didn't have much
going on today,

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:09.356
so I'm glad we had
this little talk.

00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:12.626
Plus, that's why we
can't get a snake.
