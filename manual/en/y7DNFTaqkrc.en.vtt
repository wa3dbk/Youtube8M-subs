DADDY CLAY Hey, welcome back to a very special
episode of The Lab. I'm Daddy Clay. Daddy

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:08.690
Brad is away on paternity leave. So, if your
wife is expecting, it's a good time for you

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.650
to start participating in the domestic chores.
And a great one that you can pick up is doing

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.470
a little bit of grocery shopping. But what
kind of healthy food items should you be picking

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.160
out for your expecting wife? We've come here
to Whole Foods in Austin to get a few ideas.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:36.030
DADDY CLAY So I'm here with Mary Olivar, who's
the healthy eating specialist here at Whole

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.460
Foods in Austin. And she's gonna give us some
tips on how to fill up a healthy grocery cart

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.450
for a pregnant mom.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.340
DADDY CLAY Okay Mary, what's the first thing
that's going in this cart?

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.170
MARY OLIVAR My personal favorite is kale.
The dark leafy greens are nutrient powerhouses.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.600
Not only do they have that super important
folic acid, but they also have calcium - easy

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.540
to absorb, non-dairy form, iron, fiber, vitamin
A, vitamin C, and lots of other super supportive

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.600
nutrients for mom and baby. Looks a little
daunting at first, but once you saute it,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.719
steam it, put it in soups, it's gonna be much
easier to eat and it's also delicious.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.959
DADDY CLAY Beautiful.
MARY OLIVAR I recommend it for everyday for

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:20.829
mom.
DADDY CLAY In it goes.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.310
DADDY CLAY Okay, what's going next into the
cart Mary?

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.959
MARY OLIVAR Salmon is one of my favorites.
Moms hear a lot about eating enough essential

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:34.859
fatty acids, particularly omega 3's and DHA,
all of which are found in salmon. Now, these

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:38.999
are the healthy fats that are essential for
baby's brain development and for the nervous

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.270
system.
DADDY CLAY Great. Good fats.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.120
MARY OLIVAR Good fats. And salmon is a good
fish to eat because it is considered to be

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.409
a low mercury fish, so it's safe for moms
to eat two times a week.

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.439
DADDY CLAY I've heard there are some concerns.
Are there some kind of fish that moms aren't

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:52.789
supposed to eat? They're supposed to avoid
sushi?

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:58.299
MARY OLIVAR Well, that and the higher mercury
fishes. The FDA recommends that moms do not

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.539
eat shark, king mackerel, tile fish, and marlin.
And swordfish when they're pregnant. Lower

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.409
mercury fishes are fine though but also no
sushi for moms. You want to decrease your

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:11.520
risk of food-borne illness.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:22.780
MARY OLIVAR I have to say, I saw your eyes
light up as we walked over here.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.459
DADDY CLAY Yeah, you know I was a little bit
nervous for the kale, you know. But now in

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.209
this section, I'm feeling a little more comfortable.
MARY OLIVAR Well it's all about balance. And

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.181
moms definitely have an increased need for
protein. Great place to get it is meat. And

00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:41.819
my favorite kind of meats for mom is the grass
fed. Grass fed beef and bison, or sometimes

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.909
we call it buffalo. Not only does grass fed
beef contain higher amounts of those great

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.300
essential fatty acids that we talked about
earlier, but it's also good sources of iron

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.390
and zinc, in addition to that great protein.
DADDY CLAY The color of it is just different.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.680
The color of the fats. The color of the meat.
It's local. It's grass fed. I can't wait to

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
taste it.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:18.659
MARY OLIVAR Studies have shown that certain
colors of beans actually have extremely high

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.560
levels of antioxidants. Again, for mom and
baby.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.450
DADDY CLAY Okay, alright. So what kind of
beans should we be looking at?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.420
MARY OLIVAR You can really play around. There's
a lot of variety. I like to soak them and

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.019
cook them myself. Feeling a little bit lazy,
canned beans are also an option. They're very

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:42.452
versatile. You can put them in all kinds of
dishes. If you're really lazy, you can eat

00:03:42.452 --> 00:03:43.452
them right out of the can.

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:44.452
DADDY CLAY So here were are at the amazing
cheese section of Whole Foods. Man, there's

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:46.938
gotta be like a billion and a half cheeses
right here. Aren't there some kind of cheeses

00:03:46.938 --> 00:03:48.939
though, that are not healthy for a pregnant
mom?

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:53.840
MARY OLIVAR Yes, pregnant moms are warned
to stay away from soft cheeses. And from cheeses

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.349
that are made from raw and unpasteurized milk
and aged for less than 60 days.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.450
DADDY CLAY But otherwise, cheese is a good
thing?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.340
MARY OLIVAR Cheese is a great thing. Because
moms are looking for the calcium, extra protein,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.170
and it's delicious.
DADDY CLAY I agree with that. So we should

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.560
probably load up here. So specifically the
kind of cheeses you want to avoid. Is that

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.830
like your brie?
MARY OLIVAR Brie, camembert, the sort of really

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.100
soft gushy cheeses. Just to reduce the risk
of food-borne illnesses.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.889
DADDY CLAY Yeah, I'm gonna really recommend
that you stay away from those because they're

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.600
gross.
MARY OLIVAR But any kind of cheese that is

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.271
firm to the touch is fine. So most of them
really.

00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:32.520
DADDY CLAY You know what, this has been an
amazing tour. This cart is just full of beautiful,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.900
healthy food items for a pregnant mom. I really
appreciate you giving us the tour around.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.440
Thank you very much Mary.
MARY OLIVAR It's my pleasure.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.300
DADDY CLAY We look forward to shopping here
again at Whole Foods in the future.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.300
MARY OLIVAR Thanks for coming.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.740
