00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.779
You are a writer.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.770
Whether you know it or not, whether you feel it or not,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.230
you are.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.340
It was encouraging that you don't have to be a professional writer to write well.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.210
The thing I like about her book so much is that

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.630
it can

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.300
ignite a passion.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.300
I wrote "Word Up!" to empower people to express the things they want to express in effective ways.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.030
Marcia has made grammar--the boring stuff that we learned in fourth grade--so enjoyable, so funny, and so pertinent to what we do today, that it was a pleasure reading the book.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.390
I think that if there's a little bit of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.880
humor in what you're learning, it sticks with you.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.950
It's a book that gives solid writing advice

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:25.950
in a witty,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.240
clever style.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060
It's a fun book to read

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.880
even if you're not a professional writer or you're not striving to be a professional writer.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.020
One thing that Marcia Johnston does in "Word Up!" is defining what is content strategy

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.869
because it means

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.810
so many things

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.810
to so many people. Not just defining it, but really laying out what your organization can achieve

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.200
by implementing an effective content strategy.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.250
I'm an instructor of English at Portland
State University. I teach an advanced

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.110
technical-editing course in the spring of each year.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.209
I'm really excited about using "Word Up!" as my textbook for the students.

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:30.929
If you teach writing, "Word Up!" is for you. If you are writing for business, "Word Up!" is for you. If you're writing for your friends,

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:34.199
"Word Up!" is for you.

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.209
If you're writing something that

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.260
needs to stand the test of time

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.869
for readers who haven't even been born yet,

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:49.189
"Word Up!" is for you. This is a book

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:56.189
for anyone who wants to use words powerfully to make a difference, to make a connection with someone on the receiving end of those words.

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:12.339
It's accessible, it's energetic, it's creative, it's thoughtful, it's filled with passion.

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:20.349
Reading "Word Up!" is like having the author, Marcia, there walking you through the book.

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.400
It's more than editing. It's the whole journey of discovery.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.899
There was more comedy to it. It was more relaxed.

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.499
It made you want to go to the next chapter.

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.409
Her tone is engaging,

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.180
I want to read her book,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.329
and I know there are sections that I'll go back to and refer to time and time again.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.839
It has techniques that will make your writing stand

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:40.439
several notches above your colleagues' and peers'.

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.049
You can write well. You can write
powerfully.

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.299
All you need is the knowledge.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.139
And this book--"Word Up!"--is full of the kind of
knowledge you need.
