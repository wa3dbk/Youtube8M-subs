00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.149
Today in our 2012 GMC Sierra well be installing
the Extang Express Soft Tonneau Cover part

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:09.860
number EX50650.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.160
To begin with, you want to go ahead and use
some solvent water to wash down the top of

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.190
the bed rails.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.930
Now that weve got all the dirt and debris
removed from the top of your bed rails well

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.640
make sure that its dry first.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.590
Then we are going to need to go ahead and
remove the paper backing from the form thats

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.370
underneath each of the driver and the passengers
side.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.320
There is two pieces of form on each side that
well need to pull the backing off of this.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.900
In this case its the white backing.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.410
Now, youll also notice that each of the side
rails are marked driver and passengers side

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.660
and we need to make sure that we put them
on the proper side.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.640
Next, well need to go ahead and center the
bed rail which means the front of the bed

00:00:42.640 --> 00:01:21.920
and the rear 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:03:11.479
of the bed.
