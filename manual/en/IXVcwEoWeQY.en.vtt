MALE SPEAKER 1:
(YELLING) Oh my god.

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:05.730
MALE SPEAKER 2: Do
you think you're

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.140
more beautiful than you say?

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.790
JACOB SOBOROFF: What do these
three videos have in common?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.400
They've been viewed and
shared over 120 million times

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.995
combined, and they're all ads.

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:14.870
Why do we share them?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.790
You might choose to share
an ad because you believed

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:18.060
in what it's selling,
and by sharing it,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.523
you're saying something
about yourself.

00:00:19.523 --> 00:00:20.773
DEBBIE: Hi, my name is Debbie.

00:00:20.773 --> 00:00:23.040
I'm an engineer from
Stanford, and I was always

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.760
bothered by how few women
there were in my program,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.570
so I've decided to do
something about it.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.520
I'm starting a toy
company called Goldieblox

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.550
to get a little girls to love
engineering as much as I do.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.940
JACOB SOBOROFF: It got more
than 1 and 1/2 million views.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.930
People support the
message, and they

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.790
want to make it clear that
they stand behind Debbie.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.414
Really, it's a form
of self-expression.

00:00:40.414 --> 00:00:42.850
Of course, that's
not always the case.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.530
This emotional Thai ad was one
of the most talked about videos

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.840
last year, but see
if you can guess

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.700
what it's actually selling.

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:00:57.204 --> 00:00:58.620
JACOB SOBOROFF:
Believe it or not,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.790
this thing is not selling an
unlimited supply of tissues.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.620
It's a commercial for
a cell phone provider.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.239
People shared it because
of the emotional hook

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.170
in the story--
which, by the way,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.290
was crowd-sourced from
different social media posts.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.831
Warning-- you're
going to want to hug

00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:10.529
your dad for the
duration of this video.

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:11.070
Oh, hey, dad.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.880
You might remember this
Bell's Whiskey commercial

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.796
from three months ago.

00:01:30.726 --> 00:01:31.760
I read your book.

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:35.390
JACOB SOBOROFF:
That short film's

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.710
another example of an
ad having almost nothing

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.209
to do with the
product, but that's

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.000
because they're not
really selling whiskey.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.430
Check out this
behind-the-scenes video

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.380

GAVIN KRENSKI: We don't
always talk enough

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.790
about the good stuff, and what
people do to make situations

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.160
better, to make them make
great, to make life better

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.200
for themselves and
their families.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.180
JACOB SOBOROFF:
Sometimes you get so

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.530
caught up in the
spectacle of a piece

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.100
that you don't even
realize it's a commercial.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.460
What you're seeing is
one of the earliest

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.730
examples of viral marketing.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.169
It was posted in 2008 to
an unassuming channel,

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:01.960
and quickly got picked
up by all the blogs.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.210
Lest you think this is a real
live version of "Office Space,"

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.620
it was actually created as a
promo for the movie "Wanted"

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.660
by the film's director.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.479
That ad was so
successful it triggered

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.710
an avalanche of pranks.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.320
Like this horrifying
devil baby stunt

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.320
that was made to promote
the movie "Devil's Due"

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.160
earlier this year.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.490
It has more than 44
million views to date.

[SCREAMS]

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:24.500
It's the shock factor that
makes videos like this hugely

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.876
successful, and it's changing
what we think an ad can be.

00:02:26.876 --> 00:02:29.541
In fact, the escalation of prank
ads are making plenty of people

00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:30.199
nervous.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.740
Some are even saying
that advertisers

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.650
might be taking things
a little bit too far.

JACOB SOBOROFF: Don't you worry.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.160
This is a parody posted by a
successful Toronto ad agency.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.410
Of course, it's
also an ad for them.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.120
Ad inception.

In the end, we share
ads for the same reason

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.230
that we're going to
share anything else--

we're celebrating the art.

what you guys think.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.070
Does it bother you to
share a commercial?

Let us know in the comments.

Then use the cup to
smash their heads.
