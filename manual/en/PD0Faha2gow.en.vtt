00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.610
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.870
Have you noticed this strange trend in TV commercial recently? 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.940
It's been bothering me for awhile but I haven't quite been able to put a name to it.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.550
It's this kinda twisted combination of cynicism and humour

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.250
with these over the top caricatures and it always ends up being racist and/or sexist.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.290
It's really the normalizations of sexism through the use of irony. 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.060
It's the 'they know that I know that they know that their being sexist'

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.630
Some terms people have used to describe this is ironic sexism or retro sexism.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.530
Retro Sexism is modern attitudes and behaviors that mimic or glorify sexist aspects

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.840
of the past, often in an ironic way.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.700
Let's see an example from Carl's Jr.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.080
I know it's over the top and ridiculous to see women marching in American flags to

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.490
Liberty, Cheeseburgers and the American Dream, and they know that they are

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.820
over the top and ridiculous and objectifying women but because we all know

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.700
doesn't mean that it's not sexist.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.660
Take for example this new marketing campaign by Mike's Hard Lemonade,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.400
where they are attempting to rebrand their product as a more 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.860
"manly" drink and a less "girly" drink.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.250
"Can you believe some guys have never tried Mike's Hard Lemonade because

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.940
they've seen women drink it?"

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.710
"We don't have those kinds of issues"

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.250
"Thank you"

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.280
"No we don't"

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.750
"Mike's is a refreshing change of pace to beer but you should enjoy it responsibly"

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.050
"For example, do you have a designated driver? I could take you home"

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.480
"Or I could"

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.450
"Or I could take you both home... Lots of options"

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.960
See how he's not even pretending to fool us? Like we're all in on this big joke,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.260
look how funny it is that he's incompetently and obviously trying to take advantage

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.600
of these women.  We're all supposed to know that he's acting like a scum bag

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.670
and ha ha isn't it funny.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.770
Really, they know that I know that they know that their being sexist.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.040
Or what about the good old wandering eyed lying husband and naive wife tropes?

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.910
"Do you have the extra pacifier?" "Yes"

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.280
"Do we have enough formula?" "Yes"

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.960
"Okay here ya go honey... honey... honey"

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.420
"What are you looking at?"

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.560
"Need a moment, try the chocolate caramel and fresh cookie crunch of Twix."

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.130
"I'm looking at potential babysitters so we could spend more time together"

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.880
"Aw that's so sweet"

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.730
"When you need a moment, chew it over with Twix"

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.570
See how obviously and transparently he's lying to his wife.  We all recognize that this is

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.310
ridiculous.  This guy is clearly being a jerk and we get to laugh at that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.280
but we have the added bonus of being able to laugh at his naive wife who is clearly

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.620
not seeing his transparent behaviour.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.190
Additionally, the advertisers get to use pseudo porn stars in a male fantasy 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.420
sequence so the audience gets to join the man in oogling the women.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.090
And for another example of the naive girlfriend.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.830
"Who could that be?"

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:55.300
"Oh wow, I'm there for you buddy.  That was Brad. He really wants to... vent."

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.240
"You should go." 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.670
"Ready to vent?" "Let's vent" "Let's vent!" "Let's vent!!"

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.450
"Introducing the vented widemouth can from Coor's Light.  

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.580
It let's in air for a smooth refreshing pour."

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.550
"Is he okay?" "I think we'll be venting a little longer."

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.320
So you see they know that I know that they know.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.290
Women are supposed to laugh at how stupid this girlfriend is while being secure in the

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.460
knowledge that they'll never make the same mistake. This commercial is set up so that

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.670
women are laughing at caricatured sexist representations of other women.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.540
Ariel Levy describes in her fantastic book "Female Chauvinist Pigs" how women are  

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.980
being trained to be just as raunchy and objectify women just like "one of the guys".

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.110
We're coerced into doing this instead of aligning ourselves with one another.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.150
One of the reasons might be to impress men and I'm gonna guess that 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.050
pointing out sexism isn't exactly popular with the guys.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.860
This next one not only manages to be sexist but also racist at the same time.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.950
Is there a CLIO award for that?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.840
“When a guy can’t get his wanine to put some hallakahiki all over his morabo

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.250
 then he’s gotta go some place else.”

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.520
Not only is this exotifying and sexualizing Hawaiian culture but she's literally a thing.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.970
This brings a whole new meaning to objectifying.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.190
Carl's Jr. is infamous for uber ironic sexism in their commercials. Remember this one?

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.200
“...in the winter when it drizzles, I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles.”

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.370
Yet somehow women aren't up in arms, they aren't organizing protests

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.910
 and boycotts and online campaigns.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.860
Some people might try to defend these ads by saying they are "making fun of sexism"

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.050
ironically... somehow...

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.320
Advertisers must believe that the use of irony distances themselves from 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.020
male chauvinism but that isn't the case.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.280
While we think we are in on the joke, the reality is they aren't making fun of

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.930
or pointing out sexism, they're DOING it.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.310
Remember advertisers have one goal and one goal only and that's to sell you a product.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.270
Everything else, all the jokes and humour and imagery and everything else

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.740
is to get you to buy it.  The easiest way to do this is to use sexist representations

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.640
that replicate the status quo and doesn't challenge anything.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.770
Marketers love the uber ironic sexist style of advertising because they can use all the

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.180
racist, sexist, misogynist imagery they want and simultaneously distance

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.220
themselves from it with a little wink and a nod.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.120
So how many examples of retro sexism have you already seen today?

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.870
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?
