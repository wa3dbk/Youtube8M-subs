00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.960
Global warming, declining oil resources
and environmental damage.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.640
To show how far Volvo Trucks
has come tackling these threats-

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.480
-journalists from all over the world
have been invited to Gothenburg-

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.560
-to learn about three of the company's-

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.960
-most environmentally
optimized drivelines.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.840
The routes we are using
have been specifically picked.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.320
We have two separate routes that reflect
exactly what our customers would use-

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.000
-in a real world situation.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.040
Our journalists
will be able to test drive the trucks-

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.400
-for performance, for driveability.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.880
And they'll get the full benefit
of this new technology.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.760
With the new Volvo FM MethaneDiesel-

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.960
-regional distribution with gas trucks
is possible for the first time-

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.200
-due to the use of the diesel process
and liquefied gas.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.880
This generates a longer operating range-

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.560
-and the possibility
to use heavier vehicles-

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.040
-compared to traditional gas trucks.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.920
With liquefied biogas in its tanks-

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.960
-carbon emissions can be reduced
by as much as 70 percent-

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.880
-compared with a standard diesel engine.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.400
Using natural gas,
emissions are cut by 10 percent.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.880
When I go here around 80-85-

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.160
-and we have full load, nearly 40 tons.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.520
Up to now I don't see any difference
to a normal diesel engine.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
The Volvo FE Hybrid
is a heavy-duty hybrid truck-

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.160
-designed for distribution and
refuse transport in city environments.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.080
The energy is generated by
a diesel engine and an electric motor.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.760
The battery is charged by energy
generated when the truck brakes.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.160
Yes, it was surprising for me how long
you can drive with electric power-

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.320
-about two kilometres or something,
without noise...

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.040
For city transportation
it's the future, I think.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.120
This cuts fuel consumption
and carbon emissions-

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.920
-by between 15 and 20 percent.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.160
In refuse management,
this figure is 30 percent-

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.120
-if an electric compactor
is connected to the truck.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.120
The biggest benefit will be,
I'm sure, fuel consumption.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.760
But good comfort,
I think, is also included.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.840
Big challenges
for trucks running on alternative fuels-

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.400
-is to make sure that there are
alternative fuels available.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.440
We need to demonstrate
that we have the vehicles.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.760
Now we need to work
together with the fuel suppliers-

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.560
-to bring the fuels to the market.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.280
BIO-DME is one of the alternative fuels-

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.920
-Volvo Trucks regards
as most promising for the future.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It reduces carbon emissions
by 95 percent compared to diesel.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.680
This fuel can be produced
from any biomass product.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.760
For instance black liquor
from the pulp industry.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.960
At the present time, field tests
involving modified Volvo FH trucks-

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.520
-running on BIO-DME are being
conducted in Sweden with 10 vehicles.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.560
However, it will take some time
before it appears on the market.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.000
I think the DME truck is great-

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.200
-because it gives you the comfort
of a couch, the sound level is low-

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.000
-the driving experience was great,
you have good driveability-

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.960
-the power is the same as a diesel
truck, so it was amazing, really great.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.800
It's important
for the transports in the world-

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.360
-to work
with alternative energy sources-

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.120
-to work with solutions that reduce
our impact on the climate.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.600
It is a vital issue for the survival
of the transport industry.
