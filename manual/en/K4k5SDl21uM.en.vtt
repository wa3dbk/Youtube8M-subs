00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.730
thanksgiving is a time %uh traditions
not generally political traditions but

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.379
there are few and one of the big ones
that no president can miss out on

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.980
is the pardoning above the turkey
President Obama did that today

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
on behalf of the Obama family I want to
wish everybody a very Happy Thanksgiving

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.690
tomorrow as we gather with our own
friends and family will count ourselves

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.850
lucky that there's

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.960
more be thankful for the weekend ever
say

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.910
and more be hopeful for the weekend ever
met and now before these turkeys get

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:27.420
away

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.189
with the power vested in me I want to
grant

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.770
popcorn a full recovery I'll

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.770
come on ball

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.010
well

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.010
a that's a lovely little family event
that they had their pardoning

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.470
actually two turkeys caramel and popcorn
very cute names and it's kinda weird

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.509
to name an animal that has been bred to
not end up as food after food that's a

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:09.229
little bit odd

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.310
but two turkeys pardoned that makes 10

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.810
turkeys for Obama that have been
pardoned during his first and second

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.330
terms

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.920
we'll get back to those numbers a little
later on but we do want to give you a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.259
little bit information about the
tradition

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.409
it started in the late at the Lee
eighties actually

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.530
other the research that I did came up
with that apparently reagan started it

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.380
inadvertently

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.009
by making a joke about pardoning the
turkey is now at his at that point in

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:34.990
his second term

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.530
pardons were a pretty serious topic
consider iran contra

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.799
he decided to make light of it by
talking about pardoning a turkey and out

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.740
later on in eighty nine george HW Bush
pardoned to the first one and it has

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.209
happened

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.110
every year since then now these turkeys
as a letter to earlier are raised from

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.569
birth

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.610
specifically for the purpose being
pardoned later on and actually the way

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.740
that their breads in San up bread for
food

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.509
the bread for like the presentation on
camera they apparently are in horrible

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.109
health and they very rarely live longer
than a year after being pardoned

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:08.109
but during that time over the past 20
years they've been sent to different

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:09.479
places sometimes farms

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.489
up but there's appeared about 10 years
where they would actually lead

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.900
Disneyland Disneyworld Thanksgiving I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.230
parades which is pretty fun and but

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.930
sometimes this tradition can go wrong
not at the presidential level but

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.910
since it became a big thing for the US
some governors have done it well

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.440
done as well you might remember Sarah
Palin doing and it became

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.320
got a little bit weird actually so let's
roll that therefore I Sarah Palin

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.109
governor last anticipating and hoping
that in the spirit of Thanksgiving

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.019
alaskans everywhere will find adequate
nourishment elsewhere and without this

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.420
particular turkey

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.730
I do hereby grant Thanksgiving a call

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.900
amnesty and pardon and it is so ordered

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.030
and we will pick one in the big Thomas

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.069
CEO pardon UK so

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.150
nothing wrong with that so far but you
wanna talk to the camera

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.250
afterward in a change locations a little
bit let's take a look

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.430
there so many good americans who are
just Desiree number and their government

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.500
to come together the way to allow them
to grow in progress in all our

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.340
businesses to grow and progress a great
appreciation for

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.260
those who share that value and it was a
blast every day was just a blast up

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.980
there on the trail

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.700
any other 122 behind my should not using
program coming up

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.129
you know thankfully word in a good
position still fiscally speaking with

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.640
we're in a good position but

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.689
it in made no sense at a hundred and
forty dollars

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.530
a barrel of oil that get some lawmakers
wanted to spend spend spend we're

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.920
warning them and the administration was
that we had to prepare for the day

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.269
that the price of oil would plummet
which of course that has done so

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.280
we had prepared then and reigned in the
growth in government then and we will

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.739
%uh

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.439
at now way it that comes into play at
this point

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:54.290
where and the savings that we had set
aside forward funnnnn anticipating a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.510
drop in oil

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.349
accounting for that all that comes into
play now at fifty dollars a barrel of

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.030
oil

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.110
what's most important to you doll

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:08.849
for me day I was there a happy to get to
be invited to participate in this event

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.680
so I'm political obviously that it's
nice to get out and

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.409
and and do something to promote a local
business and and 2i just participate in

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.680
something that isn't so

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.860
heavy-handed politics that day it
invites criticism

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.330
certainly will prolly my criticism for
even doing this to you but at least this

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.099
was fun

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:31.219
I think that that video is interesting
in that it really points out sort of the

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.140
the inconsistency or hypocrisy I love
the tradition itself that

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.469
she goes inside and pardons one turkey
that for all we know ended up getting

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:39.169
killed anyway

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.060
while as she's doing that they're just
jamming turkeys into the machine to be

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.270
slaughtered in the guys like

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.940
turning like smiling for the camera
because no matter what your job is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.550
everybody wants to be famous for a few
minutes and so he did that while choking

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.229
a turkey

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.080
but in terms Obama in the current like
tradition of pardoning a turkey

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.830
I think that it's its cue I understand
why they do it can seem to like it they

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.760
like the idea that the turkeys I'm going
live on a farm for the rest with life

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.690
but it is it's a very hot holiday both
because one it's sorta makes a mockery

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.210
out turkeys and other animals that are
used for food it's not like

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.169
the pardons the turkey and then they go
on to have a very Merry vegan dinner for

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.760
Thanksgiving know they eat other animals

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.750
it so it seems weird to it like choose
one it feels like The Hunger Games to me

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:23.539
or like

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:27.229
you're sacrificing about humans which is
one is an example love your mercy or

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.849
something so that seems weird to me

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.479
but also more importantly more
politically it makes a mockery of

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:33.500
pardoning

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.659
that was the whole point early on as
they said that while Reagan was doing

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:39.810
and now like yeah Obama's pardoning
turkey is and as the

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.800
having a post went up spartan 10 turkeys
is only pardoned 11 drug users

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.180
there certainly other things he could be
using pardoning power Ford I think we

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.849
have a better

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.659
affect on the country all the people who
are brought in for using different types

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:53.959
of illegal drugs

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:57.740
and maybe Edwards node Bradley Manning
perhaps I'm sure you could come up with

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.750
a lot of different people who could be
pardoned

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.320
that Marissa Alexander she's appealing
her decision when in the self defense

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.409
then around case

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:08.490
maybe you could partner since you didn't
hurt anybody and she's gonna the jail

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.950
for over 20 years

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.219
so I don't wanna be a Debbie Downer I
don't wanna be both Killington I

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:16.419
understand just supposed to be cute it's
something we do in this country

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.190
but understand that politics does not
and while the cameras are rolling on the

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.899
pardoning the turkeys they remain

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:24.589
and I think that casts a pretty
interesting light on the use the

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:25.289
presidential pardon
