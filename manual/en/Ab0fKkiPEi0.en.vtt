So, in this segment this is Dominic the guy
with expertvillage.com and in this segment

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.900
I’m actually going to install a picture
and here’s the back of the picture of course.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.910
You have your measure from the point of the
string here because this is actually what

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.940
will be holding up so it’s about 4 inches
basically from the top of the frame. I know

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:36.260
that I want my picture to be well I would
like the frame to be may be about 6 inches

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:45.250
from the ceiling here and I know that the
string is about 4 inches down, so I know that

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:54.700
my bracket my anchor has to be about 10 inches
there. So this is pretty much where my picture

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:03.010
is going to be, so just the common way, the
picture weighs about 15 lbs. so I’m going

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.700
to use a 30 lb. anchor in here. I was going
to use a 50 lb. one but I didn’t realize

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.750
that was a lot heavier. So here we’re just
going to push this into the wall just like

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:27.220
I did on the shelf brackets, self screwing,
screws itself in, snug fit, put my screw in

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:39.420
there,
leave about half an inch before it goes in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:49.869
all the way. Take my movie picture actually
it’s my gangster… I’m a gangster movie

00:01:49.869 --> 00:02:10.750
buff and I hang my string on the screw and
kind of put it up there

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.940
and we go… it’s leveled that’s it. So
those wall anchors and screw anchors work

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.040
just as well for shelves. They also work to
make sure that your picture stay up and they

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.010
don’t fall out. That’s it guys that’s
it… I mean this is pretty good and it’s

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.560
very simple. I know it looks hard when you
see it but hopefully I made it seem simple

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.450
enough for you. If I can do it you can do
it and that’s me and I’m Dominic on expertvillage.com.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.360
Take care and have a great day.
