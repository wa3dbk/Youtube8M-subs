00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.710
So today I'm taking you inside my Korean apartment.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.020
Don't look at the code.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.660
I hope you're not looking.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.660
Hahahaha.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.890
I live in a very small studio.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.660
It's just a one bedroom apartment.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.839
What you got in your hands?

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.210
Well, this weekend happens to be Chuseok,
which is kind of like

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.820
Thanksgiving and this is the lovely gift set
that I got from work.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.400
Tuna and spam.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400
Ooooh!

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.400
Oooh lala.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.829
Those are selling for 50 dollars at the store.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.191
Yes, this is very expensive.

00:00:34.191 --> 00:00:35.780
You better appreciate your spam.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.780
You better.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.780
It's a year's supply.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:38.840
Playing guitar sounds

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:48.190
I am a very talented musician and I dream
of one day playing with you to.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:59.530
Because they like people who can playing the
Ukelele.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.530
They do.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.530
Music playing.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.530
hahaha

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.530
strum it.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.530
strum it.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.530
The fridge.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.570
And what is that?

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.800
This delicacy came all the way from Argentina.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.710
Dulce de
Leche.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.710
Mmmmm.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.710
As the Koreans say 'Mashikeda"

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.460
In Spanish it is deliciouso.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.120
Deliciouso!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.650
This is my small little kitchen and I cook
so often that I paid 3000 thousand Won which

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.860
is about 3 dollars for 6 months of gas usage.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.340
Korean toilets are very scary things.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.350
As you can see there is lots of buttons with
different options to wash your bum clean and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.600
who knows what else.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.240
oooh, the seats are also heated so in the
winter time that's pretty sweet.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.960
And this is my small little bathroom.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.610
Basically whenever you take a shower everything
gets wet.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.880
This is all there is to it.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.800
This is the view from my apartment.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.860
Not too shabby.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.620
You can see lots of apartment buildings, restaurants,
bars, and the mountains off in the distance.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.350
So this is my bed with my lovely Bolivian
bed cover.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.800
And if you look this way I have a nice shelving
unit where I can keep my clothes.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.420
Little television.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.210
We just store things here.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.370
Girly!

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.650
In this little area right in front of the
door this is where you take your shoes off

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.780
because it is very bad manners to walk inside
a Korean home with your shoes on.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.460
They don't
like it.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.040
That's going to be in the bloopers.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.040
Noooo!

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.040
Yeah!

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.040
Are you recording already.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.040
Yeah.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040
Jeez.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040
I'm going to show you my apartment today.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.480
Let's go take a look - over there.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.800
The views from outside of my apartment - rice
fields aplenty.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.090
Don't look at the code.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:21.310
Don't look at the code!

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.840
In we go.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.970
And before I show you anything check out my
awesome socks.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.490
They're stripey.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.290
Candy cane for Christmas.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.800
Welcome to my bedoire.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:53.349
It is just a bed, a couch, a bookshelf (which
has no books on it) and a little makeshift

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.040
wardrobe and my dresser.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.880
Also, a tv I never use.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.250
I mean look at all of this empty space.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.550
We've got to use it for something right?

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.980
Dance party!

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.410
Oh yeah!

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.410
Or maybe not.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.710
We'll have to think of a better use for it.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.990
And this here is my tiny little Korean kitchen.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.490
I'm going to show you what is going on here.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:35.110
I've got this small sink, which is basically
just washing the dishes here and drying them

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.629
up on this rack.

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.479
I've got different Korean glasses.

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.330
This is a Korean beer company Cass.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.770
In Korean beer it is called Makju.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.360
I've got my Makju glasses.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.750
Who could be in Korea without having metal
chopsticks.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.259
I can even use them.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.259
Look at this.

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.050
Good for you - you should be able to after
four years here.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.050
I should.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.669
I should.

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.210
Agreed.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:10.289
Let's see if I can pick up something here
- this little butter knife.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:11.289
Excellent demonstration.

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.860
And you of course would do that in real life
picking up butter knives with chopsticks.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:21.319
Okay, so the other interesting thing about
a Korean kitchen is that unlike western kitchens

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.639
you don't have an oven.

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.680
You can see here that we just have a heating
elements.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.300
There is two actually and there is a frying
pan which I never use because I don't cook.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.529
Being a well paid teacher in Korea, of course
I have a plentiful supply of food, as you

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.259
can see - or not.

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:47.580
There is just condiments and water and juice
and more condiments and bread.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:56.740
It is a very - you can tell I don't eat here
very often.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.009
Bathroom time!

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.219
Come on in.

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:06.520
One thing interesting about a Korean apartment
is that it is considered to be a wet bathroom

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:11.919
and a wet shower, so you put on your flip
flops.

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:17.580
You can see I can just flip flop right into
them all nice and dandy.

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.309
Well done.

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:24.120
If you look here this is the shower area - the
wet shower area.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:33.969
I've got my manly products and over here there
is a little humble bathroom.

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.430
Something looks different about this place.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:36.550
Yeah, there is something kind of wrong.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.240
Maybe, could it be that it is clean for once.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.270
For once!

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.400
Don't expect that to happen again.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.500
Here is my spare room.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:46.500
Come on in.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.649
These are the two suitcases I brought in to
Korea from me from Canada.

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:57.089
I've got my old camera bag, which I'm not
even using anymore.

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:59.749
It is empty - just air.

00:06:59.749 --> 00:07:06.020
Here is my tripod, which I haven't been using
nearly enough this year.

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.509
My new prize possession - my awesome orange
little camera bag.

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:16.310
Here is where I put my camera right in here.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.749
It opens up.

00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:20.119
So tell us what do you use this room for?

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:24.119
I use it for studying - uh, nothing.

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:29.039
Final part of my apartment - the balcony.

00:07:29.039 --> 00:07:38.009
On the balcony we have of course the washer
and that is it.

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:39.979
Look at the gorgeous views.

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:44.249
Look, of a parking lot!

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:46.330
Yeah.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.419
Not.

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:49.979
You can flirt with the camera.

00:07:49.979 --> 00:07:52.300
That doesn't look like flirting.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.599
That looks creepy.
