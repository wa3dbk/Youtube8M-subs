00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.800
The world of Remnant is a dangerous place...

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.680
...particularly for man.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.240
In the countless years that humanity has roamed the planet, civilizations have grown and fallen.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.620
But four have withstood the test of time: Atlas, Mistral, Vacuo, Vale.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.620
These four kingdoms, with the help of natural barriers and human tenacity...

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.760
...have proven that they have the will to survive.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.920
Each kingdom has a governing council to represent the people and their needs.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.960
Next comes the military. While most kingdoms only call on its citizens to serve when needed...

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.820
...others find it important to be...prepared.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.280
There are still those who choose to venture outside the walls of the kingdoms.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.120
Roaming nomads and small villages are not uncommon.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.720
Yet neither is their tendency to...disappear...overnight.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.380
Lastly, the Huntsman academies. These institutions' sole purpose...

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.920
...is to train the next generation of Huntsmen: the next generation of defenders that will live and die...

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.020
...to protect the lifestyle that they've become so accustomed to.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.700
Yes...the world of Remnant is indeed a dangerous place.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.880
But, the four kingdoms stand as beacons of hope...as safe havens from the darkness that surrounds them.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.200
They are the key to mankind's survival...as long as they stand united.
