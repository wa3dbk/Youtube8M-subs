00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.690
let we now have scientific proof

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.200
that

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.019
the wealthy

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.249
harm or lake likely to lie

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.259
maybe not steal

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:18.890
but line she

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.449
this according to a and new

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.689
research

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.789
study by a p_h_d_ candidate in
psychology at the university of

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.029
california

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.029
they did a a couple of studies according
to well bloomberg news

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.680
uh... how the upper class

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.180
tended to behave in certain
circumstances

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.930
in one test

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.830
a candy test

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.120
a hundred and twenty nine undergraduates

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.300
were manipulated to view themselves as
either wealthy or poor

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.329
then they were uh... presented

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.900
with a jar of individually wrapped

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.150
candy

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.650
now how one i just say at this point

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.480
it's actually not wrong

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.580
to take

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.660
candy from babies

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.460
because babies should not be eating
candy

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.890
you don't have t the lot of times

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.300
small pieces of candy they can choke on

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.570
that's actually a good

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.049
how true with stick

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.909
if not also

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.940
self benefiting

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.310
ag s initiative

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.130
so they were presented with the jar of
individually wrapped candy which

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.240
researchers said would go to children in
a nearby lab valo

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.670
they could take some if they want

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.549
and the children would just get

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.320
less

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.920
the undergraduates believing themselves
to be upper-income took more than those

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.530
believing themselves to be low income

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.880
the study found

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.419
and it wasn't just a uh... candy
experiment

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.819
and i say the upper class

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.609
as defined by the study

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.010
we're more likely to break the law while
driving

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.049
uh... more likely to take candy from
children

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.510
they were more likely to lie in
negotiations

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.299
cheap to raise their arts to winning a
prize

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.089
and endorse unethical behavior or

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.759
the uh... researchers say uh... it's
important to teach ah...

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:39.129
people have it

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.899
it's not that the rich are innately bad
of but as you rise in the ranks i'd

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:46.569
guess of

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.769
whether as a person or a nonhuman
primate

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.559
you become more self focus

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.379
so uh... the wealthy should feel
comforted that um...

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.549
they share these attributes with their
ape cousins as well

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.549
now previous research has shown that
students in economic classes are more

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.329
likely

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.149
to describe

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.099
greed has a good thing

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.089
and so uh... there is a

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:20.769
sense that this is not only sell
selective in some respects

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.099
but also

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:24.309
the welfare you become

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:26.999
the more insulated and

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:31.439
essentially inward-looking you become

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:36.469
one experimented vided a hundred ninety
five adults

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.309
recruited using uh... craiglist

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:44.339
to play a game in which a computer
rolled dice for a chance to win a fifty

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:47.739
dollar gift certificate

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.439
the numbers each participant rolled were
the same so the game is wrecked

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:00.019
and anyone self reporting a total higher
than twelve was lying about their score

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.849
those in the wealthier groups were found

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.649
to be more likely to lie about their
score

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:14.689
the fear you that uh... one of the
theories that this researcher has that

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.319
does that he and uh...

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:20.029
who are less wealthy

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:25.530
tend to cheat last because they're more
reliant on their community to get by

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.059
and therefore feel more constrained

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:32.540
by community norms

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.820
that sound familiar to you

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.949
the very reason is your

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.199
any question as to why mit romney is
doing better

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.650
among voters too

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.370
earn more than two hundred thousand
dollars a year now

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.080
this dude is like talking about people
wearing panchos going ethnic nice nice

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.030
jacket

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.160
they were traffic tests

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.909
and about one-third of drivers in higher
status cars

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.509
cut off other drivers at an intersection
washed by the research

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.819
about double those in less costly cars

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.990
and additionally almost half of the more
expensive cars

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.759
team to yield

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:18.429
to production ravens

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:19.889
uh... alleged the crosswalk
