Hi, this is Dave Long from Staticworx

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.600
and in this sequence we're going to be

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.900
talking about the different types of carpet

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.800
that are used to prevent static electricity problems.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.200
The first one we're going to discuss is 
computer grade static-control carpet

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.200
and by computer grade carpet, what
we're talking about is very old technology

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.860
that was originally designed
to prevent static shocks on people who

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.400
worked in computer rooms.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.200
Early on, probably early 1980s, the thought 
was that if people did not get a shock

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.400
when they walked across carpet, then the
computer equipment in the room

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.300
was also protected from static electricity.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.300
Unfortunately, what we've learned since
then is that when a person feels a shock

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000
it requires 3,500 to 4,000 volts.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.200
Computer parts are sensitive to 30, 40, 50,
under 100 volts of static electricity

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.200
so today when we look at computer grade carpet,
we actually look at it as totally ineffective

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.200
because all it really should be 
called is shock free carpet.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.900
You won't get hurt when 
you're walking on the floor.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.000
The second type of carpet that has been 
put into use for probably the last 20 years.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.700
is called ESD grade carpet and this is the type 
of carpet–usually comes in the form of a tile–

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.400
that you would find in a 
manufacturing operation.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.200
You would find it in a place where they're
handling semiconductors.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.900
Where they're repairing computer parts.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.200
Generally speaking people wear special 
footwear and where the people are tested

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.200
for the conductive properties of their 
footwear before they walk on the carpet.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.400
The problem with this type of carpet is it has an ohms
rating that puts it into the very conductive range

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.300
but we're talking about using carpet 
in a real world environment.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.300
We're talking about people coming in wearing 
high-heeled shoes, wearing work boots,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.300
wearing flip-flops.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.200
You're not in a situation in those environments where 
you have the ability to know whether you're safe or not

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.400
based on any kind of testing, so this has
created a need for a third type of carpet.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.800
What we're calling that third type of 
carpet is an operational grade carpet,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.900
a carpet that can be used around
energized equipment

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.900
and when I say energized equipment, all I'm talking 
about is something that's plugged into the wall.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.400
Could be a laptop, could be a whole 
series of consoles surrounding you.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.200
You could be working in a flight control tower, you could 
be working in a command center, a control room,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.000
but anything that's plugged into the wall if it's static 
sensitive and you want to protect the equipment

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.400
at the same time as you're reducing the 
possibility of a static discharge,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.800
you need to have a floor that prevents 
static but also allows the person to be safe.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.000
The only difference between 
operational grade and ESD grade

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.500
is operational grade has a 
built-in resistive network.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.200
That resistive network prevents grounding 
from occurring at such a rapid rate

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.700
that you're going to find yourself potentially in a 
circuit where you're tied too closely to ground

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.400
Not only does a static control floor have 
to reduce static electricity and look good

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.800
but it also has to be safe.
