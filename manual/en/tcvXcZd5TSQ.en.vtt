Hey, it's Marie Forleo and you are watching
MarieTV, the place to be, hand thong, to create

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.360
a business and life you love. And this is
Q&amp;A Tuesday and today I have a question for

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.480
you.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
I've gotta ask you, do you ever stop yourself
from creating something you really want to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.400
do because you look to someone you admire
and you think, "Oh my God, I am never going

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.950
to be as good as them."

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.750
So if you're like many people I talk to, you're
probably stopping yourself from producing

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.829
something, writing something, sauteing something
because you're not willing to smart small

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.200
or start sucky. In other words, you are stuck
in perfection paralysis. Now, if this sounds

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.620
like you I've got a little story that I hope
will help you come out and play.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.720
As you may know, I started out my life coaching
business when I was 23 years old and I had

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.310
big dreams. I knew I wanted to teach a lot
of people really great ideas that would help

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.159
them improve their life. So my dreams were
loads of people and a big stage and all that

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.310
jazz, but the reality was I was just starting
out and I hardly had any clients. I was just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.610
in the baby stages of building my business.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.720
But I was so pumped from my coach training
and I was learning all of these cool, new

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.470
ideas and I just had to share them with others.
So I decided to hold my first workshop and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.770
it was titled How to Create a Life You Love
and it was incredibly well attended... by

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.130
five people.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.890
It was my yoga teacher Claire, two friends
that she, like, dragged around from the neighborhood,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.700
and my parents. Now, I was very professional.
I did have a venue, it was Claire's basement

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.610
in Summit, New Jersey. And you know, of course,
it was a workshop so I had workshop materials

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.680
that I created myself with Microsoft Word
and some very fancy clipart. And of course

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.440
every workshop, right, you have to have an
easel. So I had a nice easel with the markers

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.170
to make sure that the entire crowd could follow
along.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.650
Looking back I kinda get douche chills thinking
about giving a workshop to 5 people in a basement.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.700
It feels really painful and kind of pathetic.
But the truth is, there's absolutely nothing

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.150
painful or pathetic about it. I mean, I took
a risk, I did something, I put myself out

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.590
there, and I did my very best to deliver value
to all 5 of those people.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.980
That small and sucky workshop gave me the
courage to keep going because, guess what,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.239
I had already done my lamest workshop. Bam!
In the bag. Nailed it!

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:56.170
And I'll tell you, that confidence and that
momentum really fueled me ahead. Don't forget,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.120
every pro starts off as an amateur, so the
next time you find yourself stuck in perfection

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.280
paralysis, take a tip from this Tweetable
tongue twister.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.410
"Starting small and sucky beats staying stucky."

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.830
Put that in your pipe and smoke it, and then
say it 3 times fast.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.349
Now I would love to hear from you. So, are
you stopping yourself from doing something

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.200
because you're not willing to be anything
less than polished or perfect? Or how about

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.050
this one, if you look back in your past is
there something that you did that was kind

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.690
of small and sucky that makes you cringe now
when you look back at it, but totally got

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.209
your balls rolling?

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.659
