00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:07.529
this marvelous flapping bird has been made
by children of japan for last 300 years.

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.390
take a square piece of paper and fold a criss
and a cross.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.799
its like a multiplication sign.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:21.220
then up turn the paper fold a minus sign,
open the paper, rotate it by quarter turn

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:29.810
and fold a plus sign. and then you squash
the paper so that it becomes quarter of its

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.550
original size.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.590
now fold two triangles on the diagonal and
then fold the hip. it would become like a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.210
cobra's head or snake hood.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:54.810
open this up, lift the base of the crown and
fold a diamond shape.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.890
reverse the paper.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.470
once again fold the two triangles and the
triangular crown.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.009
open it up.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:14.810
lift both the triangles and lift the flap
to make the second diamond.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.639
in origami, this is called as a bird base.

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:26.049
it has two ends which can move.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:34.619
now lift one of the ends, in the middle of
the wings, to make the neck and the beak.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.770
similarly lift the other piece between the
two wings to make the tail of the bird.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.369
fold a small beak and put a black dot for
the eye. as you pull the tail, the bird flaps

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:48.470
its wings.
