Yo yo yo What's up Bros!

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.160
Zeng here welcoming you to another episode
of Clashwartime.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.599
So firstly I just wanted to give a big thanks
to my twitter followers who have subscribed

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.599
to the youtube channel.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.419
I really appreciate the support you've shown
so far.

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.230
Now I'll be doing some shoutouts for you in
the next episode so stay tuned for that.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.070
Also my clan One Hive has just reached their
100th win, it's been a massive journey so

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.580
great job guys this is an awesome milestone.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.260
Okay the first clip is from my main man rextacy
aka Zerg Rush showing how to kick ass even

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.110
after the hog update I mean I've seen a few
guys on the forums saying hogs are dead since

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.580
the giant bomb buff but to me if using it
on the right base and you really understand

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.500
hog pathing it definitely still works.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.409
The second attack is from Ayden using Gowipe
on a town hall 10 it's an old clip but also

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.659
fun to watch so I really had to share it with
you guys.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.179
The third attack is also from an old clip
using mass witches and this is from me.

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:17.270
I've been using this alot lately and I just
wanted to show you guys an example the type

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.010
of base this strategy works on.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.259
Now this can three star a lot of low to mid
town hall nines depending on the layout so

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.140
I'll be posting more clips of this attack
style very soon so keep an eye out for them

00:01:29.140 --> 00:03:01.270
in the future, alright lets get started!

00:03:01.270 --> 00:07:36.229
Hope you've enoyed today's video guys, I just
wanna say really really big thank you again

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.861
for the support everyone has shown so far
and also the guys who've left comments in

00:07:39.861 --> 00:07:40.861
my last video.

00:07:40.861 --> 00:07:45.310
I'll admit I don't have masses of time on
my hands but I do try to respond to all of

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:46.310
you.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.490
So recently I've received a few messages from
views to visit their clan.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.259
I'm all up for that so just drop me your clan
tag in the comments below and I'll pay you

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:58.680
a visit and maybe I can showcase some of your
attacks or give your clan a shoutout.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:03.339
Again drop me your clan tag, actually give
me your in game name as well in the comments

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.349
so I can find you more easily.

00:08:05.349 --> 00:08:09.430
That pretty much wraps it up for today guys
again subscribe to me if you haven't already

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.570
and I'll see you in the next episode.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:12.159
