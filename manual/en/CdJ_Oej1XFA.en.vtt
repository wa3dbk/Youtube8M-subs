00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.620
Today working on a 2007 Ford Five Hundred,
were going to install a Draw-Tite Hitch, part

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.630
number 75299.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.700
This will also be comparable to Hidden Hitch,
part number 87108.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.070
There are a couple of measurements that will
assist you in selecting accessories for your

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.220
new hitch such as a bike rack or a cargo carrier.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.480
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
outermost point of your bumper is 4inches.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.009
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 12inches.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.539
Now lets go ahead with the installation.

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.090
Were going to need to lower the exhaust in
order to install the hitch.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.520
Before I lower the exhaust, Im going to go
ahead and put a safety strap under it so that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.430
we can control how far and fast the exhaust
will fall.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.019
Now to lower the exhaust, well need to spray
a lubricant on the rubber hangers to make

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.140
it easier to remove and reinstall.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.800
Using a pry bar, we can simply push the rubber
hanger off the metal hanger.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:19.409
With our exhaust lower, we need to remove
a couple of components before 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:49.340
we can 
put 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:03:41.159
our hitch 
in place.
