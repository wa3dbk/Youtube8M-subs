00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.720
I used to paint stuff for fun
by myself when I was younger.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.720
I bought cheap paints
and painted guitars, bicycles and stuff.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.920
That’s the route that got me here.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.600
My name’s Victor Johansson, I’m 25 years old,
and I work as an industrial refinisher

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.600
specialising in powder coating.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.800
Industrial refinishing is the painting
of almost everything except cars.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.320
Wooden furniture, metal components,
frames, wheel rims - you name it.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.840
In powder coating
you use an electrostatic coating

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.600
that’s electrically charged, which is grounded
with the workpiece so the coating bonds.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.760
Which is why it only works
on things that are conductive.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.560
Wet coating generally requires
more preparation work than powder.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.880
Powder bonds much better
and is much thicker.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.720
Wet coating can be applied to anything.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.280
We start by hanging up
the things we’re going to coat in the frames.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.600
They enter the washer and are cleaned,
then on into a dryer at 100°C

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.680
and then into the coating booth.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.360
Then they go up to the oven and are cured at 210°C
and come back down for packaging.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.400
I came in
via an in-house training course with the company.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.880
That’s the most common way
to become an industrial refinisher.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.800
My stepfather, who works for a company
that’s a customer here, made enquiries.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.200
I had to start with a bit of everything:
cleaning the premises,

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.240
preparation work,
sanding and cleaning workpieces, packing...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.720
Then I got to be a refinishing apprentice
for a year.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.120
You have to find working in a group easy
and be able to take instructions.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.080
Asthma is not a good thing to have
if you want to be a refinisher. It’s a dusty environment.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.080
You have to have stamina,
be physically strong and have patience.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:47.040
The most important thing to think about
is having good protective gear, lift properly

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.640
and be thorough
with your coating work.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.080
The environment is very important.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.240
There are a lot of toxic substances:
thinners and solvents.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.160
Good ventilation,
protective gloves and dust masks are important.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.040
The Swedish Work Environment Authority are
very strict about compliance with those kinds of things.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.200
The hardest thing is when you receive old,
worn out things that you have to make look like new.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.320
That requires a lot of preparation work.
A lot of sanding, a lot of filler.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.200
The most fun things are large components
with a lot of angles

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.240
so you have to think about
how you should start and where you should end

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:42.040
and customise the job accordingly
to achieve a perfect result.
