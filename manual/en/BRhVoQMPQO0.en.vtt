00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.540
So since the last video update, we’ve now
got plumbing in, we’ve got the pillar set

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.500
almost. And then we’ve got some tarp break
up for some shade because it’s been awfully

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:28.999
hot here, check it out. We’ve got Steve
over here forming up the bridge, we’re going

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:36.170
to pour that tomorrow, coming over the lagoon.
We’ve got the stone work around the spa

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.670
completed. We’ve got the right side pillar
completed and now we just need to finish the

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:50.220
left side pillar before going on to doing
the grotto stones. Here we’ve got massive

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:59.899
six inch plumbing for our Badu stream. And
everything is being plumbed to go down to

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.440
the equipment pad which will be poured down
by the A/C units. We have our electrical light

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.110
junctions. We’ve got the stone masons hard
at work building a beautiful wall here. We’ve

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.750
got some XM radio, a fan, and a tarp, so we’re
getting better.
