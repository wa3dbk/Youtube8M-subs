00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.950
I often get asked questions from people with
different types of yeast infections on how

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.820
they can cure these conditions at home, how
they can get rid of it without incurring consultation

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.540
fees or doctor's visits or things like that.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.250
I've got a question here from a lady in Japan
regarding toenail fungus.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.630
Toenail fungus is quite common with Asian
people just like it is with people in America

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.740
and Europe and here in Australia and New Zealand.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.920
It's a very common condition that affects
a lot of people.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.050
And this lady, I got a long email from her.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.090
It sounds like she works in an office and
she's got stockings on and things like that,

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.460
so she has feet that are contained in an environment
all the time that is conducive toward yeast

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.460
infection.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.640
I made a couple of notes here on some of the
best home remedies which I think are really,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.600
really good to use for yeast infections.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.700
This will give her some very good advice.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.480
Apple cider vinegar is a very good home remedy
to use is to bathe your foot each evening

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.149
for about 20 minutes.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.730
You just use about a half a cup, a third to
a half a cup of apple cider vinegar in a small

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.560
amount of water, just enough to put your foot
in.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.800
Japanese people got small feet, so this will
mean maybe a small container.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.040
Tepid water, apple cider vinegar, soak the
foot for 20 minutes, and then dry it carefully.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.440
Olive leaf extract.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.030
You can get different concentrations of olive
leaf extract.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.770
This is going to help quite well, too.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.520
Olive leaf has some very interesting compounds
about it that are very antimicrobial.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.290
I've got some patients, in fact, here in New
Zealand I know that actually get olive leaves

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.790
and boil and simmer them and then actually
cool that water down and use that for toenail

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.460
fungus, so that works quite well, too.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.030
Tea tree oil is probably one of the best essential
oils you can use.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.890
The two best essential oils, I think, for
toenail fungus would be oregano oil and tea

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.690
tree oil.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.240
Oregano oil is much stronger, and you often
will mix this in with a little bit of carrier

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.210
oil like jojoba oil or almond oil or sunflower
oil.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.390
Just put a couple of drops of oregano oil
in a teaspoon and message it into the toe

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.300
and the nail area.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.660
Tea tree oil you can apply neat.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.350
I find it works best one drop on each nail.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.760
The hardest part is getting it under the toenail,
so you really need to trim those nails right

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.370
back and sand them until you can get the oil
underneath the nail.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.030
If you can do that and do that every day,
you'll go a long way to achieving this cure

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.080
for this condition.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.510
Baking soda is another very good thing you
can use because it has an interesting alkalizing

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.450
effect.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.760
Baking soda is also good for neutralizing
stomach acid, but it is particularly good

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.870
for toenail fungus.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.400
Just by using baking soda on its own in water,
again a soak for 20 minutes, you'd probably

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.690
use a good tablespoon for a small container
of water, mix it in thoroughly, and soak the

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.000
foot.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.580
So one day you can do cider vinegar.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.630
The following day you could do baking soda.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.770
And then when the foot's dry, use the tea
tree oil or the oregano oil for stronger treatment.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.020
Lavender oil is also nice to use because it's
got such a nice fragrance about it and it

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.990
also has good antimicrobial properties, but
not quite as good as tea tree oil.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.349
And of course, probiotics.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.880
Some people actually even bathe their feet
in yogurt.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.020
I've heard all sorts of things being done,
but the probiotics you take internally at

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:31.130
the same time that you're treating your foot
externally.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.760
Be sure to watch my other videos on toenail
fungus and have a look at some of my articles

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.910
on yeastinfection.org.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.540
And while we're here, do my online quiz.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.569
It's the best one you'll find.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.130
Candidacrusher.com.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.490
Check out my online quiz to see if you've
got mild, moderate or severe yeast infection

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.700
because most people with toenail fungus will
have some degree of Candida in their digestive

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.239
system, particularly people who've had it
chronically for many years and can't get rid

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.959
of the toenail fungus.

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.520
Or people who use Lamisil or these sorts of
drugs or creams to try to cure it, but then

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.680
it comes back.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.180
You need to treat the whole person, not just
the foot.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.410
I hope that gives you some solutions there
in Japan for toenail fungus.

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.790
Thank you for tuning in.
