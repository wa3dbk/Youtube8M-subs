Hello everyone, welcome to the University of the 
 West of England, Bristol's International College.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.160
This is our common room and reception.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:31.460
The student service team is ready to help you with any questions you have.

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:38.757

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.569
Now let's have a look at our classrooms.

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:59.025
This is one of our classrooms, all the facilities here are brand new.

00:01:14.588 --> 00:01:21.588
All our classrooms are named after a city in UK, which is very interesting.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:24.948
For example, this classroom is called Glasgow.

00:01:34.188 --> 00:01:38.188
Classified garbage collection is working very well here!

00:01:38.908 --> 00:01:41.910
We all contribute to the garbage sorting.

00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.990
You can find out information about social activities here on these boards. 

00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:54.080
The College organised many social activities to help the students get to know eachother.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.100
and offered the opportunity to visit cultural and historical landmarks in the UK.

00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:12.020
This is the bathroom.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:37.400
If you feel hungry, the kitchen is ready to welcome you - heat your food here!

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.080

00:02:45.015 --> 00:02:49.020
