00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.830
Every summer the news
brings us so many stories

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.090
of shark attacks.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.590
But here's today's
question, how likely

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.880
are you to actually be
attacked by a shark?

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.350
According to diver Gary Adkison,
90% or more of shark incidents

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.290
are mistakes.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.990
They're assuming that humans
are something humans are not,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.300
namely food.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.290
And some sharks are more
aggressive then others.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.040
Great white's, tiger
sharks, bull sharks

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.850
those are the top
three of sharks

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.660
likely to attack you for
the following reasons-- one,

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.300
they're widespread, two,
they're large enough

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.130
that human beings can
look like prey, three,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.490
they're super powerful,
and the first bite

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.130
can cause fatal damage.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.120
Next, they're top
of the food chain.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.620
This means they're
not instinctively

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.660
afraid of anything.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
Other shark species of course
are not completely innocent.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.480
So if humans are not what
sharks are looking for,

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.750
what are they looking for?

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.750
Let's think about it from the
shark's point of view, OK.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.580
Many attack victims
are surfers or people

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.030
riding on boogie
boards, what have you.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.410
A shark swimming below
the water's surface

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.260
sees a roughly oval
shape with arms and legs

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.040
dangling off, paddling along.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.020
And this bears a
close resemblance

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.370
to a sea lion or a sea turtle.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.580
And those are some of sharks
favorite things to eat.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.900
Humans just are
not on this menu.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.020
But how likely is
it to happen to you?

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.860
Let's play with some statistics.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.190
So there are between 30 and
50 unprovoked shark attacks

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.080
reported worldwide each year.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.410
5 to 10 of these are fatal.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.990
Florida has the most attacks
in the United States.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.940
Since 1990, the numbers have
ranged from 10 to 37 per year.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.530
And yes, the United States tops
the list for attacks worldwide.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.210
The vast majority
of these attacks

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.540
occur within a few hundred
yards of the shore.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.970
Just because that's where
most people enter the ocean.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.940
And yes, the number of attacks
worldwide and in the United

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.640
States has been increasing
in recent years.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.770
It's not that sharks are
becoming more aggressive.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.410
It's that people are
taking coastal vacations,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:07.960
participating in more
oceanic activities.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.750
When news stories and scientists
do offer real statistics,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.385
they can easily be misleading.

00:02:13.385 --> 00:02:14.760
You've probably
heard that you're

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.180
more likely to be
struck by lightning then

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.430
to be attacked by a shark.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.340
So this statistic is based
on the number of incidents

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.010
each year.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.035
However, anyone can
be struck by lightning

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:26.710
when a storm comes
through, right.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.060
You're chance of being
attacked by a shark is zero

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.420
if you live in Kansas and don't
take a vacation to the coast.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.990
But if you surf every day
off the coast of Florida,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.450
the odds of a
shark attacking you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.120
are just going to
be much higher.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.290
So the best it is
to be alert, always

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.190
swim, dive or surf with a buddy.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.380
Some of these attacks
can't be prevented,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.550
but having somebody
nearby to call for help

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:47.500
can save your life.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.660
With all that being said,
some fun statistics.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:57.250
In 1996, toilets injured an
estimated 43,000 Americans.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.710
Sharks injured 13.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.870
You have a 1 and 63 chance
of dying from the flu.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.210
The chances of being killed by
a shark, one in 3.7 million.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.830
Now, let's compare that to your
chance of dying from a fall.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.520
That's one in 218.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.130
You are more likely to die
from a fall or a bad run

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.935
in with a toilet, then we are
to hit that horrible lottery

00:03:18.935 --> 00:03:23.120
of one in 3.7 million and
be attacked by a shark.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.750
Add to that, there
are several things

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.510
you can do to make sure you
have a safe, sun summer.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.150
Always swim with a buddy, don't
be that one person out them

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.070
self way off in the
coast because that's

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.420
a recipe for all
sorts of trouble.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.140
So that's it.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.430
Thanks so much for watching.
