00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:06.779
My dear college graduates. You have hopefully
acquired a great deal of knowledge here over

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:14.359
these past years. But in life, knowledge is
considerably less important than wisdom.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.569
Here then are five ideas for your life.

00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:25.629
1. The greatest struggle in your life should
not be -- and, in fact, is not -- with society.

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:32.380
It is with yourself. This idea -- taught by
every great religion -- is not taught today.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.980
Instead we are taught that we have to battle
society -- its sexism, racism, prejudices

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.060
and it's other flaws. The overwhelming temptation
is therefore to see whatever problems you have 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.300
as coming from society, not from within
yourself. But in a free and decent society such as ours, 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.680
it is our own flawed human nature
-- not a flawed society -- that is our biggest problem.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.640
2. Use your common sense. For example, when
you hear the words "studies show" -- 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.180
outside of the natural sciences -- 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.980
and you find that these studies show the opposite of what common sense suggests, 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.960
be very skeptical. I don't
recall ever coming across a valid study that

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.160
contravened common sense. For example, I was
told when I was in college that "studies show"

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.500
that boys and girls are not inherently different;
that they differ only because parents raise

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.840
them in a sexist manner. This was nonsense
then, and it is even more nonsensical now

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.149
since we have brain scans showing how different
the male and females brains are.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.689
3. Race is unimportant. You've been taught
that it is very important, but it isn't. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.920
The color of people's skin is as trivial as the
color of their hair. Be guided by the idea

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.780
of Viktor Frankl, the Jewish psychiatrist
who suffered the horrors of a Nazi death camp

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.760
and whose family was gassed. After the Holocaust,
he was asked, "Do you hate the German race?"

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:25.280
"No" he replied "I don't, there are only two
races, the decent and the indecent." 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.580
Remember that truism, and you can never be a racist.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.060
4. Beware of good intentions. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.160
The 20th century
was the bloodiest and cruelest century on record. 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.660
Why? Not because so many more people
were bad, but because so many people believed

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.060
in bad ideas. Most Nazis and Communists in
their time and Islamic terrorists in our time

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.960
were not/are not necessarily sadists; they
were normal people who believed in bad ideas.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.280
So here is a quick way to measure if an idea
is good. Do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.140
ask if it feels good or if it has good intentions.
Ask will it DO good?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.340
Will it make people kinder and more ethical? 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.020
Will it encourage responsible
behavior? Has it been tried before and if so, 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:32.820
what were the results? What matters is
how you act. If you do something bad,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.840
 it is not important that you "meant well." And if
you do something good, it doesn't matter if

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.660
you did it for "selfish" reasons. So spend
much less time monitoring your motives 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.480
and far more time monitoring your actions.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.880
5. Judeo-Christian values are the real counterculture
today. Many people think that dressing weird

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.580
or having their body tattooed or pierced is
a statement of individuality or strength or

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.910
rebellion against the dominant culture. Not
true. The ultimate statement of counterculture

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:19.990
and individual strength in America today is
to take the God of Judaism and Christianity seriously. 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.620
If you want to be an individual
and to be strong, affirm a higher value system

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:34.040
that enables you to say no to the prevailing
culture. When you know to whom you are accountable

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.170
and when you march to the beat of that Higher
Drummer, 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.560
you will lead a more peaceful, happy and good life. 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.620
Good luck to all of you.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.400
I'm Dennis Prager.
