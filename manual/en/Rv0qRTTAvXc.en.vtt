00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:17.179
You want to be a benevolent ruler, not a
tyrant.You want to keep all your promises

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.199
But you don't know how to make much gold?

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.380
Then this video is for you

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.380
Play normally untill you become a monarch

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.120
When you have to decide to tax

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.120
best option is to keep Logan's policies

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.360
It won't affect people so much. You will
reach the goal faster,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.060
but you can skip this step if you want

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.470
Transfer the gold to your personal account

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.490
Use that gold to invest in properties

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.010
Start in Millfields

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:10.010
Always adjust rent and prices to highest!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.580
Take benevolent decisions!

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.580
In Sunset house there is a demand door
that opens to a monarch only! 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.869
 Go there, defeat the hobs and enter the portal

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.480
you will find there 1 000 000 gold

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.710
Again, use it to invest in property

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.420
buy shops that are more expensive first

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.210
Remember to rebuild the old quarter
when Page will ask

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.210
otherwise you wont be able to invest in that
area

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.199
Choose to keep the gold value of the
Diamond

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:19.029
You will be able to buy every house in
Aurora

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.069
This decision wont affect Page too much

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.989
people will be happy anyway

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.429
When you get this statute

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:41.810
do as you did before keep the gold to
invest in property

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.099
Keep your promises

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.199
BUT DON'T SIGN THIS "document"

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:53.029
the goal is to have 0 civilian
casualties 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.479
even with money from statue, demon door

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:57.520
 and treasury 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.300
you'll still have some houses left 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:09.110
Every five minutes you will have profits of 
thousands!  

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.520
Complete side quests or just leave the game open even when you leave your PC 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.159
But don't stay in the Sanctuary!

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.589
When you get enough money

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:20.200
Buy the remaining houses

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.519
After you own all properties in Albion

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.529
your profits will consist of 200 000 gold/per5min

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:32.900
Do what you want again and in 4 hours you will have enough money to

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.839
cover all expenses

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:43.799
You will see people hating you, 
That's because the Rent is too Damn High!

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.799
Don't worry about it! they will change
their mind after you save them

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.529
When you've got enough gold 
Lower the rent and prices in all your properties

00:03:55.529 --> 00:04:01.159
Transfer the gold to treasury
And "THEN" SIGN the contract

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:05.849
Congradulations you saved the kingdom
and people love you!
