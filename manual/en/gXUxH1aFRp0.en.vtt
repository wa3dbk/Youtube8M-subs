00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.509
Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and in
this video I'm going to walk you through the

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.459
sodaria cross. Sodaria fimicola is a fungi
that you're going to find in the feces of

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.650
herbivores. But it you're also going to find
it in the AP Biology classroom. Because it's

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.220
easy to grow and it's easy to look at a mutant
strain and how meiosis occurs. And so what

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.460
you're going to do is a cross between a dark
or a wild type. Wild type remember is what

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.250
they normally look like. And then a tan type
of fungi. And as these grow together the spores

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.720
are going to fuse and we're going to be able
to see meiosis occur. And so let's look at

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.090
meiosis again to remember what that is. What
are we doing in meiosis? Remember we're starting

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.870
with a diploid nuclei. So we're going to have
two chromosomes in this case. It'll undergo

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.010
DNA replication. So this would be the centromere.
And here are going to be the two sister chromatids.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.470
We're then undergoing meiosis I and then meiosis
II. At the end of meiosis what do we have?

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.970
We have four cells. And those cells are going
to be haploid. Remember they're going to have

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.690
one half of the genetic information that's
going to be found in that diploid parent cell.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.130
And so in us these would become sperm and
egg and eventually we have fertilization.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.920
But it's going to be a little bit different
in these fungi. They're going to be haploid

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.000
in general. Their cells are all going to be
haploid. And what happens is one haploid cell

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.980
is going to fuse with another haploid cell
and then we're going to create the next generation.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.060
We're still going to have meiosis and fertilization.
It's going to give us recombination again,

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.740
but it occurs kind of if a different, the
life cycle occurs a little bit different than

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.900
in us. And so how does this occur? Well we're
going to have one cell that's formed by the

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.280
fusion of a spore from the wild dark type.
And one from the tan type. And so what they're

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.620
going to deliver is a chromosome from each.
We now have two chromosomes. We have a diploid

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.190
cell. That's going to undergo DNA replication.
And so now this would be our centromere here

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.720
and this is going to be our two sister chromatids.
Now let's say no crossing over occurs. And

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.979
now we're going to go just through regular
meiosis. Those are going to split in half.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.840
This would be meiosis I. And then we're going
to have meiosis II. And now we end up with

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.989
these four cells that each are haploid in
relation to that fuse cell. But something

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.749
weird happens here in sodaria. And what's
going to happen is we're going to have another

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:24.370
mitotic division. So each of these chromosomes
are going to be replicated. And so we're going

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.909
to have four cells. And therefore four spores
that are going to be of the tan type. And

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.159
then four that are going to be of this dark
mutant type. And so if you ever get a four

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.950
to four ratio of spores, no crossing over
occurred. But it could have occurred in a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.359
different way. It could have occurred with
the dark on the top and the tan on the bottom.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:51.139
And what would be get? We'd still get a four
to four spore ratio of the dark to the tan.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.189
And so kind of remember these. If you ever
have four to four, no crossing over occurred.

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.249
Now let's look at how crossing over could
occur. So we began with those that are copied.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:05.739
But we have remember crossing over occurring
right here. And so where you're crossing over

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.669
we're going to take parts of one and switch
that with another. And so as we do that, we

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:17.669
now have a recombinant chromosome. It's a
mix between the tan and the dark. How does

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:22.749
this play out as we go through meiosis I and
meiosis II and finally mitosis? What you are

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:28.779
get are two spores that are going to tan.
Two dark. Two tan. Two dark. Now it doesn't

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:33.370
have to occur specifically in that way. We
could have the recombined chromosomes end

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.139
up on the end, so up here and down here. What's
that going to create? Still a two to two to

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:43.279
two to two. Or it could occur like this where
we have one of the recombinants on the inside

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:47.449
and on the outside of this other one. And
we get a two to four to two. Or it could occur

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:52.699
like this. And so these are going to be four
ways that recombination or crossing over can

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:58.269
create these new, and remember these are called
asci, which are going to be these eight spores

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.109
found within the parathecium of the sodaria.
Okay. And so how does this lab lay out? Well

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.279
let me show you. But before that let me talk
about the importance of crossing over. Remember

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:12.559
Thomas Hunt Morgan and his student Alfred
Sturtevant were the people who figured out

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:17.489
the importance of this. So as those chromosomes
cross over they literally are creating new

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.949
chromosomes that haven't been built before.
And that gives us recombination. If two genes

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.840
happen to be on the same chromosome, then
they would tend to travel through time together.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.710
They would be linked genes. But crossing over
is a way for us to get variation between that.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.050
And so what we can look at is the frequency
of cross over and that tells us how far those

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.789
genes are going to be apart on the same chromosome.
Now in this case we're not looking at in sodaria,

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.050
we're not looking at two genes. We're looking
at one gene. But we're looking at the cross

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.039
over. And so we're looking to measure the
distance between the gene and the centromere

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.199
which is going to be that connection between
the two chromosomes. And so this is how the

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.199
data is presented. What you would do is take
these parathecium. You put them underneath

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.889
a glass slide. And you push down with it.
And you kind of get this explosion of these

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.650
asci and you can start to count them. And
so you may want to pause the video here. How

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.560
many on these asci are going to be parental
or no crossing over? And how many of them

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.990
are going to be crossing over? So you may
want to count those out. Because that's a

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.580
skill you should be able to pick up. So I'll
pause for a little bit. And so what you should

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.310
have found is that there are eight ascus that
show no crossing over. And there are going

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.270
to be 10 that show crossing over. And so how
do we know again the no crossing over? It's

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.250
that 4 to 4. And then the yes crossing over
are going to have a different combination.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.430
Sometimes 2 to 2 to 2 to 2. And sometimes
2 to 4 to 2. Why is that important? Well now

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.879
we can start to plug in our data. And so if
we look at this chart. This is from the AP

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.699
Biology's Lab Book, we start with a number
of asci that are showing no crossing over.

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:02.719
And how many was that? Remember we said 8.
How many are showing crossing over? 10. And

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:07.740
so how many total asci did we count? 18. Now
this is not a big enough number. You should

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.879
count at least 50 of these to get good data.
But let's just use the data right here. The

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:17.810
next thing we're going to figure out is the
percent of cross over. Now it's interesting.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.120
Since we undergo that mitosis in sodaria,
we have to take that crossing over number

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:28.569
and we have to divide it by two. And so how
do we figure out our percent of cross over?

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.789
What we're going to do is take the total showing
cross over. Which is 10. Divide by the total

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:40.789
number, so that's 10 over 18, and I get around
57%. After I've done that I divide that in

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:48.289
2 and I get around 28%. And so that's going
to be not only our percent cross over divided

00:06:48.289 --> 00:06:52.810
by two, but that's going to be our gene distance.
Or that's going to be the map units from the

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:59.810
gene to the centromere. And so again that
crossing over is a random event. And so if

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.439
we can look at how often this is occurring,
we can figure out how far that gene is away

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:09.060
from the center of the chromosome. What's
the accepted value? In the lab book it says

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.539
it's around 26. And so this is not correct,
and that's because not only did we have a

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:20.039
small sample size, but it's data that I just
made up, so we could do an animation of it.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:24.759
And so that's the sodaria cross. You may want
to go out there, google sodaria cross and

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:28.849
you'll find all these images and you could
try to figure out the frequency of cross over

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:33.319
by yourself. Remember divide by 2 and that's
going to give you your gene to centromere

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.089
distance. And I hope that was helpful.
