Slip Stitch Edges in Knitting.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.110
Hi, Guys, I'm Kristen and welcome to Studio
Knit.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.820
I recently knitted a tie for my Dad for Father's
Day and you will see the difference.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.160
On the left side is my first attempt and then
I realized there are all these little bumps

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.330
on the edges and I remembered there is a great
and easy technique that for something, especially

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:34.690
as, you know, refined as a tie to lie much
flatter and it's really simple.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.859
So, I started again and I wanted to share
this with you.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:44.519
There are a few different ways to slip stitches
in edging and this is my favorite.

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:52.459
I simply knit across the row and on my very
last stitch, I simply slip that last stitch

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:58.600
and I slip it as if to purl, so I put it onto
my needle as such.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.560
And then when I turn it around to knit the
next row, you'll see that my yarn is in the

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.159
front here.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.310
And so I just put my needle in like this and
take that yarn and wrap it around and doing

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.750
this is what creates that nice smooth edge.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.000
So let's do it one more time.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.100
We are going to knit all the way across the
row and on our last stitch, we will slip as

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.619
if to purl and we will come back around.

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.100
You'll see that your yarn is in the front.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
So ahead and knit into that first stitch.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.479
That is your slip stitch.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.470
And there you go!

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.149
So, um, you'll see it gives a really nice
edge.

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.749
So for something as special as a tie, even
a dishcloth, a blanket, um, just this one

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:58.679
extra little technique will give your edges
that smooth look that you're going for.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.070
Really simple, extra little step.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.649
So, I hope this has been helpful to you.

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.780
Give it a try and love it, please let me know.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.009
