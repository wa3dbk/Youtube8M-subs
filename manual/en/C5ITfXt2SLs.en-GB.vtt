Hey guys, welcome to Btekt, it's Basil, it's
my last day of CES 2014 and I thought what

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.080
better way to round things off thank with
a doodle over at the Samsung booth.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.730
I've got a Samsung Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 here.
The Wacom S Pen integration supports 1024

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.599
levels of pressure sensitivity, it comes pre-loaded
with a Sketchbook application that's been

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.649
optimised for the tablet; it has layers, you
can export things to Photoshop files.

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.900
It's just an awesome app, really really would
recommend it whatever device you've got, but

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.570
now that I'm here with the Samsung Galaxy
Note Pro 12.2, let's get to it.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.430
I'm going to finish drawing this eye, won't
bore you with it so let's fast forward, I'll

00:00:42.430 --> 00:02:16.060
speak to you guys at the end.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.690
There you have it, a big eye on an even bigger
tablet. Hopefully you've enjoyed this and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.970
