00:00:00.095 --> 00:00:02.987
(mellow music)

00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:08.234
(upbeat music)

00:00:08.234 --> 00:00:09.778
- A visit to Monterey is not complete

00:00:09.778 --> 00:00:11.159
without spending some time

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:12.825
at the Monterey Bay Acquarium.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:13.780
Let's go inside.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.780
(upbeat music)

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.939
- One of the things that is really unique

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.341
about the Monterey Bay Acquarium

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:27.007
is first of all our location.

00:00:27.007 --> 00:00:28.307
We like to say the ocean

00:00:28.307 --> 00:00:30.014
is our largest exhibit here.

00:00:30.014 --> 00:00:31.985
Everything you see inside are the habitats

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:33.895
that you would see if
you were to go diving

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:35.927
right out here a few feet off our decks.

00:00:35.927 --> 00:00:37.715
(upbeat music)

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:38.608
- Whoa!

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:41.778
I'm like right underneath the shark.

00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:43.241
(mellow music)

00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.602
Wow, look, I found Nemo.

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:48.239
I can't believe how colorful the coral is.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.844
It's brilliant, so vibrant.

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:52.119
The aquarium doesn't only feature

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.639
what lives under the water in the bay.

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.874
You'll also find the birds which live

00:00:56.874 --> 00:00:58.579
in the sky and on the shore.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.627
I think my favorite is the
one with the orange legs,

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.274
the black neck stilt.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:07.317
(upbeat music)

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:07.885
Whoa!

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:09.491
So many of the creatures have to deal with

00:01:09.491 --> 00:01:12.395
the rushing water crashing
against the shore.

00:01:12.395 --> 00:01:14.752
Wow. Hey, buddy.

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:16.804
A lot of the creatures
here, like the otter,

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.812
have been rescued, and they
now call this place home

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.985
because they wouldn't survive in the wild.

00:01:21.985 --> 00:01:23.387
- Look at that one.

00:01:23.387 --> 00:01:24.464
He came to see you.

00:01:24.464 --> 00:01:26.252
- Oh, cool!

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.344
It's really neat that they
have these touch pools

00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:30.905
so that you can actually
get right in there

00:01:30.905 --> 00:01:32.976
and interact with the animals.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.521
It's called a decorator crab

00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.939
because it attaches things to its back.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:38.543
Move along, little fella.

00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:39.783
Have a good day.

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:42.363
- Whenever our guests
come to the aquarium,

00:01:42.363 --> 00:01:43.887
they leave feeling inspired

00:01:43.887 --> 00:01:45.655
and want to do something for the animals

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:46.913
and the world's oceans.

00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:47.767
They're going to leave

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:49.067
feeling that emotional connection

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.261
with all of our animals on exhibit here.

00:01:51.261 --> 00:01:55.264
- I have had such a fantastic
day here at the aquarium

00:01:55.264 --> 00:01:57.256
learning about all the different creatures

00:01:57.256 --> 00:01:58.636
that live in the bay,

00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:00.608
and seeing the world
from their perspective.

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:03.656
The Monterey Bay Aquarium
cannot be missed.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:08.656
(upbeat music)
