00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:01.733
Hello pilots!

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.633
Let's talk about team play.

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.033
What are the advantages of aircraft flights,

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:07.800
how do you find and create them,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.267
how do you talk to other players

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.467
and which aircraft make the most effective setups?

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.533
One question at a time.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:25.600
Nearly all World of Warplanes players notice aircraft

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.967
with icons and numbers in the team lists on the battle loading screen.

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:33.367
These icons mean that the players belong to an aircraft flight,

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:36.200
while numbers signify different flights within a team,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.100
if there are several of them.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.467
An aircraft flight is a fighting unit.

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:44.033
It consists of a flight leader and his wingmen.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.233
Different countries had various concepts for aircraft flight formations.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:52.467
For example, in Germany, aircraft flew in pairs and fours

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:56.133
because this formation allowed them to make the most of their speed.

00:00:56.267 --> 00:01:00.833
In other countries, including Russia, aircraft formed up into the shape of a “V”

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.767
with the flight leader in front and wingmen behind and on either side.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:08.500
The number of aircraft in a flight matters little.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.767
What matters are the skills and abilities of its players.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:16.600
In a flight they don't just add up, they multiply the effectiveness of the team.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.433
To succeed, the members of a flight must evaluate

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.500
the main threats of the enemy team quickly

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.867
and work together to eliminate them.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.700
A flight that is able to effectively work together can achieve much better results,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.033
that is, until it meets another strong flight.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.333
The players in a flight are able to better focus on a target,

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:37.733
coordinate attacks from multiple angles,

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.167
and destroy enemy aircraft faster,

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:43.067
while providing cover for teammates.

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:47.767
This allows a flight to be very effective in random battles,

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:52.800
which leads to more experience, credits and better statistics.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:57.967
There are several ways to find players for a flight in World of Warplanes:

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:02.067
via the forum, in-game channels and directly in battle.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:07.300
The most convenient is the game channel called "Search for Flight or Clan".

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:11.367
To create a flight, click the “Assemble Flight” button,

00:02:11.467 --> 00:02:17.000
then invite one of your friends or search for a pilot you want in your flight.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:27.067
When playing in a flight it is very important to quickly communicate

00:02:27.167 --> 00:02:31.500
with other players while keeping your hands on the controls at the same time.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.433
You can communicate with your wingmen using voice chat

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:36.567
- it can be enabled in the Settings menu.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:41.000
Effective communication in a flight is clear, concise and specific.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.733
So use voice chat - it allows for the optimal teamwork between players in the flight.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.267
Don't forget to designate the targets you're attacking

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.867
– they can be marked with the “T” key or F3 key by default.

00:02:51.967 --> 00:02:53.833
This will prove to be very handy.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:58.800
Aircraft used in flights can be the all same tier or of multiple tiers.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.567
Aircraft in the same tier are easier to play when you're in a flight,

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:05.500
especially if they're high-energy fighters.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.900
A flight with multiple tiers comes in handy

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.467
when a player seeks to master a combination of certain aircraft.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.700
Here, the balancer takes into account the highest-tier aircraft

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.900
in a flight when placing it in battle.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Aircraft in different tiers have different ratios of manoeuvrability, speed and firepower.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.500
High-tier aircraft tend to be faster and less manoeuvrable,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.467
so to make them suitable for playing,

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:32.667
the maps these aircraft battle on are also enlarged.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:38.667
In addition, anti-aircraft guns are also more powerful.

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:42.467
In short, each tier has a group of corresponding maps.

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:45.833
If your flight is not at the top of the list, don’t despair!

00:03:45.933 --> 00:03:48.900
You can still be very useful to the team if you stay alive,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.167
guarding the base and protecting it from the enemy attack aircraft.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:58.367
In World of Warplanes, aircraft are divided into groups based on their specifications

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:01.033
and, as a result, their role in battle.

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:05.033
High-tier battles feature both jet and piston-powered fighters, heavy fighters

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:09.833
and attack aircraft, which brings about a concept called “optimum altitude”

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.333
— the best altitude for air combat.

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:16.500
Jet-powered, piston-powered and attack aircraft have their own optimal altitudes,

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.167
so a flight can be divided into those fighting on the same altitude

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:22.467
and those fighting at different altitudes.

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:26.100
Flights with aircraft having the same optimum altitude may look like this:

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.467
Three heavy fighters,

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:31.600
a fighter and two heavy fighters or two fighters and one heavy fighter,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.133
where fighters perform best at high altitude.

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:38.333
Three fighters, where high-altitude ones, based on their specifications,

00:04:38.433 --> 00:04:40.933
stay lower than heavy fighters.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.667
Flights with different optimum altitudes may look like this:

00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:47.700
An attack aircraft and two fighters,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.300
two attack aircraft and one fighter,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.833
two attack aircraft and one heavy fighter,

00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:55.633
an attack aircraft and two heavy fighters

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:58.500
an attack aircraft, a fighter, and a heavy fighter,

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.833
a fighter and a heavy fighter.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.367
A flight with only one optimum altitude has the best chance at coordination,

00:05:06.467 --> 00:05:09.500
mutual support and cohesion during battle.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:15.033
Such a flight can display some great dogfighting and boom-n-zoom skills.

00:05:15.467 --> 00:05:19.833
A flight with multiple optimum altitudes is more interesting in terms of strategy,

00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:25.333
especially at higher tiers, where teamwork and support are even more important.

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:29.900
In high tiers players should also move along one flank,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
with players at higher altitude covering those below.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.733
If a flight meets a single enemy aircraft, two fighters should engage it,

00:05:36.833 --> 00:05:40.033
with the attack aircraft continuing on undetected.

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:44.500
If a flight meets two enemy planes, the fighters should designate a specific target

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.067
and provide each other cover.

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:50.633
If an enemy group outnumbers the flight, it would be best to avoid engagement.

00:05:50.733 --> 00:05:55.467
In the next issue of Flight School we will discuss the use of proper tactics while in a flight.

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:58.033
That's it for now, good luck in battle!
