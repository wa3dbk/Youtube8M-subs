Okay, swing feel. I had a lot of students
that hear me play jazz, and they automatically

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.880
want to jump into it, but it comes with time
to really develop it. I had some really good

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.439
teachers that have helped me out. And usually
it start with just a ride symbol. I've had

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.150
some lessons with Jason Marsalas, Israel Bannerman,
that literally the first lesson was nothing

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.320
but ride symbol, nothing else in the room
other than a pair of sticks and ride symbols.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.260
So that's how important it is to playing jazz,
is that. Letâ€™s start with it. Okay, the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
basic pattern is based off of quarter notes,
then there's skip notes in there with the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:53.730
and. So you start with quarters, 1,2,3,4;
then you add a skip note, 1,2 and 3,4. That's

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.810
basically the swing pattern. If you really
want to work on it, and improve it, which

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.210
I still need to do, there's always room for
improvement, regardless of how long you've

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.360
been doing something. Next thing I would do
is add the high hat, on beats 2 and 4, so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:17.120
you have, 1,2,3,4. Now a good little trick
to do, it's hard at first, coordination wise,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.610
is put triplets on your left hand, on the
snare drums, to make sure everything is lined

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.450
up very similar to the rock patterns we did
earlier, that would be like this; 1 triplet,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:48.430
2 triplet, 3 triplet, 4 triplet. By doing
that I can visually see everything lining

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.030
up, my body can feel it lining up and it helps.
So I use that as a warm up a lot for jazz

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:02.880
especially. So keep going. And what I like
to do is take that up 10 beats per minute.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.920
After I feel comfortable, move on and get
as fast as I can get it. And mean while I'm

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.090
working on my left hand and my swing pattern
is getting cleaned up in the process. And,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.970
so that's the basics of the swing feel. Without
this I wouldn't do this really on the song

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.910
other than every now and then as a fill, but
really it's just-

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.440
Generally speaking, the base players playing
chord notes when you're playing this pattern,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.210
it's kind of a giveaway what to match with
that. You want to make sure your chord notes

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.590
are lining up with the base players, and the
music feels good, that's the ultimate goal.
