00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.310
The fourth pattern we're going to listen to
today is the Shotgun microphone

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.310
pattern.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.520
This is much narrower than the Supercardioid,
Cardioid or

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.520
Omnidirectional.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.070
Let's hear what that sounds like.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.530
On axis we've got great pickup of the white
noise, but as we move off axis

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.550
we will notice that the sound starts to drop
off just about there.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.720
We've
got great rejection of the sound source all

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.429
the way around, but like the
Supercardioid we should notice a little bit

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.140
of a high frequency pickup as
we get directly behind the microphone, something

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.290
to be careful of.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.660
Let's move it back around.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.430
Again, great rejection from the sides, and
once

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.510
we get to about here we should come back in
with a strong pickup.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.264
Of
course, as I've said every time, the best

00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:50.320
pickup pattern is directly in
front of the microphone.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.400
Let's hear what that sounds like with the
voice.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.680
I'll stand directly in
front of the microphone.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.940
You should hear great pickup of my voice.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.960
As I
move around, the rejection will start right

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.180
about here and my voice will
disappear from this microphone.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.180
I had great rejection again, maybe just a
little bit of pickup around the back, something

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.939
to be careful of when
you're filming.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.170
I had great rejection again from the sides,
more rejection,

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.600
more rejection, and right about here I should
be moving back into the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.689
pattern of the microphone and again great
sound.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:43.009
That's the Shotgun microphone, a very popular
microphone for filming.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:02:04.829
Shotgun.
