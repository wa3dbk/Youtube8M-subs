00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.520
Hi, Iâ€™m Serge Siou and Welcome to MacStudioA.

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:19.490
This is Part 1 of three screencast from our
Blueprint Series.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.160
In Part 1, we'll be showing you how to create
a Mac OS X USB Boot Disk..

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.160
Then, in Part 2, we'll be showing you how
to create a Mac OS X System Image File.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:39.600
And finally, in Part 3, we'll be putting it
all together, using Parts 1 &amp; 2.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.810
So on to Part 1: Creating A Mac OS X USB Boot
Disk.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.490
Some reasons why you might need to create
a boot disk, might be that, you might need

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.510
to perform a clean install of Mountain Lion
on a Mac Intel Based System.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.100
Or, alternatevely, you might need to install
Mountain Lion on another Intel Based Mac System

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.650
or Systems that you might have.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.520
And finally, and my personal favorite, restoring
a Mountain Lion System Image File, and which

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.820
we'll be demonstrating in Part 3.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.740
Okay...Let's Get Started.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.380
"What You'll need"

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.040
An Intel Based Mac System.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.960
An 8 Gigabyte USB Flash Drive
(Make sure to save all data as it will be

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.290
erased when the USB Boot Disk is created).

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.030
And finally, a copy of OS X Mountain Lion.
Check your Applications Folder to see if it's

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.990
there, that's usually where it's downloaded
to, you need the install file.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.530
Launch the Mac App Store and check your Purchases
Tab to see if you've got one available to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.530
download. If not, you need to make a purchase.
Whatever the case, you need a copy of OS X

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.420
Mountain Lion to continue.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.750
As always, don't forget to make a backup of
your hard drive or hard drives, just in case

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.080
something goes wrong. As you know, human error
prevails.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.739
So; Assuming you got a copy of Mountain Lion,
navigate to its location, goto Finder and

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.879
go to the Applications Folder, this is normally
where the Mac App Store installs the Mac operating

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.379
system of Mountain Lion.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.810
Right Click on the Icon and where it say "Show
Package Contents", click on that.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.340
Then Double-click on the Contents Folder,
and finally, Double-click on the SharedSupport

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.709
Folder. What we are looking for is the InstallESD.dmg
file.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.709
Next, we need to launch the Disk Utility Program.
Go to Launchpad then in the Other Directory

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.189
or Folder

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.779
and click on Disk Utility.

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:59.779
Once launched, we need to insert our 8 gig
USB Disk.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:09.319
Once done, go to the Disk Utility and make
sure that your 8 GigaByte USB Disk is selected.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.579
Click where it says Erase, then go down the
"Erase Button" and confirm.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:25.060
A dialogue box will come up, just click Erase.
This will normally take 10 to 15 seconds.

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:31.040
Once completed, we now need to partition the
USB Disk.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.040
Go to the Partition Tab, and wait a few seconds
for that to load.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:48.859
Then in the Drop-down list, choose 1 Partition.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.129
Then click the Options Button, to make sure
that the GUID Partition Table is selected.

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:02.069
As this is an Intel Based Mac, it's done for
you by default.

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.519
Click Ok to confirm and then click Apply.

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.730
And finally, click the Partition Button to
partition it.

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:20.589
This again will take 10-15 seconds.

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:37.210
Once completed, we need to restore or copy
the Mac operating or Mountain Lion Operating

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.500
system onto the USB disk.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.800
Click on the Restore Tab,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.800
then, MAKE SURE that the Untitled 1 we just
Partitioned is highlighted,

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.930
Then; remember the SharedSupport folder we
just opened earlier,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:00.930
well, locate the InstallESD.dmg file and click
and drag it to the Source Area of the Disk

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.270
Utility window.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.680
Next; click and drag the Untitled 1 to the
Destination location.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.930
Once done, click the Restore Button, then
you'll be promted with a Dialogue box, click

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.949
Erase, then you'll be promted to enter your
Admin and Password details.

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.949
Do so, and the Mountain Lion Operation System
will be copied onto the USB Disk.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:36.310
It indicated that it'll take about 1Hr and
8 mins, but in my case, it took only 16 minutes.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:46.069
We'll now time lapse it by 8000% so that you
don't have to wait for the 16 minutes.

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:59.250
Once completed, a dialogue box or window will
open up, showing the name of the USB disk

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:08.070
and all it's contents, which is "Mac OS X
Install ESD", as you can see here.

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:15.530
Now all we need to do is just close all opened
windows and eject the USB Boot Disk.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:22.009
That takes care of Part 1, hope you join us
in Part 2, where we'll be showing you How

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.810
To Create A System Image File.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:29.789
And finally, in Part 3 we'll be putting it
all together.

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:33.909
As always, your feedback is important, if
there's anything that you don't understand

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:37.770
or you have a question, please leave them
in the comments below.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.530
Until then, see you in Part 2, Peace.
