00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.480
WE ARE INSIDE OF 
A WAR DREAMED

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.320
INSIDE OF GLASS 
PIECES UP IN THE WALLS

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.280
ON WEST,
THE MAIDEN SAINTS RISE

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.960
BRINGING LETTERS 
TO ALL THOSE BEDS

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.800
OF THE FRIENDS
WHO GO NUMB AND SCREAM

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
AND THEY BUY CALVARIES 
AND RAVINES OF THE DESERT

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.320
THE EYES, THE DANCE
AND SO MUCH WATER THAT DROPS

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
IT'S ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE AIR
BENDING THE CITY

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.160
DON'T GO STRAIGHT
NIGHT DON'T GO STRAIGHT

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.600
NIGHT DON'T GO STRAIGHT

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.280
DON'T GO STRAIGHT

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.120
NIGHT DON'T GO STRAIGHT

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.640
 DON'T GO STRAIGHT

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.320
AND THE BEASTS 
SING FOR US ALL

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.360
AND THE BEASTS 
SING FOR US ALL

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.280
AND THE BEASTS 
SING FOR US ALL

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.640
AND THE BEASTS 
SING FOR US ALL

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.680
GAS FROM 
THE SAME BOTTLE

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.240
LEAVES ESCAPED 
TO SEA LEVEL

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.520
AND A GUST OF WIND
DISPERSES THE EDGES

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.480
BUT NOTHING FORGIVES
THE FATAL SUCCESSES.
