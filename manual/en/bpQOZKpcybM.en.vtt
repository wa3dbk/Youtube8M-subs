00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:02.066
Darnell Summers:
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

00:00:02.066 --> 00:00:05.233
My name is Darnell
Summers, I'm 57 years old,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.066
and I work in the
fast-food industry.

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:12.967
I have been on strike four times
-- I'm only making $7.25 an hour

00:00:12.967 --> 00:00:15.734
-- I've been on strike four
times in association with

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:17.600
"Wisconsin Jobs Now!"

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.367
to try to get an increase in
wages and a -- and a fast-food

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:26.000
union with no prevail.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.233
My question to you is: What
can you and Congress do to help

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:36.667
people as myself in
this situation survive?

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:42.333
Because with $7.25 -- and we
were broken down to part time

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.166
to avoid paying health insurance
-- we can't survive.

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.967
It's not living.

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:51.767
The President:
Well, Darnell, I agree with you.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.166
And on Tuesday, with my State of
the Union, I talked about this.

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:56.734
We've got to make sure that
economy

00:00:56.734 --> 00:00:58.667
is growing and creating jobs.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:00.633
We've got to make sure folks
have the skills

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:02.734
to get those jobs.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:05.700
But we also got to make
sure the work pays.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.133
And the minimum wage in this
country has not gone

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.600
up in a very long time.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.800
It's actually worth about 20
percent less than when

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.000
Ronald Regan came into
office back in 1980.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.633
And I think the one thing
Americans agree on is that

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:27.433
if you work full time
in this country,

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:30.000
you should not be in poverty
when you're

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.567
raising your families.

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:36.233
So, here's what
I've done myself,

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:38.066
through executive action.

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:41.734
I intend to make sure that
anybody who is doing federal

00:01:41.734 --> 00:01:43.900
business -- anybody who is
a federal contractor --

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.633
that they're federally-funded
employees --

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:53.300
are governed by a minimum wage: $10.10 an hour.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.266
Beyond that, I'm working to
encourage states, governors,

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:02.900
mayors, state legislators to
raise their own minimum wage.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.467
And since I made this call for a
higher minimum wage a year ago,

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:08.000
you've seen already five states
that have

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.400
increased their minimum wage.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.300
A number of cities have moved
forward on a living-wage

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.667
initiative of the sort that
you're talking about in your

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:20.433
hometown in your home state.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.800
So, I'm going to continue to
try to support those coalitions

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.333
saying it's the
right thing to do.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.266
Obviously, the way to reach
millions of people would be for

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:33.900
Congress to pass a new
federal minimum wage law.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.500
And so far, at least, we
have not seen support from

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.433
republicans in Congress
for such a move.

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:45.967
But I'm hoping that, as we keep
on making the arguments out

00:02:45.967 --> 00:02:49.133
there, they come to recognize
that it's the right thing to do.

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:55.133
The day after the State of the
Union address, I visited Costco,

00:02:55.133 --> 00:03:00.567
a company that is hugely
profitable, does huge business,

00:03:00.567 --> 00:03:02.967
is a favorite of
the stock market,

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:07.600
but their starting salary for
entry-level cashier

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.567
is $11.50 an hour.

00:03:11.567 --> 00:03:14.667
The fact that they're paying
their employees a decent wage

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:19.567
and benefits, that's not
detracting from their

00:03:19.567 --> 00:03:20.800
good business practices.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.433
In fact, employees -- they
don't turn over as much because

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.633
they're getting paid well and
being treated well

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:29.734
and with respect; they're more
productive; they're not

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:32.567
as stressed; they don't have
problems because they can't get

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.633
their car fixed and get to work on time.

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:39.266
And so, they, I think, point
in the direction of where all

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.400
businesses need to go.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.100
And I'm also talking to
companies, encouraging them,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.300
"Do it on your own.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.934
Raise wages for your workers.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.867
You'll have better workers,
more productive workers.

00:03:50.867 --> 00:03:54.266
You'll have workers
who are loyal to you.

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.133
And ultimately, that will
be good for your business.

00:03:56.133 --> 00:03:57.400
And it will be good
for all businesses,

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.233
because if folks have a little
more money in their pockets,

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:03.767
that means they got more money to spend everywhere."
