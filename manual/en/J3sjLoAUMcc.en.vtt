00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.220
My name is Brandin Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village and today I?m going to show you how

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.559
to make rye bread. So this is that fun part
where you turn your oven up to 400 degrees.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:18.560
And while your oven is preheating were going
to dough up the bread, excuse me , pan up

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.050
the dough and give it about 20 minutes to
set out and expand. Were going to set it on

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.039
top of the oven so the heat from the oven
helps it expand and then were going to toss

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.519
it in the oven and finish it. So lets get
to panning stuff up. I'm going to show you

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.989
tow different ways to do this. I have my loaf
pan and my sheet pan in the background. First

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.590
since these are nonstick pans, you don?t really
have to spray them or oil them but I?m going

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.440
to take just a little bit of this non stick
cooking spray to make it easier on myself.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.520
There we go. Now I?m going to take my loaf
this side will become the bottom as its not

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.809
nearly as pretty as the top and it wont matter
once it bakes anyway. We?re going to put it

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:19.150
in our pan and smash it down and make sure
its even and it most surely is and that is

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.860
all you have to do to pan up[ a loaf of bread.
So what were going to do now is move this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.400
one out and do the ball. That?s pretty much
all you do with that one is set it on there.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.960
Now you can also get fancy and take a knife.
You don?t want to cut thru it just cut into

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:50.990
it. There we go now when this cooks it going
to bust open and leave that nice bakery look.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:59.070
So what we will do now is let this set here,
depending on how things go about 10 minutes

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.960
about half an hour. I'm going to let it go
about 15 minutes myself it just depends on

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.800
temperature and humidity. You can cover these
with a towel if you want to keep them nice

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.350
and moist on the outside, but is you want
a nice crispy crust on the outside leave them

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.950
at room temperature. I'm actually going to
put a towel over the loaf but not the rustic

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.920
ball. Alright lets have a look at our dough.
You can see that this one is split open nicely

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:41.700
across the top it has a nice like little pattern
breaking open effect and the loaf as you can

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.460
see has pretty much doubled in size. both
of them look like they are ready for the oven

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.880
so let's put them in there at 400 degrees
for 20 to 25 minutes and they should be ready

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.320
to go.
