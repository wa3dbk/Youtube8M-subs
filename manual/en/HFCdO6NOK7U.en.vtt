00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.764
(cheerful music)

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:06.475
- Hi, friends!
- [Justin] Hey, everyone!

00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:08.297
- Thank you so much for
tuning in to Cook with April.

00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:09.472
Today I'm gonna show you guys

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.077
how to make strawberry ice cream.

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:13.271
I got the recipe from the BlendTec recipe.

00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:14.307
(laughing)

00:00:14.307 --> 00:00:15.243
- Liam just grabbed it.

00:00:15.243 --> 00:00:16.373
- Liam wants to try it.

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:18.538
So stay tuned, you guys,
this is really easy!

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:20.199
- [Voiceover] Let's get started by placing

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.136
heavy cream in a blender.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:25.785
The next ingredient
will be condensed milk.

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.011
Lemon juice.

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.239
Frozen strawberries.

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.055
You're gonna cover and put it to

00:00:40.055 --> 00:00:41.760
the ice cream setting on your blender,

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.885
and if you don't have that,

00:00:42.885 --> 00:00:44.801
you're just gonna go ahead and pulse.

00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:51.559
So as you can see, it
doesn't look like ice cream.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.779
It looks like soft-serve.

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:54.999
So I put it in a container and I froze it

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.479
for overnight, and then it was

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.212
a really good ice cream consistency.

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:01.077
And I took some scoops out,

00:01:01.077 --> 00:01:02.494
and you are ready to enjoy!

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:03.778
It was really easy.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.415
- Okay, taste-tester Justin!

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:08.142
- Let's do this.

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:10.140
Ooh, it has very nice consistency.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.831
- Yeah, right?

00:01:10.831 --> 00:01:12.206
- Right as I stuck my spoon in it.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:13.791
- Yeah, I had to freeze it overnight

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:15.620
for that consistency, 'cause it came out

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.509
as like, soft-serve and I
didn't like it like that.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.708
(Liam fusses)

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:20.069
- This is so interesting. It tastes like

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:22.843
a combo between, like soft-serve,

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.628
gelato, and like regular ice cream.

00:01:24.628 --> 00:01:25.806
It's really interesting.
- [April] Yeah, it's--

00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:26.892
to me, it kinda tastes more

00:01:26.892 --> 00:01:28.427
like a sorbet.
- [Justin] This is good!

00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:30.303
- Yes, exactly! That's actually
what it tastes like, yeah.

00:01:30.303 --> 00:01:32.338
- 'Cause it tastes more
strawberry than cream,

00:01:32.338 --> 00:01:35.530
and it could be sweeter in my opinion, but

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.237
1/2 a cup of condensed milk...
- [Justin] You know what?

00:01:37.237 --> 00:01:38.767
Liam, I think you get to try some.

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:40.864
- Oh, okay! Well let Liam hold the spoon

00:01:40.864 --> 00:01:42.316
'cause he's practicing here.

00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:43.576
Hold your spoon, big boy.

00:01:45.496 --> 00:01:46.725
- Mmm!

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:48.350
- Good job!

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.441
What do you think?

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:50.123
- What do you think?

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:51.083
Whoa! He dropped the spoon.

00:01:51.083 --> 00:01:51.846
(laughs)

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:52.900
- Mmm.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.923
- What do you think? Man,
this is really good, honey.

00:01:55.923 --> 00:01:57.065
Really, really good, and I love the--

00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:58.356
the strawberry--
- [April] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:01:58.356 --> 00:01:59.239
He's trying to get more!

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.596
- The strawberry for placement.

00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:01.644
- Yeah, for sure!

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:02.486
- Mm!

00:02:02.486 --> 00:02:03.974
- You want more?

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:05.443
(squeals)

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.855
Here baby test-tester, are you ready?

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:13.232
(laughing)

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:15.507
- Good job!

00:02:15.507 --> 00:02:18.038
- You're the best taste-tester ever!

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:21.244
What do you think, more?

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:26.114
Thank you guys so much for watching!
