00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.470
Will the Milan clubs finish outside of the
European places this season?

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.339
Madonnina look away now, the Milan teams continue
to struggle. Gazzetta claimed the music emanating

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:17.640
from the scala del calcio sounds like that
played on the decks of the Titantic. Milan

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:27.619
lost to Genoa a revelation this season, unbeaten
in 9, and the only team to defeat the champions

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.949
Juventus, it’s their best start since 1930,
they’re up into 3rd with Gasperini claiming

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.579
this team is better than the one that included
Diego Milito and Thiago Motta, which narrowly

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.370
missed out on the CL 5 years ago. Inter, without
a win in Serie A since later October, took

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.219
the lead against Udinese but then collapsed
before their former manager Andrea Stramaccioni

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:57.840
and legend, his assistant Deki Stankovic.
Both are outside the European places as it

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.670
stands, will both miss out again?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.510
It was the weekend of the comeback in Serie
A, Roma went 2-0 down to Simone Zaza’s Sassuolo

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.900
and had Daniele De Rossi sent off but with
a little help from the referee and the in-form

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:23.830
Adem Ljajic drew 2-2. Napoli did the same
against Empoli, though they should have been

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.210
four behind before Duvan Zapata and Jonathan
de Guzman came to the rescue, but the pick

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.870
of the bunch was Atalanta, 2-0 down to Cesena
and forced to deny reports that their president

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.280
was in the dressing room at HT threatening
to sack Stefano Colantuono, they came back

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.780
to win 3-2. I should also mention that Lazio
overturned a 1-0 deficit to win 2-1 in Parma

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.790
who have been taken over by Russian-Cypriot
oil money.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.920
Once again I could have gone for Palermo’s
Paulo Dybala as my Man of the Weekend after

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.420
his 5th goal in 5 games this time against
Torino and one reminiscent of Robbie Fowler’s

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.630
against Brann Bergen. Instead I’m going
for a No.10 called Diego, Genoa’s Diego

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.220
Perotti who was sensational against Milan.
His father used to play with Maradona at Boca,

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.250
a club formed by Genovese immigrants and Perotti
sure played as though touched by the hand

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.890
of god.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.201
Big week for the Italian clubs in the Champions
League. A win against a Sergio Aguero and

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:35.280
Yaya Toure-less Manchester City will see Roma
qualify for the knock out stages of the CL,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.920
a 0-0 will also be enough if CSKA don’t
win against Bayern Munich. Juventus can win

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.310
their group if they beat Atletico Madrid by
2 clear goals, A draw will also be enough

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.250
for a place in the last 16. Both then take
on the in-form Genovese clubs, Roma go to

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.350
Genoa, Juventus host Samp who are one of the
few teams to have won at the JS, they should

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:20.610
tee up the big Sunday night game between Milan
and Napoli rather nicely.
