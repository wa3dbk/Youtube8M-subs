00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.970
Mike Deese presents My Advertising Pays as
an effective way to get traffic to your website

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.500
and start building your online business but
what you find after you sign up for the product

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.100
and if you really get into it, is you'll find
a waste of your money, a waste of your time

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.170
and you'll have nothing to show for it in
the end.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.650
We're going to talk about all of the reasons
why in today's review of My Advertising Pays

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:37.190
from NoMoreBSReviews.com.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.550
This video review has been edited for the
sake of brevity.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.460
But if at any point during this video you'd
like to read the full, unedited review complete

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.829
with screen shots, you can click the logo
in the bottom right hand corner of this video

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.700
and you'd be taken to the full review that
you can skim through at your own pace.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.800
The biggest flaw with My Advertising Pays
is just the type of system it is.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.880
My Advertising Pays is a traffic exchange
system.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.859
Traffic exchange systems produce really low
quality, unqualified, untargeted traffic to

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:18.670
your website when you need as a business owner
whether you're running a local business or

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.920
an affiliate marketing business or you're
running a website that sells products through

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.369
e-commerce, you need highly qualified, targeted
traffic from within your traffic audience

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.509
because that's the only kind of traffic that
converts.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.999
So what you're actually getting with My Advertising
Pays is the opposite of that.

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:42.369
It's not just My Advertising Pays, it's any
traffic exchange program because this is how

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:43.479
they work.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.799
You have a whole bunch of people sitting on
their computers at home and they're just clicking

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.899
from one's website to the next to the next
just like you would if you were trying to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.020
earn credits with the traffic exchange program.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.020
You would click on the site, stay on it for
a few seconds, click to another site, stay

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.849
on it for a few seconds because you're just
trying to build as many credits as possible.

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.399
Every site you click on is another credit.

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.600
You're not really interested in what you're
looking at.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.370
You don't really care what the website is
selling.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.780
It's not a good opportunity for that website
owner to reach you, someone that they don't

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.660
even know what your buying demographics are,
what your triggers are, what you're looking

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.660
for.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.650
You're just on their website to earn a credit
so that's someone who click through to your

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.659
site.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.530
Once you do earn the credits and people are
coming through to your site, you're getting

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.060
the exact same untargeted, unqualified traffic
that couldn't care less about your product

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.720
I'd say 90 to 95% of the time, if not more,
because all they're doing is clicking through

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.709
from one website to the next, to the next
to try and get as many credits as possible

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.310
so that they can get the same unqualified,
untargeted traffic to their website and not

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.099
make any conversions.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.900
Another way that My Advertising Pays seeks
to make money off of their customers is by

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.360
selling what they call credit packs.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:10.220
The lowest expense, the lowest cost one is
$49.99, so let's just call it $50, and you

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:18.060
will receive 550 clicks on your text ads that
you post within the members' area for your

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.060
$50.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.480
Again, let's just step back and think about
why people are on My Advertising Pays clicking

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.689
all of these text ads.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.930
My Advertising Pays promises to give them
profit share so they pay people to click a

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.190
high volume of ads.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.519
The more ads they click, the more websites
they visit, the more profit share that they're

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:39.999
going to receive.

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:44.920
Again, if we get the mentality of the people
that are on My Advertising Pays, they just

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.930
want to get paid.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.870
They're just making a few cents per hour,
probably, clicking around on all these websites

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.359
and they're clicking to yours because you
paid $50 for a credit pack to post an ad on

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.040
My Advertising Pays.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.650
They click through that ad, they stay for
a few seconds, they go away, they disappear

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.849
into the night.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:08.470
It's not qualified, targeted traffic which
is what your website needs to make money.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.779
The third and final reason that I strongly
caution you to not get involved with My Advertising

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:19.269
Pays is if you decided, you saw this review
and say, okay, I want to try it anyway, you

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.639
go and sign-up, you spend all of these money,
all of these effort and you have nothing to

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.620
show for in the end, you might as well have
set all of your energy and all of your money

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.190
on fire.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.040
There is no refund.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.270
There is a no refund policy within My Advertising
Pays.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.030
If you sign up and you find out that it's
not effective at all like Iï¿½m talking about

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:45.360
because you're getting unqualified, untargeted
traffic to your website, then there's nothing

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.319
you can do about it except to walk away and
try something else and keep on heading down

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.259
the road because you're not going to get any
money back that you've put in to My Advertising

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.919
Pays or Mike Deese.

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.460
That and the other reasons that I've discussed
within this product review are why I absolutely

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.990
cannot recommend My Advertising Pays by Mike
Deese.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.379
It's just not going to give you the results
that it promises when you sign up for it,

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.639
when you're on the homepage filled with all
kinds of spammy, junky advertisements that's

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.930
cluttered and overwhelming, I mean that should
be your first sign.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.220
If that's the kind of quality product you're
going to be signing up for, you're going to

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.780
get low quality traffic, unqualified traffic
and you're just not going to be able to convert

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.780
it int money for your business.

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.139
That's why I absolutely can't review this
product positively.

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:35.430
That's it for today's review.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.310
I hope you found that helpful.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:42.050
