00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.583
I'm going to tell you immediately:
this is already my favorite car of 2011!

00:00:19.584 --> 00:00:24.924
As you've probably noticed,
I'm driving a Mercedes C63 today.

00:00:27.281 --> 00:00:33.416
Carlsson decided to update the Mercedes a little bit, 
and it looks like they put a lot of effort in it!

00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:40.203
They not only changed the wheels and gave it another body kit,
they actually did the most of the work on the engine!

00:00:40.204 --> 00:00:43.738
Sasha already drove the Carlsson CK63 some time ago..

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:51.827
I obviously don't like to do this at all...

00:00:51.962 --> 00:00:53.102
But I've no choice, I must do it!

00:00:56.522 --> 00:01:06.328
Unfortunately, I have to take it a little bit calmer today.
But we can still take a small taste of the ultimate C63 on the streets:

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:09.121
The CK63 RS

00:01:28.707 --> 00:01:30.259
So, what did they do?

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.291
Well, as you can see this C63 has a thicker hood.
Actually, a much thicker hood!

00:01:34.292 --> 00:01:41.703
And it's not just for fun, the C63 actually needs 
the extra space for a bigger air intake system.

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:47.998
The extra space is also the difference between the 
regular AMG's from Mercedes and the SLS AMG.

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:53.388
Mercedes had, because of the huge space in front of the SLS,
the opportuniy to optimize the air intake system in detail.

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:59.023
And Carlsson thought: if Mercedes is able to do that in a SLS,
then we must be able to do it in a C class.

00:01:59.024 --> 00:02:05.994
So they developed a similar air intake system,
and the result is unbelievable!

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:11.283
636 HP, so it won't suprise you that this car goes like a bullit!

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:19.468
The regular C63 is already overpowered, and the wheels are
not at all able to put all the power on the streets.

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:26.396
But, this is the superlative degree!
Almost 200 HP extra, how much crazier do you want it to be?

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.515
And it's performance?
Well, bizarre for a car like this!

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.666
Really, this is supercar terratory!

00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:39.691
It goes from 0-60 mph in 3,6 seconds and
it's topspeed is way over 300 km/h (188 mph)!

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:44.280
The incredible acceleration, which is available 
at every speed is simply astonishing!

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.766
This is without doubt my favorite car of 2011!

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.226
And that while I only had the opportunity 
to drive this car for a very short time..
