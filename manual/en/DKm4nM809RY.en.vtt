00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:09.410
On behalf of expertvillage.com, I'm Tom Flowers
of Well Tempered Piano Tuning here to tell

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.910
you about how to clean up the tuning on your
own piano. We're now going to the treble section,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.860
the upper part of the piano. Also three strings
per note. That is to say three strings are

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.590
tuned to the same pitch to produce the sound.
This happens to be a G. So as I walk through

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:39.300
going up by half steps, here we have a distinct
warble in the note. We take our mute. Set

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:47.679
it against one the, either the left or right
string and we have the left string muted out

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:52.899
and we hear a pretty good warble in the right
string. So we're going to put our tuning hammer

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:06.790
on the corresponding pin until the sound equalizes
and there we are. Now we're going to listen

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.490
to the other string against the middle and
it's even worse. So we're going to pull it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:23.810
up. Again, we're pulling towards us to pull
the pitch higher and there we have another

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:36.770
warble in the strings. It happens to be in
the left string

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.549
and there we've equalized it. So any note
that does not sound good to your ear can be

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:50.750
examined by isolating strings with a mute
and listening to notes against each other,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.359
for instance two A's against each other to
make sure it's in tune. Then checking that

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.180
each of the three strings is in tune with
itself.
