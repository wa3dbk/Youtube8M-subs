00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:02.786
Marty?!

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:04.435
I thought you were going somewhere! 

00:00:04.435 --> 00:00:05.991
Why are you still here?!

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:08.615
He's taken my U.F.O! 

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:11.625
He'll be light years away by now! 

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.002
He's sitting in MY seat,

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:16.602
Eating MY Fizzy Twingles! 

00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.644
Wearing MY lucky driving gloves!

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.996
[pressure cooker whistling] "Eeieeeieeeieeeee!"

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:25.658
I'M GOING TO PULL HIS STUPID CLACKERS OFF!

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:26.262
MELT HIM DOWN!

00:00:26.262 --> 00:00:27.980
AND THROW HIM IN THE BIN!!!

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.954
"Honk, honk, honk! Honk, honk!"

00:00:29.954 --> 00:00:31.347
Nonsense Marty! 

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:32.856
He's hooting outside!

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:36.711
All ready for you, Sir!

00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:38.150
Your keys?

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.472
Shall I pack sandwiches?

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:43.561
Apologise Marty!

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.465
...Marty?

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:46.811
"SLAM!"

00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:48.646
What's HIS problem?!

00:00:48.646 --> 00:00:49.435
Sorry Knobby!

00:00:49.435 --> 00:00:51.734
I dont know WHAT'S got into Marty today!

00:00:51.734 --> 00:00:53.406
What can i get you?

00:00:53.406 --> 00:00:54.892
There must be something!

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:56.099
Space Pops

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:57.144
and Moon Juice?

00:00:57.144 --> 00:01:00.116
And a froca-mocha-choco-chapacino?

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:00.860
Oh, flippers! 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.555
You still haven't had your breakfast!

00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:03.344
I'm so sorry,

00:01:03.344 --> 00:01:04.862
I'll get it for you straight away! 

00:01:04.862 --> 00:01:05.875
Don't MOVE!

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.858
(MARTY!!!)

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:09.608
(WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG WITH YOU?!!)

00:01:09.608 --> 00:01:11.843
(CLEAN UP THIS MESS IMMEDIATELY!)

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:13.839
(HOW DARE YOU UPSET KNOBBY!) 

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:16.579
(COME AND SAY YOU'RE SORRY... RIGHT NOW!)

00:01:17.044 --> 00:01:18.182
I do LOVE

00:01:18.182 --> 00:01:20.039
a happy ending!

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.013
[Low humming sound of U.F.O.]

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:24.219
They're going to LOVE me on Earth! 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.796
They'll recognise GENIUS when it lands!

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:28.104
Bongos!

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:29.513
Everything looks the same!

00:01:29.513 --> 00:01:31.022
Which way do we go NOW?!

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.555
Wake up Knobby! [smack!] 

00:01:31.022 --> 00:01:32.555
Wake up Knobby! [smack!] 

00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:33.321
Do we turn left,

00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.436
or right to get to Earth?!

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:35.689
We go straight on.

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:36.850
How would you know?!

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.174
Your eyes aren't even open!

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:39.753
Small technical glitch...

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:41.800
I couldn't be bothered to fix the steering.

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:42.930
Oh, great!

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:44.470
So I can only fly in a straight line,

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:45.720
How boring!

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:46.440
Don't worry! 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.480
Things should get more exciting when we hit Earth!

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:51.080
I couldn't be bothered to fix the brakes either.

00:01:51.084 --> 00:01:52.660
Aaaaaaaargh! 

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:55.400
We're going to have a terrible cartoon accident!

00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:56.820
Ah, you'll be fine Marty,

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.560
Just try and aim for a blue bit. 

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.160
Anyway, 

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.420
I've just got to make a quick phonecall.

00:02:02.416 --> 00:02:05.360
[zoo-woo-woop! zoo-woo-woop!]

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:06.180
[beep]

00:02:06.758 --> 00:02:07.800
Knobby?

00:02:08.197 --> 00:02:09.500
Knobby...?

00:02:09.498 --> 00:02:12.310
KNOBBY!!!!!!!!!

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:44.120
[Happy Latin American music]

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.880
[END]
