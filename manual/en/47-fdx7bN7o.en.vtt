00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.190
Waiting for the coming of spring, in her eyes

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.150
Cherry blossoms were dancing as they fell

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.850
Slipping through her hands and chasing after the wind

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.920
Disappearing across the sky

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.950
Her loss of her future is carved deep within this tree

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:02.660
Setting it aflower, turning the world to spring as she waited for death

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.940
The released flower petals dance strongly as they wind

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.970
Knowing her loss, expiring, forgetting even regret

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.950
Tracing lines and motions in the end they show fragments of memories

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:32.660
As they disappear portraying a faint happiness left within them

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:46.150
She laid to rest and many years passed her by

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.830
Under this tree that no longer would blossom

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.690
When you suddenly appeared, in those eyes

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.800
Shone a gate leading unto spring

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.940
In that strong gaze, I think of you locked away

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.960
Carefully gathering fragments one by one to bring spring to you

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.920
Those lost memories in that moment my heart was swept away

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.910
Boiled up inside of me and in that moment I was entranced, overflowing with tears

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.900
Ever since that day I swore I would save you I gathered spring

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:48.510
I took back fate, calling you in your eternal sleep

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.890
Now sky has started to blossom in profusion, cherry blossom dancing like butterflies

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.450
I cannot stop these tears from overflowing, or myself from trembling

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.200
An instant I cried out I felt faintly, something and then

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.960
You disappeared again right away

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.870
The released flower petals dance strongly as they wind

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.900
And as I am gently embraced I overflow with smiles

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.020
The feeling I felt that day when I touched you will never go away

00:03:48.020 --> 00:04:00.810
Though I will never see you, I wait for you in full bloom
