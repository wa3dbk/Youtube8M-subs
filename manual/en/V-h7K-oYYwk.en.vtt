00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.020
For the next in our series of videos

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.450
we are now going to look at the Cromwell cruiser tank.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.600
The Cromwell cruiser was in service from 1942 to 1952.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.190
It had a crew of 5

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.190
an armor of 76 millimeters,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.560
which is actually quite good for a cruiser tank of that particular period,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.470
and also weighed about 27 and a half tons.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.370
The Cormwell cruiser was used predominantly

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.620
by seven armor brigade more famously known

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.730
or referred to of course, as the desert rats

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.540
At that particular time the rest of the British armor brigade,

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.540
were then adopting the American shermans.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.540
From the front profile of the Cromwell

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.090
you can see actually how small this vehicle is.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.420
Above me you can see very clearly

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.610
the main armament

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.610
and also just to the left of me there

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.870
you can see the first of our two 7.92mm machine guns.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.200
The first one mounted here

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
and the second one just mounted to the right of the main armament,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.530
Also another thing that’s very obvious when you have a look at the Cromwell

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.010
is the size of the hatches

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.360
certainly when we go inside there

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.670
you will have a much clearer example of how tiny it is

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.780
when comparing that 5 people actually manned this particular tank.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.010
The drivers compartment

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.390
is located just behind me there,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.620
and you can see quite clearly to the left and the right

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.980
there are also episcopes.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.030
Ok so now were on top of the Cromwell

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.590
first of all I want you to get an impression

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.020
of how small the actual complete size of it is.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.130
It's absolutely tiny compared to a lot of tanks that you’ll see.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.210
If you look at the front of the turret

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.400
you can see quite clearly on the left and the right there

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
there are two episcopes or periscopes

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.790
that the crew could actually see out of very badly

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.440
when they were inside and closed down.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.520
Another thing I want you to get an appreciation for

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.250
is again the size of the hatches that you find on the Cromwell

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.330
obviously like most tanks we’ve got the loaders hatch and also the commanders hatch.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.730
But if I open one of these hatches

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.050
you can see that the space is absolutely tiny.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.400
On either side of the episcopes or periscopes

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.080
we can see its got a very very very simple

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.010
means of extracting the fumes when the gun fires.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.760
Obviously a lot of the fumes that fire 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.080
when the main armament goes off are toxic to the crew.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.530
Moving across then to the back decks of the Cromwell

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.110
very very sleek the actual design of the cromwell

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.830
you can see there’s not a lot of rubbish

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.830
located on the back decks of here.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.830
The transmission compartment and the engine

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.700
was a V12 27 liter developing 600 horse power

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.030
and it was actually a modified version

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.030
of the same engine you find in the Spitfire

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030
the modified Merlin engine.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.340
The suspension on the Cromwell is very straight forward,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.600
as you can see quite clearly, Christie suspension,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.600
obviously with no top rollers,

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
and also 5 sets of road wheels,

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.970
located on each side.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.620
Each one of these road wheels

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.890
is secured by the means of a locking nut.

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.490
To the rear of the Cromwell,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.610
then of course you’ve got the sprocket wheel.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.820
Here we are now inside the turret of the Cromwell.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.120
As you can see not a lot of room as well in here.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.640
A few things major things to point out.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.270
Firstly we can see, in a really nice condition

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.410
the original radio set.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.640
This was the wireless set number 19.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.060
Underneath there, the storage container

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.750
which contained the periscopes or the prisms.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.740
If we move across,

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.890
you can see there are numerous storage compartments

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.130
which contained ammunition

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.260
one to my front right and also im sat on one at the moment.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.990
The breach mechanism opening device, located just here.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.860
and also the breach itself.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.180
Just to the left of the breach there

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.220
you can see the stock or the butt of the machine gun.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.700
you’ve got a brow pad for the sight located directly underneath it.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.360
just to the left of that you can see one of the episcopes or periscopes

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.090
and directly beneath that you can see the traverse gearbox.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.090
Some of the controls,

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.180
the handle down at the bottom there,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.080
is a very simplified version as if to give you left or right traverse

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.570
and just to the right of that there is a very obvious elevation hand wheel.
