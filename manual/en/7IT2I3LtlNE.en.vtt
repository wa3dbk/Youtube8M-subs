00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:06.450
So Neil’s got a sample of sodium. Sodium
is a very reactive metal, it is stored under

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.421
an oil to stop air or moisture getting on
it - stop it oxidising, stop it reacting - and

00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:15.509
as you can see it is a very soft metal, so
he is going to put his knife in and withdraw

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.210
the lump of sodium, so there is about 2 kilos
of sodium here, it's a really quite large

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.320
rod. So we are going to cut a small sample
of the sodium and we are going to see if we

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.900
can explore some of its chemistry.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.940
Sodium is again a light metal, rather like
lithium and it has a, a melting point about

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.190
96 degrees.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.139
So the sodium is a very, very shiny metal
and as you can see as Neil cuts some off,

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:48.010
you can see the quite nice shiny material.
It’s really quite beautiful. Reacts very,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.969
very quickly with air and also with water,
you form the oxide layer which is the white,

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.119
or the hydroxide is the white crust on the
outside.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:05.560
And many of you will know that if you drop
sodium into water it reacts almost explosively.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.680
So we are going to go outside now, go get
some even bigger reactions, with the alkali

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.700
metals. This is a dog bowl which is stoneware,
it is very hard, not likely to break, unless

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.500
I drop it on my toes.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.899
This is sodium, the metal that we cut a minute
ago and you can see there is quite a substantial

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.859
amount of the sodium, and we are going to
pop it into the water and see what we can

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:32.530
do with the reaction. Ok? So here we have
a bowl full of water and maybe, oh, a gram

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.179
of sodium? So let’s see what happens, see
what this reaction’s like. So it is reacting

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.429
really, really quite quickly and really violently
with the water, and you can see it is fizzing

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:49.499
around and it is generating lots and lots
of hydrogen gas. And see now the heat from

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:54.110
the reaction is burning away all of that hydrogen
which is generating and you can see the orange

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.170
sodium flame.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.909
That was um?

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.649
That was good

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:09.619
That is a bit of, a chunk of molten sodium
has come out of there mate.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.170
So, let’s burn that.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.110
Oh, it’s on your camera.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.659
Oh it is too!

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:21.900
Sodium chloride is transparent through infrared
light and so here we have got a sheet of sodium

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.170
chloride that has been stuck on to a glass
vessel so that you can have infrared light

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.870
going through it. Now this is a broken one,
which my students have broken.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.430
Is that bit, have you got a, we need a needle
Neil, or a pair of tweezers.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.180
So you can see here that these windows have
been broken but you can see an interesting

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.349
aspect of sodium chloride that when it breaks
it forms cracks that form at right angles.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.040
Why is that?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.350
This is related to the structure of the atoms
inside the crystal which are arranged in a

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.500
sort of cubic arrangement. I have also got
quite a nice crystal of sodium chloride over

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.409
here which I don’t know if you can see has
been turned into a table lamp. And if you

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:18.239
switch it on it lights up. So this is just
a mass of natural sodium chloride from under

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.390
the ground somewhere, probably in Cheshire
or somewhere else like this where they have

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.269
large underground salt mines, deposits.

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.879
Ok so we have got another lump of sodium,
and you can see it’s really nice and shiny.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.000
Ok? So we are going to pop that into that
big bucket of water. See what the chemical

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:44.750
reaction is, ok? So here we go! So you can
see again, see the orange sodium spectrum

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.670
as the sodium is getting excited as the hydrogen
is burning all that heat. Whoa! Exciting!

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:58.469
That is brilliant.

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:10.220
That is much better.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.730
So sodium and water, excellent reaction.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.820
That was great.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.100
I like sodium, because its symbol Na was the
nickname that my mother whose name was Ena

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.560
used to use when she was a child, she was
known as Na, so whenever I see sodium in the

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.410
formula, I sort of feel a sort of warm motherly
feeling from this.
