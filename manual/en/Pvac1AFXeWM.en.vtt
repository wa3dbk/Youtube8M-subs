00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.000
DDR4 is the latest evolutionary step forward for synchronous DRAM – 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the memory technology that you’ll find in most of the electronic devices you own

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.880
like your desktop or notebook computer or game console, 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.000
and even some very important ones you don’t own like the servers that power websites 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.580
and services like Facebook or Dropbox.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.000
Physically a DDR4 module probably won’t look that special to you...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
However, there are some subtle differences. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
DDR4 RAM is not backwards compatible with DDR3 motherboards and vice versa,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.079
so the notch has been moved to prevent accidental insertion of the wrong type of memory.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.000
Now instead of 240 pins, each module features 288 pins.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.739
And finally to improve strength and electrical contact there’s a slight curve in the shape of the bottom of the PCB.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.000
So nothing ground breaking... No, it’s what’s UNDER the hood that’s interesting. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.510
So what does this new fourth generation DDR bring that the previous one – DDR3 – didn’t?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.329
Actually more than you’d think.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.000
First up is improved SPEED.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Thanks for that.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.950
DDR4 STARTS at 2133MHz – which would be fairly high end for DDR3 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.940
and has planned speed increases that could take it well beyond 3200MHz!

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.000
and this is while requiring only 1.2V per module.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Which leads to benefit number two – power savings.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
DDR4 is more efficient that DDR3, consuming up to 40% less power.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This is something that might not seem like a big deal in your desktop PC,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but let’s talk next time your notebook shuts down due to low battery when you were 4 seconds from submitting that homework assignment!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
When it comes to mobile devices, every little bit counts!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Speaking of bits – memory capacity is poised to go through the roof 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.260
due to DDR4’s support for higher density chips and stacking technologies that will allow for single memory modules

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.620
with capacities as high as 256 or even 512 gigabytes in the not-so-distant future!

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.000
But... pushing performance past existing boundaries into new territory would be for nothing if it wasn’t reliable...

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.129
and that’s where DDR4 actually makes some of its most significant improvements.

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.000
With improved cyclic redundancy checks, on-chip parity detection of “command and address” transfers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
as well as enhanced signal integrity, DDR4 is the most reliable DDR yet.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Which leads into Kingston’s HyperX Predator modules. Their performance is pre-optimized for you.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.469
Key in one setting to turn on the XMP profile and its off to the races.

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:35.000
They’re optimized for Intel’s latest X99 platform so they’re a perfect match for your new core i7 6 core or 8 core CPU

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.749
and finally they have HyperX’s signature tall heatsink inb lack

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.849
so they’ll complement any X99 motherboard perfectly.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.120
Thanks for watching this video about DDR4 technology. 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.220
