00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.420
[JOSE] Come on. Come on, little guy. Who is a good horse?

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.700
[RICARDO] Leave the native inhabitants alone, Jose.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.620
[JOSE] But guys, look! He's a rainbow horse! It's like a little girl's blacknick poster come to life!

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.700
[RICARDO] Don't you mean the poster in your room, when we were growing up?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.180
[JOSE] N-no!

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.520
[JOSE] As an ambossador of the Galactic Federation, I extend the Federation's friendship to your people.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:42.400
[JOSE] Uhm...

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.600
[PAVALO] Come on, Jose. Let's go.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.700
[JOSE] Sigh.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.240
[JOSE] Hey, what's up?

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.760
[RICARDO] Sambo, any readings from the structure?

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.980
[SAMBO] Readings?

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.620
[SAMBO] No. I've been playing Grab's Atari.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.500
[PAVALO] That's a crashed Engi ship.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.100
[JOSE] How long's it been down there?!

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.280
[PAVALO] I... don't know.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.220
[SAMBO] Don't worry. I think I got this.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.180
*Engi speech*

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.960
[ENGI] Fire spreading. Clash imminent. Ultempertarizing.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.260
*Engi speech*

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.940
[PAVALO] Easy there, you're alright.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900
[SAMBO] Yeah, you already crashed.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.180
[ENGI] CRA-ASHED?!

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.900
[ENGI] Apologies. My memory is unstable. Nanites will need time to recalibrate.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.420
[JOSE] Can you remember anything?

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.780
[ENGI] Fire. Clicking. Continious clicking.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.740
[ENGI] A Mantis attack on the ship.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.060
[ENGI] I was the last survivour.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.860
[ENGI] Engines disabled.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.140
[ENGI] Crashed here. Mantis borading party was also killed.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.840
[ENGI] Entered sleep mode to conserve energy.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.840
[ENGI] Proposal. I join your crew, and we leave this planet.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.500
[ENGI] My primary funcion used to be shield operation.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.740
[RICARDO] Heh. Well, let's get out of here, then.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.700
[PAVALO] I hope you don't mind letting Manon take the shield post. [Subtitle creator's note. Manon is the Engi.]

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.980
[SAMBO] No, not at all.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.380
[SAMBO] But if you're building a boarding party, I'm more than interested.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.280
[MANON] Your Majesty.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.300
[JOSE] Come on.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.700
[RICARDO] What was that?!

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.300
[MANON] Analysis. We jumpred into an asteroid field.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.460
[SAMBO] He says we're surrounded by rocks.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.160
[JOSE] Not just rocks! Rock men! Rock pirates!

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.940
[PAVALO] His weapons are charging faster than ours!

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.200
[JOSE] We got them! Now the asteroids will tear them apart!

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.720
[PAVALO] It's not over. Not while it still got a missle launcher.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.300
[JOSE] We're losing air all over the ship!

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.680
[PAALO] Ricardo! Get that O2 unit working!

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.220
[RICARDO] What am I even supposed to do here?!

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.640
[RICARDO] Oh yeah. We're gonna need more of these.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.180
*Mantis speech*
