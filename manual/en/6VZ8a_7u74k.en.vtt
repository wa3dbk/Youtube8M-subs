00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.939
yes we've come to the Pen-Y-Dre High
School in Merthyr Tydfil

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:07.640
and I'm keeping my voice down because we've
come here on mass but we've come here

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.300
in secret we're about to announce the
Student of the Year winner

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.019
for Wales for the Sky Sports Living for Sport
awards I need to tell you first what Sky

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.710
Sports Living for Sport is all about
it's a program that Sky Sports has been

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.910
heavily involved with, that has more than 1700
schools up and down the country in the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.949
UK and Ireland

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.920
trying to use sport to improve children's
confidence and their life skills if you

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:28.220
like

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.300
as part of that we've got five winners
one from each country of

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.170
the home nations who'll be announced as our Student of the Year and we're doing that

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.730
on mass and as a big surprise if I have
a quick look at all the camera that is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.980
also live in the classroom just behind
me

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.230
that is a normal sports theory lesson
going on those kids do not know we are

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.719
here

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.199
but look who they're about to meet. Oh, me.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.219
It's Thierry Henry, Thierry why are you dressed like that?

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.440
You know just to surprise obviously Emma but

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.559
there is one thing you
know what she went through

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.890
you know in her life and try to get her life back on track I can actually

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.030
wear a wig

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.510
and and some fake glasses. He is about
to go in there

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.970
and say that you're their supply teacher
for the rest of the day that's why you got stuff on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.570
and Emma Morgan's going to be our winner

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.299
why is she so special, what has she been through? Well she did struggle

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.360
for a little while you know especially
dropping something that she loves

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.939
 especially swimming

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.590
 and now back being a
straight A

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.210
student so she basically
lost her way

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.370
you know and not enjoying life she
wasn't enjoying life anymore and

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.800
through again sport,

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.040
swimming she got back into it
and getting again some

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.810
straight As and enjoying life that's one of the most important thing so

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.300
that's why we're here. Thierry this is gonna be a
special moment I'm gonna hang back

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:57.170
you go and do your thing in that
classroom good luck

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.710

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.450
I'm sorry to do this to you but you are live
on Sky Sports News HD right now

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.670
what did you think when he came in
wearing those glasses and that wig

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.370
I was shocked, I wasn't expecting it

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.370
you've seen a couple of cameras around the place but you
really didn't know this was gonna happen

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.270
did you? No

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.860
ok let's chat a little bit about what
you've been through with the Sky Sports Living for Sport

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.010
Living for Sport

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.709
program you lost a lot of confidence and
you were a straight-A student

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.860
and then it all went a bit wrong for you
and you got it back

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.530
with the help of Sky Sports Living for Sport
how was that how was the hard times for

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.800
you

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.820
I felt very isolated I didn't want to be
around anyone

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.920
I didn't want I didn't wanna know about
school I was interested in anything

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.550
anymore

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.360
I lost all confidence in everything including
sports I stopped everything

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.489
but then the Sky Sports Living for Sport

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.630
 initiative came to our school and it just
changed everything for me

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.360
I gained my confidence back and i became the best I could be

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.280
you're also I hear swimming again swimming
for Wales and you won a silver medal

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.620
recently as well is this right? Yeah last
year and I'm going again now to France this year

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.030
absolutely incredible let's have a chat with Thierry. Thierry, what do you make of what this

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.330
girl's been through because

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.240
you know about the pressure that you can
face when you're doing an awful lot of things

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.020
and and I'm working very hard at sport, she's come through all of that and is bigger

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.350
and better for it 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.340
Well confidence is key in everything and
especially is always important when a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.330
kid can dream

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.660
but is something I want to say and I say
it all the time and people think that

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.800
sometimes it's because

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.130
I wanna be humble and stuff like that it's
not the case people was referring used

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.390
to

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.870
the word hero for us when we're actually
not heroes I only used to kick a ball

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.350
but in this type of situation like I always say, she's actually a hero.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.350
you know, going through stuff that you
have to deal with in life and

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.130
and make sure that she was going to
put herself in the position again where

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.640
she could

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.360
enjoy life again so that's the type of a moment where

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.260
you can use the word hero,and obviously the people that do fight for their

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.760
country

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.880
but that's what I will say. While

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.720
we drag your mum and dad in here, are they coming? Where's Phil and Paula?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.690
There they are at the back there we're gonna show some
pictures of you swimming cus we've got some

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.720
pictures of you swimming in action very
recently

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.990
and let's drag your mum and dad up here come on Phil and Paula, let's get you up here

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:49.990
 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.840
look I shouldn't be standing there, you
stand next to your daughter because

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.130
listen you've been there for her every step of the way how proud are you today 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:00.050
Thierry Henry

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.310
our Sky ambassador has made this journey all this way

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.460
to announce how special your daughter is
well we can't really believe it to be honest

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.620
we thought we didn't know what we were coming here for today

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.140
we're so proud of you

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.800
um I'm a little speechless

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.850
but she's worked so hard after having

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.050
a real dip a few years back to get
life on track

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.740
her sport back on track we can't wait for her to go to France swimming again we hope she medals

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.380
again

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.090
we're right behind her and she's great she's done a fantastic job. Well I tell you what I've

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.980
never heard a classroom this quiet it's probably because we've got Thierry Henry here

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.660
Thierry when was the last time you were in a classroom?

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.740
I hear you met the head teacher today as
well? I think it's

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.720
you know I couldn't dream even of meeting a

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:53.130
headmaster and he was actually happy to
see me

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.470
you weren't in trouble today. I wasn't a guy that was

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.000
you know causing trouble at school but
definitely usually when you go to the

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.440
headmaster's office or when you meet him

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.940
he's not actually happy to see you so I
can actually claim that he was happy to

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.900
see me and that should prove when you work

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.020
pretty well you can have a headmaster being happy to see to see to

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:11.380
see

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.100
to see someone in his school. Let's have a final chat with Emma. Emma
