00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.510
I'm here today to talk about how to treat
ingrown toenails.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.961
So, one of the reasons how you get ingrown
toenails is basically the edge or the corner

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:26.500
of the nail cuts into the skin at the edge
or end of the toe.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.040
Usually, it happens on the big toe on the
sides.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.340
The two main reasons are: because of ill-fitting
shoes; they're too tight, pointy, or high-heels.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.550
That causes the toes to squeeze together and
the nail to curl into the skin.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.520
The other main reason is they're not cut properly
- you want to cut them so it's a straight

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.490
line all the way across the nail, because
otherwise if you cut them with the slant at

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.330
the corners then they can grow into the sides.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.850
There are some other rarer reasons.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.170
Sometimes if your nails has been ripped off
or peeled off, that can cause an ingrown toenail.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:12.250
Aging, or fungal nail infections can cause
the nail to become thicker and wider, and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.150
then it just pushes into the sides of the
skin.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:23.280
And also, some medical treatment such as:
. or Acitretin - used for psoriasis, acne

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280
- they can cause the nail to thicken and again
press into the sides of the skin.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.960
So, there's three different stages of ingrown
toenail.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.190
Stage one is basically when it just goes a
little bit red and a bit sore and swollen.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:44.350
And stage two is those symptoms get worse,
but also a little bit of watery, yellowy whitish

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.979
pus that comes out and maybe a bit more sore.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.650
And the stage three is very painful and there's
lots more pus but also particularly you get

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.140
extra tissue - soft tissue - growing around
the area of ingrown nail and that just makes

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.799
all the symptoms worse.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:10.409
The stages two and three can be associated
with bacterial infection and so might need

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.440
anti-biotic cream or tablets, depending on
the severity of the infection.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.060
So, to treat stage one you can actually do
that quite simply at home.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.469
Just need to soak your foot in warm, hot water
or in a bath.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:30.409
At least try in for about four times a day.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.639
And you need to wash your feet in soapy, hot
water twice a day.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.760
Whenever you do soak your feet, you need to
dry them properly and just take a small, small

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.180
amount of cotton or gauze, gently lift up
the edge of the toenail which is ingrown.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.370
That will be painful, but you do need to do
this, because then you'll just put the gauze

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.430
or the cotton into that bit and that will
let the nail grow out and prevent it from

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.599
growing in and digging in to the skin.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.680
So, you must do this every time you soak your
feet.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.840
So, about two to four times a day if you can.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.290
It will be painful, but it will be worth it
in the long-run because it will prevent it

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.280
from getting worse.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.180
Stage two is, you still do the above processors,
but also you might need a cream and anti-biotic

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.739
cream or anti-biotic tablet if there's an
infection.

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.559
And local anesthetic cream can help reduce
the pain as well.

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.730
You can get Lidocaine gel for that, which
is quite useful.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.829
Then stage three is when you get this extra
tissue growing and pus and infection.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.709
That's really - can be quite bad so you do
need surgery for that, where they put a bit

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.819
of local anesthetic.

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.749
So, by this time I'm hoping that you've gone
to your GP and that's for referral.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.469
And the doctor will then put a bit of local
anesthetic into the toe to numb it so you

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:53.469
won't feel anything.

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.930
And then what they do is, they cut the edge
of the nail that's affected and they kill

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.549
off the nail cells where the nail has been
to prevent recurrence.

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.459
They also get rid of that extra tissue that's
grown.

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.939
And they give you antibiotics as well to cover
the infection.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:14.900
So, to prevent ingrown toenails in the first
place you need to keep your feet clean and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.130
dry, cut them straight across when you're
cutting your nails.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.180
And don't wear narrow, ill-fitting shoes.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.620
So, I hope that's been useful in treating
in-grown toenails and thank you for listening.
