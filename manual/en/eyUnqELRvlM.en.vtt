00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.500
In this clip we're going to take a quick look
at some of the various clear coat finishes

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.610
that you can put on your stained wood piece.
Some of the different finishes you can use

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.860
are Shellac, this one happens to have an amber
hue to it. Just a clear Shellac, this is a

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.670
seal coat, but essentially does the same thing,
it is basically Shellac. And a Polyurethane,

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:36.359
they usually come in a, this is a semi-gloss,
and here we have a high gloss. So let's take

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:43.839
a look at what these products look like on
our stained wood. Now this particular Polyurethane

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.639
happens to be be a water based product, which
is very good for people who are bothered by

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:56.010
the odor of a solvent based Polyurethane,
such as this product. Let's take a look at

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.629
the differences in how they, how they go on
and how they look on a piece of stained wood.

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.790
The first thing you'll, you'll notice about
the water based Polyurethane is that it's

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.080
not really clear at all when it goes on. It's
kind of a milky white sort of look. But it

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.540
will dry to a clear finish. If you want to
take a look at how that goes on. You want

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:33.980
to use nice, smooth, long strokes. Keep your
overlapping to a minimum.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.390
When you're first brushing out the finish
you can press pretty hard but, you want to

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.390
use a lighter stroke, at closer to a 90 degree
angle when you do your, your last stroke.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.159
Now let's take a look at the, at the solvent
based Polyurethane. now you can see that the

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.040
solvent based Polyurethane is clear when it
goes on. The brushing technique is pretty

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:11.349
much the same. You want to use a light stroke
once you've gotten your material onto the

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:19.670
wood.
Press it in pretty good to get that initial

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.870
material onto the wood and then lightly drag
the brush to eliminate any bubbles and streaking,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:40.230
if you can. And whenever possible, use the
best quality brush that you can afford. Now

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.010
after letting these dry for a few minutes,
you can see the dramatic difference between

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.189
them. This is just a single coat of semi-gloss
water based Polyurethane and a high-gloss

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:57.469
solvent based Polyurethane at the top. Of
course, at the very top there's unfinished

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:03.480
wood. But you can see from a single coat,
that you obviously have to build up more of

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.530
the water based clear coat, than of the solvent
based. But again, if you don't want the hassle

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.730
of having to use Turpentine, or Mineral Spirits
to clean up, and you don't like the strong

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.659
odor of the solvent based Polyurethane, then
water based can be a very, very good alternative.
