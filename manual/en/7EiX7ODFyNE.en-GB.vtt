00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.309
Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Baking
Addict Cupcake Tutorial where I'll be showing

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.590
you how to make this gorgeous little cupcake,
perfect for the baking addict in your life.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.940
Tools and equipment that we will be using
today:

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.270
I've got just a regular knife.
I've got a little bit of cornflour in a cornflour

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.800
shaker. You can also use icing sugar.
I've got 2 different colors of fondant. I've

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.440
got a little bit of white and a little bit
of brown.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.430
I've got a fondant roller. Regular rolling
pin will do.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.000
I've got a paintbrush.
A toothpick.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.750
I've got my cupcake. Now I've pre-iced that
in our flat top style of frosting. So I will

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.760
leave a link to that tutorial in the description
box below. Otherwise you can use any frosting

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.720
style you like.
I've got a little bit of just plain water.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.050
I've got some sprinkles, so you will need
a little hundreds and thousands or little

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.790
round sprinkles, and the little love heart
sprinkles are an optional extra.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.440
And I've got some mini Oreo cookies.
I also have a little, sort of a scallop edge

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.300
scone cutter.
Let's get started.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.060
While we've got a nice clean surface, we're
going to work with our white fondant. Make

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.550
sure it stays nice and white. So just taking
that out of the bag. I'm just going to pop

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.320
down just a little bit of cornflour. It's
quite a bit more than I wanted. And roll that

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.659
into a ball, sort of push it out, swipe it
around in the cornflour, and just roll it

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.659
out. I want this rolled out quite thin. And
it's going to sort of look like... It's a

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.909
little cake plate but I think it looks kind
of like a little doily underneath our little

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:35.579
edible cake there.
So you want to take your little scallop cookie

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.710
cutter or scallop scone cutter and just cut
out the nice little shape. Now to give it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.040
a little bit of, sort of a little bit of detail,
we're going to take the toothpick. And I'm

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.399
just going to make a little hole so just pop
it in and give it a little sort of a shake

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.240
around just to open the hole up a little bit.
We're going to that at each of the scalloped

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:02.850
bumps all the way around.
So it's as easy as that. That's just going

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.979
to make our little decorative plate or our
decorative doily for our cake.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.569
Next we'll move on to the actual cake itself.
So I'm going to take a couple of those mini

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.670
Oreos. And I'm going to use a knife because
I want a nice, clean finish here. So I'm just

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.939
going to slice one of them in half and the
other one I'm going to keep as it is. I'm

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:24.210
going to sandwich those together and that's
going to make our little tiered cake. How

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.879
easy is that?
Taking another Oreo...You can also use white

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.370
fondant here but I prefer just to stick with
the Oreo theme. I'm going to slice that in

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.680
half. And I'm actually going to pinch the
cream out of it. So just pinching the cream

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.700
and just press it on top. You can sort of
press it down around the edges. But don't

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.400
worry if you're not too neat. Kind of... [I
suppose] want it to cover. Now take that little

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.430
cake and dip it into your hundreds and thousands.
Give it a nice, firm dip. Roll it around so

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.770
your hundred and thousands or your sprinkles
are coat in the edges. And then just neaten

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.220
them off on the sides.
As I said, little optional extra, I'd like

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.870
a little love heart sprinkle on top of mine.
So I'm going to take it and I'm just going

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:14.799
to just sit it on top there. One of the easiest,
little, tiny, mini cakes I think you'll have

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.469
seen in a long time. We'll pop that over here
with our little cake plate.

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:28.209
Now, on to our wooden spoon and our little
rolling pin. So I've got this brown fondant.

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.580
You can substitute this for caramel fudge
if you don't have any brown fondant. But I've

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.250
mixed a bit of my brown coloring through it.
And I just have mixed it quite all the way

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.510
through. So it's almost got kind of like wood
granny look to it, a little bit [mottled].

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.200
So I don't want really cornflour on my surface
for this because I'm just going to roll it

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.069
into a bit of a sausage-y type shape. And
you need a little bit of stick on the bench

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.640
when you're rolling it into a sausage. I'm
just going to roll it out into a sausage and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.040
this is just going to be for our rolling pin.
So once you're happy that you've got a nice,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.750
sort of a sausage-y size, just cut it off
at one end and cut it off at the other. You

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.680
will squish it a little bit as you cut it
off. So you just want to make sure that you

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.700
do bring it back into that nice, round, shape
at either end to keep our rolling pin looking

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.760
nice and authentic. Just give it another little
roll to make sure it's all even.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.340
Now taking this little extra piece here, you
just want to pinch off just a very little

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.690
bit. Roll it into a ball and then I just rolled
mine into like the little cone type shape.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.460
Little tiny tiny dab of water. Just put a
tiny dab. The more you put on, the less likely

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.630
it is to stick. So you just really want to
moisten the end, and stick it on to the end

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.310
of your rolling pin. We'll repeat that process
for the other end. Then we can move on to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.220
our wooden spoon.
If you do lose any of the shape of your rolling

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.330
pin, just push it back into shape before it
starts to set.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:57.229
Moving on to our wooden spoon, I'm just going
to cut out of that sausage another little

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:02.750
piece, a little bit shorter than the one that
we used for the rolling pin. And give it a

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.170
little bit of a roll, like I said to keep
that shape. Now what you want to do here is

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:14.010
about the half way point. You want to roll
it down so you get that nice, skinny, spoon

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.479
handle. Alright, so you should have something
that looks sort of like this. That's our nice

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.130
little handle there. I will make that handle
just a little bit thinner, really it's up

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.530
to you how big and how long you want your
wooden spoon to be.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.710
So I'm going to cut off just the end there,
stamp it down a little bit. And I'm going

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.020
to cut off the top here. Now with your top,
you want to just fashion it into a rounded

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.310
type shape, and push it down. So round it
on the top so you don't have any sort of flat

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:52.360
edges at the top, just using your fingers.
Now once you've got it sort of looking a little

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.360
bit spoon-like, I like to take just my little
finger. Be careful if you've got fingernails

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:04.680
here, just sort of use the side of your finger,
and just push it in there. Right. And that

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.229
makes our lovely little wooden spoon. Really
really easy.

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.180
So pop those all together, we're just going
to take our cupcake. I have just frosted that

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.169
cupcake. So you don't want to frost your cupcake
too far in advance or else you'll find your

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.229
buttercream forms a little bit of a crust
and it won't... your decoration won't stick

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.169
to it.
So sticking that lovely little doily down

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:33.240
to buttercream, tiny little bit of water just
to make it a bit tucky and we'll pop our cake

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:44.690
on. And then positioning the wooden spoon
and the rolling pin.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.280
There you have your gorgeous little baking
addict cupcake, perfect for the avid baker

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.300
in your life.
