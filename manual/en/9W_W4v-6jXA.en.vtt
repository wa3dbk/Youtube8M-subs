00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.580
(glass bulb rolling on a table, electrical
sounds)

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.209
I like to think about engineering, primarily,
as being intrinsic to human life.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.029
Engineering is fundamental to everything we
do in society,

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:20.890
whether it's transportation, communications,
the infrastructure, clean water, health care.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.749
All of these require an engineer or computer
scientist, who has developed a system,

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:30.970
who has modeled a system, who has built 
a system, tested a system, failed,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.640
and then succeeded eventually to provide something
of value to society.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.960
Who are the real beneficiaries?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.199
It's you and me and everybody else in the
world, including those engineers.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.780
We need to be thinking all the time.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.449
We know for certain that our fossil fuel supply
is limited.

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:51.410
We know for certain that our population is
going to continue to increase,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.559
particularly in some parts of the world.

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.940
There's billions of people there that need
access to clean energy, that need access to
water.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.980
How are we going to provide this to humanity 
in locations where they are?

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.320
This has to be a local solution. It has a
global impact,

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.470
because if we don't solve the water problem,
not just in this country but across the world,

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.380
that's gonna lead to war eventually.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.549
And this is where I think engineering and
science play a role.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.970
Now, everything has a cost associated with
it, but ultimately I think it's about the
quality of life.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.159
Take the field of assistive technology engineering, 
which is another field that we're launching
into right now,

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.750
which brings together really disparate disciplines,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.210
brings together engineers on the one hand, computer 
scientists, health and human development biologists,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.020
all of them creating devices and processes
to help people overcome disabilities -- 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.659
either physical disabilities, or cognitive disabilities,
or just disabilities due to aging.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.050
So I really think that if you think about
engineering as an enabling discipline -- 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.000
truly, I think it's a Renaissance discipline; 
you could be in any field --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.670
but if you're willing to think, if you're
willing to apply what you've learned,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.049
and if you're willing to create products and
processes to help people,

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.549
you're in the right place; you have to be
an engineer.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.259
