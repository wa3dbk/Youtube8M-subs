00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:13.040
On October the fourth, 1957 the first satellite,
Sputnik I, was launched into space.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.940
Although it burned up in the atmosphere three
months later, many satellites launched since

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.109
then have not, leaving us with a virtual junk
yard orbiting the earth.

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.289
Now those debris represent a real threat to
the television communications and GPS satellites,

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:28.720
not to mention the astronauts.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.300
But luckily, the Swiss have a plan to clean
up space.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.630
So I have come to Lausanne to figure out how
they are going to do it.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.690
Most of the space junk orbiting earth is within
2000 kilometers of the earth’s surface.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:48.300
There are over 22,000 objects larger than
this softball and over half a million larger

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.580
than this marble.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.281
Now all of the orbiting debris is going about
seven to eight kilometers per second, but

00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:58.170
since the objects are moving relative to one
another the average speed of a collision is

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.000
about 10 kilometers per second.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.320
And an object this size going 10 kilometers
per second has about the same impact as a

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.039
midsize car going nearly 200 kilometers per
hour.

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.600
That is enough force to destroy any satellite
in orbit.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.000
As a veteran of four space flights, Swiss
astronaut Claude Nicollier knows the dangers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.670
first hand.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.670
&gt;&gt; Only the large debris are tracked.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.369
By radar we know the orbit exactly and sometimes
we have to be a small change in the orbiter

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.310
characteristics that our space ship, the space
shuttle...

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.630
&gt;&gt; Space shuttle Endeavor...
&gt;&gt;... because it is foreseen that next day

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:44.060
or two days later we are going to have a close
approach with a debris, such that NASA was

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.079
not feeling to good about that and we translated
our orbits so to make that distance a little

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.149
bit larger.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.539
&gt;&gt; Fortunately, to date, there haven’t been
any serious collisions with manned spaced

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:55.539
craft.

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:02.389
But in 2009 a single crash between two satellites
added a whopping 2000 new pieces of debris.

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:08.720
&gt;&gt; If we don’t do anything, space will become
soon inaccessible because of the large amount

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.950
of debris and the high risk of collision.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.790
&gt;&gt; So the Swiss, determined to do something
about that problem, are extending their clean

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.860
country reputation into outer space.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.750
&gt;&gt; The Swiss space center has launched a program
called Clean Space One that is a demonstrator

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.570
of the capability to remove debris.

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:34.140
And the idea is to go and to remove one of
two satellites from Switzerland.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.720
&gt;&gt; One of these two satellites is appropriately
named Swiss Cube.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.140
&gt;&gt; Swiss Cube is a small satellite which you
see.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.570
This is a one to one model.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.020
So this is in the right scale.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.440
It belongs to Switzerland.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.160
So we had to do something about this.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.600
&gt;&gt; You can’t have Swiss junk just floating
around in space.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.600
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.600
No.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.340
That is not acceptable.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.830
&gt;&gt; So the mission for Clean Space One is a
proof of concept that a janitor satellite

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.310
can be sent into space to grab a piece of
space junk—in this case Swiss Cube and bring

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.690
it back into the atmosphere where it will
burn up.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.590
To rendezvous with the space junk, the small
janitor needs an incredibly efficient engine.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.590
Working on the challenge is Professor Herbert
Shea, an expert in micro mechanics.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.590
&gt;&gt; This is your propulsion system.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.930
&gt;&gt; This is our propulsion system.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.620
Little silicone micro machine chips.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.150
We use something called electro propulsion,
which allows you to emit single atoms with

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.460
a ... that are electrically charged and use
an electric field to accelerate them out.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.460
So you are not burning them.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.490
You are emitting your propellant.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:43.100
And that is what many small satellites use,
but nothing has been, to date, been able to

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.620
make something this small.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.680
So we do zero to 60 miles an hour in a about
three days.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.650
But laughable as it, indeed, seems to all
of us, because there is no friction in space,

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:59.730
or negligible friction, then if we wait six
months, we have a huge change in speed.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.750
And that is how the mission will be done.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.960
&gt;&gt; Once propelled into the correct orbit,
the next challenge is to grab the space junk,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.659
an object tumbling around uncontrollably without
creating more debris.

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.350
&gt;&gt; Our idea is to use a very compliant system.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.710
Kind of think of an octopus arm.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.739
An octopus arm is very soft, but it can grab
any strange shape and wrap around it and hold

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:20.739
it.

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.749
And we will have a grabber that looks, in
a very ... but that real one will be more

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:24.749
sophisticated.

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:25.749
But it looks like this.

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:26.749
So it is basically very, very soft elastomer.

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.289
I will turn it on in a minute.

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.039
You can see how soft it is.

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:32.900
And the idea is this will be rolled up so
it doesn't take up much room.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.280
You get into... and it will have 10 of these
in a series.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.330
You get into space, you unroll it.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.710
And then these things can open when you turn
the voltage on.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.189
You are able to open this and you turn the
voltage off and it wraps it around and it

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.130
holds the satellite.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.650
&gt;&gt; Is this going to be a little bit like those
games where you are trying to pick up a stuffed

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.629
toy in the arcade and drop it somewhere?

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.880
Is it going to be like that?

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.880
&gt;&gt; Essentially, yes.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.419
&gt;&gt; Because those games... those games can
be incredibly frustrating with those little

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.419
arms.

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:00.820
&gt;&gt; They are built to be frustrating.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.039
&gt;&gt; Whereas this, this is built to be ...

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.530
&gt;&gt; This is built to succeed.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.240
&gt;&gt; Can I ask?

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.980
Has anyone ever successfully gone up and grabbed
a piece of space junk and gotten rid of it?&gt;&gt;

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.980
To my knowledge, no.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.000
It has never been done before.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.610
&gt;&gt; And it grabs on.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.550
&gt;&gt; Ambitious as it may sound, the Swiss know
how vast this junk yard is.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.720
So their ultimate aims are more modest.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.639
&gt;&gt; Hopefully starting in, say, 2020 to do
systematic removal of the large debris at

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:36.180
the rate of five or more per year in order
to contain the increase of the debris density

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.759
in lower earth orbit.

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.330
Then space will continue becoming accessible.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:57.169
Of course, the exposure to the space environment

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:07.110
is a wonderful thing.
