00:00:01.863 --> 00:00:04.483
- So let's talk about some
of the differences between

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:08.823
anemia of chronic disease
and iron-deficiency anemia,

00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:12.134
because really these two
diseases present very similarly.

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.119
Both of them are going
to have patients that

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.696
present with signs and symptoms of anemia.

00:00:16.696 --> 00:00:20.803
So, patients that are chronically
fatigued and feeling weak,

00:00:20.803 --> 00:00:22.048
looking paler than usual,

00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:24.863
and maybe experiencing
some shortness of breath.

00:00:24.863 --> 00:00:28.433
And really, when you go to
draw the basic anemia labs,

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.743
take a look at what's
going on in the blood,

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:35.059
you'll see that both of
them are microcytic anemias.

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.663
So, really the only way to
tell these two diseases apart

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.843
is to draw iron studies.

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:41.723
So let's take a look at

00:00:41.723 --> 00:00:44.263
what some of those values would show.

00:00:44.263 --> 00:00:46.106
So, here's some of the
values that you get back

00:00:46.106 --> 00:00:47.503
when you draw iron studies,

00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:49.615
and we already went through
this for iron-deficiency anemia,

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.463
but let's just do it
again for practice sake.

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:54.304
So, with iron-deficiency
anemia you'd expect

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:57.024
your serum iron to be decreased, right?

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.783
Hence, the iron deficiency part of it all.

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:01.103
The percent saturation

00:01:01.103 --> 00:01:04.563
or the percentage of total binding sites

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.783
on the transferrin
molecules that are actually

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:11.783
occupied by iron would also be decreased.

00:01:13.246 --> 00:01:17.132
The total iron binding capacity
in iron-deficiency anemia

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:19.592
is increased, and we said that that was

00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:21.762
the body's compensatory mechanism

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:24.050
to deal with the deficiency in iron.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.032
So what the body does to deal
with the shortage of iron

00:01:27.032 --> 00:01:30.205
is increase its production
of transferrin molecules.

00:01:30.205 --> 00:01:33.552
It makes more transferrin,
puts it out into the blood,

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:35.232
so that the transferrin can go out there

00:01:35.232 --> 00:01:36.852
and bind to more iron,

00:01:36.852 --> 00:01:40.052
to find more iron and
bind to more of it, okay?

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:42.039
And ferritin, which is reflective of

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.890
the amount of iron that's
in storage in the body

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.007
is decreased in iron deficiency, okay?

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:52.292
So, those are the values
for iron-deficiency anemia.

00:01:52.292 --> 00:01:54.212
Let's compare that with what you see

00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:56.072
in anemia of chronic disease.

00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.352
So just as an overview, once again,

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:01.492
anemia of chronic disease
is a disease where you have

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:05.504
some underlying inflammatory condition,

00:02:05.504 --> 00:02:08.332
and as a result of it, you
have an increased production

00:02:08.332 --> 00:02:10.832
of a molecule called hepcidin,

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:13.243
and what hepcidin does is it, number one,

00:02:13.243 --> 00:02:16.272
decreases the absorption
of iron from the gut,

00:02:16.272 --> 00:02:19.912
and it also decreases
the recycling of iron

00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:21.852
from the breakdown of red blood cells.

00:02:21.852 --> 00:02:23.993
So, really what your body is trying to

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:27.024
accomplish in this disease
is, it's trying to limit

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.732
how much iron is coming into the body

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:33.012
and at the same time
it's trying to tuck away

00:02:33.012 --> 00:02:36.095
as much iron as possible into storage,

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:38.867
so that very little is
present in the blood.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:40.407
In essence, the body's trying to

00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:42.192
play keep away with the iron,

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:44.536
away from bacteria and inflammatory cells,

00:02:44.536 --> 00:02:49.536
because they really need it
to thrive and to grow, okay?

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:52.412
So, you'd expect that the serum iron

00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:54.544
in anemia of chronic
disease would be decreased.

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:56.838
That's exactly what the
body's trying to accomplish.

00:02:56.838 --> 00:03:00.161
It wants very little iron
present in the blood.

00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.112
The percent saturation,

00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:04.480
which is again the percentage
of transferrin binding sites

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.472
that are actually filled up with iron,

00:03:06.472 --> 00:03:09.652
would also be decreased.

00:03:09.652 --> 00:03:12.252
The total iron binding capacity,

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:16.252
or the amount of transferrin
that's in the blood

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:19.864
in anemia of chronic
disease, is decreased.

00:03:19.864 --> 00:03:21.116
And again, this makes sense.

00:03:21.116 --> 00:03:23.052
It goes totally in line with

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:24.812
what the body's trying to accomplish.

00:03:24.812 --> 00:03:27.925
It decreases the production of transferrin

00:03:27.925 --> 00:03:30.252
so that there's less transferrin
out there in the blood

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:32.372
trying to bind to iron, okay?

00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:35.632
And finally, the ferritin,
which is reflective of

00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:38.152
the total amount of iron
in storage in the body

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:39.470
in anemia of chronic disease

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.552
is characteristically increased,

00:03:42.552 --> 00:03:45.144
and this is because once again the body

00:03:45.144 --> 00:03:49.024
has tucked away as much iron
as possible into storage, okay,

00:03:49.024 --> 00:03:52.135
which is reflective of
what you see with ferritin.

00:03:52.135 --> 00:03:54.004
So, really there are a
couple of differences between

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.132
iron-deficiency anemia and
anemia of chronic disease.

00:03:57.132 --> 00:03:59.812
Firstly, iron-deficiency anemia is really

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:03.664
a disease of total body depletion of iron,

00:04:03.664 --> 00:04:06.632
and these lab values
reflect that very well,

00:04:06.632 --> 00:04:07.580
especially the ferritin.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.373
This tells you that there
is no iron in the body,

00:04:10.373 --> 00:04:11.886
not even in storage, not in the blood,

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:14.072
not in the storage, not anywhere.

00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:16.112
Anemia of chronic disease, however,

00:04:16.112 --> 00:04:18.592
isn't necessarily a disease where you have

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.245
a depletion in iron.

00:04:20.245 --> 00:04:22.636
Instead, you'll see an
increase in ferritin,

00:04:22.636 --> 00:04:25.252
so that tells you that
there's iron in the body,

00:04:25.252 --> 00:04:29.212
it's just tucked away,
away from the access of

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:31.252
bacteria and inflammatory cells.

00:04:31.252 --> 00:04:34.572
Now, also another difference
between these two diseases

00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:37.233
is that in iron-deficiency anemia

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:39.452
the body is doing its absolute best

00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:42.952
to increase the amount of
iron available in the serum,

00:04:42.952 --> 00:04:45.501
and you see that with the
total iron binding capacity.

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:48.665
It increases the
production of transferrin.

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:50.888
It does its best to try to bring more iron

00:04:50.888 --> 00:04:53.372
into the body and into the blood.

00:04:53.372 --> 00:04:55.792
However, in anemia of chronic disease

00:04:55.792 --> 00:04:58.584
the body is trying to
accomplish the exact opposite.

00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:01.088
It's decreasing its
production of transferrin

00:05:01.088 --> 00:05:04.472
so that you have as little
iron as possible in the serum,

00:05:04.472 --> 00:05:06.957
and the increased ferritin also reflects

00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:10.332
that the body's trying to
hide away its iron in storage.

00:05:10.332 --> 00:05:12.692
So, in summary, those are
some of the differences

00:05:12.692 --> 00:05:14.352
between anemia of chronic disease

00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:16.550
and iron-deficiency anemia, which again,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.792
you really rely on these iron studies

00:05:18.792 --> 00:05:20.375
to differentiate between,

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:22.590
because they present very similarly.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:23.938
What's important to keep in mind is that

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:26.992
these are both microcytic anemias.
