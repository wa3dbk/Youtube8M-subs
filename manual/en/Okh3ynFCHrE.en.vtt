00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.964
(happy upbeat music)

00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:07.272
- Hey friends, thank you
so much for tuning in

00:00:07.272 --> 00:00:09.024
at Cook With April,

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:12.954
with Liam as the taste tester, yay!

00:00:12.954 --> 00:00:14.291
(laughs)

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.855
Today we're gonna show
you guys how to make

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.617
Pineapple Upside Down Cake.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.301
It is so moist, stay tuned.

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.871
So you'll need butter,
pineapples, cherries,

00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:25.656
I'll include all the precise measurements

00:00:25.656 --> 00:00:27.779
in the information box below.

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.865
Sifted cake flour,

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:32.325
granulated white sugar,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.275
packed brown sugar,

00:00:34.275 --> 00:00:35.766
baking powder,

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:38.961
pure almond extract,

00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.172
salt,

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:43.604
four eggs, and they're gonna be separated

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:45.141
egg whites and egg yolks.

00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:46.918
First of all I'm gonna go ahead

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:49.242
and melt the butter onto a pan.

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.592
This is a 10 inch pie pan that I'm using.

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:55.748
Now I'm ready to sprinkle the brown sugar

00:00:55.748 --> 00:00:58.627
right on top of the butter,

00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:02.047
and then I'm gonna add the pineapples.

00:01:02.052 --> 00:01:07.052
(soft music)

00:01:08.644 --> 00:01:10.211
After that I'm adding the cherries

00:01:10.211 --> 00:01:12.281
right into the middle
of the pineapple rings.

00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:17.567
I'm gonna set that aside

00:01:17.567 --> 00:01:19.134
and now I'm gonna work on the cake flour.

00:01:19.134 --> 00:01:21.451
I'm adding the baking powder and the salt

00:01:21.451 --> 00:01:23.331
and I'm whisking it.

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:25.097
Now I'm adding the egg whites

00:01:25.097 --> 00:01:27.203
and I'm gonna go ahead and beat that.

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:30.997
I'm gonna beat it until
it creates stiff peaks

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:34.015
and it kinda looks like whip
cream when it's a stiff peak.

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:36.383
Then I added the egg yolks as well

00:01:36.383 --> 00:01:39.062
as the flour mixture into the batter

00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:42.613
and I'm gonna go ahead
and turn it on again.

00:01:42.613 --> 00:01:45.196
Until it's like a creamy consistency.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:50.556
The consistency should look like this

00:01:50.556 --> 00:01:51.555
and oh my goodness you guys,

00:01:51.555 --> 00:01:54.439
just pour it on top of the pineapples.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.253
It's gonna be so moist.

00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:59.849
So you're gonna bake it at 325
degrees for about 30 minutes.

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:01.602
I like to use a fork to kinda poke at it

00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:04.569
and make sure that it's completely baked.

00:02:04.769 --> 00:02:08.268
Then I'm using a little
knife to just go around

00:02:08.268 --> 00:02:10.477
to make sure that it doesn't stick.

00:02:10.477 --> 00:02:14.208
I'm placing a large plate on
top and I'm gonna flip it over,

00:02:14.208 --> 00:02:16.500
I'm wearing Ove Gloves
to protect my hands.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.019
This gets a little messy, I
messed up on the pineapple

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.364
but I just put it right back and I'm done.

00:02:21.364 --> 00:02:23.032
Enjoy.

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:26.145
Alrighty, baby taste
tester is going to try it.

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:27.749
Justin actually tried it already

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.341

00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:31.641

00:02:35.797 --> 00:02:38.618

00:02:40.783 --> 00:02:42.642
Mmhmm.

00:02:42.642 --> 00:02:45.663
Yeah, go for it.

00:02:47.953 --> 00:02:49.999

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.432
Oh, going in for more you guys,

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:54.708

00:02:55.028 --> 00:02:57.378
Mmmmmmm (laughs).

00:02:57.378 --> 00:03:00.172
So tasty.

00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:02.219
Can you say yum?

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.570
(laughs)

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.697
