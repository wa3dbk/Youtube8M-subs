00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.830
The temperature of regular stuff is basically
just a measurement of jiggliness of the atoms

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.120
and molecules that make that stuff up.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.920
More jiggling, higher temperature.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.090
Less jiggling, lower temperature.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.990
Of course, when something's at a high temperature,
it feels hot, and when something's at a low

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.330
temperature, it feels cold.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.330
Right?

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.820
mmmjhyyaaanot exactly

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.350
If you touch a piece of metal and a book that
have been sitting in your fridge, the metal

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.640
will feel much colder than the book - Derek
of Veritasium did a great video on this, but

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.630
you really have to try it for yourself to
believe it!

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.260
The metal and the book are honestly at the
same temperature as measured by a thermometer,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.980
but the metal FEELS colder.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.730
This isn't just a trick of the mind, though
- we experience the metal as "colder" than

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.160
the book for a very physical reason: metal
is a conductor, and paper is an insulator,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.540
so the ENERGY, or jiggliness of the molecules
in our hands, is absorbed more quickly by

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.559
the metal than by the book.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.860
Even though the book and the metal are at
the same temperature, the metal causes the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.149
temperature of our hands to go down faster,
and thus, we experience the metal as being

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.990
colder - because the temperature of our hands
is what we really feel.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.290
It's like how, technically, a mercury thermometer
really only measures its own temperature and

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.740
you can only indirectly measure temperatures
of other things by putting them in thermal

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.320
contact with it.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.420
Similarly, the thermoreceptive nerves in our
skin can only directly measure the temperature

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.249
of the skin itself and not of anything else.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.869
So when we touch something, we don't feel
its temperature, but rather, we feel its effect

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.579
on our skin: that is, how much and how quickly
it transfers thermal energy - that's the jiggling

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.929
of molecules - to or from us.

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.409
The capacity to transfer thermal energy is
also why a blast of steam from your stovetop

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.259
can feel so much hotter than a blast of hot
dry air from your oven, even though the oven

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.719
has a higher temperature: water vapor transfers
more molecular jiggling to your skin than

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.810
air by itself.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.499
In fact, it's tempting to say that "hot" and
"cold" are fundamentally different concepts

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:50.669
from "high temperature" and "low temperature",
even though we usually use the words interchangeably.

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:55.119
"Hot" really means "it gives off a lot of
energy" while high temperature means "it has

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.429
a lot of energy" - and as anyone who's tried
fundraising knows, just because somebody has

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:11.579
a lot of something, doesn't necessarily mean
they give a lot 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:29.359
of it away.
