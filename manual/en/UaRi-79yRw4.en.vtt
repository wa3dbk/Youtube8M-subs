00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.740
Remember Nottingham Forest?

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.620
No.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.209
Giggs takes the corner. He bangs 
it over. You're there waiting.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.740
- Bang, in it goes.
- No, no.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.479
Man City

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.050
Hughes down the right wing to Kanchelskis. Kanchelskis chips it over.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.019
You're there waiting. Bang, casual as you like. Straight in.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.030
Arsenal !

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.220
Beckham crosses it over. Their defender comes out,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.160
heads it away.
You see it coming.

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.240
Take a step and half back to accomodate the bounce.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.769
Bang, on the half volley. Straight in.
Seaman didn't know what hit him. Come on.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.519
- Not that one.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.280
Oh, God, give me strength.

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:37.530
- Morning, Eric.
- Morning, love.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.950
- Are the lifts working?
- No. Knackered again, I'm afraid.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:42.090
Third time this week.

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.590
Must have been amazing though.

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:53.749
Sixty thousand people watching ya.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.050
Cheering. Chanting your name.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.320
Scary, yeah.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:59.990
You, scared? Never

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.840
Scared it might stop.

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.550
I loved to surprise the crowd, you know?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.380
Every time, in every game,
I tried to offer them a gift.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.729
Sometimes it didn't work,
but then when it did...

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.369
- In our minds forever.
- Yeah.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.579
But I had to surprise myself first.

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.979
Take a risk.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.410
You know, it depends on the limits
you set yourself.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.780
Play safe,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:28.499
no risk.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.189
You know?

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:33.999
Remember Sunderland?

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.950
That was a beauty. Magnifique.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910
It was like a ballet. A dance.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.200
Kept me going for months that goal.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.979
&lt;i&gt;That is magnificient by Cantona.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.180
It just sort of fills you up so much that 
you just forget the rest of the shit in you life

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.880
just for a few hours.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.639
I miss the games, me.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.090
Only place where you can go, where you can let rip without getting arrested.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.070
Shout, scream, laugh.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.820
- Even cry.
- Yeah.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.470
And see Englishmen kiss.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.860
I mean, where else can you sing at the top of your voice with all your mates?

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.300
That's what I really miss.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.669
It's gotta be a good 10 years now
since I last went to a game.

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:59.380
Sweetest moment ever?

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.530
It wasn't a goal.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.349
- It's gotta be a goal, Eric.
- No.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.220
Come on. Last minute.
FA Cup against Liverpool.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.400
Beckham takes a corner.
The goalie runs out.
He punchs it away.

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.849
It hits your chest.
Hits the floor on its way up. Bang!

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.240
You just whack it
right in the net.

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:22.800
Wimbledon. It's gotta be Wimbledon.

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.669
You're going towards the ball. The ball's coming in. 
You're sussing out the trajectory of it, the angle of it.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.889
The spin on it. The way the wind's blowing. The speed of the wind. Everything.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:32.260
You stick your right foot out.
You stop it in mid-flight.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.139
It bounces up about a foot off your leg. You come back, you whack it in.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.070
The most perfect volley in the world.
In it goes.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.579
It's a goal. It's gotta be a goal, Eric.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.889
It was a pass.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.430
- A pass?
- Yeah.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.430
To Irwin against Spurs. Yes!

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:55.380
Beautiful.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.459
I know how clever he was.
Left, right-footed.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:02.400
Came in a flash. I just flicked it 
with the outside on my boot. 
Surprised everyone.

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.889
He took it in his stride
and my heart soared.

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:06.499
A gift.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.030
Yeah, like an offering
to the Great God of Football.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.880
What if he'd have missed?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.720
You have to trust your teammates.
Always.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.619
If not, we are lost.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.539
It must have been tough on you
when you got banned.

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:26.160
Nine months? The bastards.

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:28.269
That twat got what he deserved.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.559
I had to work hard, you know?
Dig deep inside.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.990
I needed something to fill me up when I was on my own. 
Something to aim for, you know?

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.999
It's funny, innit? Sometimes we forget that you're just a man.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.430
I'm not a man.

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:46.829
I am Cantona.
