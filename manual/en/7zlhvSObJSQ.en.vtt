00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.790
A hiatal hernia occurs whenever the junction
between your esophagus, which is your food

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.230
tube, and your stomach, where the food sits
in your abdomen, slips up into your chest.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.910
So normally that junction sits right at your
diaphragm.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.923
The valve there keeps gastric fluid, the high
acidity of your stomach, from coming up into

00:00:29.923 --> 00:00:31.410
your esophagus.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.140
There are multiple different types of hiatal
hernias.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.720
In a sliding-type hiatal hernia, which is
the most common type, the junction slides

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.720
into the esophagus.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.220
In a pera-esophageal hernia, meaning beside
the esophagus, the stomach actually flips

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.260
up alongside the esophagus and that's a little
more concerning because the stomach can become

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.260
trapped up there.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.860
What are the symptoms of a hiatal hernia?

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.290
Oftentimes, a hiatal hernia has no symptoms
and doesn't require any treatment.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:08.580
If you have a very large hiatal hernia, a
large amount of your stomach can get trapped

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.229
up in your chest.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:20.759
They are often associated with reflux or heartburn,
where you have acid that normally stays in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.170
your stomach that comes up into your esophagus
and causes that burning sensation or that

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.820
chest pain sensation that you get with heartburn.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:38.579
What are the treatments for a hiatal hernia?

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.260
The vast majority of hiatal hernias don't
require surgical treatment.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:50.790
Most of the time patients have reflux and
our medications for treating heartburn are

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.790
excellent.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.960
Surgery is reserved for special cases of hiatal
hernias or reflux, that is either nonresponsive

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.340
to the medications or in very young patients
who don't want to take these medications for

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.630
their whole life.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.840
What are the surgical options?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.740
The surgical options usually can be a laparasopic
or robotic approach.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.940
Both use multiple small incisions on the abdomen.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:31.210
It's usually up to the surgeon's preference
as to which approach is used.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.600
We put the junction of your stomach and your
esophagus back down in your stomach in your

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.560
abdomen where it belongs.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.140
We usually perform some type of anti-reflux
surgery where we try to recreate the valve

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.740
at the junction so you won't have the continuous
reflux.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.850
What are the advantages of robotic surgery?

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.100
The advantage of the da Vinci is the platform
is very stable.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:11.700
The robotic arms are doing the movement.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.230
The movements are a little more precise and
it makes doing the suturing technically more

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.230
easy.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:25.550
They have been using the robot for hiatal
hernias for about two years.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.790
What can a patient expect?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.290
Usually the outcomes are excellent.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.980
There is a risk of bleeding and infection,
just like there is with any surgery that we

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.340
do.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.870
Patients get antibiotics at the time of surgery
to prevent that.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.100
There is a risk of injuring the esophagus
or the stomach when we're trying to get it

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.120
clear of these dense connections that are
around it.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.360
Rarely patients will have difficulty swallowing
afterwards because when we're trying to recreate

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.930
the valve that's loose down there or if you
have a lot of swelling after surgery you can

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.100
have some difficulty swallowing after surgery.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.150
Most patients can expect from relief from
the chest pressure and the vast majority of

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.150
patients don't require any further medications
for their reflux symptoms.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.959
About 20 percent of patients unfortunately
do have to go back on their medications for

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.710
reflux, but 80 percent of patients do not.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.860
How long is the recovery?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.690
Usually for a hiatal hernia repair the patients
are kept overnight.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.150
We make sure they can swallow liquids well
the next day.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.560
As with other laparscopic surgeries, we don't
let patients lift any xxx Most patients can

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560
return to work in about a week.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.830
Sometimes patients need to be on a softer
diet for a few weeks after the repair.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.009
How common are hiatal hernias?

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.710
They are very common -- probably 30 percent
of Americans have a hiatal hernia.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.850
The vast majority have no sysmptoms.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:53.300
Those with symptoms can oftentimes be treated
with medications.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.620
Surgical treatment is reserved for patients
who have failed medical therapy or who have

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.259
complications or can't tolerate taking the
acid-controlling medicines.
