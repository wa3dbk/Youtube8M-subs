00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.609
This is the Tesla Model S P85D, which could
just be the fastest four-door saloon in the

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:11.540
world. Featuring two electric motors – one
for each axle – the four-wheel drive Tesla

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.770
pumps out a mind-boggling 691bhp and a monumental
600Nm of torque. All this power costs a fraction

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.300
under £85,000 – although this car will
set you back the thick end of £100,000. So

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.660
just how fast is the P85D? Well, Tesla claim
it will blast from 0-60mph in just 3.1 seconds

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.780
and hits an electronic limiter at 155mph.
And all this in eerie electric silence. So

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.460
the Tesla should be pretty much unbeatable
in a drag race. However, there is another

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.100
high performance four-door saloon that’s
pretty tasty in a straight line. The Porsche

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.579
Panamera Turbo S. On paper the Porsche needs
3.8 seconds for the 0-62mph sprint and continues

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:05.940
accelerating until it hits its 192mph.
Under the skin the Panamera relies on old-fashioned

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.130
internal combustion technology. Its bellowing
twin-turbo 4.8-litre produces 562bhp and a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.420
staggering 750Nm of torque. The Porsche puts
all this power down through a seven-speed

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.150
twin clutch gearbox that’s mated to a four-wheel
drive transmission. And the cost of all this

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.820
complexity? A whisker over £132,000. So which
is really the fastest? To find out we hooked

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.970
up our GPS timing equipment and pitched our
duo head-to-head in a 0-100mph drag race.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.530
And as a final twist we wanted to see which
one could come to a stop in the shortest distance.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.750
OK, so here we are ready to go. Both cars
are essentially four wheel drive but the Porsche

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.180
has the advantage of launch control. The Tesla
doesn’t have that but it does have Insane

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:59.141
acceleration mode which I’m going to engage
now. Yep, there we go. All set, let’s see

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:11.169
how we get on.
Already the Porsche has the lead but its level

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:20.409
pegging and he’s pulling away. Oh my word.
Now it’s brakes, brakes, brakes, brakes.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:27.300
Now that was close on the acceleration but
the Porsche just stops so much quicker. Man

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.069
alive this thing is fast but the Porsche is
even faster. Just off the line you get pushed

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.200
back in your seat – it’s incredible the
traction. But above 85mph it just starts to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.980
tail off and the Porsche gets into its stride.
On the brakes, those carbon ceramics on the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:54.629
Porsche are incredible - the ability to stop
is amazing. The Tesla is no slouch on the

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:04.849
brakes but I’m surprised by how much more
distance it needed to stop.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.069
So the Porsche was the clear winner. But exactly
how fast were our contenders? Well, the Panamera

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:17.099
covered 0-60 in just 3.4 seconds, 0-100 in
8.2 seconds and needed only 90.8 metres to

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.930
stop from 100mph – you can thank the car’s
excellent standard carbon ceramic brakes for

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.359
that eye-popping display of stopping power.
The Tesla wasn’t quite as quick, but it

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.859
was hardly a slouch. There was a hesitation
off the line, almost as if the electric motors

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:37.140
took a deep breath, but once moving it cracked
60 in 3.6 seconds, 100 in 9.2 and came to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.180
a stop in 98.1 metres - 7.3 metres more than
the Porsche. So, in the final reckoning, the

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.389
Porsche had the legs of the Tesla. It was
faster to 60, it was faster to 100 and it

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:53.209
stopped in a shorter distance. But don't underestimate
the Tesla, because it's a seriously impressive

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.409
piece of kit. For an electric car to rival
a Porsche Panamera Turbo S on acceleration,

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.049
emit zero emissions from its tailpipe and
go 300 miles between recharges, is a staggering

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:21.590
achievement.
