00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.419
Okay, on this one we are going to actually
talk about shadows and light and just the

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.430
basics of the fundamentals on how light actually
works. How it bounces off objects, refracted

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.889
light, reflected light, things like that.
You're also going to learn how to draw an

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.040
asymmetrical box at the same time, so it's
a two for one on this one. Let's get started

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:34.260
with that. So we have refracted light.
We have here, is where the starting of the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.780
shadow starts so it's easy to assume that
here is where one of the darkest parts on

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.860
the box is going to be. So it would go from
dark to more light, not such a big change,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:58.960
also the same with here. But when drawing
a box and shades it's important to pick out

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.799
a side that will be darker than the other.
Since this part looks like to be more of in

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.479
the dark area we will make this one darker
than this side. As far as the light is concerned,

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.079
on the top we have light coming on the top
of the box and since it's coming from behind

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:27.069
the box, this part in this corner here, might
even be highlighted.

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.520
So it's not easy to assume that this is going
to be the brightest part of the box. It's

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.619
going to kind of become not as bright, but
still bright, but just not as bright. So if

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:46.420
we have the brightness from here and we'll
just kind of dissipate slightly, just ever

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:55.109
so slightly to this part. That's basically
how a shadow box would work. Just remember,

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:02.149
instead of drawing solid colors or solid shades
that you have to keep in mind of such things

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.489
called reflective light, and other things
that if you wanted this to be actually shiny

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.960
then you could actually have reflections in
these. As far as the shadow goes on the ground

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.180
itself there are other parts that are going
to be darker and lighter around the shadow.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.220
If you actually look at a shadow, it's not
always the same color, or the same shade all

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.610
throughout. The darkest parts, showing the
least amount of light towards it, is going

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:40.360
to be actually the bottom of the box. So here
at these points all along this part of the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:50.310
box are actually going to be the darkest.
From there it's kind of less of a shadow and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.920
becomes brighter and brighter and brighter,
but still within the darkness. That's your

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.700
basics on how light works, and shadows work
on a basic square.
