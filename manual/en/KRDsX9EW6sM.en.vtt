Hello, I'm Matt Guf here for The House Snowboard
Shop, and this is the Burton Kilter jacket.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.860
It's part of the Restricted series and not
many shops out there are going to have it.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.109
It's part of the Team Fit as well, and it's
actually about 2" longer than the average

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:24.000
Burton jacket, and 1" longer in the sleeves
than most Burton jackets. This Kilter jackets

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.369
is part of the DryRide 2-layer Durashell Technology
series. It's an abrasion-resistant fabric

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.040
combined with a waterproof and breathable
membrane. This jacket actually has 10,000

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.600
mm of both waterproofing and breathable material,
so it's going to repel a lot of water while

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.789
it still breathes very well. Now, as you'll
see, the jacket is pretty much just the shell.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.329
It has printed mesh on the inside, but that's
pretty much all the insulation this jacket

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.519
has. It's going to be great in wet, warmer
conditions. If you're on the East coast in

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.530
the middle of February and it's -90 degrees
outside, this isn't going to be the best jacket

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.500
for you. However, if you're in southern California
riding Bear, or Summit, or Mammoth, wherever,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.490
this is going to be a great jacket all year
round. I really like the fit of this jacket

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.343
and how it feels on. It's nice and relaxed,
loose and just a shell. There are a lot of

00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:25.789
great features to this jacket, including:
- An adjustable cuffing system - Arm pit zips

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:35.560
- A contoured hood that's fully adjustable,
it doesn't matter how big your head is, or

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.619
whether you wear a helmet, a baseball cap
or a beanie - A chafe-free collar...I've got

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.939
a little facial hair (or trying to have) and
it won't chafe me up at the end of the day.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.359
Now, the pockets are pretty minimal. There
are only two pockets on the outside of the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.840
jacket. They're nice stomach pockets that
are fleece-lined with elastic closures as

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.109
well. You can pull on the elastic tabs and
the waist of your jacket is going to tighten

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:06.679
up. Plus, there's a nice key ring on the end,
a great addition so you won't lose your keys.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:17.790
The inside of the jacket is guarded by these
great huge YKK zippers. They keep out a lot

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.860
of the weather and they're very durable. You'll
see how big they are and the teeth are great.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.240
And when you open up the zipper you see the
great mesh lining I was talking about earlier,

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:39.820
which includes a nice media pocket for you
iPod, where you can also string through your

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.140
headphones so they're protected on the inside
and don't get tangled out in the elements,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.990
when you're talking to your friends, or eating
lunch. And lastly, there's a huge mesh lining

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.250
pocket inside as well, big enough for your
goggles, lunch, whatever you want. There's

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.150
also a nice waist gaiter on this jacket. It
connects to the Burton snowboard pants and

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.540
is a nice interface that keeps the elements
out of your pants and your jacket. If you

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.380
don't have Burton snowboard pants, don't worry
about that, because you can just attach it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.350
anyway by clicking it together over your regular
pants. There's also the flash pass pocket

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.380
makes it easy to show your pocket to nifties
out there that are nazis. So, overall I think

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.660
this is a great jacket. If you're running
in the wet and weathered conditions where

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.600
you don't need too much warmth, but you do
need a lot of breathability and water resistance,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.280
this Burton Kilter jacket, part of the Restricted
series, is going to be great. With the Team

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.960
Fit, 10,000 mm of waterproofing and breathability
materials, it's lightweight all mountain protection

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.180
that's simply killer Kilter!
