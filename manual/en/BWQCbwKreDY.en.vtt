Vegan Southern Brown Rice Recipe - Day 17 - Food, Cooking, How to

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.480
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.568
Today is Day 17 of our journey to Veganize Paula Deen's Souther Cooking Bible.

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:13.769
And today, we will be making her southern brown rice recipe. Why 
 there is no brown rice in it, I don't know?

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.587
Southern Brown Rice Recipe - Food, Cooking, How to

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:25.356
So we are going to start this recipe off, 
 just about how we start off every recipe,

00:00:25.356 --> 00:00:29.062
by adding vegan butter to a large saucepan over medium-high heat.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:33.715
To that, we are going to add in fresh sliced mushrooms and diced onions.

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:40.658
The original recipe asked for canned mushrooms, but who cooks with canned mushrooms?

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:40.658
The original recipe asked for canned mushrooms, but who cooks with canned mushrooms?

00:00:41.726 --> 00:00:47.601
Then we are going to add in white rice, and let it 
 get covered in butter and start to fry a little bit.

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:52.419
Just a tiny bit, for like 1 - 2 minutes, 
 before adding in our vegetable stock and soy sauce.

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:58.073
And we are using the vegetable stock to replace the beef 
 stock in the original recipe for obvious reasons, 

00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:03.994
but I added the soy sauce to get that 
 umami flavor and add to the color too.

00:01:03.994 --> 00:01:09.567
Then we are going to cover the rice and let it 
 simmer for about 15-20 minutes, like we would any rice.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:14.791
And it should come out perfect. If you know how to cook 
 rice, then you won't have a problem cooking this recipe.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:21.572
It turned out to taste like one of those pre-seasoned 
 packages of rice that I loved in undergrad,

00:01:21.572 --> 00:01:28.654
but those packages have like more sodium than they do rice. So 
 it is so much sodium and this doesn't have that sodium

00:01:28.654 --> 00:01:34.645
but you get the same flavorful burst of rice, like you would those packages.

00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:37.361
So it is a good healthy alternative. Thanks for watching. Bye.

00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:44.070

00:01:44.072 --> 00:01:51.110
If you missed my video from yesterday, I made spinach stuffed 
 mushrooms with this vegan cream cheese that was  

00:01:51.107 --> 00:01:57.450
already flavored with garlic and chives. And it was the best 
 appetizer I have had in a really long time.

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:03.340
So just click on the mushroom.
