00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.730
Kyle Bradshaw from Cruiser Customizing with
this Motorcycle Handlebar Tip of the Week.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.430
Last week we showed you the installation of
some 4 inch Showchrome Handlebar risers, talked

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.750
with you about handlebars, how to find the
perfect fit for your motorcycle, and how to

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.750
install them.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.630
When it comes to handlebars there are three
main dimensions: height, width and pullback.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.720
Now the easiest way to find the perfect handlebar
for your motorcycle is to measure your current

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.291
stock bars. Measure the height, the width,
and the pullback, and then set yourself to

00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:43.500
the perfect riding position you want to end
up at, and then measure the dimensions where

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.380
your hands sit. Now, to give you an idea exactly
on what size bar you need.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.130
For quite a number of years now, the rage
is to go with a thicker bar than stock. Stock

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.120
used to be 7/8s of an inch, and now, most
stock bars are 1 inch. This year, it's a 1

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.530
1/4 inch bar. For most handlebars, the area
where you attach to the triple plant, as well

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.900
as your handgrips and levers attached, you're
gonna narrow it down to one inch, so you really

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.090
have to buy all the listed hardware.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.680
When it comes to motorcycle handlebars there
are 3 desriptive words that usually throw

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.770
people off for a loop; dimple, neural, and
drill. This bar is a great example of neuraling.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.360
This neural area right here is basically cross-hatchets.
These neurals allows your razor clamp to be

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.540
able to grip the bar without slippage. Moving
over to these 3 dragbars, these pieces of

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.660
bars look absolutely identical. But they're
not. Come on in and take a closer look.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.080
This particular set of drivebars here has
been dimpled. what the dimpling does it allows

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.550
you to run your handlebar wires from the control
housing in this section; see, you don't have

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.610
a gap between your control housing and the
bar. In addition, at the center of this particular

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.409
bar, it's wider. On the pullback, it's greater.
Take a look.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.689
If I put these 2 bars side to side you can
see that the pullback is definitely greater

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:09.539
than this bar, and the center section is an
inch wider. Moving to these front two bars

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.519
you can see the center of the bars are pretty
much the same. But this particular bar right

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:17.140
here, as you can see, are about an inch and
a half wider.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.999
Another thing to look at is whether the bar
is drilled or not. This particular bar is

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:27.640
drilled up here where the switchboxing meets.
You're gonna run all your wires down to this

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.700
pore and they're gonna X at the bottom. This
is an example of a bar being drilled for internal

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.870
wiring.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.829
Now for the anatomy of handlebars lets go
ahead and install one of these drag bars onto

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:39.829
a V650 Classic.

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.499
We're gonna start this week's install, like
last week's install, by covering the tank

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.980
with a towel or cloth so we don't damage it.
Take note

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.700
of the riding position that i'm currently
in, In just a few minutes, it's gonna be drastically

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.700
changed.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:02.389
The first thing we're gonna do is to remove
the master cylinder.

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.959
Next we're gonna remove the two screws that
hold the switchbox together. Next, we're gonna

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.860
remove the wire ties that hold the electrical
on. We're gonna move to the clutch side, undo

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:22.230
the switchbox housing, remove the cable ties,
remove the clutch perch.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.150
People that replace their handlebars go ahead
and replace their stockgrips with an aftermarket

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.519
grip. But if you're gonna reuse your grip,
some really easy way to get the stock grip

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.760
off is to go ahead and remove the cap, spray
a little bit of wD40 inside this grip.Put

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.700
a little bit of WD40, and rip the slide the
cap right off.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.290
While we got everything loosened up here we're
gonna go ahead and undo these cap bolts, remove

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:54.180
everything from the bar.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.319
Now we have the top clamps off, we're gonna
go ahead and grab the handlebar, lift it up,

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.680
we can have that clutch cable right off that
side, and the throttle of this side. It's

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.159
just that simple to remove the stock handlebars
from your motorcycle. Now installing your

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.549
new aftermarket bars is just as simple.

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.980
While I was installing a taller or wider bar,
I had to go ahead and slide the controls and

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.000
cables on prior to installation into the risers.
Being this is such a nice short bar, I can

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.340
go ahead and set the bar in, start the riser
at bolts, and secure this in a position I'm

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.810
gonna want it before I slide the controls
and cables on.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.400
Once I've found that poistion I'm gonna go
ahead and hold this in place, and tighten

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.930
one of these riser bolts so the bars stand
in place so I can go ahead and snug the rest.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.280
Now that we have the bar in place we're gonna
take this clutch perch and slide it into place.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.580
Now, we'll take the control housing and set
it up here in place.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.401
Now,one of the only modifications you're gonna
have to make is going into the bar because

00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:01.450
they keep the throttle's housing steady so
that they throw out and twist.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.380
So what I'm gonna do here is slide the bar,
all the way to the end, back it off just a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:14.320
hair, and I'm gonna mark the bar where the
holes need to be drilled.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.040
Now, we're gonna hold drill. We're gonna take
our throttle housing. Secure it just like

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.260
so.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.870
Now that we have the throttle housing attached
we're gonna go and attach the master cylinder.We're

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.250
gonna go ahead and apply some grip glue here
so we can reinstall the stock grip.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.060
When you get to this step you wanna go ahead
and sit on your motorcycle.Position the bars

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.530
in the position that you're gonna want. And
then, button everything up.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:47.240
There you have it, in a matter of hour, hour
and a half, we completely modified the look

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.610
and feel of this motorcycle by swapping out
just the handlebars.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.550
The amount of monetary investment in handlebars
are so minimal. They could be the key to the

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.810
absolutely riding position.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:11.340
Take a look on our tip next week where we
show you how to swap all these black cables

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.960
to stainless steel.
