(Paul)
Welcome to Progress Rail,

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:22.121
we're based at Sandiacre in Nottingham

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.537
and we're the main manufacturer

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:24.637
of switches and crossings

00:00:24.737 --> 00:00:25.737
for the rail industry.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.303
Fabricated switches and crossings

00:00:27.403 --> 00:00:28.737
are manufactured from

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:30.205
normal pieces of rail

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:31.917
with a series of machining operations

00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:34.527
from a variation of milling, turning,

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:37.395
planing, welding and final assembly

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.795
to make bespoke products

00:00:38.895 --> 00:00:39.895
for Network Rail.

00:00:40.744 --> 00:00:42.228
(Rob)
What you're going to see today

00:00:42.328 --> 00:00:43.456
is the manufacturing process

00:00:43.556 --> 00:00:45.014
from start to finish. You're going

00:00:45.114 --> 00:00:47.209
to see the rails being cut, machined,

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.758
milled, welded, bolted together

00:00:49.858 --> 00:00:50.858
and then dispatched.

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:55.487
The first part of the process

00:00:55.587 --> 00:00:56.790
is cutting the rails to length

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.347
in the CNC saw machine.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:02.413
(Narrator)
CNC means Computer Numeric Controlled,

00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:04.445
meaning the saw mill is pre-programmed

00:01:04.545 --> 00:01:06.097
to follow an individual switch or

00:01:06.197 --> 00:01:07.372
crossing design.

00:01:08.705 --> 00:01:10.705
(Machinist #1)
Now I'll upload that program

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:11.962
from the drawing office

00:01:12.062 --> 00:01:14.551
then this machine will drill and cut

00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:16.058
to whatever is required.

00:01:21.645 --> 00:01:23.074
It is a big bit of kit,

00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:25.113
but when you consider some of the rails

00:01:25.213 --> 00:01:28.305
that it's handling, they're 120ft long,

00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:30.473
you do need a big bit of kit.

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:32.406
I've got 16 different sized drills

00:01:32.506 --> 00:01:33.729
it can choose from.

00:01:34.048 --> 00:01:36.470
I've got a tungsten carbide saw blade

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.323
which cuts through very easily.

00:01:42.972 --> 00:01:45.047
(Narrator)
Once the rails have been sawed, drilled

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:46.984
and tagged they're going to be machined

00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:48.783
into completely new shapes.

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:52.380
Planing gradually slices rails down

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.990
to narrow the profile to create sections

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.776
such as switchblades.

00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:59.195
(Machinist #2)
Well, this is a planing machine.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.187
Well it's important to get it straight,

00:02:03.287 --> 00:02:04.743
or follow the line of the curve of

00:02:04.843 --> 00:02:06.216
the bending that's in the rail.

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:08.003
Once we're going to get that gives us

00:02:08.103 --> 00:02:09.324
a true running line

00:02:09.424 --> 00:02:11.517
for when they assemble it afterwards.

00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:17.119
(Narrator)
While the planing machine slices down

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.471
the original rail in long sweeps,

00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:20.776
milling machines grind down

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:22.298
other parts of the same rail

00:02:22.398 --> 00:02:24.269
to more complex profiles

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.036
allowing it to fit into other parts

00:02:26.136 --> 00:02:27.849
of the switch and crossing layout.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.732
(Machinist #3)
It's an Elgamill milling machine.

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:32.200
There's a bit that's special about

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.042
this machine; it's got an indexing head

00:02:34.142 --> 00:02:35.796
that can work on any angle.

00:02:35.896 --> 00:02:37.685
Change the head over, it can work

00:02:37.785 --> 00:02:40.016
on any angle that comes along

00:02:40.116 --> 00:02:44.312
from vertical, horizontal, 45 degrees,

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:45.841
any sort of angle that

00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:47.089
it needs to be, like.

00:02:49.006 --> 00:02:50.795
(Narrator)
In another area of the workshop,

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:52.141
a part-welded crossing

00:02:52.241 --> 00:02:53.315
is being prepared.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.696
Two long sections of rail have been

00:02:55.796 --> 00:02:57.069
machined into shape.

00:02:57.169 --> 00:02:59.046
An insert bar is placed between them

00:02:59.146 --> 00:03:00.481
to create adequate width

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.581
and they're then raised

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.210
into the vertical to be welded together.

00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:07.841
(Welder #1)
It's an electro slide welding machine.

00:03:07.941 --> 00:03:09.560
The welding heat is derived from the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.477
electrical resistance of the slag bath

00:03:11.577 --> 00:03:13.133
to the amperage that we're using.

00:03:15.594 --> 00:03:17.607
(Narrator)
The welding takes 3 hours to complete

00:03:17.707 --> 00:03:18.994
but it's important that the weld

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:20.190
is strong enough on this

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.595
high-load component.

00:03:26.087 --> 00:03:27.326
Once joined and cooled,

00:03:27.426 --> 00:03:29.365
the V-crossing component is machined

00:03:29.465 --> 00:03:31.225
to the finished profile.

00:03:32.442 --> 00:03:33.926
The V will then need to be joined

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:35.759
to a longer rail, called a "leg".

00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:37.969
The process used is called

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.069
"flash-butt welding".

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.191
(Welder #2)
When you switch a light on at home,

00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.094
and the two connectors come together,

00:03:43.194 --> 00:03:44.582
obviously they heat up.

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:46.016
This is exactly the same process,

00:03:46.116 --> 00:03:47.675
very simple, pass electric current

00:03:47.775 --> 00:03:49.292
through these two copper plates

00:03:49.392 --> 00:03:50.556
into these two copper plates,

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:51.902
very high current,

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:53.165
it melts the end of this rail

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:54.689
by touching them together

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:56.755
and then when they become fluid enough,

00:03:56.855 --> 00:03:58.950
this side has got a big ram on it,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.479
butts it against that side

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.292
and then it becomes like one rail.

00:04:21.172 --> 00:04:22.459
And they've been pushed together

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.299
and now it's one solid piece of rail.

00:04:24.734 --> 00:04:25.857
This is a much stronger weld

00:04:25.957 --> 00:04:27.216
than a thermite weld because

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:28.316
you're actually melting

00:04:28.416 --> 00:04:29.416
the ends of the rail and

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:30.959
you're actually forming the material

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.522
and making one piece of rail.

00:04:32.622 --> 00:04:34.629
(Narrator)
At the end of the machining processes,

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.949
the switch and crossing component parts

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:39.096
are collated, checked and tagged

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:40.653
and ready to be sent off

00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:41.976
to be assembled.

00:04:48.453 --> 00:04:50.023
(Rob)
When you see the components made

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.677
at Sandiacre, it's quite hard

00:04:51.777 --> 00:04:53.061
to understand what they're for.

00:04:53.161 --> 00:04:54.570
It's only when they're assembled at

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.358
our site at Beeston it makes sense.

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.067
All the components,

00:04:58.167 --> 00:05:00.909
i.e. the jigsaw pieces come to this site

00:05:01.361 --> 00:05:02.938
and we put them together to prove

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:04.617
that the switches and crossings

00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:05.995
go together correctly.

00:05:06.795 --> 00:05:07.795
Once we've proven that

00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:08.978
they go together correctly,

00:05:09.078 --> 00:05:10.782
we will then dispatch them to site.

00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:17.828
This is one of our finished products,

00:05:17.928 --> 00:05:19.132
ready for dispatch.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.607
These switches are

00:05:21.707 --> 00:05:23.089
powered by hydrive units

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.351
in the middle of the bearers.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.686
Judging by the length of these switches

00:05:26.786 --> 00:05:29.034
these will be used in high speed rail.

00:05:29.134 --> 00:05:30.460
Some of the components we use are

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.887
cast chairs which are made at our

00:05:31.987 --> 00:05:33.102
Sandiacre site, we've got

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:34.375
screws that are screwed to

00:05:34.475 --> 00:05:35.735
the concrete bearers,

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:38.274
we've got pads to stop vibration,

00:05:38.374 --> 00:05:39.659
we've got a clip which is called

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.185
an "e-clip" which has got an insulation

00:05:42.498 --> 00:05:43.637
to stop signal failure.

00:05:49.498 --> 00:05:50.498
This is a switch rail.

00:05:50.598 --> 00:05:51.598
Look at its profile.

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.202
This started off life as a normal rail.

00:05:54.793 --> 00:05:56.607
This was manufactured, milled,

00:05:56.707 --> 00:05:57.831
bent in position

00:05:57.931 --> 00:05:59.156
at our site in Sandiacre.

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:00.784
It's quite an achievement how the rail

00:06:00.884 --> 00:06:02.027
starts off life like this,

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:04.312
and finishes with a profile like this.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.789
This is not going to be disassembled.

00:06:06.998 --> 00:06:08.362
This is a modular unit.

00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:10.502
This will be loaded by cranes onto a

00:06:10.602 --> 00:06:13.216
tilting train, and sent to site.

00:06:13.316 --> 00:06:14.770
Which, in this case, is Scotland.

00:06:22.438 --> 00:06:23.438
This is Network Rail's

00:06:23.538 --> 00:06:24.581
new modular train.

00:06:24.776 --> 00:06:26.179
This allows us to ship

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.179
switches and crossings in modular form.

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.055
This is a genius idea. Before this,

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:31.447
we used to have to dismantle the

00:06:31.547 --> 00:06:33.036
switches and crossings we'd assembled

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:34.439
and send them straight to site

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.255
for reassembly. We don't need to do this

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:37.524
any more, instead we load our

00:06:37.624 --> 00:06:39.117
pre-assembled switches and crossings

00:06:39.217 --> 00:06:40.701
to the train. We tilt the train to

00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:42.367
allow it through tunnels and stations.

00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.145
This is delivered straight to site,

00:06:44.245 --> 00:06:46.444
offloaded, saving time and money.

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:49.754
(Paul)
We're very proud of the

00:06:49.854 --> 00:06:50.854
work we do here.

00:06:50.954 --> 00:06:52.435
The manufacturing unit has been going

00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:53.855
for over 50 years.

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.343
There's a lot of skill, dedication

00:06:56.443 --> 00:06:57.971
and we pride ourselves on the

00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:59.804
quality of work that we turn out.
