00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:09.040
Dirty Hearts, deprivation, if this ever happens
to you at a table, just head under the table

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.290
if you do this because you will not be a very,
that person that you do it to will not be

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.820
a very happy camper. Let's look at the vital
parts of the elements here. Here we have a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.640
powerful six card heart suit, missing the
jack, here we have jack eight seven nine,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.590
here's the four and five, and here's a wonderfully
guarded queen with a gazillion backers and

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.860
a deuce of hearts. This hand is completely
safe. It had low clubs and diamonds. To make

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.630
a very long story short, this fellow ran a
bunch, this is the low person, this person

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.030
has the low score, this guy over here runs
a few cards in clubs and he throws a five

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.730
of hearts on him, right? Now he has the chance
to shoot the moon. He leads the ace of hearts,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.690
he plays small, he plays small, and he plays
the deuce. Now he leads the king of hearts,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.970
and he plays small, and he throws something
off, and this guy over here is wondering,

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.320
he's got it stopped, why doesn't he get rid
of his queen of spades? It's not going to

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.610
do him any good. The queens not going to stop
anything, but nope, he doesn't choose to do

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.190
that. He throws a little spade on it. And
now he leads the queen of hearts and he says

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.610
well, I can't believe he's going to do that,
but he doesn't throw the jack to him, he plays

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.560
another one, and now when he leads the ten
of hearts, he plays the jack, and he blasts

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.120
him with the queen and says, oh that's what
you get for stopping the moon. I mean, you

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.120
punish the person who stopped the moon to
help you out and the low guy gets out pretty

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.260
cheaply and this guy gets out of the game
because you held the queen to stop, to hit,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.090
the guy that stopped it instead of the hearts
being split twenty-four and two, you held

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.260
onto the queen until he went up and then you
hit him and then you make the comment congratulations

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.299
it's a girl and that will really gather the
ire of your opponents so that's just, that's

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.979
a dirty play and it makes no sense to hold
the queen for the person who stops the moon

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.109
and it's not nice.
