00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.490
And all I'm going to do is, I've got my cake
on my turntable.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.180
I have my rolling pin.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.360
And the best way is just to start at the edge
and roll towards you, and if you find there

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.150
are any big, kind of clumps of dry stuff on
the bottom, just brush them off with your

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.590
hands.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.060
And this is just the easiest way to transfer.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.730
Now that I have it, I can just lift up my
rolling pin.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.080
Make sure you're going far enough away from
the edge that it's not going to cut into the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.050
cake, so I'm starting kind of on the side.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.170
And just gently rolling over and releasing.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.789
And you definitely want to have extra.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.670
You don't necessarily need this much extra,
but you definitely want to have extra.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.399
So, a good thing to do at this point is just
kind of immediately, just to trim a little

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.399
bit.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.889
So, with my paring knife, I'm just trimming
off a bit of excess fondant because I have

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:02.389
too much here.

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:06.010
And don't feel like you have to get rid of
anything you don't use.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.440
Just knead it back together.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.399
Make sure you wrap it up really tight, and
you can see immediately, just like Play-Doh,

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.700
it comes right back together and you can use
it later.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.880
So, all I'm going to do is gently rub the
surface.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.020
Make sure there are no air bubbles, and work
my way down.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.390
And you're starting right at the top, and
if you see any folds, just as you go, you're

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.060
doing this very gently, and as it goes down,
it's just going to kind of start to stretch

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.420
itself out and become like a little skirt.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.510
You can see I'm just moving around my cake
and rubbing.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.700
And once I get toward the bottom, I can just
kind of keep going and seal my edges.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.490
Now is a great time for my smoother.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.749
Just kind of give it a quick rub and that
should smooth down any big bumps that I have.

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:09.289
Same thing, I can go around my sides if I
want to.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.990
And you're really looking for kind of 90 degree
angles.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.300
And here's the time when I would just start
to trim.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.640
And if there are any little imperfections,
keep in mind you're going to be covering it

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.320
anyway with decorations, but the nicer you
can get it, the better.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.660
The problem with the bottom is if you, this
is kind of the part where you may get crumbs,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.130
so this part I just kind of get rid of, unless
you feel like it's really clean and you want

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.820
to save it, then save it, but otherwise it's
kind of unnecessary sacrifice.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.000
But I just make sure I go all the way around.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.780
Make sure it's nice and smooth.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.480
And that is it.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.980
So, that's a quick way to cover a cake with
fondant.
