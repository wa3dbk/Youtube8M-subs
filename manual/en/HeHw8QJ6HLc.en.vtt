00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:12.685
So, we're lighting a Tulikivi stove here.

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:32.201
Never knew you could open up the bottom part there.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.620
Open what?

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.580
Oh sorry, the.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.220
(Indecipherable speech.)

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.340
Oh I see.

00:00:43.783 --> 00:00:45.463
We've got good draft going there,

00:00:45.463 --> 00:00:47.359
because it's pulling it's pulling all the ash up there.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.130
I'm just going to go and check the other room,

00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:06.151
Nothing going up here but the rent. Ha ha.

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:08.964
This is great.

00:01:08.964 --> 00:01:10.161
There's no smoke here.

00:01:20.608 --> 00:01:22.688
So, I find once all that paper just poof,

00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:24.620
it's gone. Yeah.

00:01:26.054 --> 00:01:27.254
Now that's. Ha ha.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:34.262
Now it's got a real draft.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.820
Hey?

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.723
Close that trap.

00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:50.307
Oh yeah, you can really see the difference.

00:01:50.307 --> 00:01:51.817
Yeah. It was going like a jet engine

00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:53.656
before I shut the door down. Yeah.

00:01:53.656 --> 00:01:55.302
There you go. That's the deal.

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:56.900
That's the way I live.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.220
Like, I don't know if that's the way

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.080
it's supposed to be done.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.060
But it's better than the weird, better than the way before.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.075
I mean. You've got a real good draft going right now.

00:02:06.075 --> 00:02:07.613
It's going like mad right? Yeah.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.860
So now that I've got it going.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.620
Yeah. Now you add larger wood?

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.880
Yep, so again.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.500
(Voice in the background.)

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.020
I'll look for smaller pieces like this, right?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.760
Yeah.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.220
And I'll let it, wait for those to burn.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.932
Then I'll stick another set going this way.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.700
Yeah.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.872
Wait for those to ignite,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.140
and then that's it.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.660
Yeah. It's burning.

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:00.086
How're you doing?

00:03:02.228 --> 00:03:05.028
I mean it'll sometimes work the other way.

00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:06.862
where it's almost stuffed in there,

00:03:06.862 --> 00:03:09.167
but this is the way it works all the time. Yeah.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.680
Yeah. This confirms it.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.960
This is a cold flue.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.100
Definitely a cold flue yeah.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.769
So, you've got to light one of those raisers,

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:20.849
and burn kindling first,

00:03:20.875 --> 00:03:22.955
just to get this big bugger going,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.740
and now it's fine.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.936
There's still no smoke anywhere.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.880
No, and you know, I mean it does go to big wood

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720
but you have to start with that little stuff first right.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.240
Yeah. If you don't start with that little stuff.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.800
You know, I think you're right.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.240
You could say the white guy said so. Ha ha. Ha ha ha!

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.660
There we go. Yeah.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.380
And the other trick I've learned

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.820
is that both of these need to be open

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:49.640
when you first start it.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.658
Yeah. I just have everything open.

00:03:51.658 --> 00:03:54.400
Yep. You've got to get your draft going right

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.560
because it a big,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.360
it's not like it's a little,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.816
it's not like it's a stainless steel. No.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.800
And right now again,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.900
what I would be doing,

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.520
I mean I'm not going to. Use the damper.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.680
Is on the next, putting in a mud room.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.420
Yeah. And then I'd let it run like this,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.080
for usually about an hour,

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.880
then I'll come back.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:14.820
