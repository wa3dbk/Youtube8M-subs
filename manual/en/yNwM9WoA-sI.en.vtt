00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.430
the mission of the department of corrections
is to improve public safety

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.070
to accomplish this task the Washington state
penitentiary and Coyote Ridge corrections center

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.050
have partnered

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.369
with walla walla community college

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.789
offenders who meet the basic requirements

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.800
have the opportunity to obtain
an associates of arts degree while incarcerated

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.030
The courses are spectacular they work well 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.929
the teachers

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:41.620
the climate here is the same

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.380
Its real conducive to learning
offender Efram henderson

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.660
is earning an associates of arts degree
at the Washington state penitentiary

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.300
although there may be some differences between
incarcerated

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.200
Students such as Henderson and a community campus students they are 
actually more like

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.970
then you’d think

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.060
most of our guys test into college level reading

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.240
Fifty to sixty percent test right into college level writing

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.730
almost nobody tests in to the college level math

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.770
and that's really not any different than

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.650
what you find in any of the community colleges with adult students that are coming

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.620
back to school after being away for a time

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.180
The course requirements for to obtain a degree 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.729
are equivalent to community campus student requirements

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.430
and the desire to move forward from an educational standpoint is the same

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.929
whether incarcerated

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.500
or not

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.850
Most things we do here is programming  

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.220
Which a lot of people take it as being forced upon

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.000
But a lot of people haven’t had jobs on the outs before so they don't know that that's part of life

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.810
It'ss getting up, going to work, what have you

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.920
this gives you some incentive and you learn it open your eyes

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.490
Studentwise they’re  

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.340
real devoted, they’re real focused

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.080
they look at this is a really important
opportunity

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.509
to the instructor

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.019
they will tell you that their best classes
are here

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.079
The degree program started in the fall
of two thousand two

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.289
Through a grant for the Washington state
penitentiary

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:26.609
interest in the program grew to coyote ridge corrections
center

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.649
but the previous grant only funded one facility

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:34.269
the federal grant specifically for offenders
in prison was available but the paperwork

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.260
to apply was very involved

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.719
and few state agencies had the resources to complete
the application process

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.269
fortunately

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.919
Walla walla community college

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.559
Saw the benefit in applying for the grant

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.590
it was only the walla walla community college that we're
contracting with here

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.560
To provide education services that actually
took the time to do the paperwork and so they

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.810
got all the money that had been allocated in the state of Washington 
have to share with Washington state penitentiary 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.059
because the walla walla community college serves both institutions

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:09.400
I was like thinking of paying for correspondence courses

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.849
and this is was like a god’s gift in a sense to me

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:19.130
The degree program is paid for through
a private grant from the Sunshine Lady Foundation

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.930
and the US department of education incarcerated
individuals grant. 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.049
No Washington state tax dollars were used.

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.119
It's a completely grant-funded program,

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:36.869
it doesn’t involve any tax dollars and
yet it is significant in its impact on the

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:38.540
offender population

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.069
and overall offender behavior.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.260
Offenders who participate in educational programs
while incarcerated

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.470
are using their time productively

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.850
and are learning new skills and training that
make them better equipped

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.319
To successfully transition
0:03:53.319,0:03:54.819
back into the community

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.290
I think it's a great program for the people
involved

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.709
because it gives them something to do

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.849
and it just helps people interact with each
other they normally wouldn’t interact

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.439
because when you go out in the day room 
and you can see five or six seven people at a

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.039
time

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:11.989
Sitting at different tables working doing their
work

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.819
and you see people helping them

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.499
they wouldn’t normally know or people they
wouldn’t normally see

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:20.560
Trying to help them do things and get get their
work done

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.799
as a superintendent

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.620
I fell blessed that we’re able to have this opportunity

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.000
and on

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.440
truly has been very impacful

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.089
on the offender population

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:35.520
because this is an opportunity that they don't
normally get

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.309
and they have

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:41.280
Gone over and above to try and meet the standards
So that they can get in that program.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.220
Research does indicate that offenders
with at least two years of college have a

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.060
ten-percent rearrest rates

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.470
compared to a national re-arrest rate
of approximately sixty percent

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.190
We are hopeful this program will positively
impact offenders and improve

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.120
public safety .
