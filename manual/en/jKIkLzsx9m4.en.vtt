00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.270
MIRADOR is a real-time monitoring system by
Criopak USA to provide wireless temperature

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.270
monitoring

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.809
It is specifically designed to monitor the
environmental conditions of thermal equipment

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.359
and storage facilities such as temperature-sensitive
packaging, warehouses, manufacturing sites,

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.609
hospitals, and vehicles.
Monitoring temperature of trailers, reefers,

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.109
refrigerated vehicles
The system consists of wireless sensor transmitters

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.990
and receivers
The sensors can be fitted inside vehicles,

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.140
ware houses etc. and the temperature and humidity
data will be continuously recorded on to a

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.450
computer
The sensors fitted inside the vehicle will

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.870
transmit the data as well as record data when
the receiving unit is not within the range

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.390
The temperature and humidity sensor device
will be permanently fitted in the vehicle.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.480
The unit can be fitted in the driver cabin
and external sensors will be connected to

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.491
the refrigerated compartment.
The data receiving unit will be fitted in

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:02.440
the warehouse.
If the vehicle is inside the warehouse the

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.550
sensor will continuously transmit the data
to the receiving unit and data will be downloaded

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.020
into the computer
As soon as the trailer leaves the warehouse

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.290
and the wireless connection is lost, the data
will be recorded in the device inside the

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.730
vehicle automatically.
Once the vehicle comes back to the warehouse

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.360
the data will be downloaded automatically
If you have multiple warehouses and if all

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.930
of them are fitted with similar receiving
units the data will be automatically downloaded

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.710
as soon as the vehicle enters any of the warehouse.
You can have any number of vehicles in a single

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.470
warehouse and the data transmission will take
place automatically

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.390
There is a display unit in which the driver
can see the current readings

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.810
Also in case the temperature goes above limits,
the driver will be alerted through a beep

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.010
sound and L E D indication on the device

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.060
This is the sensor named as x-tag
Main features are

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.909
These are Wireless or Wired temperature and
humidity sensor

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.680
Dot matrix LCD and L E D display
It has an internal sensor and up to 5 external

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.560
sensors can be connected
Local Alarm notifications are available

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.340
Internal memory and micro S D card memory
are available

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.109
Re-chargeable battery
You can have a closer look at the device

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:25.840
This is one side of the device
This is the other side of the device

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:32.989
You can see various indications on the screen
This device can be used as a regular temperature

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:38.879
logger for quality studies or monitoring shipments.
As soon as no data is transmitted, the logger

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:44.150
mode is automatically activated. To be used
only as a logger, the device can be delivered

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.529
pre-programmed as a data logger only.
If for any reason, the device is not able

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:54.569
to transmit data to the reader or a display
unit, all data are recorded into its internal

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.769
memory. When transmission is re-established,
all data are transmitted automatically.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.950
