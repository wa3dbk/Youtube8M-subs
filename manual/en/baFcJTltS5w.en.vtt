00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.490
Anthropologist, Mary Douglas

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.850
argues that the role of food in society
reflects societal structure

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.050
and self-understanding. "Food choices," she says

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.320
"support political alignment and social opportunities

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.000
in which other levels of categorization
become manifest."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.800
Now, this insightful theorizing of food ways is applicable

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.090
to the examination of church cuisine as
well. Too often

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.480
scriptural analysis is overlooked when considering one of the most influential mechanisms

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.750
in the faith journey of Christians around the world.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.790
That's why we're talking about... 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.220
...the "church potluck" on this episode of

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.320
Chuck Knows Church.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.620
[Intro music begins]

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.320
The potluck,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.540
and many credit Thomas Nash of the
sixteenth century England for coining

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.550
the phrase to mean,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.690
"food provided for an unexpected or uninvited guest.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.700
The luck of the pot. Well anthropological
scholars too often ignore biblical

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.710
examination of the church potluck

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
the rest of us more serious students of church'ology cannot

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.190
overlook its importance when scrutinizing

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.030
this Christian cuisine. It is not merely a dinner

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.570
organized by religious communities to
simplify meal planning

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.680
and distribute the cost among its
participants. For instance,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.070
in the beginning, Genesis 9:3 says,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.149
"Every moving thing that lives shall be
food for you and as I give you the green plants

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.669
I give you the luck of the pot...

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.170
Now, potluck should not be confused
with potlatch,

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.270
which is the gift giving festival and
primary economic system practice by

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.060
indigenous peoples of the Pacific
Northwest Coast

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.780
of Canada.. [strange pause, laughing behind camera]

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.400
Instead, histology of the church potluck reveals more than just food parts,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.340
and its evolution reflects insightful
changes within the congregation

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.920
and and the larger society.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.920
In Geertzian terms, Clifford Geertz,

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.730
professor Emeritus of anthropology at
Princeton, uh, the skin on there.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.740
Church potlucks

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.820
serve communities as models of gender roles

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.550
and relations the structure of the family

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.750
and the role of the church in society.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.020
Again, evidential in Scripture. Isaiah 1:19 states,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.040
"If you are willing and obedient you shall

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.390
eat the good of the potluck"

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.840
And this illuminating Proverb,

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.350
21 verse 20, "Precious treasure and oil

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.290
are in a wise man's dwelling but a foolish man

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.520
devours only the tuna noodle casserole"
[not sure that's a literary translation Chuck]

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.980
Oh, cake..

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.910
To learn more ask your pastor, oh, and you
might want to ask about those

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.330
scripture passages, I may have misquoted a hair.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.250
Just double check my work on that.
Tell them Chuck sent ya.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.010
Let's start with dessert. dessert first, right?
And then for dessert,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.250
who am I kidding? More desert, I'm gonna I'm have more dessert
