00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.460
A good game doesn’t always make a good portable
game.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.600
Obviously, games that are being played on
the go—on a train or a subway or a...flying

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.270
stick or whatever—have a slightly different
set of standards.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.310
They should be accessible.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.890
They should be easy to jump into.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.690
They should be...you know, portable.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.220
Gaia’s Moon is all those things and more.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.250
In fact, that’s kind of the problem with
it.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:51.480
The freaking game’s so easy to jump into,
it’s kind of hard to jump back out.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.670
Released to DSiWare in early 2012 and now
available on the eShop for the Nintendo 3DS,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.739
Gaia’s Moon comes from EnjoyUp Games.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.350
You may know them as the developer behind
stuff like Abyss and 99Moves...they’ve certainly

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.450
done some interesting stuff on DSiWare, but
Gaia’s Moon might be their best.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.970
So the story is...collect the orbs.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.211
I mean, there’s something about a disturbance
in the balance of energy or something, and

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.470
there’s existential chaos...so you play
as this little boy named Atreyu.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.280
And you fly around on a...magic stick.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.820
So it’s essentially Star Wars Episode Gryffindor:
The Neverending Story Strikes Back.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.470
The Phantom...Racing Snail.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.920
This is part of what I touched on earlier...portable
games having their own goals.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.420
This kind of game doesn’t need some elaborate
story.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.100
It throws you right into the gameplay, wasting
no time in introducing you to its mechanics

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.280
and getting you hooked.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.830
And yes, you’re definitely getting hooked.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.340
Beware, commuters...you may miss your stop.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.320
And you don’t have a Luck Dragon to fly
you back.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.920
Gaia’s Moon is a simple side-scrolling action
game based on momentum.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.170
It’s so simple, in fact, that it only uses
a single button.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.130
Hold it down, and Atreyu pulls up and gains
some elevation.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.980
Let go, and he inspires a crappy metalcore
band.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.980
Actually, he loses elevation, which can be
more useful.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.450
So it’s this constant balancing of momentum.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.550
You have to avoid obstacles and collect enough
energy to make it to the end.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.989
So the gameplay is really tight and precise,
but what I like most about Gaia’s Moon is

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:35.989
the way it looks.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.530
I mean, it’s not a stunning game, but there’s
a real charm to its style.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.430
The sprites are nice, and the colors have
this soft, almost pastel quality.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.150
This is a very pretty game...easily the most
attractive I’ve played from EnjoyUp.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.410
Now, EnjoyUp games aren’t known for having
a lot of content.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.490
And Gaia’s Moon is no different.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.100
But it does have an interesting two-player
mode.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.120
“Interesting” in that...it’s two players
for one DS.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.859
One character on the bottom screen, one on
the top.

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.340
One person using a button, the other using
the d-pad.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.340
This is exactly the kind of stuff I like to
see on DSiWare and the eShop.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.020
Games that are not only good games, but good
portable games.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.859
This is the kind of game that makes the minutes
in the bus, the car, the waiting room...seem

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.250
to fly by.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.480
It’s Gaia’s Moon for the Nintendo DSi.
