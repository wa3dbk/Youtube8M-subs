Hi I'm Sarah and this is Andrea, and we are
from the lifestyle blog Peanut Buttered.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:10.350
Welcome to keep calm and bake, today we are
going to be making breakfast bars.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.929
[music]
So it is the new year, it is January, we have

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.550
all over-indulged a little bit at Christmas,
we are trying to be a little bit better

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.000
A little.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.510
So to start we are going to heat some condensed
milk on the stove top.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.500
So it is just going to be for a couple of
minutes until it thins out.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.990
You just need to keep a close eye on it so
it does not burn and keep stirring.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.820
So I have 300 grams of rolled oats in my big
mixing bowl, we are going to add our pumpkin

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:45.750
seeds and sesame seeds, coconut, goji berries,
great sleep food there, such a good super

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.870
food, full of nutrients, dried cranberries
there, orange zest.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.800
For the full list of ingredients just check
the description box below.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.070
So we are going to mix all this up.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.020
This is a really versatile dish.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.480
You could add any kind of nuts you would like,
different kinds of seeds, dates, for extra

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.570
added sweetness some sultanas, dried apple,
it is really versatile.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.659
Just as long as you keep the ratios about
the same as what we have got here.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.909
That almost looks just as good to have it
on its own with just some milk or something

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:13.909
as a breakfast

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.429
Yeah or sprinkled over some yogurt.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:17.090
Oh yeah that would be delicious.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.069
Let us know what you like to add to your muesli
or breakfast bars in the comments below or

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:22.069
on Twitter.

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:24.549
So the milk thinned out now so we are just
going to pour it into the mixture.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.549
Just go nice and slowly.

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:34.700
Pour it all over so it gets a good coverage.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.349
Okay that is looking good we will just get
the last little bit in and I will give it

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:40.630
a really good mix through.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.759
At this point it starts to get really sticky
so you have to try and not get it all over

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:45.929
the bench, first of all.

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:47.099
Keep it in the bowl.

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:50.169
And just try and make sure everything in the
bowl is really coated.

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:53.579
And you do not want any dried bits.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.579
No.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:55.579
Okay, this is looking good.

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.990
We are going to get it into our baking dish
now, I have oiled it up so it should not stick.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.990
You can really smell the orange zest coming
through now.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.990
It is lovely.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.349
It smells really fresh, it is perfect for
morning.

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:11.469
We are trying to get the surface as even as
possible.

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:16.489
We have pre-heated the oven to 130 and the
length of cooking time really depends on how

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.720
you like your breakfast bars, how do you like
yours?

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720
Chewy.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720
Chewy?

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720
Definitely.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.129
I like mine chewy as well so we are going
to bake for about 45 minutes.

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:29.010
If you like yours crunchy and a bit darker
in color just keep going, 55 to 56 minutes

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.010
will do it.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.450
So we have taken the breakfast bar mix out
of the oven and we have let it cool down to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.450
about room temperature.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.730
We are going to cut these up now.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.610
And we are going to go off and enjoy them.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.129
And for more recipes we will see you next
time on keep calm and bake.
