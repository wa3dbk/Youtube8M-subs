00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.879
After we have made all 36 pieces for the Kusudama,
we are going to string them together. This

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:16.650
is the order that we are going to string it.
Half of the Kusudama is made up of one single

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:29.460
individual piece, a string of six, a ring
 - I'm sorry - a ring of six, and a ring of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:39.590
eleven, that is half. The other half is the
same: one, six, eleven. Take your thread and

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:49.260
needle, double-thread the thread, take your
individual piece, and pierce your needle right

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.399
through the base of the piece, right in half,
so that you half four sections on one side,

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:08.420
and four sections on the other side. String
your needle through, and string all six in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:36.930
this manner. Two more. Last one. And after
you have done that, push them together loosely,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.909
you don't want them too tight. You don't want
them too loose either. Hold it together, and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:02:06.950
tie a knot. I like to tie three square knots.
One more. Take your scissors, cut off the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:21.790
loose ends, and take some glue, and put a
dab of glue right on that knot to ensure that

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:32.780
your knot won't come undone. That is one ring.
So, make a ring of six, make another ring

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.230
of six, and make two rings of eleven.
