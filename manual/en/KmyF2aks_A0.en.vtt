speaking with Marie-Hélène Labrie, Vice-President,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.570 position:80%
Government Affairs and Communications with Enerkem.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 position:98%
Thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us today. Hello.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.690 position:98%
First off, tell us about your key product, key products and services.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.480
Alright.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.940 position:75%
Enerkem is a Canadian company that has developed

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:21.960 position:97%
green technology to convert residues and sorted waste into renewable fuel and green chemicals.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.560 position:98%
So the company has that technology, is developing, in fact, we are developing our own

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.260 position:98%
ethanol production plants, the second generation, cellulosic ethanol, green chemicals, so

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.600 position:97%
methanol that can in fact finally replace the use of petroleum in our fuel or in plastic

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.760 position:98%
manufacturing, since these green chemicals also replace the use of petroleum.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.450 position:98%
At the same time it allows us to meet objectives for reducing greenhouse gases with

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.210 position:97%
renewable fuel, and in that regard we are meeting many objectives.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.240 position:83%
What opportunities have you found in foreign markets?

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.900 position:98%
There is great demand all around the world for renewable fuels.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.210 position:98%
Several countries, including the United States, have introduced regulations to ensure a

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:17.480 position:97%
minimum level of renewable fuels in their gasoline, in their biodiesel so at the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.360
beginning you start mixing.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.630 position:81%
The objectives are often a five percent ethanol mix,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.280 position:61%
for example, in gasoline and biodiesel.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.930
Often it's two percent.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.400 position:72%
Some now have objectives of a ten percent mix.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.170 position:97%
It's regulated and the objective is really to reduce our dependence on petroleum, so

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.160 position:86%
energy security is very important in the United States,

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.780 position:58%
and pretty much all around the world.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.200 position:97%
And at the same time, all the reduction objectives I would say for, or really objectives

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.380 position:97%
to find solutions to managing waste, so waste reduction, since we can take the final

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.290 position:97%
waste produced after recycling and composting and keep it out of the landfill.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.820 position:98%
There are a great deal of opportunities because we are finding, we are trying to find

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.090 position:97%
solutions and in fact with that waste we, what we do is we recycle the carbon and hydrogen

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.280 position:97%
molecules that are in the waste that we are putting in a hole and in fact we can recycle

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.170
it and turn it into renewable fuel.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.990 position:95%
So there are a whole lot of opportunities all over the world.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.100 position:98%
For now we are concentrating mainly on the North American market, but we're in talks with

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.280 position:66%
various partners, yes, all over the world.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.230 position:98%
But what is the importance of doing business internationally for Enerkem?

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.590 position:98%
Listen, our technology is really at the heart of the world's environmental,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.330
economic and energy issues.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.790 position:97%
So we're meeting a demand that is really there, that is worldwide.

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.460 position:97%
It's essential for us and we really see ourselves as, the vision is to be a multinational,

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.830 position:91%
so we have these technologies, we are world as our market.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.050 position:97%
Tell me a little about the challenges you've had to face in the United States.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.530 position:97%
In fact, one of the major challenges, or among the challenges, I would say that in terms

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.540 position:97%
of marketing intelligence, you have to be very familiar with the regulations, understand

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.650 position:97%
the market, so you have to take the time to get to know the market, understand the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.240 position:98%
regulations because every country is different and often every state is different or in

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.330 position:98%
Canada every province is different so you have to take the time to have the right resource people

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:26.120 position:97%
also to help at the local level. You also have to develop relationships with potential partners,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:32.190 position:97%
which for us would be the people with the raw materials we use, waste, and then we develop

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:40.740 position:98%
projects for plants, fuel production plants, often with cities that have this waste and are trying to

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.180 position:98%
find solutions. So you have to find the right partners to work with at the local level and it can

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.190 position:97%
also be in terms of local investment as well, to have a local partner for building those plants.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.350 position:98%
So at various levels, you have to get the right network of partners and contacts on the ground.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.870 position:97%
How did you meet these challenges? Our Vice-President, Business Development, this is one

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.000 position:98%
of his main responsibilities so there are a number of conferences we attend that allow us

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.970
to create these relationships.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.290 position:63%
We have people calling us from all over.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.880 position:97%
We have the entire network of trade commissioners also that we work with so all this

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.210 position:97%
really enables us to develop relationships, and to know in all this who the credible

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.320 position:84%
player is that we should partner with in our projects.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.250 position:97%
I'd like to talk about the Trade Commissioner Service in a moment, but how has the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:32.050 position:97%
economic situation affected Canadian businesses like Enerkem, for example, in the United

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:40.600 position:97%
States? Listen, for us, the demand is there, so certainly the energy, economic and

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.290 position:73%
environmental issues remain in terms of demand.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.930
The market is there.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.530 position:97%
With Obama elected, in fact, the momentum is growing for what we do.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.600 position:67%
So in that regard there has been no change.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.070 position:97%
What has perhaps changed is the financial markets and what we see today with regard to

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.080 position:98%
the situation on financial markets since these are projects that require a lot of

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.550 position:97%
capital, a capital investment, it's certainly true that now it is more complex to find

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.700 position:72%
financing that covers us for all our projects.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.790 position:66%
We have a pretty big pipeline of projects.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.240 position:97%
So this may slow down our growth a bit at that level, but we are still growing and still hiring.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:21.870 position:97%
We've gone from 20 employees to 50 employees in one year, so. Wow.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.290 position:98%
And how has the Trade Commissioner Service helped your company? In fact, it's pretty much

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.320 position:98%
our ongoing communication with them that keeps us abreast of the opportunities they see

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.540 position:97%
on the ground, such as in the United States, where they'll inform us about certain calls

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.360
for tenders in various states.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.200 position:97%
The Chairman of our Board of Directors went to China to attend a conference.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.870 position:98%
We took advantage of this to organize meetings between the Chairman of our Board of

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.600 position:98%
Directors and the various players in China as well as in Japan, so we worked with the

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.470 position:97%
Canadian Embassy there and even with the Délégations du Québec, worked together to

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.860 position:72%
organize everything, coordinate, work with us.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.810
And it was a success.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.660
It worked out very well.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:12.100 position:98%
What advice would you give Canadian businesses looking to expand internationally?

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:17.890 position:97%
Well I think you have to take the time to, in terms of the demand on the ground, to understand the

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:24.370 position:97%
reality of the local market, whether in terms of regulations or partners, and to

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:27.900 position:94%
understand whether your technology really meets their needs.

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.700 position:98%
You also need to partner with people locally to properly understand how to do business in

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.070
that country.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:37.580 position:97%
You can't do business in China the way you do it in the United States.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.640 position:92%
So you really have to understand the local culture as well.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:45.280 position:98%
It's important to be well equipped beforehand and to have the right partners, the right

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.630 position:59%
people, the right advisors around you.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.510 position:77%
Thank you very much, Marie-Hélène, and good luck.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:50.460
Thank you very much.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.060
It's been a pleasure.
