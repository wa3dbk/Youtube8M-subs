00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.581
What I have in my hands here now is a blood
python. It's a member of the boid family.

00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:12.550
Again this is a python. This particular guy
is still pretty young. These guys get about

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.880
five to six feet at max. They rarely get up
to nine. Like I said, that is very rare. These

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.640
are a very stocky snake. As you can see they
tend to be very, very thick. Even once full

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.689
grown, they look short and stumpy almost.
He's being kind of a poop today, he doesn't

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.089
want to settle down for me. But, usually they
are relatively...as long as they're captive

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:41.629
born, relatively easy going snakes to keep.
If it's wild caught they do tend to be a little

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.219
bitey, and a little aggressive sometimes.
As you can see, they are gorgeous snakes.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.940
They're called blood pythons because of the
blood red color that many of them attribute.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.739
This one in particular doesn't have a lot
of red on him though you may see more as he

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.800
gets older. On this guy we can see that his
snout and head is a little bit more interestingly

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.530
shaped. It kind of does a little upturned
bit. You see it kind of comes down and goes

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.109
up a little bit again. This is a terrestrial
snake, as how big and bodied he is. These

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:19.429
guys spend a lot of time in leaf litter and
bushes in their natural environment. And what

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:23.180
he would do is he would bury himself down
in that leaf litter, leaving only his head

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.939
exposed. And that little nose, upturned bit
will help him...he doesn't want to look at

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.130
you guys....will help him keep that upturned
nose out of the substrate and help him watch

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.579
out for prey a little bit better. Again, since
he is a boa, python rather, part of the boid

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:46.020
family, he does have the heat pits, though
they're not very pronounced, on the lips of

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.899
the upper part there, and you can see him
flicking his tongue out as he smells. Again,

00:01:52.899 --> 00:02:00.579
these guys come out of like, Suriname, is
where you find them mainly. They are a very

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.960
beautiful species, and actually pretty easy
to keep. These are a kind of a prairie low-lands

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.920
kind of snake, not tropical. You keep them
in kind of an arid, hot environment as opposed

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.210
to any kind of high humidity. So, gorgeous
snake and a wonderful specimen of the boid

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.249
family.
