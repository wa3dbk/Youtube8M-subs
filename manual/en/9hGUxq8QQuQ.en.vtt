(music)

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.869
Paul Bauer: The NIU School of Music was invited

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:17.869
to participate in presenting the latest, cutting
edge video technology for Internet 2.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.890
Dan Nichols: We were demo-ing specific type
of Internet 2 technology called LOLA, which

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.469
stands for Low Latency. It’s a videoconferencing
technology that is ground-breaking in the

00:00:26.469 --> 00:00:31.640
sense that it is faster than anything else
developed for this application so far. We

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.440
had a demo from Northern Illinois all the
way to Raleigh, North Carolina to an Internet

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.750
2 member conference out there and that’s
approximately 700 miles or 1100 kilometers

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.940
as the crow flies. We were able to get the
distance down to effectively a 35 milliseconds

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.010
of latency, which musically translates to
35 feet. It’s like being on the opposite

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.550
side of the stage from the musician across
the United States from you.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.860
Paul Bauer: We demonstrated it by performing
an incredibly intricate, interactive, rhythmic

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.820
piece of music. It was highly effective, musicians
felt like they were interacting with each

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.600
other. It was a rewarding experience for them
musically. That in turn then prompts other

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.569
musicians to give this a try. People are talking
about rehearsing an advance of guest appearances

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.240
where you might have the guest artist come
and normally they would come the day before

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.020
and you would have a very compressed schedule
and maybe not enough time to practice and

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.859
prepare as you would like. Now, we could rehearse
weeks or months in advance together before

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.450
they come on site. And it would produce a
much more comfortable and more artistic performance

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.060
and listening experience. This is very important
for NIU because this is not the first time,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.429
this is probably the third or fourth time
Internet 2 has come to us to demonstrate leading

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:57.149
technologies as used on Internet 2. And as
we continue to be called upon to demonstrate

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.799
this, we reinforce our position as leaders
in the country and even internationally in

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.399
use of technologies on Internet 2.
