00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.130
Target area for foil is the smallest target
area of all the sword types. It is my trunk

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.980
and my back and that's it. My arms, my legs,
and my head are excluded so your target area

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.650
and when you are making any kind of attack
you are aiming for this prime area. Every

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.039
once in a while there are some different sorts
of flicks or flushers you might hit the back

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.820
of a fencer but most of the time this is what
you are aiming for so this is how we divide

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.890
the target area. It's as if there is a cross
across my middle. Then we use numbers to describe

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.370
each part of that cross. This quadrant is
four, this quadrant is six, this one is seven

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.790
and this one is eight and the numbers are
the same on my opponent so every time someone

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.920
makes an attack you can divide the idea of
the quadrant into these four sections. The

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.789
ones you will be using most frequently are
your four and your six. Another important

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.969
concept to understand is the concept of point
in line. If I have a point in line in foil

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:11.179
fencing it means that my foil is actually
aiming at target area on my opponent so the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:19.090
tip of my sword is pointed at four, six, seven,
and eight. Also to have my point in line my

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.520
arm has to be extended and I have to have
a straight arm. It is really important when

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.829
you are establishing right away which we will
talk about soon. So again, target area four,

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:34.759
six, seven and eight. It is only the trunk,
the front, and the back and when you are making

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:42.469
a thrust you are going to employ one of those
four target areas so let's demonstrate. I

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.749
would like to demonstrate each of the four
attacks that we just discussed so Syria is

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:52.799
here to help me again and we'll show four,
six, seven, and eight. Again in foil you can

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.309
only attack with the tip of your sword. Only
thrusts are legal so each time I hit I am

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:11.319
hitting with the tip of my sword. I'll thrust,
two, four, thrust two, six thrust two, seven,

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:32.209
thrust two, eight. One more time; four, six,
seven, eight. Now each of those thrusts has

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.620
uses that are better at different times each
are used for different strategies and they

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.730
are accompanying periods for each but those
are your basic moves. In the beginning you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.150
will find that you use four and six much more
often than the other two.
