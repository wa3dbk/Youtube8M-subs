Now that we've got that explation out of the
way...of the lining, and how to leave the

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.130
opening, I'm going to show you how to sew
the lining on. And what we're going to do

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.570
is put the right sides of the fabric together.
This is the right side; the side that you

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.000
want to see on the outside of the coin purse,
and this is of course, the wrong side, and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.020
that's the wrong side also. So lets put right
sides together, and that just means laying

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.740
them across eachother like this. And if you'll
remember, I made it a little bit short...a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.990
little half an inch short and I'll show you
how to fix that. And I think I had told you

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.969
that I was gonna leave the opening here, so
lets go ahead and sew this one first.

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.469
And all I'm going to do is run this seam along
the side of the zipper just on top of the

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:49.150
seam I already made to sew the zipper to the
body. So let's attach one side of the lining.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.260
And it doesn't matter if you're thread doesn't
match because it's going to be on the inside

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.789
and no one will ever see it. Make sure that
you back tack, top and bottom so that it won't

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.610
come apart. I like to keep my threads trimmed
while I'm sewing so I don't have to deal with

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.640
them later. Okay, so now we're going to make
the opening side of the coin purse... the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.640
hole that we're going to flip it through.
And since it's a little bit short, what I'm

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.780
gonna do, I'm just gonna pull it through to
where it does match the end. See...and it's

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.890
a little bit tight there...and that's only
becuase we want the lining to fit real smooth

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.530
inside that little coin purse. So, to create
the opening, I'm going to need about this

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.090
much room to flip it through. So I'm going
to run a seam from here to here, and tack

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.530
it real good, and then from here to here.
So I'm going to do that right quick. Back

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.970
tack real nice there...and another one right
here....let me cut these threads. And since

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.460
we've done that, I'm going to flip it out
and do a little top sewing around the top

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.210
to the zipper before we actually get started
finishing this up, so lets do that real quick.
