O'kay so a great thing to have around the
house all the time whether you have friends

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:10.720
over right now or they could be coming potentially
in 20 minutes or for dropping guests is to

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.870
have nuts on hands, little nibbly things and
this recipe that is a nut recipe may seem

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.669
unusual but I promise you it's great. Not
only that, but the house will smell fantastic

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:30.599
if you cook this. What I am doing is I am
starting by separating one egg. All we need

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:39.780
is one egg white because that is going to
be the binding ingredient for when I add about

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.519
a heaping tablespoon. It is not baking, it
is not science, just cooking and art. Then

00:00:47.519 --> 00:01:00.809
I am going to add a quick little bit of some
sugar and some salt, just a few shakes. I

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.460
am going to stir that altogether which makes
this kind of goo and I know that it does not

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.610
look terribly attractive at the moment. Okay
so we have this not terribly appealing looking

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.770
goo right now, I promise it is good. This
recipe will make one pound of curried almonds

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.740
so the ratio is very easy to remember, one
egg white, one tablespoon of mild curried

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:35.720
unless you want a little more heat and then
one pound of raw almonds. Then when people

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:43.890
say oh my gosh that is such an usual nut recipe,
it is not that you bought it at the store,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.210
you made it yourself. Before they even taste
it they will smell it because honestly the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.280
house smells amazing. Now you will see right
next to me I have prepared my cookie sheet

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.219
rather. You can either line it with parchment
paper or with aluminum foil or you can go

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.530
right directly on it and it is just that the
curry will stay on the cookie sheets and I

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.440
like my cookie sheets to stay nice looking
and so I just spoon it right on to there and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.280
they stick together and that's okay because
that is the way it is supposed to look. Spread

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.110
those out nice and evenly and place them in
a 325 degree oven for 25 to 30 minutes depending

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.140
on how roasted you like them. The smell will
let you know when they are ready and that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.830
is it, put them into little bowls and your
guests will love them.
