00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.030
Before spraying, be sure you have proper personal
protective equipment including a goggles,

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.840
gloves, respirator, and full Tyvek suit including
a hood.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.560
Apply a generous amount of lube to secure
the nozzle.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.300
Here we are using the cone tip to start our
application.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.070
Today we are using the fast rise kit to spray
this open wall cavity.In opening up a kit

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.512
you need to ensure that you have the proper
tanks A &amp; B. Check to ensure your applying

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:42.512
the proper hose to the proper.

00:00:42.512 --> 00:00:50.550
Once the tanks are at the optimum temperature
of 85, shake the kits to ensure proper discharge

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.170
of products.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.500
Prime the gun by spraying some product out
the nozzle into a disposable container to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.989
get a smooth flow and mixing in the nozzle.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:08.270
Today we are applying an air sealant with
a fan tip which will spray out the product

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:18.080
wider and a thinner application.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:27.520
Apply spray foam at a 1-2 inch thickness.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:40.780
If your job requires more than one inch, apply
the first layer then let it cure tack free

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:49.460
before applying another layer of foam.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.250
The spray foam curing time is approximately
45 seconds.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.160
If you stop spraying for more than 30-45 seconds
or spray constantly for 6-8 minutes, the foam

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:11.340
inside the tip will cure and harden.If you
continue to spray with a blocked nozzle, the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.340
foam will back up into the gun and throw the
pressure ratios off.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.340
The tips snap on and off very easy so a replacement
is very quick.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:25.730
We are going to switch to a cone nozzle tip
for the next application.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.730
The cone tip provides a different application
when applying an air sealant by dispensing

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:51.920
more product in a smaller area.The 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.860
horizontal application technique is easier
to control and faster than passing up and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:25.640
down using the cone tip.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:37.709
If you can see where you are spraying then
Fast Rise is the product to be used in all

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:57.760
Open face surfaces or cavities.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.550
All the surfaces need to be free of dirt and
moisture or your foam will not adhere properly

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:34.129
to the surface.
