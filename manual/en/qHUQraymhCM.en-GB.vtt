00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.460
What do you want from me?

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.640
What's this? Aah.. Cool

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.740
Thank you, boy

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.900
Fletcher Rockwood!

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.740
Oh! It is so lovely to see you!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
I knew.. I knew we'd encounter each other again

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.280
Didn't think you would've gotten this low, though

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.240
All those years in hiding have reduced you to tormenting

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.320
and terrorising young wizards!

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.540
What is it you want from me?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.180
What we have always wanted...

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.340
It's gone

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.160
It's all over now

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.600
He came back once before

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.760
and he'll do it again

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.620
Pity you won't be there to see it, though! -- STOP!

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:36.237
Wait.. there's something in my bag

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.900
Ohh I have no need for your stolen wands, Fletcher

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.480
Oooh it's not just wands. C'mon, have a look inside

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.940
Oww.. well I do like a good surprise!

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.220
Accio!

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.860
Pretty bag.. Steal it from a Muggle?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.840
Someone has been busy..

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.960
Love potion?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.900
One whiff of that--

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.100
CAMERON CAIRNDUFF (Director &amp;Writer): If somebody had told me at the age of nine

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.060
that I'd still be obsessing with the world of Harry Potter twelve years later... 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.420
I'd have said 'of course'!

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.820
'I couldn't've imagined anything else'

00:04:07.935 --> 00:04:10.575
But.. you would've thought that at the age of 16 or 17

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.060
 that I would've gotten over my obsession with the magical world

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:20.354
If anything, my obsession grew, growing up with Harry, Ron and Hermione

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.600
and, in many ways, knowing them better than I knew my own classmates

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.280
And in 2007 when the series ended I, like millions of you, stood in the edge of Platform 9 3/4

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.660
and waved them goodbye in a huge cloud of steam 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.260
And since then... I've had a strange empty hole in my heart

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.260
My blood is a 30-minute action-packed adventure

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.260
which would take fans back to the heart of the wizarding community

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.840
but this time we'll be encountering a new hero

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.880
Our story itself is written with the help of many Harry Potter fans

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.500
We explored the online communities such as Pottermore, Mugglenet and Harry Potter fan forums

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.460
to find out what you, the fans, wanted

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.420
Along with our cast of over a 100 actors and including an award-winning actor from the show Game of Thrones

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.240
we hope to bring you the ultimate fan film

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.614
Of course, as much as I miss Harry, and as passionate as I am about the books and world

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:28.935
I wouldn't want to bring it back for one moment: the guy has faced his foes and earned himself a peaceful life

00:05:28.935 --> 00:05:31.874
However, what about the remaining students?

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.700
In Hogwarts, 2014

00:05:33.994 --> 00:05:37.594
Well, I, being a writer and a film-maker, want to find out

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.700
But we need your help

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.280
In order to make what is possible, we understand that attention to detail is key

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.600
This means that sets costs you, make-up and locations are incredibly vital when creating a high production value

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.580
So, you've seen what we can do without a budget...

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.555
Now let's see what we can do with one!

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.640
The film is completely non-profit and I have an intention to share it with you

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.440
and millions of viewers from around the world, and you can get involved from day one

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.200
We have a wide range of awards on offer including the Potterheads digital download package

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.600
Which features the extended edition of the film

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.700
Along with a soundtrack composed by a 60-piece string orchestra

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.260
So, to conclude: thank you ever so much for watching our film today

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.635
and if I could ask you to share it to your friends, family or just anyone who loves movies in general

00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:34.855
It'd really help to make this big dream a reality
