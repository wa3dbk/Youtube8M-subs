This is the AeroPress, it makes great coffee
quickly and very easily.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.580
Just remove the filter cap from the chamber.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.540
Put a new filter in.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.140
Put the cap back on, and place the camber onto cup.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.540
or you can use a base station.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.040
Use the funnel, and add a couple of scoops of coffee,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:34.440
depending on how strong you like
your coffee.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:50.070
Then add water and stir for a short while.

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.909
This is the plunger, this goes
into the top of the chamber.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:17.040
Push down for around twenty to thirty seconds, forcing the
water through the coffee and into the cup.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.340
Then you have a coffee. The AeroPress
is very easy to clean.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.040
Just take the cap off.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.240
Force the plunger through the end, and the
coffee comes out.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.840
Enjoy your drink, cheers!
