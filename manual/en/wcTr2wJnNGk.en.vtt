I handled everything
from robbery, homicides--

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.248
I got tired of it, and I thought
this would be an easier life.

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:19.051 line:85%
Cheers.

TOM:
<i> Money was flowing,
 every chair was filled,</i>

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:33.099
<i> and there was a line
 going out the door.</i>

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.868

 a toll on him.</i>

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:44.743
As a detective,
I'd walked into a house,

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:48.280
and there was a dead
one-year-old baby there,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.551
and the mother and father
were playing video games.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.719

To beautiful women.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.229
<i> And as the drinking got
 more out of control,</i>

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.864

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.070 line:0%

I'm getting a table!
Give me a second!

in three months,

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.699
I'm done. It's over.
