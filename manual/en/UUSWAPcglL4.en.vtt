00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:19.960
This 8th generation Honda Civic was
introduced in Europe in 2006.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.780
The car stood out with
its bizarre appearance.

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:32.200
You either like the looks or not,
but it got the Red Dot Design Award.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.834
That's a big award
in the world of design.

00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:41.395
The modern design of the Civic
has some advantages.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:47.180
It has a huge trunk, larger than
that of the BMW 3-series at the time.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.685
It's also 100 L bigger than the
competition: Golf, Ford Focus, etc.

00:00:54.113 --> 00:00:58.634
There isn't much head
space in the back, though.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:04.548
Keep that in mind when
buying this car with kids.

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:11.840
Small kids will be fine, but taller
ones will be less comfortable.

00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:19.232
The interior is very driver focussed.
Everything I need is within reach.

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:25.471
I can even reach for the A/C
right next to the steering wheel.

00:01:25.897 --> 00:01:29.152
The model got a facelift in 2009.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:35.138
That model can be recognized by
its open air intakes in the grille.

00:01:35.138 --> 00:01:38.727
It interrupts the continuous
bar of the headlights.

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:42.830
The rear bumper of the facelift
is a little different as well.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:52.588
Engines start with a 82 hp 1.4,
up 'til the 197 hp Civic Type R.

00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:59.725
There's also a diesel engine,
a 2.2 CTDI with 138 hp.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.750
ENGINES
gasoline, diesel

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.568
About 130 Civic hatchbacks of this
gen are for sale on AutoScout24.

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:20.369
More Civics are for sale, but those are
hybrid sedans; completely different cars.

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:22.144
We won't go over those in this video.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.398
80% of the hatchbacks has a gasoline
engine, the other 20% has a diesel.

00:02:30.988 --> 00:02:43.064
About 93% has a manual gearbox,
7% has an automatic.

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:49.624
A lot of cars have A/C standard.
Climate control is rarer.

00:02:49.624 --> 00:02:55.053
About 65% has it,
80% has a form of A/C.

00:02:55.483 --> 00:03:02.719
If you want a Civic, prices start
at 6,500 euros for high mileage cars.

00:03:03.775 --> 00:03:09.058
It ends at 17,000 euros
for a young Type R.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.950
PRICES
minimum, average, maximum

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.792
There are some things
to watch out for.

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:24.361
There have been a number of recalls,
for the older cars in particular.

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:32.317
The first cars had problems with the
rear springs, which needed replacing.

00:03:33.338 --> 00:03:39.998
Next, water would collect at
the fuel pump plug thing.

00:03:40.547 --> 00:03:46.356
It would corrode, stalling the engine
or it just wouldn't start.

00:03:46.916 --> 00:03:49.621
That got a fix as well.

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:54.622
Then, the first Civics in particular,
had a problem with the parking brake.

00:03:54.622 --> 00:04:03.578
The release button's spring was put in
wrong side up, so it released itself.

00:04:03.578 --> 00:04:09.340
That's not convenient when parking the car
on an incline with the parking brake on.

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.664
You get out and the car will roll away.

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:14.805
That needed to be fixed as well.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.022
Other things to watch out for?

00:04:17.786 --> 00:04:22.105
The braking fluid needs to be checked
thoroughly once every 3 years.

00:04:22.105 --> 00:04:24.697
That's important with this car.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:33.369
Then, the interior often shows wear, 
especially on the high mileage cars.

00:04:33.369 --> 00:04:39.035
Check for wear and tear in places
where you'd expect it:

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:44.850
the seats' sides where you rub
against when getting in and out.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.583
Usually you'll see wear
at these spots first.

00:04:49.082 --> 00:04:56.277
Coming back to the design. The
windshield is part of the car's integrity.

00:04:56.277 --> 00:05:08.101
If it shows cracks, it all could wring more.
You don't want that, so check the windshield.

00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:11.418
Any damage should
be fixed immediately.

00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:19.056
The 2.2 diesel is a nice engine. We're
driving gasoline now, but I heard it is.

00:05:20.225 --> 00:05:25.704
They do want oil, so keep
an eye on the oil level.

00:05:25.704 --> 00:05:35.778
Another problem is that some (the older ones)
need a new clutch at 31,000 miles.

00:05:35.778 --> 00:05:44.717
That's quick. If you want an early Civic diesel,
check if the clutch has been replaced.

00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:48.625
It's an expensive fix.

00:05:48.983 --> 00:05:56.624
There aren't many cars (7%)
with an automatic gearbox.

00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:03.142
It's called I-SHIFT and is
not very sophisticated.

00:06:03.142 --> 00:06:12.499
It's technically fine,
but doesn't shift smoothly.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.983
A problem with the headlights:
they wring in pre-facelift cars.

00:06:19.983 --> 00:06:30.032
It cuts into the bumper's paint.
Check for any damage there.

00:06:30.628 --> 00:06:34.950
Finally, there's a problem
with the oil sensor.

00:06:35.826 --> 00:06:40.532
It may malfunction,
switching the light on.

00:06:40.532 --> 00:06:46.998
It can run the battery dry.
Annoying, but easy to fix.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.161
It's just annoying.
A software update should fix it.

00:06:52.702 --> 00:06:57.712
If you encounter the problem,
visit the dealer for a quick fix.

00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:02.304
We borrowed this car at
Auto Hommel in Etten-Leur.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.228
It has a lot of features, this 1.4.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:14.050
It's an S Advantage edition, basically
full-option. Only satnav is missing.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:21.901
You pay 11,750 euros
for this nice Honda Civic.

00:07:22.985 --> 00:07:24.985
THIS CAR

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:41.500
Thanks to
