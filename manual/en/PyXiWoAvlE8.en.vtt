00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.000
MSU, we love thy shadows

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.200
When twilight silence falls,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.200
Flushing deep and softly paling

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.100
O'er ivy covered halls;

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.200
Beneath the pines we'll gather

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.000
To give our faith so true,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.800
Sing our love for Alma Mater

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:46.600
Any thy praises, MSU.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.780
It's kind of just a throw them into the water and see how they do.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.600
It's mentoring, its modeling. It's leading by example

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.080
What if you don't have a local address?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.780
I'm just a little homeless, not completely (laughter)

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.540
Where are you going to be living?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.360
I don't know.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.940
We thought people were going to be responsible this year (laughter)

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.260
This is preseason. It's the time where the band basically gets ready for the fall

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.440
Lunch Is at Shaw?

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.000
Shaw for meals.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.500
Shaw is where we eat today?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.700
Not at Brody, like my schedule says, it's at Shaw

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.800
Everything's new, they're nervous, they're crazy excited

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.400
It's just all these emotions at once

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.700
Uniforms are tonight at 10

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.660
They get checked in in the morning

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.100
They move into the dorms that day and then they come and work for the rest of the week

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.300
You're moving in this morning?

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.000
Uh, yeah,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.260
Okay then, good luck, good to see ya. You know, be there by 1:30

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.760
Okay

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.320
It's that building of this year's team, and it's a family mentality.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.020
Oh! (laughter)

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.380
We're bonding (laughter)

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.500
Kidneys in my mouth!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.680
We're usually hear from between eight and nine in the morning

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.240
and until about, I don't know, eight or nine at night

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.040
We're going to walk this way! (laughter)

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.180
It's pretty intense and it's it's hard physically

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.280
Tubas! Drop and give me half

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.920
Should we run twice a day?

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.080
We're marching all day, high step.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.720
Stand up straight, pull that gut in!

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.920
Pull it in!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.600
A lot of the way we develop throughout the season is

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260
What happens right now?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.100
Friday the drum line arrived

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.180
(drums playing)

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.799
They've been working from, you know, 9 to 9 every day.

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.209
They do their own thing for a lot of the time just to get ready with all their business they do

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.780
(drums playing)

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.349
Band, parade, hest

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.480
Well, right now, we're training the freshman

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.100
The back of the heel touches on the beat

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.459
With a nice tall neck, stand up

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.780
Reach tall

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.400
Get the freshman ready for when the veterans come. The veterans come in this afternoon

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.620
But there's not much to see yet

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.620
It's just sort of

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.000
fundamentals

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.359
we're basically just getting all our fundamentals down before we start learning

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.300
the real stuff

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.000
everybody's scratches

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
no running

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.760
They like it! They like it!

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.360
Disco Sparty!

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.510
It's kind of, I mean , it's a warm up for the legs

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.000
We stretch, but then it's also our own little hype things

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.980
like we get excited about Sparty, we get excited about weird stuff actually

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
(laughter)

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.800
Alright, that better be on TV

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.879
Actually part of the reason I even stayed in band after

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.400
High school and into college was because I wanted to make the band here

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.359
It's a lot of hard work

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.789
I mean, to even get into the band you have to go, if you're new, you have to go through two rounds of auditioning

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:02.900
(horn playing)

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.450
Placed in right in the middle of the band last year, so hopefully in these auditions I do a bit better

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.480
Well for most people it's a pretty exciting thing

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.650
(horn playing)

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.529
And then there's the difficult reality in our, in our system that some people don't make the block

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.330
(horn playing)

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.580
Uh, I was really nervous actually. I was an alternate my first year, and it was, it was terrible

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.870
(horn playing)

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.870
one of my least favorite

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:31.560
responsibilities

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.940
(horn playing)

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.180
With the same token, it is the reason the band is as good as it is

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.520
(horn playing)

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.400
Because there's competition from within to be in the most coveted spots

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.800
Are you excited?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.940
Yeah, let me show you

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.000
That means I get to play the E flat cornet instead of this thing

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.480
so there's only eight people to do that, so that's pretty high honor, so I'm pumped

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.620
(band playing)

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.620
Man, I'm tired

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.480
Pretend that nobody's watching me. I'm not wired up, not on TV.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.520
Bring it in, let's go!

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.580
this is obviously the beginning of the

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.290
freshman dress rehearsal

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.869
Tonight, we kind of become one class and it's a tradition that's it's gone back up

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.400
For a long time at Michigan State

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.160
This is my third year as a leader in this band

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.600
And I just want to tell you guys, and I'm very proud of you

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.930
It makes the freshmen class feel like, man, I really

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.180
really feel like a part of this band. I've worked hard. I've earned it

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.180
I love these guys. That's, that's the overwhelming feeling

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.800
this is going to be a test of what you've learned during preseason

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.400
No talking from this point forward

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.600
Freshman dresses, it's just, it's a test of what you've learned all preseason.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.180
So you're just doing the same things that you've done all preseason

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.140
Marching "The Series"

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.140
(drums playing)

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.300
Hey, hey, hey, hey

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.300
playing the fight song

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.800
(band playing)

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.669
That kind of stuff, and it's, it's an intense environment

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.400
up and down, swing, flash!

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:27.580
this is your school!

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.700
But it's not a negative environment.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.460
So if you back up, the whole band has to back up

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.480
Keep at it man, you've got a long ways to go, but you're moving fast

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.900
Cops are there for safety

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.300
and we're using the least busiest road on campus

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.940
(band playing)

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:51.220
More important is just becoming part of the band and the sense of belonging that you really get that really begins tonight

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.049
We're not this group of freshmen and veterans anymore. We're finally the Spartan marching band for 2008
