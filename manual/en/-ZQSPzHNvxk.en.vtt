00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.290
Samsung Tocco Ultra Edition (GT-S8300 / UltraTOUCH).

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.680
The Samsung Tocco Ultra Edition (also known
as the Samsung GT-8300 and possibly the UltraTOUCH

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.740
in some markets) is an eight megapixel touchscreen
phone with a slide-out numeric keypad.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.769
Although it borrows the "Tocco" name from
the Samsung F480, the Samsung Tocco Ultra

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.910
Edition is a completely different and much
upgraded handset.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.960
At a time when touchscreen phones were beginning
to look identical, the design of this S8300

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.910
handset is a little bit different, the "stretched
slider" design gives the handset a distinctive

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.039
look - albeit a tall look at about 139mm when
the handset is open.

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.910
A tour around the features of the Samsung
Tocco Ultra Edition show that this is an impressive

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.870
looking device.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.690
One notable feature is the 8 megapixel camera
with dual LED flash, autofocus, face detection

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.930
and geotagging using the Tocco's built-in
GPS.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.830
The S8300 can also record video at 640 x 480
pixels at 30 frames per second.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.080
The display is a 2.8" WQVGA (240 x 400 pixel)
touchscreen panel with haptic feedback, using

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.890
Samsung's Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting
Diode (AMOLED) technology to deliver a clear,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.490
bright display.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.649
In terms of capabilities, this is certainly
more advanced than the original Tocco, but

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.619
it lacks the high resolution of the Nokia
5800 XpressMusic.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.550
The user interface has been upgraded to TouchWiz
1.5 which seems to be a very usable way of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.580
controlling the phone.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.850
It's worth remembering that the Tocco Ultra
Edition is not a smartphone, so software upgrades

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.950
will more limited than for some of the competition.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.220
However, it's likely that the built-in software
will be more than enough for most users.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.929
Samsung say that the GPS on the Tocco Ultra
Edition provides navigation with detailed

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.170
maps that can take users "from door to door".

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.550
The precise features are not clear, but the
large display has the potential to be an excellent

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.110
aid for SatNav users.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.820
Multimedia support is a strong point of the
S8300 / Tocco Ultra Edition.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:39.440
It can play back MP3, AAC and WMA audio plus
DivX, XviD, MPEG4, WMV, H.264 and H.263 movies.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:46.110
There is also support for stereo Bluetooth,
and the Tocco Ultra comes with an FM radio.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.310
We don't know whether or not the S8300 comes
with a 3.5mm audio jack or not.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:01.820
Underneath it all, this is a quad-band GSM
phone with dual-band 900 / 2100 MHz UMTS.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.220
The Tocco Ultra also supports HSDPA with a
maximum download speed of 7.2 Mbps.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.220
There appears to be no WiFi support.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.060
The S8300 is powered by an 880 mAh battery,
which is surprisingly small for a phone of

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.520
this high specification.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:28.870
Internal memory is 75MB, expandable up to
16GB using a microSD card.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.240
Other features include photo blogging, video
editing and a high degree of customisation

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.560
using repositionable widgets.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.040
So, overall this appears to be a good looking
phone with a lot of features.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.170
Perhaps it isn't as flexible as the Samsung
Omnia or a smartphone, but it is certainly

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.140
an impressive and powerful device.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.330
No word was given on price, but we expect
to see the Samsung Tocco Ultra Edition to

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.550
hit the shops from March onwards.
