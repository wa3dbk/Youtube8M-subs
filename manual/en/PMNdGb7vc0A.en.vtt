Announcer: At a maximum security prison--

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.420
Bob: Who the heck breaks into prison?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.160
Gail: The real question is:

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.980
Who sends in three guards alone to deal

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.500
with a prison break?

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.800
-At least we have armor and blasters.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.100
-Armor and blasters aren't what they're cracked up t'be.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.160
Remember the Ewoks?

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.360
-Good point. Let's just be sittin' this one out.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.100
(crunching sounds)

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.500
Beast Boy: Who the heck breaks into prison?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.940
- Hey, that's MY line!

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.240
- Let it go, Bob. He's the star of the show and we're

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.860
just stormtroopers.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.080
- There are five good reasons to stop what you're doing:

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.960
ONE!

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.880
- TWO!

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.640
- Three!

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.760
- Five!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.140
-Dammit, Raven, I'M Five!

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.040
- My bad.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.880
- And after we spent HOURS rehearsing that bit.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.560
Anyway, Cinderblock, you're horribly outnumbered

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.640
and outgunned. Surrender now.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.900
- RAAAAAARRRRRR!

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.300
- Oh no! He has called the bluff!

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.940
(Cinderblock's attack continues thru the theme song)

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660
Robin: Hey! You can't attack during the theme song!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.800
-RAAAARGH!

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.180
- So, wanna give him the Sonic Boom?

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.680
- Itn't that against the Geneva Accords?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.020
- What the United Nations doesn't know

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.240
won't hurt 'em!

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.420
- Then let's LOCK AND LOAD!

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.820
(Teen Titans Theme begins playing)

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.260
(record scratch, theme stops)

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.380
-Whoawhoawhoawhoawhoawhoa!

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.280
(sonic blast)

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.720
- Starfire: Eeeeeek!
- Beast Boy: My eyes!

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.160
- This is just like when we play Halo.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.160
(flash grenade explodes)

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.960
- It's no fun when they defeat themselves.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.940
(crunching and crashing)

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.000
- Sweet! We can escape!

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.260
- No way, man. I'm trying for good behavior.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.960
- I can't live outside any more, man.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.640
I'm all institutionalized.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.880
- Well if you blokes ain't goin, I ain't gonna try.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.060
- Who would have thought that peer pressure would

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.160
be a good thing?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.840
- We have bigger things to worry about--

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.920
--like Cyborg messing up the Sonic Boom.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.480
- Me? You're the one who got in MY way, twinkletoes!

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.600
- It may have been better that it did not work

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.800
the way you hoped.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.920
Would not the energy bolt have caused the grenade

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.700
to go off in your faces?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.480
- Starfire, the men are talking.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.960
- Don't you talk to her like that!

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.720
(Cyborg and Robin argue over each other)

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.260
(arguing continues)
- Beast Boy: I hate it when mommy and daddy fight!

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.540
- Robin: --a detachable object!

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.620
- Well that's it, I don't need you. I'm gonna go

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.180
get my own show. It'll be awesome!

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.580
It'll have blackjack and hookers--

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.060
--in fact, FORGET the blackjack.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.060
- Announcer: Meanwhile inside Slade's secret underground abandoned warehouse inside of an active volcano....

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.820
(crunching)

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.700
- Excelent work, Cinderblock. You managed

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.120
to capture Plasmus off camera.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.580
Now wake him up.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.500
(smoke hissing)

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.060
- Wh-what? I'm awake!?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.500
- But I went to prison so I could sleep all day!

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.940
- You aren't in prison anymore, my friend.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.440
But you will soon be... MY BITCH.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.940
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.940
-No, not again! Well let's see how you are with a...

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.980
SLIME MONSTER!

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.620
(glass shatters)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.820
- Uh, just for the record, I was speaking

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:04.780
metaphorically there.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.240
- Announcer: Later, at the Hall of Justice

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.620
--now with a spare room for rent, just

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.940
call the landlord for details!

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.140
- (lady on phone) Beast Boy, huh? That's a cute name.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.560
Press one for pillow talk, two if you want me to take--

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.400
-SIGH- I miss Cyborg. It's no fun calling 1-900 numbers

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.060
from his cell phone if he isn't there to catch me.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.660
- Beast Boy, I made us something to take our minds

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.980
off of Friend Cyborg's departure.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.920
(hacks and coughs)

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.440
- What is that? Cream of Toenail?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.460
- No, I made a cake!

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.240
- Star, you're supposed to BAKE cakes.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.160
-Oh, Beast Boy, ever the joker. Baking cakes!

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.660
Next you will tell me the eggs

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.200
are supposed to be fresh!

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.460
- If anybody even THINKS about making

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.040
a Portal reference, there will be blood.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.980
- (thinking) I bet I can fit all my extra porn in here once

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.680
I clear out all his crap.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.760
(wistfully) I remember that day. He tousled my hair

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.120
so hard it's never been straight since!

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.180
(alarm buzzes)

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.740
- What is it NOW?

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.460
- Plasmus is attacking!

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.240
- When did HE break out of prison?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.840
- It must have happened off camera.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.380
-Crap. Where is he?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.340
- No clue. Cyborg's the only one who

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.980
can read this crazy thing.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.420
- Then Titans, GO....

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.640
--wonder around until you hear property damage.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.900
Announcer: One long meandering trip later!

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.580
(Grunting)

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.660
- Do the dew!

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.700
(laser blast)

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.680
- Robin: Stealing Mountain Dew? That's unforgiveable.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.040
- So how are we gonna fight it?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.480
I know I'm not touching that thing?

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.340
- Never send a glornak to do a wuffa's job.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.640
- Stop making up words!

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.780
- NOOO!

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.940
- Just let me throw a barrel at it!

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.480
- Time to kill it with one kick!

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.020
I... could have thought that out better.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.200
WuaaaAAAHHGGGHHH!

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.080
- Mm. Just like Mother used to make.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.000
- Is all the cooking on your planet a dare?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.500
- YES!

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.820
-Titans, this will require teamwork.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.360
- Oh, so we're gonna get to sit around while you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.520
kill it with one punch again?

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.080
- No, this will require ACTUAL teamwork.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.080
- That's new.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.760
- I know. I'm scared too.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:20.880
(Teen Titans Theme Plays)

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.480
- Nice work team. I was AWESOME.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.680
- We did it! Who needs Cyborg?

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.560
- Meanwhile, back at Slade's under...uh.. uh..

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.800
Meanwhile, back at Slade's Lair!

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.280
- What the-- This isn't how the fight is supposed to end.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.540
They're supposed to start losing, then win with

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.340
The power of FRIENDSHIP when Cyborg gets back.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.180
That was supposed to give me time to launch an attack

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.140
with Cinderblock.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.540
- This is precisely why you shouldn't trust Wikipedia.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.920
- Slade: Curses! My plan is ruined. And it was foolproof.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.720
- Do not be so hard on yourself, Master Slade.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.620
The Titans ARE rather high-quality fools.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.800
- You have a point there but it's just so FRUSTRATING.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.760
(cup breaks)

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.480
Oh well. I suppose I can't expect to win

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.340
in the first episode.

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.200
- Master Slade, this is the third episode.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.440
- Note to self: when I rule the world...

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.960
(smash, cup shatters)
DESTROY WIKIPEDIA.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.740
- Wintergreen: And this is my grandmother's 
good china, too.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.680
-Later, outside the Mountain Dew bottling plant.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.740
- Well, well, well, look who showed up

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.200
too late to be useful.

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.020
- Hey man, I admit I was sort of a jerk earlier

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.780
but I really need this job.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.840
Turns out cartoons and hookers cost money.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.640
Now the mob says they'll take my CPU

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640
if I don't pay them back.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.020
Can I come back?

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.040
- Sure. The others missed you for some reason.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.700
Plus, we need you to cover 
the Affirmative Action quotas.

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.400
- Cyborg: Ah, mutual exploitation. The foundation
of every healthy friendship.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.880
- Robin: Amen, brotha!

00:06:44.140 --> 00:07:07.040
(Weird Al's "Everything You Know Is Wrong" )

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.460
- In the interest of educating the kids at home

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.180
Teen Titans Abridged now presents the first installment

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:14.980
of 'Conversational German With Raven'...
