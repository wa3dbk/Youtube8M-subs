00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
 

00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.070
DR JAMES GRIME: We did a video.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.850
I'd done it some time ago
about Mersenne primes.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.220
And offhandedly, just
off the cuff, I said

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.040
that 1 wasn't a prime.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.500
Now, if I'm honest, we
don't say 1 is prime.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.920
There's a special
reason for that.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.520
And we noticed that some people
in the comments said,

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.050
well, I think I've heard of this
before, but why is that?

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.580
Why isn't 1 a prime?

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.610
So what is a prime number?

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.970
Let's think of the definition.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.530
You probably know
the definition.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.430
A prime number is a number that
can only be divided by 1

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.550
and itself.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.480
So the prime numbers are
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.890
You know these numbers.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.690
So it sounds like 1 should
be a prime number, right?

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.070
It fits the definition
of the prime number.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.930
You can divide by 1, and
you can divide by

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.440
itself, which is 1.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.420
And historically, it was
considered a prime number.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750
So if you're thinking, hmm, it
sounds like it should be.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.390
Well, that's what they
used to think.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.490
That's what mathematicians
used to think as well.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.260
But in the end, they
had to exclude it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.590
from the prime numbers.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.580
Oh poor old 1, 1 is the
loneliest number, the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.390
loneliest number
you'll ever do.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.420
So it's excluded for a reason.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.950
There's a really important
theorem in mathematics.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.450
It's called the Fundamental
Theorem of Arithmetic.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.320
Now, it says that every positive
whole number can be

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.780
written as a product by
multiplying prime numbers.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.550
So here it is.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.800
I didn't want to write it
out, so here it is.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.120
Every positive whole number, or
integer, if you like, can

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.510
be written as a unique
product of primes.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.530
So you can tell this is an
important theorem because it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.610
has a name.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.150
And you can tell it's a very
important theorem because it

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.330
has a pompous name.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.670
So what this means is prime
numbers are our atoms, like

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.050
atoms in chemistry.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.600
They can be used to make other
numbers by multiplying these

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.100
primes together.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.116
So for example, 15
is 3 times 5.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:10.850
3 and 5 are prime.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.970
And you can make 15 from
multiplying primes together.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
But there's a very important
word here in this theorem.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.440
Look at this word, unique.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.020
Now that's not just there
for decoration.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.490
Every word is important,
unique.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.830
It has to be a unique product.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.670
There's only one way to do it.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.050
Now we know, of course, that
15 is also 5 times 3.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.610
We don't mind that,
that's allowed.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:38.760
We don't mind that.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.980
What we don't like is that
15 is 1 times 3 times 5.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.600
Not only that, but it's also
1 times 1 times 3 times 5.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.860
And it's 1 times 1 times 1 times
3 times 5, and so on.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.280
If 1 was a prime, then we
wouldn't have a unique way of

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.290
writing 15 as a product
of prime numbers.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.950
So what this meant was, when
they used to think it was

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.490
prime, they had to keep

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.130
excluding 1 from your theorems.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.750
You would have to keep saying,
take all the prime numbers,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.420
except for 1.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.560
And we just got tired
of doing that.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.200
So we just decided to exclude 1
from our definition of prime

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.840
to begin with.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.060
So 1 isn't a prime number.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.510
It isn't considered a composite
number, where you

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.100
make the other numbers
from primes.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.490
No, it has a category all of
its own, where it sits, all

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:39.940
lonely by itself.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.720
BRADY HARAN: But why does
this mean 1's not prime?

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.460
Maybe it's just a
stupid theorem.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.540
Maybe the theorem's no good.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.500
Why does the theorem
beat number 1 out?

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.160
DR JAMES GRIME: We have a choice.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.470
We have a choice to include
it in that category

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.990
if we wanted to.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.220
Prime's just a word, it's
just a category.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.150
And it's more useful for us to
say, take this list, which is

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.660
the list of all the primes.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.050
And it doesn't have 1 on it.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.470
It's more useful to say,
take this list.

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.020
And that list is 2, 3, 5,
7, 11, blah, blah, blah.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.930
BRADY HARAN: Looking at that
theorem, doesn't that mean

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.543
that 1 isn't a whole number
because 1, surely 1 can't be

00:04:19.543 --> 00:04:21.209
made as a unique product
of primes?

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.450
DR JAMES GRIME: OK.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.140
Well, let's have a look.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.225
Let's take--

00:04:24.225 --> 00:04:27.080
I'll start with 16.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.610
16 is a product of primes
because it's 2 times 2

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.270
times 2 times 2.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.500
It's four primes.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980
8 is a product of primes.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.200
It's 2 times 2 times 2.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.190
So I've just divided
by 2 there.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.160
4 is a product of two primes.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.060
The number 2, the prime number
2, is a product of just one

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:50.710
prime number.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.830
And then if I divide by 2 again,
I get 1, which is the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.770
product of zero prime numbers.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.360
It's called an empty product.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.840
So we've got a product of 4
primes, 3 primes, 2 primes,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.970
continue the pattern, 1
prime, and 0 primes.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.550
It's 1, and it's not 0.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.390
It's 1, it's called
an empty product.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.160
 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.730
Oh, that won't be it
for the number 1.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.800
We'll be hearing from the number
1 again soon, I'm sure.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.050
