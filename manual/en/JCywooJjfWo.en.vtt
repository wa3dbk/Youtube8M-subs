00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.550
Welcome to a brief tour of Halftone 2. To
create a new project from the

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.920
document gallery, tap the plus button.
On the left side of the screen is the pages

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.900
panel
where you can add, delete, and rearrange

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.520
pages. You can hide the pages panel by
tapping along its edge or sliding

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.220
it out of the way.
On the right side of the screen is the

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.930
toolbar, which we'll be using in just a
moment.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.380
The center of the screen is the editing
area. As you'd expect, you can drag to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.690
position the page and pinch to zoom in
and zoom out.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.770
To work with elements on the page, simply
tap to bring up the radial menu.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.390
The first few times you use the radial
menu, you'll see helpful tips around its

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.000
perimeter.
If you'd like to turn off those tips, tap

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.970
the gear icon on the toolbar, and turn radial
menu help to off.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.329
So, let's design our page.
Tap the page and choose the edit page

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.059
icon from the radial menu.
Select a background color or a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.280
background texture,
then tap the layout tab and choose an

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.000
arrangement for your photos.

the panels to bring up its radial menu,
select the load photo button,

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.539
and choose a photo from the album, from Faceook,
from Flickr, or from Instagram.

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.619
For this example, we'll load a photo from
Facebook.

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.700
To position the photo, tap the panel,
then the move photo button.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.659
You can pinch to zoom and move and rotate
the photo and tap when you're done.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.709
If you don't like a change that you've
made, you can always tap the undo button.

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:37.130
To add a text caption to the page,
tap the speech bubble icon on the toolbar.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.020
Notice that the Facebook caption for
the photo is automatically included.

Swipe to find a caption style that you
like,

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.439
and tap to select it.
We'll add a little extra padding around

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.149
the text
and tap to complete.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.799

or its left edge.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.520
To move a caption,
drag near its center.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.539
Next, let's add a stamp by tapping on
the BAM icon on the toolbar.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:14.539
Scroll to find a style that you like,
and tap to select it.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.860
Like a caption, you can move a stamp by
dragging near its center.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.820
You can also rotate and resize a stamp
by dragging near its edge.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.000
If you'd like to place a stamp inside a
panel, tap the stamp,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.840
then choose the place in panel icon from
the radial menu.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.840

When you're ready to share your creation,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.800
tap the share icon on the toolbar.
If you just want to see what your page

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.280
looks like without actually sending it
anywhere, tap the preview button.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.540
Tap Halftone dots

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.550

or turn them off for a crisp and clean
look.
