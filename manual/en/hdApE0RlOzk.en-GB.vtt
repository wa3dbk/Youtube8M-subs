00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:08.609
This is Fieldsports Britain News

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:14.440
Did the earth move for you? – well it might
do if you're a gun at this shoot in Co Durham.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.110
A few years ago, John Hensby and Sam Hillyard
watched this happen to the bridge. This is

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.440
what it looks like now. Then a couple of weeks
ago, a huge sinkhole appeared in one of their

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.440
drives.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.369
Well, they'll have to stay nervous now.

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.270
[laughs]

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.040
Daystate celebrates 35 years of its Huntsman
air rifle this year.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.250
Designed before we had even elected Maggie
Thatcher, the Huntsman is a classic that’s

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.370
still available and to mark the anniversary
The Airgun Centre is doing a deal on it in

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.480
time for Christmas, including Hawke Eclipse
scope, hard case and free servicing for life.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.690
It is just £34.53 a month on finance. Go
to Bit.ly/daystate

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.309
If only more government departments did this.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.680
The 2014-2015 Georgia dove season opens on
6th September. Migratory game bird coordinator

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.940
Greg Balkcom gives an inside look at what
hunters can expect for the upcoming season,

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.140
as well as some recommendations for where
to go.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.970
Find the nearest dove field, find the opening
day, find the hunting partner, go and have

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.560
a good time.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.580
You might remember last year we filmed DSC1
candidate Stratts.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.770
Well, he’s always up to good, and this week
he wants a shout-out for the Cambridgeshire

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.530
Countryside Fete in aid of East Anglia Air
Ambulance. It’s this Sunday, 7th September

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.940
at Weybridge Lakes, starting at 1.30pm.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.960
Sticking with the DSC1 and there's a new learning
tool for stalkers with learning difficulties

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.820
such as dyslexia.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.530
An audio CD resource been developed by industry
professionals to help those of us who find

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.090
it difficult to retain information through
standard reading material, but they still

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.390
want a chance of achieving the qualification.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.960

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.110
Now, do you want to go wildfowling for as
little as £10 a day?

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.200
The updated Wildfowling Permit Scheme is one
of the benefits of BASC membership. The guide

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.370
can be found online. It includes contact details
of clubs which are willing to take people

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.090
out to try wildfowling or to try wildfowling
in a new area.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.310
To join BASC go to Bit.ly/joinbas

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.069
And finally, a deer can be seen running at
speed through the centre of Glasgow before

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.970
it smashes into the windows of a restaurant.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.910
The animal caused £500 of damage to the Kervan
Palace restaurant before running off.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.260
