Hi I am Kelli I am aesthetician makeup artist
at Ulta Salon and Cosmetics and I am going

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.370
to give you some tips on how you can give
yourself an older more sophisticated look.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.510
One of the first things that you want to do,
is pick some neutral eye shadows, something

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.679
that is just going to go well with your skin
tone and define the eye, so we are just going

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:32.600
to start with a light color. Apply that all
over. Medium tone. On the lid. And a darker

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:45.610
color, in the crease for a little bit of contour
and definition. Open for me. So you can see

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.470
this is very natural but it has enhanced her
eye and given her a little bit more of a polished

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.510
look. We'll then just going to apply a little
bit of eyeliner, close for me, we are just

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:05.710
going to apply a very thin line of eyeliner
right to the base of the lashes. Just make

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:15.610
her lash line look a little bit thicker. We
are also going to fill in her brow. Give her

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:26.800
a more a more defined brow, which will frame
the face and lift the eye. We are going to

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:38.130
apply a little bit of blush. To the apple
of the cheeks, smile for me. And we are going

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.409
to darken up her lips with, a neutral lip
color that is just a little bit darker than

00:01:46.409 --> 00:02:05.150
the color of her lips. So those are some tips
on how you can give yourself an older more

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.330
sophisticated look.
