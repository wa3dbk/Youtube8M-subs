00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.240
Every generation, there comes along an experience...

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.500
...that transcends the three dimensions of space.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.940
This...this isn't really one of those times.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.100
Listen up now, girls and boys, it's time to make some noise

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.982
Cuz the boys are back, and are gonna rap all about some plastic toys

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:26.313
For the Super Smash Bros. sequel, so fun it should be illegal

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:29.355
Who needs real life amigos, when you got pint-sized Amiibo?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.600
Holy toledo, man, look at them Amiibo, man

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.495
Fighting away while I get my ass kicked by Master Hand

00:00:35.495 --> 00:00:38.850
Stand up, well done Nintendo, a collectible memento

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.180
What a legacy of NFC, now let the song crescendo

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.140
All across the world, it ain't hard to see

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.160
Why everybody's crazy for these figurines

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.420
It's like I'm living in a neverending dream

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.560
And the best part is availability

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.750
I can't wait to choose from their huge selection

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.856
Picking out specific ones I want would be perfection

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.140
It's the start of a fairly priced collection

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440
Of perfectly good AMIIBO

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.948
Alright, enough rapping about it, it's time to go do somethin' 'bout it

00:01:09.948 --> 00:01:12.927
Gotta get another fighter for myself, take it home, make a shrine for it on my shelf

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:16.276
I think it's time to go outside, head down to my local Best Buy

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.366
Look at 'em side-by-side, marvel at their supply

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:23.080
Head to the Wii U section, and they're...sold out...

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.820
(noises of disappointment that they're always FUCKING SOLD OUT)

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.980
OK, that kinda killed the energy

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.195
But now we're gonna check things out at Target which is way across town (Haha!)

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.807
Walk in the store like we owning the place

00:01:35.807 --> 00:01:39.236
We head right over to the games and they're...nowhere to be found. (Dammit!)

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.440
Boy, wow, they're really in high demand, huh?

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.400
I guess they're popular...

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920
We drove all the way...

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.560
Hey, what about like a smaller store?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.160
This guy is brilliant! Now we on our way to Gamestop

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.110
They're guaranteed to have some cool exclusives in stock

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.320
We roll in, and it looks like they're ALSO OUT.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.442
You have got to be kidding me.

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:01.392
Oh my god, we literally drove, like, 30 miles.

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:03.523
This shouldn't be bothering me as much as it is right now.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.209
There should be millions of these. There should be MILLIONS of these.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.493
Well, what're we gonna do now?

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.460
eBay, looking for affordable Amiibo

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.810
Type the one you're looking for into the search bar and "eurek-o"

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.414
There he is, Little Mac, for just $500?! (Are you serious?!)

00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:18.915
For that piece of ----?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.220
$500?!

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.795
You literally can't even pose it! Why?

00:02:21.795 --> 00:02:24.971
That is not the manufacturer's suggested retail price!

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:27.874
I've never seen $500. I've literally never seen $500.

00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:28.933
This is worse than Sonic Boom.

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.896
I don't get that reference, but if it's anything like this, ---- that game.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.960
----. ---- that game. ----! So over it.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.743
How are we gonna get you one of these?

00:02:36.743 --> 00:02:38.983
I'm over it, I'm over it. Oh no, I know exactly how. (doorbell rings)

00:02:39.414 --> 00:02:41.094
I'll get it, Schnookums.

00:02:43.077 --> 00:02:43.877
death stare

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:55.600
OHHHHHOHHHHOHHOHHOHHHHHHHOHHHOHHHH-O-O-O-OOHHHHHOHHHOHHOHOOHHHHHHOHHHOHHOHOOHHHHHOHHHHHH-O-O-O

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.380
Well, there ya go. (hands Amiibo over)

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:01.534
I guess I have one now!

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.100
I don't like this one.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.313
I'm not doing any of that again, so you're gonna get the one you get, and you're gonna like it.

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:15.067
You wanna go play, like, laser tag or something?

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:16.960
And pizza. YEAH! OK.
