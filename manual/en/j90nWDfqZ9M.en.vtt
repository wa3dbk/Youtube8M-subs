\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 Hey

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.750
whats up guys, olli43 here, welcome back to
the gta 5 show! The show on youtube where

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.759
break down gta v, up until the release of
the game (Gta 5).Today we are going to do

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.360
a public service video. I have already done
one of these but I feel I need to do it twice

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.340
because i have had a few more subscribers
since my last video, and this is getting out

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.430
of hand, This issue that im going to be bringing
it up. So I hope you enjoy this video, and

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.980
if you do, let me know in the comments section
below. So Let's get started. I was browsing

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.739
the web and I read some news articles saying
that GTA V has a beta. There are websites

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:51.193
such as Gta v beta .com and more facebook
pages ect. I get a lot of comments on my videos

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:56.839
saying "join up to the gta v beta" and they
leave a link in the video.well I got to tell

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:02.620
you, that stuff is rubbish, don't believe
a word of it. take 2 interactive the publishers

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.400
of this game, not the developers (that's rockstar
games)are taking down these websites as they

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.900
are complete scams! People are getting sucked
in, they are doing surveys and making the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.530
people who made these websites lots of money,
and at the end of it they are not getting

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.380
the GTA V beta. None at all. So, if you know
someone talking about a GTA V beta or they

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.681
are claiming they are getting the beta, just
tell them it's not going to happen. Rockstar

00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:35.020
rarely do betas and they haven't done in the
past (unless I'm wrong). They certainly wouldn't

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.930
do one for gta v unless they troll me and
actually bring out a GTA V beta. Honestly,

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:54.420
if its not from rockstar.com the claimed gta
5 beta is fake.Anyway guys, i hope this is

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.890
informative and it stops you making the same
mistakes. I know its easy to get tricked as

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.640
we all really want to play this game. Thanks
for watching this video, i hope you enjoyed.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.980
Remember to let me know if you have been scammed
for the GTA V beta. See you later!\par
