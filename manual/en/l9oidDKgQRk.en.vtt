00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.210
OK well today we are going to talk about breads
and cereals and how to look for the healthiest

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.869
choices when you are grocery shopping. Breads
are the first place that you want to start.

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.029
Now you hear that wheat bread is healthy has
a lot of fiber and that’s what you want

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.570
to buy. But the problem is a lot of packages
are very misleading. For example, this wheat

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.599
bread here you’d read this and think great
wheat bread it must have a lot of fiber I’m

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.090
going to get this one. But the problem is
when you look at the label you’ll see that

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.370
one slice of bread contains less than one
gram of fiber per slice. So that’s pretty

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.080
low. You want to look for a bread that contains
at least 3 grams or more of fiber per serving.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.900
So even though this says wheat bread this
is super low in fiber and this would not be

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.550
a good choice. Now this bread for example
this says 100% whole wheat so it sounds a

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.070
little healthier. When you read the label
you’ll see that one slice has 3 grams of

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.510
fiber. So that’d be a great choice. This
would be a lot healthier. Fiber helps lower

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.690
your cholesterol. Also keeps you more regular
a very healthy thing to include in your diet.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.119
You want to get 25-35 grams of fiber per day.
So this would be a healthy choice for bread.

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.350
If you want to make a sandwich you’d double
that so you’d have 6 grams of fiber if each

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.200
slice is 3 grams. You can even find breads
with 5 grams of fiber which is even better.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.229
Tortillas are another thing that people often
get confused about. Now for example these

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.359
tortillas here say garden spinach herb looks
really healthy someone might get this and

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.659
think wow what a great choice I’m making.
Now the problem is when you look at the label

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.130
on the back of the package, first of all one
tortilla contains 210 calories which is a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.210
high amount of calories. Also the fiber amount
is 1 gram and when you look at the ingredients

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.159
you are going to see partially hydrogenated
oil on the ingredient list. And that means

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.799
that is going to contain trans fat which is
not healthy at all. Transfat is not heart

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.880
healthy it will raise your bad cholesterol
and lower your good cholesterol which is the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.969
HDL cholesterol. So trans fat will raise the
LDL cholesterol and lower the good cholesteraol

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:12.750
the HDL. So you want to avoid products with
transfat. When you look at the label it says

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.060
it doesn’t contain any transfat. It says
is has 0 grams. But it’s important to remember

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.830
that legally a company can list transfat as
0 grams if that food contains less than 0.5

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.550
grams of transfat per serving. So because
this probably contains less than 0.5 grams

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.400
of transfat or the partially hydrogenated
oil that’s why they are able to say that

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.400
its zero. So you’ve gotta check the ingredient
list. So again very high in calories, contains

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.189
transfat, and is very low in fiber. Now these
tortillas are yellow corn tortillas. Corn

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:51.819
can be a great source of fiber. When you read
the ingredient list you see ground corn, lime,

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.799
water, and a few preservatives so very very
healthy choice. Two of these tortillas which

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.569
would about equal to one of these larger ones
contain so two of them only 110 calories so

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:07.120
about half the calories found in one of these.
And they contain 3 grams of fiber. So that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.349
would be a great choice. So this is something
no transfat, lower in calories, and high in

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.860
fiber. So these yellow corn tortillas would
be a very healthy choice. Now it’s important

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.790
to remember that when you go into a store
there are some yellow corn tortillas that

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.760
have transfat in . So you’ve gotta check
each product each different brand and really

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.530
read those labels to know what you are getting.
And then we have cereal. Cereal is a great

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.019
way to get a lot of fiber in the morning.
Some people eat cereal for a snack for dessert

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.640
for breakfast. It’s a great choice. But
there are so many cereals on our grocery store

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.159
shelves so you really need to know what you
are looking for. For example, this one here

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.030
this is a golden grams cereal when you read
the label you will see first of all the calories

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.810
are 120 calories for ¾ cup that’s OK but
then you’re going to look down and see your

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.849
fiber is only one gram of fiber. So that’s
very very low in fiber and cereal is a great

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.060
way to get your fiber so if you pick this
kind of a cereal with that much fiber it really

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.340
going to be tough to get the fiber you need
throughout your day. Also the sugars this

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.030
contains 11 grams of sugars so it’s a little
beit higher in sugar. So something like this

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.940
the calories are usually OK in most cereals
not too high but again it low in fiber and

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.270
high in sugar so again not the healthiest
choice. A cereal like this one Fiber One you

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.639
can tell from the name of the cereal that
it is probably higher in fiber and it is.

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.990
When you look at the ingredient list and nutrition
facts here you’ll see that the first ingredient

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.110
listed is whole grain wheat and that’s a
very good ingredient to have. The calories

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.620
here for a whole cup is 160 calories and then
the fiber it contains 13 grams of fiber that’s

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.020
very very high. So 13 grams as opposed to
the 1 gram in this cereal. And then the sugars

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.870
it contains only 6 grams of sugar versus the
11 grams in this higher sugar cereal. So next

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:09.169
time you go to the store take a look at the
different cereals and breads and really read

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.560
those labels to pick the healthiest options.
