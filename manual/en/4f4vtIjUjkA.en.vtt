Welcome to Expert Village; this is Kim Brown.
In this segment, we are going to show how

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.650
to do a quick half up of half down with naturally
curly hair. I always like to take the hair

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:22.140
in sections, so I am going to take a small
triangle section at the top. Try to gently

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:32.071
separate the hair. So get the section up out
of the way, that will be the last section

00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:42.450
that we put in. You can just secure it with
a hairpin. Everything is going to be coming

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.920
up to this crown area, and so you just want
to have a little bit of back combing in the

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.989
crown to give your pins something to settle
in. You just take a little section, just back

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:03.513
comb a bit. Half up and half down, can be
anywhere from the tip of the hair up. You

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:10.140
can just do the top, or you could come all
the way from underneath here, and have it

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:17.300
come up. I think we are going to do that.
We will take from just below the ear at the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:33.700
nape area, straight up towards the crown.
Using mostly our fingers, a little bit of

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.110
pomade, and rake it through the hair just
to create definition and get rid those of

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:50.960
little flyaway pieces. The best way to secure
the hair is to tie in a knot, and this comes

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:59.720
out really easily. You donâ€™t have to worry
about the hair getting stuck. It creates a

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.720
little bit of softness and then it gives your
pins a nice place to set in. Then you just

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:21.880
secure this knot and we will do the other
side. Then you take your last section, take

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:41.810
this to a third knot, and then you can just
push it to create a little bit of lift, then

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:55.680
secure that. Half up and half down. For more
