Hey, my name is Luke Broadlick. I am
a tricker and somewhat of a hip-hop head.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.200
Basically how I started dancing and tricking
stuff is I actually drove my friend to the

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.240
Britney Spears Circus Tour audition back in
'09. And he was like, "Yo, you're gonna wait

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.980
for me anyway. Why don't you just audition
and have fun? It's like a free class if you

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:37.210
don't book." And luckily enough I actually
booked the job with no real experience pretty

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.210
much at all. Tricking is derived from martial
arts. I started out martial arts at 8 and

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.129
I really pursued it. I won 7 ISKA, I'm like
a 15 time world champion. It's just like B-boys,

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.739
it's just like any other dance, you have technique
and so tricking we basically took like say

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.710
a front kick and we decided to throw in some
gymnastics and some other flare and we did a back

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.049
flip with it. And with the front kick you
have a flash kick and that derives the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:11.049
giant flash tricking and so we kinda started
out a whole new movement which is pretty cool.

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.060
Tricking adapted over countries and stuff
and so now I'm getting videos on youtube about

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.350
kids like in Germany and Korea and Africa
like just going out into the park like I used

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.299
to do in Arizona and just flip and trick and it's 
cool that they watch my videos that I've had

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.520
since I was a kid. Tricking is like a freedom.
I can clearly say I'm a dancer. I don't know

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.200
if you just open up your surroundings and
you just try things I feel like you can go

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.530
so far.
