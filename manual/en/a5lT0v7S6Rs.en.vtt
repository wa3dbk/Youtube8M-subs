Peter, day 2 of the Dakar Rally, how did it go?

00:00:49.636 --> 00:01:01.071
We drove great, had a good day. It was heavy, despite 
 they told us it would not be that heavy.

00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:24.123
At the start we lost some minutes by searching a waypoint. Sainz also lost 
 a lot of time on that point, so everyone has their problems.

00:01:24.123 --> 00:01:33.678
After that we had a puncture, so we had to 
 change the tyre. Again lost 6 to 8 minutes.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:25.750
But we drove good, we are satisfied about today, we learned a 
 lot and we are looking forward to the next stage.
