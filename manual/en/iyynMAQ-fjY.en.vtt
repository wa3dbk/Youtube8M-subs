00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.710
Our population is growing each year, and we are now 7 billion on the planet.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.860
With so many people, new problems arise faster than we can find solutions for them.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.849
With so many people, new problems arise faster than we can find solutions for them.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.069
Our ressources are limited :

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:14.329
we'll need to feed our population,

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:16.330
find new energy sources,

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.859
and deal with the colossal amount of waste that we produce.

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.000
Traditional engineers have tried to develop solutions for these problems.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.460
However, these solutions are often too costly to be practical on a large scale.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.819
In the emerging field of synthetic biology,

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.060
the molecules of life are a new kind of tool for a new breed of engineers.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.770
We can now design cells to sense the environment, process signals,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.050
and perform useful functions.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.900
Every summer, students form teams to create synthetic biology projects

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.430
for the International Genetically Engineered Machine, or iGEM competition.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.830
Using genetically modified bacteria, the 2010 Bristol team provided a tool for farmers

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.240
to use on their fields to detect nitrate levels in order to manage and reduce their use of fertilizers.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.910
to use on their fields to detect nitrate levels in order to manage and reduce their use of fertilizers.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.500
A project like this is working well in the lab, but until methods to assess the risks are developed,

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.590
this project cannot move into the fields.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.520
One of the main concerns is that GMOs will become invasive species,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.810
or that synthetic genes could move from our bacteria to natural populations,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.270
a process known as Horizontal Gene Transfer.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.350
Both events could potentially harm the ecosystem. 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.820
That's exactly what we want to prevent.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.520
The first step is to develop standard protocols to perform risk assessment, 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.460
an essential tool for the scientific community. 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.780
The next step is to create a genetic system that will be modular, which means

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.230
it will be compatible with previously developed genetic systems like Bristol's.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.750
To prevent horizontal gene transfer, we will rely on different containment mechanisms:

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.500
a physical barrier provided by alginate capsules, 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.610
a DNA degradation system that will trigger the death of the GMO on the population scale

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.300
without harming neighboring natural populations,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.250
and finally,

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.549
a semantic containment system that will make the DNA encoded information 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.710
unreadable by other species.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.210
We thank you for your interest in our project, and hope you will support our team!
