00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:08.510
If we look at this hand closely, 3, 6, 8,
12, 15, 20, we'll see a hand that has some

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.690
fundamental flaws in it. For example, look
at our diamond suit, lots of nice diamonds,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:22.060
double marriages, no 10, no run, that's trouble.
Do we have aces all around? No, again by sorting

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.210
these hands out properly, we will get our
scoring system out of the way, by sorting

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.829
these hands properly we will get to assess
which cards we have and which cards we don't.

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.680
The first thing we look for is perspective
trump suit if we are going to name it. Do

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.461
we have a run? No we don't have a run so that
can still be a trump suit but it does not

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:45.031
get the premium of 15 points. Do we have aces
all around? No, do we have kings all around?

00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:50.570
Well I don't see one in spades so no. Do we
have jacks all around? No. So we have a very

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.329
weak hand, but the card guards are kind because
they have given us the wonder of Double Pinochle.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.269
Let's just look at that specimen right there.
That's the Double Pinochle. That's 30 fat

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:14.319
juicy points, 30 meld points, and very important
meld points. Important for meld but not a

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:18.950
lot of power though. Those are not going to
take a lot of things at all, maybe those jacks

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.310
of diamonds at the end if you would declare
diamonds as trump but it is still 30 meld

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.780
points. If you have the opening bid or you
have a chance to jump to 55 without it being

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.469
an over call of 54 to 55 and some pairs will
use 55 exclusively to show double Pinochle,

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:44.090
that keeps your partner from being confused
as to whether the 30 meld that this represents

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.889
is truly Double Pinochle as opposed to the
30 meld that aces all around and kings all

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:57.939
around might represent, that would be 28 so
55 reserved exclusively for Double Pinochle

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.420
if you can bid it and some partners will even
say I don't care if you say 54, if you say

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.719
55 that's telling me Double Pinochle and if
you say 56 I'll know you couldn't say 55.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:15.880
Now 59 is also in this line and it says double
aces because that is a traditional bid. Single

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:24.810
aces, all around, four different aces, 51,
two aces of each suit all around 59, 55 Double

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.920
Pinochle and nothing else.
