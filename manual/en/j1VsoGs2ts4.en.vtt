00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.508
I've had a break out

00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:16.016
This drives me nuts. It always happens when I've got something important to do or somebody really cute to see. I need to hide this

00:00:16.104 --> 00:00:23.398
So today I will show you how to do that. My name is Faye Smith, I'm a makeup and hair artist. And today I'm going to show you how to cover acne

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.699
First I like to do my little skin regime in the morning

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.496
Its pretty simple, I just swing my face with water to get off all the oil from the night

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:43.043
And them add moisturizer, I like the ones with SPF to protect my face from the sun 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.761
The first thing is to use liquid foundation

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.806
Use a color that matches the neck, so it will blend nicely

00:00:56.865 --> 00:01:00.769
I like to use Young Blood Mineral Cosmetic Liquid Foundation

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:09.319
You can apply the foundation by using non-latex sponge a foundation brush, or as I do my fingers

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.784
I find the warmth of the finger makes the foundation blend easier given seamless edges

00:01:17.327 --> 00:01:22.290
Just to make sure it blends evenly across the face

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:31.591
Not that I've even my skin tone a little bit, I want to cover up all those blemishes

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.182
My blemishes today are pretty big, so I will use a concealer that is little bit heavier than normal

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.062
I chose the Young Blood Mineral Cosmetic Concealer in medium which is my color

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.885
Again you can use a brush to apply but I like to use my fingers

00:01:48.983 --> 00:01:55.448
I apply it on top of my blemishes and blend the edges with my finger so you can't tell the concealer is there

00:01:55.457 --> 00:02:01.371
And then blend it underneath my eyes to cover up dark circles, and the redness around my nose

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:26.354
Now I've hidden all of my blemishes and the dark circles around my eyes and redness around my nose

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:28.982
I want to get rid of the shininess

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:40.326
So I will add a translucent powder but I like to mix it will a little bit of loose mineral powder as well to give litter extra coverage and even out more

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.664
I'm going to apply this with a kabuki brush

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.752
I mixed my mineral foundation will a little bit of translucent powder

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:59.721
The mineral foundation is going to give me extra coverage and even everything out, and get rid of the remaining blemishes

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:04.517
And the translucent powder will get rid of the shine and buff everything out nicely

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:10.648
Here we have a flawless skin that's hidden all the blemishes I had

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:18.531
Obviously you wouldn't want to go out like this, you want to finishes your makeup by adding anything you want

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.118
For now this is my video of how to cover up acne
