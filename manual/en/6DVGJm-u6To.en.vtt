00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight featuring Hecarim, the Shadow of War.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Hecarim is a melee fighter who specializes in high mobility and jungling.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.900
Whether striking multiple nearby enemies on the move or leading the charge into fights, Hecarim exemplifies mobile, high-impact fighting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.900
Hecarim’s passive is Warpath. Hecarim ignores unit collision and gains a percentage of his bonus movement speed as bonus damage.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.900
Rampage immediately damages all nearby enemies. If it hits, the next activation of Rampage enjoys a lower cooldown, down to a cap.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.900
If Rampage hasn’t hit anything for a few seconds, the cooldown returns to normal.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.900
As Hecarim’s primary damage source, take Rampage at level 1 and max it by level 9.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.900
Spirit of Dread creates an aura around Hecarim for a few seconds that constantly damages all nearby enemies.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.900
Additionally, Hecarim heals for a portion of any damage dealt to these enemies. Healing against minions is capped.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.900
Because it brings both great damage and health sustain, take a point in Spirit of Dread early and max it by level 13.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.900
Devastating Charge grants Hecarim steadily increasing movement speed for a few seconds.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.900
If Hecarim attacks an enemy during this time, he deals bonus damage and knocks back his target.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.900
Devastating Charge deals bonus damage based on how far Hecarim has traveled during the effect.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.900
Because it’s mostly a utility spell, take a rank of Devastating Charge early, but max only it by level 18.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.900
Hecarim’s ultimate is Onslaught of Shadows. Hecarim charges to target location, damaging and causing all nearby enemies to flee from Hecarim for a short time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.900
Additionally, Hecarim summons spectral riders that charge alongside him, damaging all enemies they strike.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.900
Due to the power of the ultimate, rank it as soon as possible, at levels 6, 11, and 16.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.900
Try to build a mix of damage, toughness, and mobility through your runes, masteries and items.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.900
For example, I take armor penetration marks, flat armor seals, magic resist per level glyphs, and movement speed quintessences.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.900
I recommend 9/12/9 masteries, taking armor penetration in offense, health and damage reduction in defense, and movement speed plus neutral buff duration in utility.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.900
When not jungling, or in Dominion, drop the minion-specific masteries for extra armor and magic resist.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.900
In Classic, I open with Boots of Speed and three Health Potions.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.900
I rush for Wriggle’s Lantern and Aegis of the Legion before taking defensive boots depending on the enemy team.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.900
Trinity Force is the next major buy. After, I grab a mix of damage and durability through Maw of Malmortius and Frozen Heart.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.900
In Dominion, my build is similar. I start with Boots of Speed, Prospector’s Blade, and two Health Potions.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.900
Aegis of the Legion, upgraded boots, and Trinity Force come next.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.900
From here, I adapt my build depending on my enemies, choosing among Randuin’s Omen, Maw of Malmortius, Sanguine Blade, and Last Whisper.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.900
Try to always gank enemies from behind. I activate Devastating Charge, close the distance on Galio, and make sure to push him away from his turret.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.900
I keep pace with him while I hit Rampage and Spirit of Dread to deal as much damage as possible before retreating from the turret and giving Nasus first blood.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.900
Let’s look back at this fight, because there’s something else to point out.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.900
Hecarim wants to keep up with enemy champions as long as possible to maximize his damage.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.900
Notice how I tell Hecarim to move forward immediately after every basic attack, ensuring that I stay next to Galio as long as possible for more Rampage hits.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.900
Make sure to use the most of Hecarim’s mechanics.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.900
Before I shove Ezreal toward the wall, I first use Rampage because Devastating Charge’s movement speed feeds into Warpath, giving me bonus damage.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.900
I chase with Ghost as he runs, using Rampage and Spirit of Dread to kill him without breaking stride.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.900
I turn on Kayle and I hit Onslaught of Shadows to lock her up under the turret and grab another kill.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.900
Finally, with Spirit of Dread sill active, I Rampage and Smite nearby minions to gain health back as I escape.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.900
When jungling, try to keep your cooldown reduction on Rampage alive between camps.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.900
To do this, make sure that Rampage is the killing blow on the last monster in the camp, and then immediately run to the next one.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.900
As soon as you’re in range, hit Rampage again to keep the cooldown low and enjoy your extra fast jungle speed.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.900
In this case, it let me clear the camp just fast enough to grab the Lizard Elder with Smite and run away with Devastating Charge.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.900
Remember that Onslaught of Shadows will constantly force the enemy champions to run away from you.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.900
Here I initiate on Rammus and move such that he’ll run into my team.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.900
I push him with Devastating Charge and stay in front of him, cutting down his health with Rampage.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.900
After we pick up the kill, I walk out of turret range and then back across to escape Morgana.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.900
By hitting by hitting Onslaught of Shadows immediately after activating Devastating Charge, you can give it a lot of bonus damage and set yourself up for an easy knock back.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.900
I lock up Galio and we get him extremely low before his team comes to help.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.900
After killing Galio I move quickly to take out the champions with the least armor, killing Morgana, and then Kayle soon after.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.900
I spot Rammus just above. Devastating Charge grants me a lot of movement speed as I walk just past Rammus before he taunts me, pushing him back toward my team.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.900
Thanks to all the armor accrued from items, I’m able to tank the turret long enough for my team to show up and grab the ace.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.900
The Speed Shrines on Dominion are even more useful on Hecarim thanks to Warpath, which converts that movement speed into bonus damage.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.900
This helps me catch up to Nidalee for one kill before moving down to meet Fizz with Onslaught of Shadows and a second.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.900
Combining Speed Shrines with Hecarim’s ability to deal damage while moving means you should always try to juke skill shots.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.900
After taking down Nidalee and Fiora, I’m put into a duel against Fizz. I start winning, but then he fires off his ultimate.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.900
I dodge away and then chase him down with Devastating Charge. I take him out with Rampage and win control over the middle.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.900
