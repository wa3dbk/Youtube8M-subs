Tara These days a lot of people, including
me, keep all of our music on our computers

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.370
so that we can play them through our iPhone
or iPod, even our iPad.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.510
But if you're listening to your music from
the speakers that came in the box with your

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.880
computer, or even the speakers that are built
into a laptop, then you're missing out on

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.570
a lot of the detail in the music.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.110
So in this video, we're gonna cover three
ways to upgrade the sound from your computer.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.030
Computer speakers are super simple to set
up.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.640
You'll likely connect one speaker to another
with speaker cable, and then one of the speakers

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.469
will connect to your computer with a cable
like this.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.289
They'll also connect to the wall for power.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:48.219
A second option is to use computer speakers
like these that have a built in digital-to-analog

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.670
converter, or DAC.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.819
With these you'll connect your computer using
a USB cable so you'll send a pure digital

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:59.559
signal out to your speakers.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.269
This lets the speakers higher quality processors
take care of the sound and it's gonna give

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.730
you higher quality, clearer, more detailed
sound than you'd get if you were using the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.100
processing that's built into your computer.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.630
These speakers are as easy to set up as other
computer speakers.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.841
You'll run one cable, USB, out to the speakers,
one cable to connect the two speakers, and

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:24.409
then a cable to the wall for power.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.149
A third and even better option for getting
better sound from your computer is to use

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.009
an outboard digital-to-analog converter, or
DAC, like this one here.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.520
This is going to take that pure digital signal
from your computer so it's going to bypass

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.329
the sound card and all the processing that
goes on in your computer.

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.899
It'll process the sound with its dedicated
digital-to-analog converter and so it's gonna

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.440
give you a really high quality sound that
it'll pump out to your speakers so you'll

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.090
get again better clarity, more detail.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.090
It's really gonna open up your music and your
games.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.810
Something great about these DACs is that they're
really quite small so they're not gonna take

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.369
up a lot of room on your desktop.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.730
So it's great way to improve the sound, whether
you're in the market for new speakers or just

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:14.250
trying to upgrade the sound with the speakers
you currently have.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.300
And they'll work with headphones, too.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.250
So you'll get better sound whether you're
listening through headphones or speakers.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.590
If you have any questions, or you want help
picking out a desktop system, just give us

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.590
a call.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.000
We'd be happy to help.
