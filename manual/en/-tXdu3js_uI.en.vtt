00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.870
Look at this.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.050
A really thin, really light.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.750
In fact, you can call it:
Ultralight or Ultrathin.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.260
This Toshiba Portege R500-S5008X
 laptops computer.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.190
Now, this thing is really, 
really small and light

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.560
and I don’t know if I can really convey 
how light this computer is,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.530
effectively to you over video, 
but it’s 2.4 lbs.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.300
I mean, that’s it.
That’s all this thing weighs.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.600
2.5 lbs.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.370
That’s less than a lot of 
the netbooks that are out there 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.170
and, when you pick it up, 
it feels as though…

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.770
It feels light as air, man.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.430
It’s really, really light.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.480
It also has extraordinary 
battery life.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.850
Up to 7.5 hours of battery on this 
Toshiba Portege R500-S5008X.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.370
It’s got an Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 
a U7700 processor

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.440
running at 1.3 GHz.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.030
It’s got 2 GB 
of DDR2 RAM on board.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.470
It’s got a  160 GB hard drive, 
it has XP Pro preinstalled on board.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.780
It’s got a/g and wireless n, 
built in.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.160
It’s got Bluetooth.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.890
The maximum resolution 
on the 12.1” screen here is 1280x800,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.690
it’s an LED backlit screen, 
one of the factors 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.390
that contributes to this computer 
having such as incredibly 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.090
long battery life is that 
LED lit screen. 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.100
It’s got the GMA 950 
graphics chip on board.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.240
So, it’s not going to exactly be, 
say, a gaming workhorse.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.240
The graphics on board 
are comparable to those 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.970
in many of the netbooks out there, 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.440
so it’s going to be really, 
really great at handling 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.210
all of your Office applications, 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.690
websites, online videos, 
stuff like that.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.550
Not really such a 3-D 
gaming workhorse at all.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.490
It has gigabit LAN on board 
so if you plug into Ethernet, 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.350
you are going 
to get gigabit speeds 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.530
if you are plugged 
into a gigabit network.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.530
And, as I said, 
the weight of this thing, 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.570
2.4 lbs and 7.5 hours 
of battery life.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.800
So, this is, sort of, 
an ultimate road machine 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.970
because you’re not going 
to even notice it in your bag, 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.740
it’s so light 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.040
and you’re rarely going 
to have to charge the battery.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.240
I mean, imagine having a laptop 
if you’re on one of those

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.750
god forsaken 9 hour flights.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.290
Imagine, you can use your laptop
 for almost the entire time

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.320
without having to actually 
plug it in and charge it, 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.390
which is really nice.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.720
And it also has a few other features
 which are great

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:39.860
for the business traveler.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.860
If you look down here, 
right on the track pad.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.160
You see, it does have 
a 2-button track pad 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.300
and a fingerprint scanner located
 right here, in the middle.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:49.840
So you’ll be able to use that 
for security.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.110
Anytime that you want 
to unlock your computer 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.570
you can require 
a swipe of your finger

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.190
to make sure you… no unauthorized people get
 a hold of your laptop and your data on board. 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.880
On the side, you’re going 
to find a lot of the ports.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.150
A lot of ports are located 
over on your left side,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.850
including your power port, 
an external VGA port, USB,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.350
a small FireWire port, 
another USB, 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.690
your mic and speaker outputs here,
 as well as a volume control knob

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.600
right here on the side, 
which is actually really handy,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.210
being able to use a physical knob 
rather than to Windows software

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.710
to turn the volume up and down.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.440
Over on the other side, 
you’ve got an SD slot as well.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.010
You’ve got a PC card slot over here 
on the side as well.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.180
Something you don’t find very often 
on such small computers.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.420
You also have a switch for turning 
your wireless on and off.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.460
Another USB port 
and there’s that gigablit LAN port 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.130
located right there.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.470
But this is a, sort of, 
an ultimate business machine.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.830
It doesn’t have a webcam, 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.630
it’s not designed 
for all kinds of fun stuff.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.670
It’s designed to be ready to go, 
on the road anytime.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.310
And that’s what this is.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.500
It’s got a really, 
really nice matte 12.1” screen.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.210
Very high resolution 
for a 12.1” screen, 1280x800.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.210
So you’re going to have nearly 
the same resolution 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.380
as a lot of 19” screens out there.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.820
So you’re going to be able to watch 
all of your 720p video,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.080
it’s going to handle high def video 
really, really well.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.490
So it’s great 
for being on the road.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.020
Now, it doesn’t have 
an optical drive 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.890
so if you want to be able 
to install software 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.230
off of a CD on this thing, 
you’re going to have to purchase

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.500
an external USB DVD reader/writer, 
one of the small ones.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.900
Any one will do, USB 
or even a mini firewire one

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.700
will be able to hook up 
to this computer.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.170
But that’s something you’re 
going to want to think about 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.420
while shopping 
for this particular laptop.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.580
You’re going to want, probably, 
an external USB CD or DVD drive

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.820
for being able to install and burn a
nd backup all of your files.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.180
So, overall, really, 
really great road machine.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.770
The Toshiba Portege R500-S5008X.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.660
You can go out 
and you can grab one right now.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.160
