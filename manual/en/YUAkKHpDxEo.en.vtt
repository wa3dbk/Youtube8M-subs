00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.862
Now I would like to give an overview of the
different container and utensils that you

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:09.260
will need to prepare ramen noodles in the
tomato sauce. First you'll need a spoon for

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:16.640
stirring your sauce and all those luscious
herbs and spices can combine within your pot.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.550
Which I should also mention this is just a
small sauce pan or pot I'll use this to prepare

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.309
the noodles as well as cook the sauce in.
When cooking on a budget, you probably have

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.600
heard the expression that time is money and
you're probably one of those people who is

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.499
also cooking with time constraints. I like
to minimize my clean up by using a few containers

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:55.440
and utensils as possible so then we have a
fork, your fork is your most trusty companion

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.640
when cooking ramen noodles. You're going to
use this to drain our noodles, to stir our

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.730
sauce if we don't have a spoon, chicken out
of the can I mean and use this to eat your

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.240
ramen noodles with. So this is very important
if not crucial, a can opener if you're adding

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.750
chicken to your tomato sauce, a measuring
cup. You're just going to use this to really

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:31.259
measure out the two cups of water you'll need
to prepare the ramen noodles. This is a mixing

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.820
bowl that I use when I prepare ramen noodles
just a good place to mix all your ingredients

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:48.020
together, it can also be used as a serving
dish to eat ramen noodles directly out of.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.500
I also have a plate and a bowl here just to
show that yes you can serve ramen noodles

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.740
with tomato sauce on a plate or in a bowl.
