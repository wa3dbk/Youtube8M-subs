00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.190
Today we&amp;#39;ll be reviewing and showing you
how the Brophy sliding camper hold downs,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.060
part number HSSF, will fit on most trucks.

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.019
These hold downs will fit on any truck that
has a downward lip on the underside of the

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.019
bed rail.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.199
But keep in mind, if you have a bed liner,
you may need to cut it out to fit properly.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.999
We&amp;#39;ll begin our installation by first
threading on the 7/16 hex nut onto our T bar.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:30.820
We&amp;#39;ll then thread the T bar into the threaded
hole on the tie down plate.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.320
We&amp;#39;ll then take the included neoprene
pads, which we&amp;#39;ll place on the underside

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:53.699
of the tie down 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:30.220
plate as well 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:45.930
as 
the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:02:13.530
back 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:38.500
of 
the T bar.
