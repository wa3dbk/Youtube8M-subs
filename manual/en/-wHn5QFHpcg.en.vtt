00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.500
We're realizing that trees provide multiple benefits.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.500
Not just the shade that we have traditionally planted them for in 
our cities but also the environmental essential services they provide.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500
Trees are beautiful, they are niceties, but we 
are realizing that they are also necessities.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Trees provide us with oxygen, trees cool our environment 
and help to deflect the urban heat island effect

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but they also help us manage storm water very importantly 
particularly in a place like portland where we get a lot of rain.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They also sequester carbon and they also 
purify the air by capturing air pollutants.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So trees are yes beautiful, yes amenities, but also absolute necessities for us.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Some of the benefits of trees are fairly intuitive. 
But researchers found a less obvious, but very important benefit:

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.000
Trees may improve your health.  
Roger Ulrich did a landmark study in this field.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.000
He found that patients recovering from surgery in a room 
with a view of trees recovered faster, and took fewer

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
pain medications, than patients that recovered 
in a room with a view of a brick wall.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.000
But how do we study the effect of trees 
on health when they grow so slowly?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.000
One way is to see what happens when a invasive 
forest pest kills a lot of trees in a short amount of time.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Probably the nastiest pests in the last 10 years 
is the emerald ash borer.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.000
It's killed about 100 million trees in 15 states since 
it was first discovered in Detroit, Michigan in 2002.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In this study, we focused on cardiovascular and 
lower-respiratory disease because past research

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
has demonstrated a link between these causes 
of death and the natural environment.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We looked at data from 1990 through 2007.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.000
This allowed us to look at mortality before and after 
emerald ash borer was discovered in 2002.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
We found that counties infested with emerald ash 
borer had significantly higher mortality rates.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.000
Specifically, an additional 15,000 people died from cardiovascular 
disease, and an additional  6,000 from lower-respiratory disease.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.000
Now these results are not because of 
demographic differences between counties.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.000
We statistically accounted for a wide range of 
factors, including income, education, and race.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
Our results strengthens the evidence that 
healthy trees really may mean healthy people.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.000
Indeed it may be time to start thinking of 
trees as part of our public health infrastructure.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.000
The emerald ash borer, an evasive forest pest, has spread 
across 15 states since it was first detected in North 
America in 2002.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.000
The insect killed approximately 100 million North American 
ash trees between 2002 and 2012.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The resulting loss of tree cover is associated with an 
additional 21,000 deaths: 15,000 from cardiovascular 
disease and 6,000 from lower respiratory disease.
