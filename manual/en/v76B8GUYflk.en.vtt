00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.320
Thank you, thank you very much, thank you

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.940
Hello! Hello everyone, or as we say in South Africa, hello!

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.039
It's really wonderful to be here, this is my first time working with Comic Relief

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.550
when they asked me to join they said Trevor we'd really love you to join Comic Relief and I said I'd love to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.369
do it, do I have to come to the UK but then I found out

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.710
that they're actually projects in South
Africa that I got to take part in which is really

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.699
wonderful for me

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.919
for two reasons one because obviously
it's close to my heart I grew up in a township

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.710
a but more importantly I didn't have to fly
which is really great

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.000
because flying has been particularly
stressful for me

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.800
in the recent months mostly because of
the ebola crisis

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.100
as a South African traveller flying
anywhere in the world has been extremely stressful

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.969
because it has been extra stringent
measures that have been placed on us

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.420
you know flying to America particularly
has been the worst you go through different

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.640
lines, there's extra checks you know especially if you
come from what they consider

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.890
a high-risk ebola region which is
apparently the whole continent

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.720
cause we're all coughing on each other in one big hut

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
I don't really blame them cause look, the
truth is most Americans don't know much

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.040
about South Africa so I well they don't
know much about

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.369
Africa as a whole, well most of them don't know much about anything, but still

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.439
like it's just weird because you
would land America and the questions

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.479
they would ask you at the border control
would be so interesting, like you'd get there

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.689
a man would look at me and as soon as he'd see I was from South Africa he'd be like, Sir

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.070
South Africa, have you been in contact with ebola?

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.400
like my answer would be yes, next stop Disney World!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.580
Would I really still be traveling I've been in contact

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.500
with one of the most deadly diseases on the planet is that what type of person do you -

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.770
ahh I paid for that trip I'm going

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.450
even if it kills everybody, like why would I
do something like that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.689
And the way they would ask it as well me made it sound like ebola was a distant relative of mine

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:57.289
like a cousin, have you been in contact with ebola? Yeah, I spoke to him last week!

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.410
he's doing well, thanks for asking

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.120
Such a strange world was, was
honestly one of the worst trips I ever took

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.360
because what happened is we flew in, so I was flying to Los Angeles

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.380
and because of that we have to stop over in Atlanta and change planes

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.880
and when we got off our plane went off and
we got into another plane

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.840
and when we did they made an
announcement as we got onto the plane

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.460
they told other passengers that we were
from a South African plane and so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.240
they were going to be spraying the cabin

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.100
for their safety. But they said this as we
walked on the air hostess came on and she was like

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.730
ladies and gentlemen please note we've got some passengers

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.260
joining us from a South African flight

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.280
and due to the ebola crisis right now we're just gonna spray the cabin

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.010
shouldn't be too harmful, you can
cover your eyes and a nose if you think

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.680
it'll harm you but it should be okay
and we'll be on our way shortly

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.800
thank you very much. We walked on to that, that's our introduction.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.140
As we're walking on, hello hello, was like a
scene from Forrest Gump, everyone was like, can't sit here!

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.690
can't sit here! It wa shonestly one of the worst flights I've ever taken in my life

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.400
I've like, it was so tense I coughed once

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.940
The plane shook, there was this one guy who couldn't even hold it, I couldn't hold it any longer

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.580
and he couldn't hold it, it was like...and he was like ebola!!

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.560
Ebola! I was like calm down, calm down

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.140
It's just AIDs, calm down, you're safe for now

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.980
The stress! Everybody. We landed finally

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.840
in Los Angeles but still we weren't allowed to disembark

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.260
The air hostess came back on to make another announcement she said 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.720
Ladies and gentlemen plsease stay in your seats

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.750
before we can disembark the plane we're
just gonna have a quick safety procedure

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.560
checking, health and safety officials
coming on board to make sure everything

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.970
is up to standard and we should be on
our way shortly

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.129
thank you very much. So we have to sit
there while the health and safety official

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:51.209
came on board the plane

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.220
and his job was using a list of African
passengers

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.060
he was gonna go around and then scan each passenger and make sure they were healthy

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.349
and what he had, he had a laser thermometer and he'd go to each African

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.190
point it at our heads and then basically the
way it worked on the thermometer is if

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.829
you're very hot then you've got ebola, I think that's how it works

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.620
So walk down, scan the people, walk down, scan the people, and I know why he did this, he came down to my row

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.690
walked all the way to me, to me scanned the people around me, looked at me

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.820
and then just shook his head and walked
away, like

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.710
almost like I wasn't African enough or
something...

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.950
I mean he scanned the people around me and he moved on

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.900
so because of this a few rows later he
was short one name on the list

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.240
which was mine and so he calls the
air hostess over and he's like I got a name

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.380
I don't know, and she's like are you sure, did you check, and he's like yeah I don't know who it is ...

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.020
And this commotion and it's growing and
it's growing and now I think they're talking about me

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.480
I'm pretty certain but I'm not gonna be
the guy was like excuse me I think I'm

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.290
I'm the ebola threat! Yeah I'm not gonna say that

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.540
So I'm just listening while this is, and the commotions growing, keeps growing

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.700
So the whole plane starts listening everyone gets involved

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.350
and then at its height, at its height
there was a man three rows behind us

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.740
of Middle Eastern descent, he had a big beard, very traditional regalia on

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.230
and I'll never forget this, he leaned
into the middle of their conversation with

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.210
no hint of irony

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.950
whatsoever just leaned in and was like
excuse me, pardon me

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.980
ah, you probably want to check the
gentleman over there

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.550
something suspicious about him I notice, might want to check in there

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.330
that guy was coughing

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.850
I was like really?

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.150
Et tu Ahmed

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.140
How the wheel has turned my friend

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.480
you forget there was a time when muslims
were the black people of the skies

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:44.620
now you have turned on me, I thought he would be on my side

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.240
I thought he would relate, I thought he would be like don't worry I know how it feels, I got you

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.490
Instead he was like, enjoy being under the bus!

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.000
It was a stressful time. Coming into the UK has been a bit nicer

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.020
you know, I guess people are a bit more informed - not that it's easy don't get me wrong

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.700
flying to the UK is a lot of stress

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.880
you have one of the most stressful border
controls I have ever come into

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.370
in my life, like they ask you so many questions, question upon question upon question

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.440
I've got the right paperwork, I've got the
visa

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.240
Comic Relief, the guy looks at me he's like so you're a comedian, I said yeah, he's like you don't look funny

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.340
I just woke up and what what what does
that even mean?

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.360
And he kept asking me questions and at one point I stopped I said look man

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.300
look man, I've given you the paperwork, I've told you why I'm here, why don't you believe

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.300
me? He said, well look the truth is we can't just believe everybody that comes into

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.750
the UK, we can't just believe

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.680
that you gonna do what you say you here
to do that doesn't make sense you might

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.390
do something totally different

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.420
I was like, yeah fair enough, that makes
sense

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:44.520
I just wish as Africans we'd thought of that when the British arrived

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.760
would've served us well

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320
What is that flag for? Oh, just going to wave it in your country

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.000
Ahh, come on in!

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.980
You guys have been fantastic, thanks so much for having me

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.780
Have a great night
