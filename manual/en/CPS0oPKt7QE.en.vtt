00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:06.299
• From villains that can melt into confectionary,
to vigilantes whose only crime is that they're

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.510
obese, we count 15 horribly awful comic book
villains ever to find their way onto printed

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.389
pages
15 - Codpiece

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.699
• This supervillain's powers come from a
misunderstanding he had with a girl - she

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.740
calls him short which he immediately assumes
is a reference to his tiny wang

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.019
• So, naturally, he goes out and builds
a giant pair of rocket cannon underpants,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.730
with a spring-loaded boxing glove and a huge
drill

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.059
• He was inevitably defeated by the transsexual
superhero Coagula, and if that doesn't scream

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.170
social justice then I have absolutely no idea
what does

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.359
14 - Walrus
• A man who claims to have all the mighty

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.320
strength of a walrus - unfortunately though,
since those animals are typically slower and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.199
weaker than a human, he's saying he's not
that great

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.320
• Likewise, instead of breaking into banks
or taking over the world, Walrus likes to

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.999
attack inanimate objects like walls and lampposts
• In one comic issue, Spider-Man flicks

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.860
Walrus with his index finger once, and it
knocks him unconscious

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.860
13 - Asbestos Lady
• This is a criminal that dons fireproof

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.360
clothing lined with asbestos to ward off fires
- she'll carry around a flamethrower and light

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.320
everything ablaze, then walk out unharmed,
well, as unharmed as you might be wearing

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.149
a suit lined with ASBESTOS
• She actually constructed asbestos bullets

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.870
to attack her long-time adversary the Human
Torch

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.270
• But in the 90s, she contracted cancer
because, heh, ASBESTOS

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.460
12 - Eye Scream
• So, you know those times when you're writing

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.909
a comic book, you need a superpower so you
look around the kitchen and you realise, gee,

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.499
I wonder what it would be like to turn into
an ice-cream

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:50.479
• Well, meet Eye Scream the man who can
melt his body down into an ice-cream substance

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:56.060
to slip under doors and feed small children
• Unbelievably, his saga only lasted one

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.670
comic - how could THAT happen?

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.420
11 - Sportsmaster
• A man named Lawrence Crock who uses sport-themed

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.940
weapons like exploding baseballs, flying bases,
rocket baseball bats, knockout basketballs,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.209
lacrosse snare nets and exploding hockey pucks
• He also wears sports clothes because apparently

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.880
his obsession with sports wasn't already obvious
• This is his power, this is what he does

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.090
- that's like my throwing exploding modems
because I work on the internet

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.540
10 - Gin Genie
• Here we go, a superhero that's so crappy

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.080
she's basically a villain anyway
• Gin was a member of X-Force, with the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.540
ability to generate seismic waves at her enemies
- which sounds fine in itself, except she

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.900
needed to be totally hammered to do so
• In fact, her waves would be precisely

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.250
equal to her blood alcohol level, and since
she was an alcoholic anyway, she gets so drunk

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.020
that she couldn't control her waves and instead
hurt or kill her teammates

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:57.090
9 - Mr Mxyzptlk
• An inter-dimensional imp, enemy to Superman,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.620
with a bizarre weakness that, even so, isn't
as much a weakness but more of a dumb thing

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.510
• The only thing that can banish this guy
from our dimension is to make him say or write

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.980
his own name backwards
• The problem is though, his name is already

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.780
a mess that saying it backwards is just as
hard - so it's not a weakness, it's just a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.920
bizarre thing that tends not to happen yet
works somehow

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.190
8 - Bat-Mite
• Another inter-dimensional imp, but more

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.030
of an annoyance than true enemy to Batman
• He comes from a fifth dimension, too difficult

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.470
to understand for us with our measly 3 dimensions
• He tends to show up and idolise Batman,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.610
only disappearing when Batman tells him off
to which he cries, as popularised by the animated

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.080
series, "I just wanna help"
7 - Calender Man

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.880
• This guy is a villain that only commits
crimes on a given date, mainly holidays when

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.459
it's more lucrative or simpler
• The only issue is, when you know the date

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:57.110
someone is planning a crime, would you, y'know,
arrest him before that day and keep him there?

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.499
Criminal intention, maybe?

00:03:58.499 --> 00:04:04.390
• Likewise, his costume is entirely composed
of dates, so he's carrying around the time

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.769
and dates of his every crime so all you have
to do is catch him and the evidence is pinned

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.950
all over his body
• And his costume is bright RED, he couldn't

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.330
be more obvious in a crowd - he might actually
be the worst superhero of all time, let alone

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.920
this list
6 - Pink Pearl

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.760
• You want to know what her superpower is?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760
She's fat.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.330
She is EVIL because she is FAT.

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.450
Okay - that's it.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.911
She opens a male strip club, and now she's
known as a Master of Evil

00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:38.640
• So take heed ladies and gentleman - if
you get fat, you'll be labelled a dangerous

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.190
criminal
5 - Condiment King

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.850
• A recurring villian on Batman, he wields
condiment cannons to spray food toppings on

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:52.030
superheroes, mainly mustard and ketchup
• He's generally known for his Mr. Freeze-like

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.490
cringeworthy condiment puns, like, "I knew
you'd ketchup with me sooner or later," and,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.980
"Let's see if you can cut the mustard"
• Wildly popular character, surprised he

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.890
didn't get his own feature film slash cooking
documentary

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.070
4 - Ruby Thursday
• A scientist who develops a high-tech organic

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.060
computer, but instead of selling or monetising
it in any way, no, she carves up her own head

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.490
and plants it smack bang atop her neck
• Now the red ball she calls a face can

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.760
alter its shape so she can form tentacles,
fire projectiles and blasts of pure force

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.460
- and as a bonus if the sphere is removed
from the body, she can still control it

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.240
• Now, this is just me, but I'd have just,
y'know, left my head as it was and possibly

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.720
used a tablet or something, because when I
get a critical error I wouldn't feel so great

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.230
about not being alive anymore
3 - Polka-Dot Man

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.470
• So, I feel mixed about this guy since
the idea is both good and horrendous

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.070
• On one hand, Polka-Dot Man is covered
in a suit made from polka dots that, when

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.910
removed, transform into a much larger object
like a weapon or even a flying saucer

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:04.170
• But on the downside, the man is covered
in a suit made from polka dots - and that

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:07.490
is he how commits crimes
• Mmmm, inconspicuous

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.270
2 - Egg Fu
• You know how people like to draw little

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.870
faces on eggs?

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.090
Let's make one of those a supervillian, sure,
that's sounds like a ridiculously acceptable

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.440
idea
• So they did, and Egg Fu is a Chinese Communist

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.830
house-sized egg with a twirly moustache that
can whip or strangle people because why not

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.490
• He also has egg relatives, and a robot
twin called Dr. Yes

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:36.220
1 - Fisherman
• Aquaman is known worldwide as a pretty

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.800
unpopular, useless superhero - but what happens
when you make an even LAMER but EVIL version?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.991
• Fisherman uses a high-pressure suit, a
fishing rod and several lures - yes, he's

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:52.180
just an ordinary fisherman that happens to
commit crimes

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.930
• In one story, it's revealed he's actually
an alien parasite that grafts itself onto

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.210
an individual's head, because otherwise nobody
would care about his existence
