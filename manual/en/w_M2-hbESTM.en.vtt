00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:09.260
2014 will go down as the warmest year around
the globe in recorded history ...worried about

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.610
brushfires as well as wildfires across Oregon.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.910
It's even promoted the governor to declare
a state of emergency.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.820
You've read the headlines, you know it's happening.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.029
The effects of climate change are here.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.730
Some are obvious: strong hurricanes, bigger
wildfires.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.440
Some are subtle: shorter ski seasons, smaller
oyster harvests, longer-lasting droughts.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.570
This is a story about something that's happening
in every community across America.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.480
This is a story about David vs. Goliath, about
our health and our planet and a wonderland

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.110
known as Oregon, home to winter sports, bountiful
fresh food, clean drinking water, and clean

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.110
air.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.790
But this is also a story about large corporations
set on turning a profit in exchange for the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.180
things that Oregonians love and what people
are doing to fight back.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.840
The world needs new leaders to step forward
and hold polluters accountable.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.609
They need one nation, one state, one community
to show no matter our backgrounds, what communities

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:25.329
we live in, or where we work, we support meaningful
action now to reduce carbon pollution.

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:30.890
In 2014, communities across Oregon gathered
in solidarity with over a thousand climate

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.159
events around the world.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.850
As United Nations leaders gathered for a climate
summit in New York City, the world united

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.750
with a single call to action: we must act
on climate change now.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.381
Millions of people around the planet stood
up for justice, for a better economy, and

00:01:49.381 --> 00:01:54.260
for the real change that will move us toward
a future where polluters are accountable for

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.119
what they put in our air and water.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.390
And elected officials in Oregon are listening.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.969
It's clear that we can make that kind of real
change here in Oregon.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:09.020
Well, we've had hearings showing the effects
that we're already feeling here in Oregon.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:18.450
The disruptions to our oyster industry because
of ocean acidification, changes to the wineries...

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.750
Everything that defines Oregon, the iconic
species, the glorious landscape, the rivers,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.240
the snow pack...that's just the short term.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.220
In the longer term, it loses its habitability.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.360
We've gotta figure this out because it's working
and middle class people that are going to

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.511
be the ones that are most economically impacted
by our failure to do something about climate

00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.190
change.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.700
We've led before.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.310
We created the first bottle bill to clean
up plastic waste that was filling our cities

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.760
and rivers.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.300
We even tore down a highway to restore the
beauty of an urban waterfront.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.420
Much of Harbor Drive, a former major urban
freeway in downtown Portland was redeveloped

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.020
as a park in 1978.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.640
It is now known as the Tom McCall waterfront
park and is often cited as the first instance

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.180
of freeway removal in the USA and is a milestone
in urban planning.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.230
Oregon can lead again but we need more voices.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.820
The only way to counter corporate influence
in our policy is with people.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.800
Enough people to stand together and demand
that pollution be paid for by the corporations

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.480
that create it, not by the public.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.490
Climate change disproportionately affects
communities of color and I think Oregon has

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.250
na opportunity to show how we can develop
more equitable systems.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.660
And by developing communities that are fair
show, Oregon can be that leader in showing

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.960
that environmental issues matter to everybody.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.471
Why not take advantage of this opportunity
to help lead the charge and show that we are

00:03:52.471 --> 00:03:57.520
invested in creating a healthy climate for
everybody on the planet.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.250
You know, it's now just God bless America,
it's God bless everybody.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.120
We know that without a doubt that our climate
is changing and that our weather is becoming

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.960
more extreme due to human activities such
as the burning of oil and coal.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.290
These are Oregon's state goals on reducing
pollution.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:21.450
This is where we're at in meeting those goals.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.699
We're not on track to hut the state's adopted
goals.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.360
To get on track, we must reduce emissions
by putting a price on carbon.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.889
This is a grassroots campaign to make big
polluters pay, to empower communities, and

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.139
to tackle climate change once and for all.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.110
And we need your help.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.389
Your voice is needed to secure a better world
for ourselves and for generations to come.

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.629
From all corners of this great and diverse
state, Oregonians are coming together to demand

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.270
action on climate change.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:03.449
This state is a very condensed version of
about 10,000 different eco systems and you

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:12.199
can go experience a whole lot of them even
in one day - going from the coast to the mountains,

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.919
to the high desert.

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:20.770
It's a phenomenal place to live and recreate
and enjoy ourselves.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.749
And I think we all know it and yet what we
don't really remember all the time is how

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:35.469
diversity of different landscapes makes Oregon
such an incredible place.

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.529
'Cause it's now just all mountains, it's not
just all sea shore, it's now all river basis.

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:47.610
It's all of it put together in this incredible
mosaic that we love.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.810
A better world is within our reach.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.029
Together, we can lead the world to a clean
energy future.

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.389
The time is now
The time is now

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.830
The time is now
The time...is now

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.259
The time is now.

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:04.999
