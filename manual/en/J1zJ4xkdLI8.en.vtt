00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.885
Where is the bird?
I hear it. I hear it.

00:00:02.885 --> 00:00:06.064
Where is the bird?
Here we go. Wait. Okay.

00:00:07.738 --> 00:00:09.039
This is super hard to read.

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:13.571
Hi. I am Philip Rosedale,
creator of Second Life,

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:14.707
and co-founder of High Fidelity.

00:00:14.707 --> 00:00:15.885
I am here for "Ask an Expert",

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.942
which is a show where we take your
questions from the Twitter-verse,

00:00:18.942 --> 00:00:20.852
about the topics we cover in SU.

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:22.845
I think I hear a tweet.

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.475
Here we go.
Thank you.

00:00:26.219 --> 00:00:30.669
All right. @svm118 asks:
"What will happen when people

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.310
spend more time in virtual worlds,
than the real world?"

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:37.494
A lot of people get worried
about virtual worlds,

00:00:37.494 --> 00:00:40.067
and I think that's where this question
comes from,

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:42.438
taking our time away
from the real world.

00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.475
But, actually, I think, as virtual worlds
become bigger

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:47.405
and more complex
than the real world,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.011
it will almost be the opposite.

00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.418
We'll worry if people are spending
too much time

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.433
locked into just the place
where they live in the real world,

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.210
where they might only have a limited
set of friends,

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.011
or they might have less diversity
around them

00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:01.112
that they can find
in the virtual worlds.

00:01:01.112 --> 00:01:05.043
So, as virtual worlds replicate
everything we can do

00:01:05.043 --> 00:01:08.172
in the real world, which they will,
I think we are going to see them

00:01:08.172 --> 00:01:11.271
as...a place where...like school.
We want to make sure

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:13.180
we actually spend enough time in.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:16.271
As a matter of fact, there have been
a lot of studies

00:01:16.271 --> 00:01:17.442
even before VR,

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.608
that suggest that people
we see everyday,

00:01:22.608 --> 00:01:24.804
because we've learnt
about them online,

00:01:24.804 --> 00:01:28.693
people we've come to know on-line,
are people that we are far less likely

00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:30.885
to engage in conflict or wars with.

00:01:30.885 --> 00:01:35.302
The more VR becomes a literal world
that you can walk around in,

00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:38.391
a real, physical world like this one,
that feels the same,

00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:41.820
the less likely we are all going to be
to fight with each other.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.383
There it is. There's another tweet.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.534
Thank you.

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:53.064
@croftandy asks:
"How much will it cost

00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:57.485
to preserve your virtual brain
on a future virtual grid?

00:01:57.485 --> 00:01:59.521
Will there be virtual jobs?"

00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:00.754
Well there are two questions there.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:03.290
Moving our brains
into the virtual world,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.993
kind of, confronts a series
of tough questions about biology,

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.564
and about the way
the human brain is designed

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.964
that are pretty challenging ones.

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.034
I personally think
that we are going to see

00:02:13.034 --> 00:02:17.104
a very, very human AI's,
that are able to talk to us,

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:20.174
and have intelligence
initially comparable to ours,

00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:21.209
and then, greater than ours,

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.475
I think we were going to
see that happen

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:25.379
a lot sooner, then we see
this ability to, sort of,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.916
upload yourself completely
into a virtual environment.

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:30.584
I think it's a good question
for the future,

00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:32.620
but it's one that I don't know
how easy it's going to be to do,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.388
and I don't have as much confidence
that it will be straightforward

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.959
as some of the other crazy things
that are happening right now.

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.228
As for the question of virtual jobs,

00:02:40.228 --> 00:02:43.264
totally. There are already
many virtual jobs.

00:02:43.264 --> 00:02:46.500
So, the virtual world of second life
has somewhere between

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.970
a half a billion
and a billion dollars a year

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.839
in people buying and
selling things from each other,

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.510
and many of those things are things
that are people's fulltime jobs.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.111
There are many, many people
in Second Life today,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.046
for example, who make
their real world living

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:02.583
from building things
in the virtual world

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:04.119
and selling them
to other people in there.

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:06.988
So, virtual jobs are going to be
a dominant part of our future.

00:03:06.988 --> 00:03:10.624
I would go so far, as to say
there probably be

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:13.493
the biggest place where we work,
bigger than the real world.

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:15.362
I think I hear another tweet.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.632
I've got you this time.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:21.736
All right. Andrew Leit says:

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:24.739
"Second Life choppy
on mid-range systems.

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.077
How do you balance performance
and expensive in-game environments?"

00:03:30.443 --> 00:03:32.780
Well, the one thing
about Second Life is,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.917
you know, as the creator and founder
of it, I can say this,

00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.717
We started early.

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:41.688
Second Life was  barely able to work
on the computers we had at the time.

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:44.992
I started Second Life right when
broadband had come around

00:03:44.992 --> 00:03:47.495
and there was a little bit of
3D capability on the computers.

00:03:47.495 --> 00:03:49.630
But because computer
double in their power,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.100
and so does network bandwidth,
every two years, approximately,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.235
it's only a matter of waiting.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:59.506
And it's 15 years later now, than
when I originally started Second Life,

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:01.508
and what that means
is that we have computers

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:06.180
that are about 50 or more times
faster than we did when we started.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:09.116
In fact, High Fidelity,
my new company,

00:04:09.716 --> 00:04:12.286
here, we are trying to build
virtual worlds

00:04:12.286 --> 00:04:16.089
that take advantage of all the speed
we have on modern PCs,

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:17.959
and all the speed of the network,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.729
as well as its latency,
its point-to-piont timing today.

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.232
And that's allowing us already
to create experiences

00:04:24.232 --> 00:04:27.302
that are extraordinarily life-like
and compelling.

00:04:27.302 --> 00:04:31.672
For example, we've built
the whole inside of an animal cell

00:04:32.373 --> 00:04:35.710
that works, that actually has
moving parts, you know,  inside it.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.178
And teachers can take their students

00:04:38.178 --> 00:04:41.014
actually, into that space
on a  sort of magic school bus,

00:04:41.014 --> 00:04:45.418
that drives around in it, and lets you
look at the cell from the inside out.

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:48.056
That's an example
of what would you do in VR.

00:04:48.056 --> 00:04:50.858
That is just going to be
world changing,

00:04:50.858 --> 00:04:54.862
and is only just becoming possible
with the technology.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.565
All right, here is one more tweet.

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:03.370
All right, Parabolicarc.com,
just asks: "Why?"

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.472
You know,
I think that's a great question.

00:05:05.807 --> 00:05:10.344
Well, I think virtual worlds
and generally, technology,

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:14.082
is our aspiration
and potential as humans.

00:05:14.082 --> 00:05:17.185
I mean, we are building and doing
everything we can do.

00:05:17.185 --> 00:05:20.321
We've done all those things
with the world up till now.

00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:22.023
You know,
the kind of world around us

00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:24.023
has been the world
on the surface of the earth.

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:27.862
But why wouldn't we create,
a kind of new space?

00:05:27.962 --> 00:05:30.797
A virtual world where we can go
inside that space, I guess,

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:33.334
rather than going into outer space
in spaceships.

00:05:33.901 --> 00:05:36.571
If that space is big
as the real world,

00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:40.842
which it will be, many times larger
in another decade, which it will be,

00:05:40.842 --> 00:05:43.978
why wouldn't we explore it
in the same way

00:05:43.978 --> 00:05:47.482
that we explored and built and
changed everything else around us?

00:05:47.482 --> 00:05:49.950
So, that's why. That's what keeps me
getting up in the morning,

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.351
working on what I'm working on.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.254
