[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.580
-Hi everyone!

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.070
I'm Bailey and this is Brooklyn
from Brooklyn and Bailey.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.765
And today we're going
to do a Q and A where

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.460
we answer all of
your guys' questions

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.237
that you want us to answer.

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:20.820
So the first one
we're going to answer

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.330
is the most common
question asked for us.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.980
How do you tell the
difference between us two?

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.770
-And there's not really
a specific detail

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.290
on the difference between us.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.390
-Wait, you have bangs.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.210
-I have bangs, she doesn't.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.550
-I will never have bangs.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.850
-She's got more of like a
circular face than I do.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.010
Mine's more kind of--

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.230
-Her's is all squished.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.175
-Cuz she was close to
me in my mom's stomach.

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:47.910
-She was up under the rib, so
I was like, ah, I need room.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.170
And she's like all squished
in the ribs and stuff.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.470
So now her face is like that.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.090
-And I always wear
long earrings.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.670
Brooklyn does not
like long earrings

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.150
because it's just not
part of her personality.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.320
So, always look for those,
and you'll know it's me.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.580
-These are my earrings,
they will never change.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.450
So a lot of guys have been
wondering what kind of videos

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.480
we're going to be
doing on our channel.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.040
And since my mom has a
whole like, hair thing,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.690
but we are mostly
going to be doing

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.880
like a hodgepodge of just--

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.380
-Fashion,

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.240
-Nails,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.060
-DIYs,

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.040
-Yeah, silly videos,
vlogs of the family,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.340
anything of that sort.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.880
-Anything pretty much
that revolves around

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:25.630
our personalities.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.740
-Daily things.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.340
So, yeah those are the videos
we'll be doing on our--

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.881
-I don't know,
whatever we feel like.

00:01:30.881 --> 00:01:33.690
But the next one is,
what's our favorite food?

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.710
Our favorite food to eat, both
of us like this, is potatoes.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.670
-Potatoes.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.040
-We love potatoes.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.540
Yes.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.566
-Idaho potatoes,

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:43.630
-Mashed potatoes.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.960
-You can smell them from a
mile away, they're so good.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.160
-They're delicious.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.080
The next question is, what
our favorite books are?

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.875
And--

00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:51.553
-Pf.

00:01:51.553 --> 00:01:52.761
I don't have a favorite book.

00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.236
--that's a hard question,
because we like to read.

00:01:55.236 --> 00:02:00.280
-I like sci-fi books, those
are good and I like fantasy.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.420
You know, dragons and
knights in shining armor.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.985
-I think my favorite series ever
is Goose Girl by Shannon Hale.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:11.880
That series is awesome,
so go check it out.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.331
-It's a good book, well,
a good, how many books?

00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:14.830
-Series.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.050
-There's four books.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.251
One, two, four--

00:02:17.251 --> 00:02:19.000
-I think there's four
books in the series.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.499
-Yeah

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.650
-Go read them, they're good.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.370
OK.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.360
The next question is.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.530
What are our favorite treats?

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.500
-Chocolate,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.030
-Brownies,

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.529
-Yeah!

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.510
-Ice cream, yummy things.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.880
-Fudge.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.380
-Chocolate.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.830
-Chocolate.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.205
-They should say chocolate's
a girl's best friend instead

00:02:34.205 --> 00:02:36.330
of diamonds, because
chocolate makes anyone happy,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.370
it's so yummy.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.050
-Diamonds are expensive.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.370
The next question is,
which one of us is taller?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.250
And, yeah, she's taller.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.910
It's usually off and on.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.210
-I just grew like, an
inch, so now, I'm like,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.210
I don't even know, half
an inch taller than her?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.720
-It's off and on, so.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.269
-Depends.

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:54.810
I don't know.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.260
-Maybe next time,
I might be taller.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.630
-When we were
little, I was taller.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.213
And then she was taller when we
were like in fourth grade, now

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.060
I'm taller.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.270
So, you know, who knows?

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.210
It'll change in the next month.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.985
-Yeah, and she's also
older, by two minutes.

00:03:08.985 --> 00:03:10.730
Two minutes.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.089
-Yeah, see, I rule.

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.880
I'm older than you.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.870
-So some of our
hobbies are tumbling.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.922
-I like tumbling.

00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:18.880
-It's just floor stuff.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.540
We don't do bars or
anything like that.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.580
Just floor, like
back handsprings.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.340
-Tucks and stuff.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.020
And dance, I like
to do dance, too.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.920
-Yeah, dancing.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.250
And reading, of course.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.750
-I love to read,
read all the time.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.374
The next on, probably
is like, stores.

00:03:35.374 --> 00:03:36.790
What stores we buy
our clothes at.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.870
-Forever 21, woo!

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:39.860
-And American Eagle.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.901
That's a good store, too.

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.610
-Yeah, those are like our
two favorite, top two.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.030
And then Ross, but it's
off and on in that store.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.910
Do we share a room?

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.780
-Yes.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.897
Always have, always
will until I'm married.

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:53.980
Then I won't share a room.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.188
That's weird, don't share
a room when you're married.

00:03:56.188 --> 00:03:59.445
-She doesn't like
it, I'm too messy.

00:03:59.445 --> 00:04:03.115
-I don't mind sharing a
room, you know, it's OK.

00:04:03.115 --> 00:04:05.080
You learn to live with
it when you have a twin.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.360
It's like having a shadow, they
just follow you everywhere.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.890
-The next question, is
probably, personalities.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.380
-The difference between
our personalities.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.850
-I'm girly.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.360
She's not.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.019
-Well, not not girly.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.270
-I'm more girly.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.940
I like fashion and
doing hair and nails.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.750
And she's more like,
let's go throw footballs--

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.750
-And kick a soccer ball,

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.362
--and have a water fight
and stuff like that.

00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:37.570
-Outdoorsy, I guess, I don't
know what you'd call it.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.570
But, I have some girly traits.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.340
-She got those from me.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.950
Twin-epathy.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.240
I think that's how you say it.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.546
Do we have like,
telepathic abilities?

00:04:50.546 --> 00:04:51.920
-Sometimes I'll
walk into a room,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.440
and I'll be singing a song--

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.011
-At the exact same time,
with the exact same tune.

00:04:56.011 --> 00:04:57.010
--singing the same song.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.080
We'll be like singing
a song, or we'll

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.370
say the exact same thing--

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.540
-At the exact same time.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.811
-Watch, watch this cool trick.

00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:06.310
-Ow.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.840
-That is what I call
Twin-epathy right there.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.710
-That's about all the questions
that we have for today.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.010
But if you have any more,
just leave the questions

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.423
down in the comment
box below so that we

00:05:20.423 --> 00:05:22.006
can be able to hear
what you guys want

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:25.730
us to say in our
videos and we will--

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.430
-See ya later!

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.930
-See ya.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.530
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.430
(SINGING) Cuz you
can do anything.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.480
Yeah you can do anything.
