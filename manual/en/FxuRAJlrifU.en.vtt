00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.310
Here I have got the Salomon XA Pro 3D men's
shoe.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.849
This is an all around adventure shoe, so I
can see this as being for fast and light backpacking

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.420
or hiking, also used for trail running on
rugged terrain.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.620
With this shoe there is an excellent balance
of support and comfort.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.590
So if we start...

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.770
Salomon has built this shoe on their solid
3D chassis.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.550
So you can see it here in the heel, but it
runs throughout the shoe.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.140
You have extra cushioning with the EVA foam
that runs through the mid sole there and that

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.620
just offers extra cushioning and extra comfort.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.210
You do have a removable ortho light foot bed,
which gives additional comfort and cushioning

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.440
and is easy to take out if you need to replace
it with your own foot bed or orthotics.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.789
So definitely a great option, lots of comfort
in there.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.420
The mostly mesh upper is rally breathable.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.409
So should it become wet, it will dry out a
lot faster compared to a waterproof shoe if

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.170
the inside of the shoe becomes wet.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.049
And we can see these overlays which give some
extra durability and as you cinch down the

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.030
laces this really cushions and, you know,
tightens down on your foot.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.039
As well, on the inside of the shoe the tongue
is Salomon's endo-fit.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:44.569
So there is actually a piece that fits over
top of your foot on the inside and it gives

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:45.799
excellent stability.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:52.709
So once you cinch down these laces that endo-fit
piece is rally going to be comfortable.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:57.989
It cuts down on hot spots and really cinches
down nice on your feet.

00:01:57.989 --> 00:02:00.329
We go to the bottom of the shoe.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.679
This is Salomon's contra-grip outsole which
means that it is very durable and very aggressive

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:07.579
on the trail.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:16.060
These lugs give you extra traction on trails
and on uneven terrain and just a lot of traction

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.650
throughout there.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.560
If we look at the platform, this does have
a 21 millimeter heel height and an 11 millimeter

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560
four foot height.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.239
So you do have a 10 millimeter drop which
is pretty typical with trail shoes in this

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.430
category.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.739
It has got a pretty protective toe cap along
with the mud guard behind it.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.379
So if you do get into muddy conditions or
wet conditions, it is going to protect you

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:53.360
a little bit better, you know, before water
and mud begins to seep into the shoe.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.849
Some other features: you do have asymmetrical
lacing which is going to cut down on your

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.739
feet falling asleep.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.010
You do have the lace pocket right here so
once you cinch that down you can tuck this

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.409
piece and the rest of the lace into that pocket.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.959
All in all, with a combination of support,
durability, comfort and protection with these

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.099
shoes, it is an all around adventure shoe.

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:21.639
It is the Salomon XA Pro.
