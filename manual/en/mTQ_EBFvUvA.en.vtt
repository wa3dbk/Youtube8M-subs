00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:06.808
Purity

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:15.794
Purity is something I think that very, very few people 
 understand what it is, and know what it is.

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:23.260
The standard that Jesus set for purity, how He set it.

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:26.320
What He said, in Matthew for example.

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:30.155
It is a high standard, but it is not an impossible standard.

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.235
Because that's how He also took it.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.400
To be pure is far more than just being pure in outward things.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.600
Most of purity has to do with how you're taking it in your thought life.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.100
If your eyes look at a woman to lust for her, 
 you've committed adultery. This is something nobody can see.

00:00:52.843 --> 00:00:54.708
It's with your thoughts and with your eyes.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:01:01.539
But that's how serious He took it and that's the way 
He also wants His followers, His disciples, to take it.

00:01:04.852 --> 00:01:13.126
When you live for your lusts, that means 
 what we naturally as young people want.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.660
It leaves you in such an emptiness, and when you look back,

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.220
you can say that your thought life has been with many different things, and many different people.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:23.840
And that's not pure.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:25.855
Pure means clean.

00:01:25.995 --> 00:01:30.872
That your heart is clean. And that your heart is for God and only for God.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.151
How can I keep myself pure?

00:01:36.775 --> 00:01:38.091
Where are your thoughts?

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.200
You cannot be pure in your thoughts if you use your time

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.100
to watch things, or to see things or to listen to things,

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:57.570
or to be with people where there's no purity.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.829
So the first step there is to be careful how you use your time,

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.338
for example with the Internet, and with what you watch and what you listen to.

00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:15.430
Is it pure? Does it help me? Does it follow the example Jesus set?

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:19.360
But I am tempted anyway - ?

00:02:19.673 --> 00:02:24.333
One thought in itself, for example when one impure thought comes in,

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.800
that doesn't mean that you have sinned.

00:02:27.973 --> 00:02:32.590
That comes as a temptation, the first thought. But the question is, what do I do with that thought?

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:38.720
If that impure thought leads to another impure thought, and you let those thoughts continue, then that's impurity.

00:02:38.873 --> 00:02:42.310
But it is completely normal that as a youth you're tempted.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.320
You're tempted to youthful lusts, and there are many thoughts there that come, that are first...

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.980
But to be conscious, to be conscious when that thought comes, and it's not pure,

00:02:54.083 --> 00:02:59.430
then, what should I do with it? Then I stop thinking those thoughts.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:04.760
I remember as a teenager, you feel that you are tempted non-stop.

00:03:04.763 --> 00:03:07.810
There's thought after thought, after thought, after thought.

00:03:08.374 --> 00:03:15.240
But when you're faithful thought after thought, that's purity!

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:20.680
There it's really important to know that I have decided with my whole heart and and my whole mind to serve God.

00:03:20.682 --> 00:03:30.370
Then the temptations come, but then to not listen to Satan who would have me think that I have sinned and it's not possible for me.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.450
What's the result of keeping myself pure?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.917
It says: We who believe enter into rest.

00:03:37.917 --> 00:03:40.068
And you can say, what is rest? Rest is rest,

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:51.020
Rest means that things that tempted you before â€“ you feel like it was constantly those thoughts, you were tempted non-stop,

00:03:52.118 --> 00:03:55.157
you come to rest from that.

00:03:55.157 --> 00:04:03.240
I've experienced that for myself. That there's a real joy in choosing to live a pure life.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:11.630
And for myself I can say, to choose purity, is, I think, the greatest thing you can do for yourself.

00:04:11.632 --> 00:04:20.380
It's not at all that it's hard and it's bondage. You save yourself from so much.

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:28.430
You make it so much easier for yourself, for the future.
