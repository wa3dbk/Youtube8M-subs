00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.997
Swoop style bangs are a great way to switch up your look.

00:00:13.317 --> 00:00:15.038
You will need wefted hair,

00:00:16.431 --> 00:00:17.414
weaving clips,

00:00:17.793 --> 00:00:18.670
your needle and thread,

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:19.823
a comb,

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:20.603
shears

00:00:20.785 --> 00:00:21.499
and a flat iron.

00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:27.893
In order to begin, you're going to cut your 
 weft into a seven inch wide panel.

00:00:28.547 --> 00:00:31.786
If one weft is too thin to frame in your face

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:36.393
cut two, and attach the two together with a fabric adhesive.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.841
From there, you're ready to sew on your weaving clips.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:44.041
The last step in the process is to sew on your weaving clips.

00:00:44.642 --> 00:00:47.847
Make sure that when you sew them on that the tongs are pointed up

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.681
and not upside down because you'll never be 
 able to put it on that way.

00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:57.130
So we're going to take our needle and thread

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.262
and push it through the weft once.

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.400
Before you get all the way to the end, 
 put your needle back through the thread.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.834
And you're going to pick up your clip.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:09.957
Put it in place.

00:01:10.953 --> 00:01:13.771
And you're going to go through that hole

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:15.354
back through the weft

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:17.766
once.

00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:20.067
Twice.

00:01:21.868 --> 00:01:23.049
And then three times.

00:01:28.653 --> 00:01:32.132
Okay, now, you're going to go back through the weft

00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:35.415
so that you're underneath your clip.

00:01:37.758 --> 00:01:39.100
You're going to put your clip

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.580
in place, but hold it slightly off the weft

00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:45.360
and go just above that hole,

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.240
through the weft.

00:01:51.013 --> 00:01:53.690
And what that's going to do is it's going to allow you

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:58.470
to get that thread over to the other side, but 
 you're going to hide it underneath that clip.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:03.690
So then you're going to go actually through that hole once.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.660
Twice.

00:02:10.594 --> 00:02:12.850
And you're probably already guessing it...

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.200
Three times.

00:02:19.143 --> 00:02:23.160
Now we're on the front side of our weft, 
 we need to go underneath our clip.

00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:26.350
And tie our knots.

00:02:29.164 --> 00:02:30.720
So I just flipped it up out of the way.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.940
So we're going to go through that weft once.

00:02:37.246 --> 00:02:39.430
Around our thread twice.

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:41.530
And we're going to repeat that.

00:02:42.653 --> 00:02:43.700
Through the weft.

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:51.720
And to make our knot, we're going to 
 go around our thread once, and twice.

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:53.400
And then pull it tight.

00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:55.630
And that's going to secure it.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:02:58.310
You're just going to repeat that

00:02:58.791 --> 00:02:59.790
until you have

00:03:00.686 --> 00:03:02.780
all of your clips sewn on to your weft.

00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:09.460
Before you wear your swoop style bangs, you're going to want to flat 
 iron these to make sure that they're perfectly smooth across your face.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.050
You can add a little bit of Heat Glide 
 or Moroccanoil to help smooth out the hair.

00:03:14.625 --> 00:03:16.000
You're just going to start at the top

00:03:16.728 --> 00:03:18.620
and smooth your way down.

00:03:19.204 --> 00:03:20.900
If you're starting with a wavier hair,

00:03:21.142 --> 00:03:25.400
use your comb to help smooth our your hair between each pass.

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:35.460
Once you've completed your flat ironing process

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.690
they're ready to wear!

00:03:37.673 --> 00:03:43.550
To use these bangs, simply clip them in to the front of 
 your hairline and use a headband to hide the seam.
