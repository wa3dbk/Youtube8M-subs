Hi I’m Marisa Peer. Thank you for listening
to me today. When I first worked with very

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.460
overweight people, they would always say things
like “it isn’t fair that I can’t eat

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.740
what I want” “why can’t I have what
I want”. You can have whatever you want

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.420
if you’re prepared to pay the price. I actually
can’t eat what I want but luckily I made

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.880
myself love the food I eat. So, if you eat
whatever you want and gain a lot of weight,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.250
you’re going to have quite a restricted
life. Whereas if you choose to restrict your

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.150
diet, just a little bit, everything will change.
So I’ve worked with very overweight people

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.880
who have told me how restricted their life
is because they cant do certain things. But

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.370
simply will not restrict their diet. What
I absolutely recommend is to love the restrictions,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.720
to welcome them. So rather than saying, “oh
I can’t eat this, I can’t eat that”

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.900
you have to say, “I love eating this way.
I love taking the right food with me, I love

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.229
ordering healthy food.” If you welcome the
restrictions, they won’t feel like restrictions.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.393
If you have children, you can’t stay up
all night and sleep all day. We all know that

00:01:12.393 --> 00:01:15.290
having children ends that. But we welcome
the restrictions when we want a baby.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.750
If you have a partner you can’t take your
salary and spend it all on holiday and coming

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.461
back whenever you like. We understand that
in a relationship, there are certain restrictions.

00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:31.590
Even if you own a home, you know have restrictions
because a big part of your salary goes to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.270
your mortgage. But don’t we all accept those
restrictions? Even welcome them? If you have

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.950
a pet, you have to walk it when you have a
flu or headache. But we welcome the restrictions.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.160
With your diet and what you eat, welcome the
restrictions. Don’t bitch and moan and complain

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.480
about what you can’t eat or shouldn’t
eat. Tell yourself that you’re choosing

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.460
to do this. This restrictions… not eating
cheese, having certain food that are more

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.080
healthy for you not eating deep fried food.
Just changing for instance having crisps to

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:13.880
popcorn. Don’t see it as a hardship; see
it as a benefit. You’ll become thinner,

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.720
happier, lighter, leaner… go to my website
marisapeer.com for lots more hints and thank

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.599
you for listening.
