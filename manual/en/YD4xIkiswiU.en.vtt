Hi, I'm Heath Heine with Clearview Windshield
Repair here on behalf of Expert Village. In

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.309
this clip we are going to be talking about
how to determine what type of break you have.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.471
Before beginning the repair, you want to clean
and inspect the whole windshield because you

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:22.449
might have some other stone breaks that are
hidden maybe under your windshield wiper,

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:28.199
that's a good place for them to usually hide.
Just make sure you go around the whole edging

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.950
because those ones are actually more prime
for cracking out. It can also help you if

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.130
you look from the inside of the windshield
so just look from all angles. After wiping

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.900
down and inspecting the whole windshield,
you've found some stone breaks. Now you need

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.870
to determine what type of break they are so
that you know how to prepare it before you

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.710
do the repair. Right here we found a clam
shell which is the glass that has gotten nicked

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.220
out just kind of at an angle and we've also
got a star which is just caused by a regular

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.030
rock and that is usually an x or just a sliver.
We've also got a bullseye which is a perfect

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.000
circle. These ones you will usually see more
often than not. Then we have a combination

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.960
break which is a combination of a bullseye
and a star put into one break. So all of these

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.679
actually have potential of cracking out. And
we also have a pressure ring which is hit

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.819
by more something like a golf ball or a lug
nut off of a car. It is something with blunt

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:39.130
force, blunt pressure. Besides that we also
have a crack that we are going to go over

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.969
here pretty soon and this one is probably
about 8 to 10 inches. Now you usually can

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.170
fix cracks but you want to keep them just
like a single crack, just one. I mean if you

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.179
start getting cracks clear across the windshield
that is actually going to need a replacement

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:00.970
and bear in mind that all of these bullseye,
combination, clam shell, they have the potential

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.939
of cracking out too so that is why you want
to get those handled before you have to replace

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:05.499
your windshield.
