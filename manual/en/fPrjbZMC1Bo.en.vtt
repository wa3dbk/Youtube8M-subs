00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:03.997
Hello youtube, today we make pine syrup.

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:12.623
We use an experimental method,
as we did making birch sap wine.

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:14.863
The wine looks almost ready.

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:18.280
Only little fermentation.

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:21.248
Ok. Pine syrup.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:23.917
We have here some pine tips

00:00:24.613 --> 00:00:26.042
Gathered yesterday...

00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:29.893
28-th of april

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:39.193
I wash them well, rinse, and then I put them in a jar

00:00:40.354 --> 00:00:45.577
One layer pine tips, one layer sugar,

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:47.721
One layer pine tips and one sugar.

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:53.168
The last layer must be sugar, a thick one, it works as a lid.

00:00:55.818 --> 00:00:58.675
For one kilogram of pine, one kilo of sugar is needed.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.998
One to one.

00:01:02.724 --> 00:01:03.579
Then,

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.236
You bury the jar underground.

00:01:08.635 --> 00:01:10.735
I will put it in the cellar

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:14.891
I have constant temperature there, and enough darkness

00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:31.311
I have to shake it after a month, from time to time.

00:01:32.022 --> 00:01:35.552
And when all the sugar is dissolved I'll put it in bottles.
