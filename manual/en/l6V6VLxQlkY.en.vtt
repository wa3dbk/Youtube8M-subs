00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.040
This patient is being prepared to
undergo a SPECT procedure

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.440
to look at myocardial profusion,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.920
that is,
blood supply to the heart muscle.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.560
It's usual to scan the patient to look at
the profusion

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.360
when the heart is being stressed
and also when the heart is rested.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.480
There can be several days between
these two image acquisitions.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.320
Stressing of the heart is achieved
in two ways,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.800
first by a pharmaceutical which has
a similar effect on the heart

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.240
to taking exercise.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.520
And also by squeezing a dumbbell.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.800
The heart needs to monitored
carefully during this period,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.160
so an ECG is recorded.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.240
This is the bit that allows us to see â€“

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.840
take some pictures
and see what's going on.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.480
Once the heart has been stressed,
the radiopharmaceutical is injected.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:53.400
In this case,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.480
the pharmaceutical being used
is Technetium-labelled Tetrofosmin.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.520
Okay?

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.840
That's that part of the test finished now,
Mr Park,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.520
so I'm just going to disconnect you
from all of the machinery

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.800
and then I'm going to ask you to wait
in the waiting room,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.920
because it takes this isotope
up to an hour to reach your heart.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.800
And then I'll come and collect you
and escort you through for your scan,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.880
okay?

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.160
Hello, Geoff, this is Mr Park.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.160
Mr Park, this is Geoff,
and Geoff will be doing your scan,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.480
- so I'll hand you over, okay?
- Thank you very much.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.720
If you'd like to lie on this bed,
on your back, for me,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.520
with your feet up this end and your
head on the pillow just up there.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.920
Alright?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.840
I need you to put your arms just above
your head for me now,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.600
just on either side of you,
and that one as well.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.120
In order to obtain thermographic images,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.680
two gamma cameras must be rotated
around the patient,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.640
as close as possible to the heart,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720
and the cameras are now trained to
move around the patient

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.480
as closely as possible
without touching him.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.640
The computer will now calculate...

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.120
and teach this camera head
just to move in.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.760
Keep very still...

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160
I'll go and start the positioning.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.560
The images are reconstructed
from the data,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.280
using the same back projection
techniques

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.960
that are used in CT scanning.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.720
They're shown as slices through the
heart in different directions,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.400
with the white part of the image
corresponding to high take-up

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.360
of the radiopharmaceutical,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.960
and the blue part representing
low take-up.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.920
Right, that's it,
we're all finished now, you can relax.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.880
We will be doing some pictures
of your heart when it's at rest,

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.360
and that will be later on.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.160
We'll give you all the details about when
we're going to do that

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.720
in about ten minutes or so,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.440
but first of all I'm going to check
the data.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.280
Have a seat in the waiting room
where you were before.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.240
Right.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.640
And I'll come and let you know.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720
Thank you.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.600
- bye bye for now.
- Bye.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.240
Right, here we have some
processed images,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.600
and we're looking at the stress
and rest in the short axis,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.960
stress and rest in the
horizontal long axis,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.280
and stress and rest in
the vertical long axis.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.880
And what we're now going to do

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.280
is compare isotope distribution in the
stress images and the rest images,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.960
looking for reversible
or irreversible defects.
