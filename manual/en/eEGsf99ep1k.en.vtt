Hi, I’m Kelsey. I’ve been knitting for
10 years, and am a member of several knitting

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.309
organizations. Once you’ve learned how to
cast on and knit, at some point you’re going

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.219
to have to stop. You can’t just take it
off the needle or it’s going to unravel.

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.230
What you have to do is the opposite of casting
on, you cast off. This is also known as binding

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.800
off. Just like casting on, there are a million
different ways to cast off. By far the most

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.789
common is the technique I’m going to show
you here. When you’re casting off, It’s

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.430
very similar to knitting, you go ahead and
start by knitting two stitches on your right

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.219
hand needle. You knit one and then knit two.
Now what you’re going to do is use your

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:49.800
left hand needle to pull this first stitch
over the second. So you pull that stitch over

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.039
and as you see you then get an edge that’s
not going to unravel. Then you’re going

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.609
to knit another stitch so you know have two
on the right hand needle, and you’re going

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.180
to repeat. Put the left hand needle into the
first stitch and pull it over and off. Repeat,

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:18.750
knit again, over and off. And then, when you
get to the end, you will have one stitch left

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.560
on the needle. So now you’ve got one stitch
left on your needle. Now you’re going to

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.800
want to cut the yarn. You want to leave yourself
a good size tail so you can wave it in or

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.850
use it to sew and connect this piece to another
piece if you’re making a multi piece garment.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.310
Go ahead and cut the yarn. Now what you’re
going to do is make a loop on your right hand

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.790
needle, take your fingers and take that stitch
and pull it up and over like your did with

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.310
all the others. Then go ahead and pull that
yarn thread all the way through and tighten

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.780
it. Now you’ve got a nice bound off edge
there with a nice attractive little knit border.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.060
That will keep it from unraveling. And that’s
how you bind off.
