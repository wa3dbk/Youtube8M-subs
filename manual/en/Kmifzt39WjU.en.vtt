00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.200
Hi everybody. I’m Melissa. Welcome back
to Cloudmom, so happy to be here at Albee

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.080
Baby. Today I’m looking at the UPPAbaby
Mesa infant car seat. This has just come on

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.779
the market in early 2013. People are very
excited about it. I’m going to walk through

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.259
the basic features of the seat and a general
install for you guys. Make sure you look at

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.140
your product manual to make sure that your
baby is safely installed in his or her seat

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.100
in your car. Just to start out, this is a
very sleek and narrow seat. It has excellent

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.379
side infant protection here for the head area.
It has a five-point harness, one, two, three,

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.789
four, five. These clips are very easy to use.
When you’re detaching this clip here, getting

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.100
your baby in and out, you’re just going
to press on that red button. I like the fact

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.339
here that they say that this clip should be
at armpit level. Frequently people have their

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.460
baby’s upper clip here too low. Now what
else is special about this? And by the way

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:16.010
you adjust here when you want to pull the
seat up and down. When you have your seat

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.500
in it’s base, which I’ll show you guys
in a minute, you just have to pull up on this

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.370
one lever here to release the base. It’s
very easy compared to a lot of other car seats.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.250
And when the seat is sitting on the base of
your stroller, and this is compatible with

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.630
the Vista and the Cruz, you can dislodge the
seat by just pressing on this one button.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.790
So it’s very, very easy. Okay? So those
are the basic features of the seat. I’m

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.810
going to show this to you using the base of
the Vista now, the UPPAbaby Vista. And we

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.700
have another video on that stroller. Here’s
the Vista. The seat does come with two very

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.770
small adaptors. They fit right in there. You’ll
hear a nice clicking sound, always rear-facing

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.510
when it comes to an infant car seat. And I’m
just going to hold it up and attach it right

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.340
here and get that nice clicking sound. One
thing you can do is just pick up on your car

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.140
seat to make sure that your baby’s safely
installed. So here I am. I’m cruising around.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.239
I’m looking so stylish with my UPPAbaby
Vista. And guess what I want to do when I

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.829
want to take my car seat out? Watch this.
Duck. That’s it, very, very easy. I can

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:35.400
also collapse my base while my adaptors are
in place by doing two things. I’m going

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.389
to release the brake to show you guys something.
I’m going to be pushing down on this little

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.290
piece here with my index finger. And if I
put down the brake the stroller won’t roll

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.689
away from me while I collapse it. So I pull
up here, push down here to get it to that

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:59.900
part, that area. And it easily, easily collapses.
And I can have it like this. Restaurant owners

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.870
are going to love you. When you want to get
the base back into position it’s very easy.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.840
Pull up on this little black piece here, which
dislodges the stroller, and then watch this.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.239
Duck. That’s it. And again, to put my car
seat in I just need to snap down there. And

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.879
I’m quickly going to go through how the
base of the seat is going to work. And again

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.810
you have to look at your product manual. This
is not a thorough install review. But I just

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.829
want to quickly show people how easy this
is. And it really does have a new technology.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:39.450
I’m going to go through two things here.
And the first is the basic latch install.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.599
And you’re going to be using these two latches
here, which are located here, which are kept

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.829
conveniently in these little nooks when I’m
not using them. Now the way I’m going to

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.799
do my latch install is I’m going to loosen
up on the latches by pressing on these two

00:03:51.799 --> 00:04:00.169
orange buttons here. I press on this orange
button and I come down, and my latch is right

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:06.109
behind me. So I’ve already done one side.
Now I’m doing another side. I’m pressing

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.950
down on this orange button. I’m going to
take my latch out of it’s little nook. You

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:20.239
can get more slack by pressing down. And you
hear that nice clicking sound. Now what is

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:26.310
so special about the Mesa? This is what it
is. Oh by the way, this piece here adjusts

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.110
the height of the seat which you may or may
not need depending on the incline of the,

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.690
of your automobile seat. So once I’m in
this position with the Mesa, what I’m looking

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:39.930
for is I want this window to turn to green
from red, which indicates that my seat is

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.650
in a safe position. And again make sure you look at your manual to make sure all the components of this

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.539
are in the proper place. So I’m going to
push down like this and see that I get that

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.300
nice green bar. And I know I’m good to go
with the latch system. And now I’m going

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.599
to show you guys how to do this with the seatbelt.
When it comes to installing your seatbelt,

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:06.580
you want to pull it out as tight as possible
to begin your install. Okay? So I’m pulling

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.690
out like this and I’m then holding with my other hand like this to make sure this is all nice and

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:19.259
tight. I’m going to take this piece, I’m
going under here, keeping it nice and flat.

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:26.629
I’m going over this blue part here. And
I’m going to click it in here. And now what

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:29.639
I’m going to do is I’m going to pick up
the slack and make sure that my seatbelt is

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.620
as tight as possible by pulling in on the
top piece like this. You could just sort of

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:44.470
adjust it like that. Now this seat in Albee’s
is not totally typical of every automobile

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.240
seat of course. See how that goes? And it
does not have a self-lock, which your seat

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.180
may have, which is a great safety feature.
This piece goes down and locks nicely into

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.879
place. And again this whole thing should be
as tight as possible. Once this is done with

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:05.639
your belt, what you’re going to do is move
your seat around to make sure that it can

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:11.389
move no more than one inch in any direction.
That is assuring you that your seat is tight.

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:16.530
One other quick note about these seats, I
want to show you one other function on this

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:22.909
wonderful base. And again, you are always
rear-facing when it comes to a baby in an

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:30.460
infant car seat. This lever here should have
no red visible. And that is basically indicating

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:38.080
that the seat, the base, is at the right level.
So that’s another safety precaution. Those

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:44.270
are the basics of the UPPAbaby Mesa infant
car seat and base. Thank you so much for watching

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.289
this video. We’re going to have more information
about this product on Cloudmom. And we will

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.569
see you next time.
