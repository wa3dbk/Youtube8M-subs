00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120
Hello, everyone!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.940
Sorry I haven't uploaded in a while.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.280
As you know, as most of you should know, I was really busy working..

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.840
..on the new iHasCupquake animation, the Surgeon Simulator one.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.140
But I am back! And I am working on my next animation for you all..

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.180
But for now! Here are some questions you sent to me from Twitter and DeviantArt.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.780
"Where do you get your animation ideas for your channel?"

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.860
Um, I've just gotten all my ideas from society and the world around us.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.640
Whether it be from noticing things, just walking around, embarrassing real-life experiences..

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.640
So basically, all the stories that I'm animating for you all are just from the juices of life!

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.980
"Do you have any animation tips or tricks?"

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.880
*laughs*

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:49.260
When I was just starting, like I said in my last Q and A, my first animation experience was a huge project.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.500
And at the time, I had no idea how to actually animate or do anything..

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.280
And it was scary; it was intimidating!

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.760
So I would say, don't start off with a huge idea or skit, 'cause chances are..

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.840
It'll get overwhelming, it'll get confusing, you won't know what the heck in the world is going on..

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840
So, start off with the basics.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.160
I don't know, like a bouncing ball or a walking guy just to get an understanding..

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.200
..of the animation process and then you can go from there!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.160
"Will you make animations for other YouTubers?"

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.360
I would love to work with other YouTubers!

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.320
Working with Cupquake is so awesome. They are amazing people..

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.080
..and I'd love to reach out to some other YouTube channels!

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.980
I've recently become obsessed with British YouTubers, so I feel like it'll be fun to work with one of them.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.100
My favorites are Dan and Phil. &lt;3

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.460
Most of you should know them and I feel like they would have some really great animation ideas.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.460
Maybe you guys can help me get in contact with them, like tweet them or something, I don't know..

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.220
Movin' on.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.100
"Am I Team Torchic, Team Treeko, or Team Mudkip?"

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.000
Pokemon Ruby was the first ever Pokemon game I ever played.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And it's my favorite! And the first time I ever played through it, I picked Torchic..

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.260
And ever since, I was hooked. I love Torchic. Torchic is bae.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.140
Also, Blaziken is tied with being my all-time favorite Pokemon ever!

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.760
Not to say that I dislike Treecko or Mudkip, I love them both, but I always go with my fire-y karate chicken.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.260
"What is 2 plus 2?"

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.880
Twenty-two. (help, this meme is a bear trap SOS)

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.360
"If I could be any animal that matches my personality, what would it be?"

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.180
This is kind of a funny coincidence.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.540
Because in junior high, I was in a class and somehow we got on the topic or deciding what animal I would be,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.100
and apparently, the class said that I would be a bunny, so..

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.600
I guess being a bunny wouldn't be that bad.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.880
You know, hoppin' around, eating grass, until you're SAVAGELY EATEN BY A COYOTE. (Bunny story of life)

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.340
But, you know, besides that.. that'll be pretty cool.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.220
"How big of a Pokemon fan are you?" (Did you not see like the 20 pokemon vids like wut)

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.340
You all do not understand. *laughs*

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.840
I am such a big Pokemon fan. I've played almost all the main games, some sides games..

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.520
..I have merchandise and I actually play it competitively. (I don't mess around boi ;D)

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.080
Yes, there is a technical side to Pokemon that many people are not aware of.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.020
It includes complicated things like Eevees, Ivies, Natures, Stats, Abilities, stuff like that.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.020
And if you have no idea what I'm talking about, then you are not ready. *laughing* (You not yet hold the power of the force -Yoda)

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.880
Once you are enlightened, you can never play it the same way again.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.220
You have been warned.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.060
"Do you like drawing traditionally or digitally?"

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.960
Um, I started off drawing on paper just like anyone else would--

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.960
Crayons, markers, stuff like that, so I was always used to paper when I was growing up.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.420
But when I got my first drawing pad, I started drawing digitally a lot more..

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.820
And now, I really like drawing digitally just because it's so much easier to fix things..

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.840
..or undo something-- Ctrl-Z is my god. *giggles*

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.900
So, I am much more of a digital drawer now.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.820
"Do you play any other games other than Pokemon?"

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.260
I am just a big Nintendo fan. All my favorite games are made by them.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.780
I love Animal Crossing, Kirby, Smash Bros, Mario..

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.260
Kate and I love playing Cooking Mama together because we rage when..

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.160
..when we ruin the dish by washing all the rice down the sink or burning the beef in the stir-fry..

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.320
..because the stupid onions we couldn't cook fast enough.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.540
I basically enjoy all the cute cartoon games.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.080
"What is your advice for peole learning to draw?"

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.140
I would say: Don't let anything discourage you.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.900
If you're passionate enough towards drawing, you need to keep doing it.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.300
Practice literally makes perfect when it comes to drawing.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.480
One tip that I figured out is: You shouldn't compare your work with other people's.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.320
Everyone draws differently, they all have their own style, and comparing yourself only discourages you.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.300
Also, listen to what other people say about your work

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.200
Don't just quote-on-quote "Block out the haters" because the art world is based on criticism.. (Even self-criticism)

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.500
..and how people perceive your artwork.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.460
So listening to people's point of view can help you grow as an artist and get better.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.880
Well, that's all the questions I have time for.

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.000
Thank you to everyone who sent money.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.460
If you want to ask a question for the next Q and A, be sure to follow me on Twitter and DeviantArt.

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.460
I love all and goodbye!
