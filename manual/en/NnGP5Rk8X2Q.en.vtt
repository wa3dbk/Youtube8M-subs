00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.389
We're going to cover the opportunity to start
training a horse towards his lateral work.

00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:10.601
Sometimes lateral work sounds like a dressage
term, but we know that everything that we

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:17.010
do with our handier western horses, all that
fancy footwork comes from the basics of dressage.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.699
Our rider is going to begin to ask this horse
to just simply cross over, or we might also

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.390
call this a leg yield. You can see she's putting
pressure through her lower leg and heel to

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.230
the horse's left side. She's creating an indirect
ring with her left ring, which means she's

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.670
simply moving it slightly over towards the
saddle horn as her right rein was opening

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.030
up. Laura, we'll do one more of those. That
was very good. So she puts herself in the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.220
straight on position and then begins to ask
him to go from the right to the left by closing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.280
the right door, opening the left. In other
words, applying pressure from right to left.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.050
That would be one of the very first and basic
things we can do with the horse to help them

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.710
understand this concept of moving side to
side rather than straight on. A young horse

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.770
would be taught first to do straight forward,
straight on, straight lines, round through

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.540
the corners, but then we would soon like to
move them to this position where they understand

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.460
how to cross over. Laura right now is starting
to show how he would then go to side passing.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.640
The difference being, of course, she's asking
him to remain in one track from left to right,

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.360
as his legs cross over, keeping him on that
nice, straight line. We call this side passing,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.970
it's very common to be used with western horses
in a number of disciplines. We want to make

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.060
it a pleasant and easy experience, recognizing
on a young horse that he may have an attention

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.740
span that we finish up with before he gets
too nervous about it. We always start on a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.560
good note; we always end on a good note. From
this point, we could start to ask the horse

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.080
to even go one more level of lateral work
where we now want him to keep his haunches

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.980
in place or his hind legs not moving. And
that would take us to the beginning of what

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.990
you might consider a spin. Spinning is very
common in the practice of reining horses as

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.340
well as our world of cutting, team penning,
ranch sorting, and not to mention even for

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.190
the class of trail class. There are often
times we have to do a turn on the haunches.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.140
So those are the three different examples
of ways that we can introduce lateral work.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.250
Each time it's the degree of forward that
we're trying to either to change in the transition

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.800
between a leg yield, a side pass, or a spin.
Asking the horse to maneuver and cross over

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:42.069
without going forward will change whether
it is those things, the leg yield, the side

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:42.880
pass, or the spin.
