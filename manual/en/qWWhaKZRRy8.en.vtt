00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.670
This video will show how to update the firmware
on a WAGO 750 Series PLC.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.180
We'll start by opening up the trap door for
the service cable.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:19.210
And with the PLC turned off, go ahead and
connect the 750-920 service cable.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:28.619
If you haven't already done so, you will want
to install the FBC Update software.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:39.850
And then you'll want to install the firmware
for the target that your wanting to update.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:48.390
You can then start FBC Update, and click on
options&gt;communications, select your com port.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.899
And then click identify, and you might get
some warning messages , um, just read them

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.100
and click through.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.390
After you've reviewed the new firmware, and
you're ready to update, go ahead and click

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.860
the update button and click continue.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.320
The update process will take several minutes,
I have accelerated the process here in the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.830
video, but you definitely do not want to interrupt
the transfer of the, ah, firmware at any point

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.410
or you can permanently damage the PLC.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.970
After the transfer of the firmware is complete,
you want to click on settings and do a 'format',

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:49.100
followed by an 'extract', followed by a 'restart'.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.920
This next step is optional.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.990
I like to go into WAGO Ethernet Settings and
verify that the firmware indeed transferred

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.020
correctly.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.280
You can locate the firmware version on the
controller by going to the 'identification'

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.860
tab and looking at Software (SW) version.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.560
And the number in the parenthesis is the firmware
version.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.230
And that concludes this video, thank you.
