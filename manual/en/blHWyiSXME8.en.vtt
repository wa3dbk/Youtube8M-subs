Hey ThreadHeads

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.500
I am here with Kristen of the fabulous blog, Glitter 'N Glue

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.640
Kristen, thanks for being here!

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.300
Thank you for having me on this fabulous show!

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.560
Everything is so Fabulous. Omigosh we're Jazz Hands right now

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.180
So, you just got back from Hawaii, and you were rocking your DIY Gladiator Sandals

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.200
all over Hawaii (All over) And what I'm liking about this project is that you can literally take

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.640
one pair of flip flops and turn them into a countless supply of sandals

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.240
I simply took one of my scarves, and cut it in half so that it's equal on both sides

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.820
The thing about these is that they do need to be the long scarves, so take that end

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.260
Yes, alright, we're working with ALL this

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.500
So, I know some people may be thinking, "Ok, if I cut it in half, then I'm going to have this RAW edge on the side

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.580
But I personally don't have a problem with the raw edge, sew that right up the edge

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.020
and then you have a clean seam there, and then you are ready to get to work

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.780
So you're gonna take your piece in the middle, equally in the middle, and then you're gonna the the loop

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:17.440
and slide it under the thong part, and you're gonna take the edges and just slide it on through

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.780
Now you're simply just gonna take both pieces, separate them, and then this is when you're gonna

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.620
start the wrapping. So it doesn't really matter whichever way you decide to go

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.820
But you're gonna simply wrap around the part of the flip flop so that you're covering it.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.060
It's really easy .

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.960
And I'll wrap that about 3 times.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.000
And then if you just spread it out so that it really covers it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.440
and then you just do it to the opposite side as well

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.420
So, there's many more ways to tie the Gladiator, I personally like, we'll call it the "Come from behind"

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.200
Where you criss-cross the frabric underneath your ankle

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.900
Criss-cross it behind the heel and then wrap it around your ankle

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.040
There you go.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.380
Well thank you so much Kristen, I'm sure everyone's gonna love this project

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.680
It's super easy and versatile, (OPTIONS), We like the options, (OPTIONS) It's all about the options

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.180
