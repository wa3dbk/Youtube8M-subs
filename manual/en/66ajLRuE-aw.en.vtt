00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.030
Hi, I'm Erica, the Product Manager 
for Simply Beads Kit-of-the-Month Club.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.050
I'm passionate about beading, 
and if you give me a couple minutes,

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.070
I'd like to show you a fun and exciting way that you can become a more accomplished beader.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.080
I've been an avid beader for 19 years,

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.100
ever since I bought my first beading kit.
It wasn't long before I was teaching

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.120
beading classes and designing my own jewelry.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.150
That's why I'm thrilled to work with 
Simply Beads Kit-of-the-Month Club.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.180
Our beading kits provide quality beads, findings and other materials. Our step-by-step instructions 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.220
with close-up how-to photos guide
 you through the entire process

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.250
of making gorgeous jewelry you'll find 
yourself wearing again and again.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.290
Simply Beads Kit-of-the-Month Club
 is like having a beading class 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.330
right into your home.
Best of all, it's a whole lot of fun!

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.340
Before you know it, you'll be making and wearing pieces
 of turquoise and silver,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.360
fresh water pearls and lapis stones. 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.380
We work with suppliers all over the world to find the right materials you need to complete

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.430
your projects, and wear them with pride. 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.490
Our kits are delivered right to your home,
and include all of the beads,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.540
findings, wire, hooks and clasps you need to
 create beautiful jewelry,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.580
including necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.610
