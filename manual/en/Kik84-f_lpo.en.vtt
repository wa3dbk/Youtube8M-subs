00:00:03.452 --> 00:00:07.846
As you're selecting a law school, one of the key things you need to consider is law school debt.

00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:10.462
Read any newspaper or blog these days

00:00:10.462 --> 00:00:12.883
and you'll find great concern over the amount of debt

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:14.315
law students take on.

00:00:14.315 --> 00:00:16.992
Too much debt reduces your choice in jobs,

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:20.330
affects your standard of living, and because of compounding interest,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.227
greatly increases the amount you'll spend on education.

00:00:24.227 --> 00:00:27.217
Luckily, if you choose Nebraska Law, chances are

00:00:27.217 --> 00:00:29.878
you can avoid a lot of these problems.

00:00:29.878 --> 00:00:32.450
We were recently named National Jurist Magazine's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.045
4th best value school because compared to other schools,

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:38.645
our tuition is low and our students graduate with

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:43.229
some of the lowest debt in the country, around $54,000.

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:48.594
In contrast, the average US public law school student borrows around $75,000.

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:54.048
At a private law school that number jumps to about $125,000.

00:00:54.048 --> 00:00:57.528
So what exactly do these numbers mean for you?

00:00:57.528 --> 00:01:02.529
If you took on the typical amount of debt at Nebraska and paid it back over ten  years,

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.346
your payments would be about $621 monthly.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:09.745
And you would pay just over $20,000 in interest.

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:13.509
Compare that to the debt that results at other schools.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.757
A student with the average debt from attending another public law school

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:22.539
would pay $871 per month and almost $30,000 in interest.

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.082
And a private law school student would have monthly payments

00:01:26.082 --> 00:01:28.992
more than double that of a Nebraska Law grad...

00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:35.594
around $1,438 per month with nearly $50,000 interest.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:38.860
Right now all of those numbers probably seem unreal.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.691
But here's why they matter.

00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:44.126
Experts recommend your job salary after graduation

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:47.126
roughly equal your total debt so that you can

00:01:47.126 --> 00:01:49.511
pay your monthly loan payments and also pay for

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:52.874
things like a mortgage, car payments and food.

00:01:52.874 --> 00:01:56.174
The more debt you have, the more money you need to make.

00:01:56.174 --> 00:01:59.166
The problem is that the highest paying jobs may not

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:02.929
be as readily available as you have been led to believe.

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:05.795
The highest paying entry level jobs across the country

00:02:05.795 --> 00:02:09.928
in 2011 paid about $160,000.

00:02:09.928 --> 00:02:13.887
But only about 14 percent of graduates get those jobs.

00:02:13.887 --> 00:02:15.294
The majority of new attorneys,

00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:16.745
around 52 percent of them,

00:02:16.745 --> 00:02:21.263
have jobs that pay in the $40-$65,000 range.

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:23.877
The danger is that you could take on a lot of debt

00:02:23.877 --> 00:02:28.398
and then not land one of the few jobs that would help you pay it off.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:31.531
Another concern is that there's only one type of job

00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.051
that offers a $160,000 salary.

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:36.441
Working a large law firm.

00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.418
Now that may be a great option for you.

00:02:38.426 --> 00:02:41.071
But you may want to do other things with your law degree.

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:43.890
With a Nebraska education and low debt,

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.329
it's likely you can do what you want to do,

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.643
whether that's run a non-profit.

00:02:48.643 --> 00:02:50.725
Or work as a public defender.

00:02:50.725 --> 00:02:52.058
Or for the government.

00:02:52.058 --> 00:02:53.741
Perhaps you want to start your own practice

00:02:53.741 --> 00:02:55.173
and be your own boss.

00:02:55.173 --> 00:02:57.577
Or perhaps you do want to work in a large firm in

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:01.091
Lincoln or New York City or anywhere in the United States.

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.973
The point is this, at Nebraska Law you receive a

00:03:03.973 --> 00:03:06.091
wonderful education and you will leave with

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:07.846
relatively low debt.

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:10.347
You're prepared for the high-paying law firm job,

00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:13.307
but you also can take the jobs that otherwise might

00:03:13.307 --> 00:03:16.547
not be an option if you're saddled with a higher debt load.

00:03:16.547 --> 00:03:18.763
The opportunities are endless.

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:21.439
A low debt load means more opportunity to have

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.571
the career in law that you have always dreamed about.

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:28.694
And you can start on your path to that career at Nebraska Law.
