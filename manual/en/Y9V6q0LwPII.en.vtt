00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.690
Hi, I’m Kelsey. I’ve been knitting for
several years and I’m a member of several

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.359
knitting organizations. Today I’m going
to talk about the kinds of needles you might

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.720
want to use for different types of knitting
projects. I’m going to talk specifically

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.950
about straight needles. These are the most
common type of needles when you are knitting

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.320
back and forth. As most projects are done
flat, you use straight needles. Needles come

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.430
in all sizes, this is a size 1, and these
are size 13. Much bigger. The size of the

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.279
needle and also the weight of the yarn determine
the drape of the fabric. A lot of time you

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.440
will use these smaller needles for delicate
work such as lace, and the bigger needles

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.892
for bulky yarns that knit up quickly like
a blanket or an afghan. When you are choosing

00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:47.559
a needle, one of the biggest choices is material
of the needle. The come often in wood, plastic

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.640
and metal, plastic and metal being the cheaper
and easier to find. It doesn’t mean that

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.990
they are any worse though, each kind has it’s
benefits and disadvantages. Metal ones are

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.640
really durable, which is nice. They’re cold
to the touch which some people don’t like.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.860
They can be heavy, but these are really light.
Aluminum ones are really light. They are the

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.720
easiest to find. The broadest range is going
to come in metals, so that’s one thing to

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.470
consider. Plastic are a little cheaper. They’re
lighter and the warm up when you hold them

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.060
which a lot of people really like especially
if you’re dealing with arthritis or carpel

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.960
tunnel syndrome or sensitive hands. Also a
lot of times your bigger, thicker needles,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.369
these are a 10.5 and the 13’s I showed you,
come in plastic most often which is nice and

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.790
they are cheaper. Wood is the most expensive
option, but it’s the prettiest, the lightest

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.600
and also warm to the touch. These are bamboo
clover which is very light, they are also

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.720
made in mahogany and other exotic woods, particularly
by Brittany, which is a distributor of wood

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.170
needles. Those have really elaborate carved
ends and they are very pretty, but they are

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.360
fragile. Another thing to consider is that
metal needles are slipperier so they can knit

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.700
faster which is one benefit to that. When
choosing a needle size, you want to keep in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.150
mind the weight of the yarn and the recommended
needle size in the pattern. When choosing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.109
a material you want to try different kinds
and see what works best for you.
