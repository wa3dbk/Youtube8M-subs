00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.650
f_b_i_ director robert molly more of
robert muller economics

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.549
for the first time in congressional
testimony yesterday that the f_b_i_ has

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.490
in fact used aerial drones for
surveillance purposes within the u_s_

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.630
this revelation came in the middle of
more efforts from the obon

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.539
administration to justify the a
surveillance programs that have been

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.250
although not surprising to many have
been made public through the releases

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.230
made by edward snowden over the last
uh... uh

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.980
near feedings period of time

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.630
now the government did previously admit
to using drones on the u_s_-mexico

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.400
border and in isolated instances

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.760
and robert molars admission is the first
time that the f_b_i_ has publicly

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.550
acknowledged using the drums
domestically and this is some say that

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.800
this may have been been done

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.130
preamps

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.920
edward snowden from raviv releasing more
documents that actually publicized

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.820
details about government drone usage in
surveillance programs the kind of

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.629
out ahead of it in a sense

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.490
that's certainly possible

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.830
how the questioning was uh... pretty
straightforward chuck grassley a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.520
republican senator said

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.150
does the f_b_i_ alone

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.220
are currently using drones and if so for
what purpose molar replied yes and for

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.320
surveillance and he went on to add
drones are very seldom used

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.550
and generally used in a particular
incident when you need the capability

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.320
he uh... didn't say anything about what
those incidents are he he kind of

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.800
downplayed the significance of this

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.600
saying it's really not a big deal that
was an interesting exchanged with

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.410
democratic senator from california
dianne feinstein asked

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.230
or what privacy protections for use

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.840
in deploying drones and storing the
images that the drums collect

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.830
and uh... f_b_i_ director molar said
their use is narrowly focused on

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.600
specific incidents it's a very seldom
used and generally used in a particular

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.729
incident we need the capability

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.580
he said he doesn't even know what
happens to the images that the drugs

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.090
take are they stored

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.400
by date deleted

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.249
among our w reviews then that you you
well

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:10.700
it's possible that he deliberately is
not told right and we know that that

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.279
happens with the president said that the
president and say he doesn't know

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:17.939
sometimes he's deliberately not told
buttttt it would be weird that nobody

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.769
knows what happens to the images taken
with the drowns again we kind of knew

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.029
this was going on the issue

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.489
or the surprise here isn't there use it
seems to be this broader lack of a

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.650
specific policy that guides their usage
that is articulated notes on what do you

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.969
think

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.239
well how do you think it's important to
remember that a lot of these

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.299
technologies are pretty new and as there
are new telecommunications technologies

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.809
that people use um... you know the
intelligence of gathering changes as

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:50.969
well and that you know obviously the the
fact that after nine eleven we passed

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.999
the patriot act and we had a number of
years were no one question anything

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:58.519
related to this for fear of being
branded a traitor sure um... money right

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.029
now we're finally having the discussion
about what's reasonable what isn't given

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:06.239
the current level of threat lewis did we
know that that uh... american public

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.249
doesn't have a rights to know everything
that is being done

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.619
by the intelligence community but that
being said

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:18.809
do you believe that there is a right to
know what is the policy on drone usage

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:23.099
we don't need to know every time you've
used rollins we don't need to know every

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.999
aspect of who has been surveilled by
drones

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.799
button give us a sense of what is the
policy

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.669
or is even that in your mind
legitimately classified

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.499
you know we should definitely know the
policy but we also know that the

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:37.409
government is doing everything possible

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.509
to ensure that those policies have very
loose language and are very vague

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.139
deliberately set of early and they're
going to do everything they can to make

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.529
sure that they can continue to use
transfer surveillance i don't know for a

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:50.749
lever have something that is uh...

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.499
you know as as articulate and detailed

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.269
and concise as we want live with regard
to legislation on this there's no

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.689
question you will never satisfied
everyone with whatever you revealed that

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.079
the question is right now we don't have
much at all and saying it's very narrow

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.269
usage in specific instances

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.329
full stop

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.809
and doesn't really satisfy a lot of
people
