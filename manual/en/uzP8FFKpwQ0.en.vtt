00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
I'm in Tromsø in Norway,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.940
That is the Tromsø bridge,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.240
and the beautiful Arctic Church there.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.880
Now, if you've been following my videos from here for the last couple of days,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.880
you might have noticed something a bit weird

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.440
every time I'm under artificial light.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.440
And let's be honest: That's most of the time.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.320
Because, while it does get light in the middle of the day here,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.360
we're in the Arctic Circle,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.020
it's winter.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.020
The sun doesn't get above the horizon.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000
Mind you, when it does get light, this place is beautiful.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640
Anyway, you might have seen a bit of a weird effect,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.680
if I take a slow motion video of that streetlamp, and the ground under it,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.580
you'll see what I mean.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.020
There's this kind of weird strobing, rolling effect going on.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.360
And the reason for that,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.840
is something you might not know,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.060
the difference between the European and American power grids.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540
See, the European power grid runs at 50 hertz,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.820
50 cycles a second.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.100
That means the alternating current in the wires

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.580
switches direction,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.740
a hundred times a second, 50 cycles

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.460
back and forth, back and forth

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.160
And that means all these lights, that you can see,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.420
pretty much, dim imperceptibly

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.940
a hundred times a second.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.920
Not enough that you can see it with the naked eye,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.640
but the camera will pick it up.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
Now, okay, that's not a major problem

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.080
if your camera runs at the same rate as the lights

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.600
The lights run at 50 hertz,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
British television runs at 50 hertz.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.620
But unfortunately, I'm using an iPhone,

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.360
which is designed in the U.S.,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.900
for the American power grid.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840
The American power grid chose to run at 60 hertz,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.400
60 cycles a second,

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.780
so American TV runs at 60,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.360
or 30 frames a second.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.020
So, the camera is recording at 30 frames a second,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.640
the light is pulsing at 50 hertz,

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.060
those two are out of sync,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.700
and so sometimes you get light, and sometimes you get dark.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.480
But, why the rolling effect?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.160
Well for that,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.260
we have to understand the rolling shutter in a camera.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.460
Or in any modern camera.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.600
Old film cameras don't do this,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.680
obviously, they just expose a shot

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.280
every time a frame goes by.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.940
But, no-no, not this.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.940
THIS camera, and all modern cameras

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.540
run, a line at a time, scrolling down the screen.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.100
Which means it can take a fraction of a second difference

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.720
for it to go from the top of the frame, to the bottom

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.420
And the result is this rolling effect.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.960
Some of those lines are recorded when the light is fully on,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.060
and some of those lines are recorded when the light is dim.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.160
And that's the reason.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.020
That's the reason you have this kind of weird, artificial,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.680
rolling light problem,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.260
when you're filming with an American device in Europe.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.340
'Course the easy way to fix it,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.040
would be for Apple just to have a 25 frames a second option,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.700
but that would be far, far too difficult for them...

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.180
And THAT is something you might not have known.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.320
