ALAN MARK LIGHTNER: Hi. I'm Alan Lightner
with Expert Village. We're talking about playing

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.670
steelpans and fitting into various musical
situations, playing with different types of

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:17.789
ensembles. Right now, I'd like to talk about
more about leading an ensemble and playing

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.490
solo on the steelpans which you--one thing
that you want to be aware of is the melody

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.819
that you will be playing and choosing a melody
and learning that melody that works well on

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:38.350
your particular instrument, on the steelpans.
Remember that your instrument is a drum. So

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.860
you're going to be tapping these melodies
out. You can roll, obviously you can roll,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:53.730
we'll talk about that in technique, but your
instrument is a drum and so you're going to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.070
have that kind of attack as opposed to let's
say, a violin, where you know the attack is

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.970
going to not be as sharp here. Here, you're
almost always going to have a sharp attack

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.190
on your melody. So when you're choosing melodies,
let's say, you're trying to choose a pretty

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:22.510
melody to play, you do have to be aware that
you actually can play pretty, but you are

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.210
going to have an attack. It's going to be
different than if a violin played that or

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.750
even a flute where it's more legato. You've
got specific attacks here. Even when you play

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:47.450
rolls, you've got attacks.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.420
You want to choose you melody accordingly.
Remember, that if you let me--while you're

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.430
listening to the melody and choosing when
I like to play this song, would that song

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.480
work on a drum? Is that going to have the
impression that you want to bring about playing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.479
it with attacks as opposed to your voice which
you may be able to sing between different

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:15.611
notes and glide smoothly. This one, you've
got ring between notes but there is that attack

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:21.480
that you got to be aware of, and the best
steeldrummers that you hear always choose

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.230
the melodies that sing nicely on the drum
and are played--that sound great when they're

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.810
played with an attack. So you have to be aware
of that.
