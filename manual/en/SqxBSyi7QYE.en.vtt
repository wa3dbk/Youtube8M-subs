00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:05.740
Now that we have our cream cheese and sugar
incorporated cream cheese is nice and smooth

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.460
it's time to add our wet ingredients. First
what I'm going to add our the eggs 3 pounds

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:23.490
of cream cheese, 1 cup of sugar, 5 eggs. So
we will crack these open when you mix your

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.500
cheesecake with a mixture it's best to add
the eggs one at a time, when your doing it

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.589
by hand you can add them all because your
mixing nice and slow though. The reason for

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:38.690
adding the eggs one at a time with a mixture
if you add everything to fast it will fluff

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:49.830
up and it will be almost like a moose. Okay
4 eggs now we'll mix these up again by hand

00:00:49.830 --> 00:01:00.729
and then we'll whip it later. I just like
getting into the food okay again it's very

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.630
important that your cream cheese is room temperature
when your doing this other wise it will be

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.860
impossible to get the lumps out. Okay so that's
mixed fairly well, we'll move on with the

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:23.210
whip after we add our cream and we'll be adding
1 cup of heavy whipping cream, let me show

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:38.620
you this is a 2 cup cup, I was wrong this
is one cup it looks really big this morning

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.770
for some reason, so I'm going to add that.
And we're going to add 2 tablespoons of vanilla

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:56.060
like I said you can eyeball it but in this
case this is exactly 2 tablespoons. Okay now

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.840
we'll whip start off slow if you get in there
just whip crazy you'll have heavy whipping

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.600
cream going all over the place, start in the
middle just kind of work it around, and then

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.090
work your way around the edges turn the bowl
if you like. That's what I like to do it helps

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.200
me get everything off the sides, off the bottom
once you see that all the liquid mixed in

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.670
the cream cheese and you can give it a little
more power, turn it on to second gear if you

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.790
would.
