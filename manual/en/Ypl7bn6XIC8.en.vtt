My name is Roberto Peralta.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.230
I first joined with the organization

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.260
about a year ago and right now I'm

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.380
part of the board as the president of Heurto
de la Familia.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.879
I started the organization in 1999 because I

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.800
saw a real need for you Latino immigrant families to have access to more nutritious food.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.690
 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.300
My family now we have two years

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.090
growing our own vegetables. We have a
daughter that is four-years-old,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.890
she knows how to plant  -- she 
really likes it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.000
and loves broccoli - that is kinda weird,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.990
but the other things that are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.770
really really important, and it's not only
for my family, for all our families

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.120
is that we are not going to
the supermarket

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.229
to get our food.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.440
We have enough forth with these plots 
to feed our families.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.530
The Presbyterian Hunger Program 
has been really crucial

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.500
in supporting our organization in a variety of ways.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.290
Community is strengthened when children,
parents, and elders

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.650
garden together. Your donations to One
Great Hour of Sharing

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.210
allow us to work in more communities
addressing the causes of hunger

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.290
and growing a brighter future. Thank you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990
for your support to One Great Hour of Sharing.
