00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.666
America on a crowded map!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.428
We have some coast!

00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:01.478
Good enough

00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:03.448
Tiles are cheap-cheap-cheap

00:00:03.448 --> 00:00:06.248
I got a pair of 'em

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:07.588
Hiawatha is greeting me.

00:00:07.588 --> 00:00:08.828
Hi back.

00:00:08.828 --> 00:00:11.258
Of course I do, it's Tradition

00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:12.668
Do I dare?

00:00:12.668 --> 00:00:13.668
I did!

00:00:13.668 --> 00:00:14.808
Now for Bob the Builder

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:18.387
The marble is accessible next turn

00:00:18.387 --> 00:00:20.837
Ethiopia has joined the game

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:23.117
I've gone for a Mausoleum!

00:00:23.117 --> 00:00:26.148
I will also claim some of the remaining land

00:00:26.148 --> 00:00:28.408
New York gets a majestic view of the mountains

00:00:28.408 --> 00:00:29.408
Hey!

00:00:29.408 --> 00:00:30.418
Cool hat

00:00:30.418 --> 00:00:31.828
Begin the trade

00:00:31.828 --> 00:00:35.118
I should really make a decision on what victory
to try

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.008
Protect for all victories

00:00:37.008 --> 00:00:39.498
Make that protection more powerful

00:00:39.498 --> 00:00:41.298
Katniss eat your heart out

00:00:41.298 --> 00:00:42.798
Nothing wrong with a Golden Age

00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:45.868
The borders are all expanding and I need more
culture

00:00:45.868 --> 00:00:50.118
Meritocracy: boost happiness and finish the
tree.

00:00:50.118 --> 00:00:51.598
The only choice

00:00:51.598 --> 00:00:53.468
Go fish for New York

00:00:53.468 --> 00:00:54.998
They'll look at marketing

00:00:54.998 --> 00:00:57.498
I can upgrade to better composure

00:00:57.498 --> 00:01:00.268
There is talk of academic gatherings

00:01:00.268 --> 00:01:04.058
Machu Picchu... surely I'm the only one with
this idea

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:06.888
I'll even boost the production towards it!

00:01:06.888 --> 00:01:09.408
Kamahameha picked-up Machu Piccu.

00:01:09.408 --> 00:01:11.277
I get 124 gold though.

00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:13.787
Donate it to the alumni association!

00:01:13.787 --> 00:01:16.048
Grand River lives up to it's name!

00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:17.438
More trade!

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:20.408
Star gazing is gratis (that's French, kids)

00:01:20.408 --> 00:01:23.147
I feel like I should attack people soon

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:24.817
I will be rational about it

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:25.817
Wait a minute...man

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:28.277
Two minute... men

00:01:28.277 --> 00:01:30.628
Manufacture minuteman

00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:32.287
He's about to lose his composure

00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:34.737
Ya I started it

00:01:34.737 --> 00:01:36.018
Pew pew pew

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:38.588
I just really want to destroy his stuff a
bit

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:40.917
The calm before the storm

00:01:40.917 --> 00:01:43.037
Pillage here, pillage there

00:01:43.037 --> 00:01:46.707
I know it's cruel but everyone is doing better
than me and I am angry

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:49.037
I am the underdog!

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:50.268
Pillage the village

00:01:50.268 --> 00:01:51.777
Ya fine

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:55.237
Retreat to our lands, watching theirs burn

00:01:55.237 --> 00:01:56.967
Heal up and upgrade,

00:01:56.967 --> 00:01:59.118
Dude I just smashed your things for no reason

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.438
Alright then, free opera tickets

00:02:02.438 --> 00:02:05.857
Maybe a little research help to get us closer
to science

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:10.568
I don't want to attack Polynesia but these
two are fair game

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:12.888
Peace treaty expired?

00:02:12.888 --> 00:02:14.958
You re-build it, I rebreak it

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.698
I would love to have about triple the firepower
right now

00:02:17.698 --> 00:02:21.718
A Great General could borrow up some of this
nice smokey land

00:02:21.718 --> 00:02:23.468
Have your worker back!

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:25.208
Customize the housing

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:26.948
Do I spot a Great General?

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:30.048
I think I just might want to do that

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:31.518
Hello Everybody

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:33.548
We need time to regroup

00:02:33.548 --> 00:02:38.428
There is talk of never fixing the citadel's
surroundings, for intimidation factor

00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:40.288
The Queen is like REALLY GUYS

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:43.718
Here is some more scary violence

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:45.108
So much battle

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:47.438
That worker is hiding in the depths

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:51.058
I will fix that pillaged citadel SO QUICKLY

00:02:51.058 --> 00:02:53.138
There are no winners in war

00:02:53.138 --> 00:02:54.428
PEW PEW PEW

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:56.808
Guard the refurbished citadel

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:57.808
FINE

00:02:57.808 --> 00:02:58.808
I want more land

00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:01.818
I'm going to make Iroquois host to confuse
them

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:03.478
Apparently I'm at war with Babylon

00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:04.588
Hmmm...

00:03:04.588 --> 00:03:06.168
I don't recall this

00:03:06.168 --> 00:03:09.898
Snuck into a deal... maybe I should read the
fine print next time

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:11.578
Oh now I'm actually in trouble

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:14.698
Maybe Polynesia won't attack

00:03:14.698 --> 00:03:16.328
Maybe they will

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:20.638
Well my cash-flow is negative and I have no
clue how to work this dynamite yet

00:03:20.638 --> 00:03:23.978
I foresee more violence on both fronts

00:03:23.978 --> 00:03:25.888
Finish a second tree!

00:03:25.888 --> 00:03:27.618
New York's last stand

00:03:27.618 --> 00:03:28.998
MORE CITADELS

00:03:28.998 --> 00:03:30.158
New York is in trouble

00:03:30.158 --> 00:03:31.438
OY.

00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:33.248
All men to Washington!

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:36.348
We need to check ourselves before we wreck
ourselves

00:03:36.348 --> 00:03:38.228
The smoke moves closer to home

00:03:38.228 --> 00:03:39.848
But everyone loves America!

00:03:39.848 --> 00:03:40.848
Come on!

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:46.718
We have an amazing something I'm sure if you
just try to understand us! *singing*

00:03:46.718 --> 00:03:48.558
Why all the violence!

00:03:48.558 --> 00:03:50.308
My Gatling Gone needs more moves

00:03:50.308 --> 00:03:54.378
I could afford new units if my Gatling Gun
could make way for them

00:03:54.378 --> 00:03:56.728
A sign from above, we will survive!

00:03:56.728 --> 00:04:02.158
Or it was just due to be produced at that
turn and we are still in trouble

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:03.307
Goodbye cruel world
