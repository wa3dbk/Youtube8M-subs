00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.110
The universe is a very dynamic place. Once
thought to be static and unchanging, the cosmos

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.180
roils with activity.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.730
Clusters of galaxies spin and twirl in a dance
of unprecedented scale, and all of it occurring

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.340
in an ever expanding ballroom.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:49.160
But how do we know this? How do we know these
galaxies are interacting in such a way?

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.540
We know the stars and galaxies are moving
because we can see their light compress and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.060
expand as they move through the heavens. A
star or galaxy moving towards us has a spectrum

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.220
that is shifted to the blue as compared with
a stationary spectrum, and red shifted if

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.220
the object is moving away.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.620
There are three ways light from celestial
objects can be shifted and the amount is usually

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:19.600
denoted by a dimensionless number, z:

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.270
The first way is known as Doppler shifts and
is due to the proper motions of the stars

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.229
and galaxies relative to each other, for example,
the Andromeda Galaxy has a spectrum that is

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.039
blue shifted because it is heading straight
towards our galaxy. Doppler shifts are usually

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.219
small with a value of z less than one.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.180
The second way light can be shifted is called
a gravitational shift, and it us usually caused

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.149
by light leaving a luminous body that is near
an object lith a large mass, such as a black

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.600
hole or neutron star.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.750
The third way is the most interesting, cosmological
redshift, and it is caused by the expanding

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.940
universe. Photons leaving a distant galaxy
are stretched by expanding space-time - always

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:19.670
towards the red - and the amount of shift
is directly related to its distance from us.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.290
Astronomers know which of these three is in
effect by the object being observed. A moving

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.530
nearby star or galaxy will exhibit a shift
due to the Doppler effect. A star or other

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.820
luminous object near something with lots of
mass will have its spectrum shifted due to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.940
gravity, while very distant galaxies will
always have a redshift due to universal expansion.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:50.700
So how can there be measured redshifts greater
than the speed of light? It turns out that

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.890
an object moving at the speed of light would
have a measured redshift of about 1.4 and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.450
would lie 4200 million parsecs away. Two galaxies,
moving relative to each other, are bound by

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.150
the laws of relativity, so 1.4 would be about
the largest doppler redshift that can be recorded

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:19.640
and the photons left that star or galaxy 4.6
billion years after the Big Bang.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:26.220
Any galaxy moving away from us with a z greater
than 1.4 is moving away from us at faster

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.810
than the speed of light. Paradoxically, the
Hubble Space Telescope routinely measures

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:38.870
galaxies with cosmological redshifts of 8
or more. How is this possible?

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.700
While the laws of relativity DO limit the
speed of two or more galaxies moving in relation

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.300
to one another, the expansion of spacetime
is NOT bound by this limit.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.410
Relativity places no limits on the speed with
which creation can expand. The farther a galaxy

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.450
is from us, the faster it is travelling. The
most distant galaxies measured so far are

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.050
around z=8, the light left those galaxies
when the universe was only 600 million years

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.660
old.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.789
So how can we possibly see the light from
these galaxies if they are traveling so fast?

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.720
The answer is that the motion of a galaxy
NOW has no effect whatsoever on the light

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.820
it emitted billions of years ago. The photon
that is travelling towards us has no knowledge

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.210
of what the galaxy does after it leaves, it
is affected only by the increasing amount

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.130
of spacetime as it travels.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.570
At the moment photons are emitted from very
distant galaxies, they are not traveling faster

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.010
than light. But as the galaxy continues to
recede, and it has picked up speed until its

00:04:49.010 --> 00:05:00.450
redshift was greater than 1.4, any photons
would not be able to outrun the galaxy. We

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.831
would observe the galaxy freeze, then slowly
fade away.

00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:08.310
Our current value of the Hubble constant says
that for every megaparsec of distance between

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:14.040
two galaxies, the apparent speed at which
the two of them move apart increases by 71

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:21.310
km/sec. The implications for this are rather
bleak. Because of universal acceleration,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.830
any galaxies that are currently moving from
us at faster than light, will ALWAYS be doing

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:37.140
so. Once a galaxy says its last goodbye, we
will never hear from it again.
