[intro]Hi, I'm Brad, I'm the Chief Hemp Officer
at Hippie Butter and welcome to Cooking with

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.070
Hemp Seeds. Today I'm making the Ultimate
Hemp Seed Butter Smoothie. I'm using Cacao

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:27.359
Hemp Seed Butter, raw organic hemp seed butter,
almond milk and some frozen bananas. How I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.340
start this out is, I'm using a Magic Bullet,
we got three glasses for the 3 different Ultimate

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:41.140
Hemp Butter Smoothies. I put four ice cubes
in each one. I'm going to add a cup of almond

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.140
milk, you can always use hemp milk, silk or
whatever your favorite alternative is. Silk

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.380
Vanilla. That would work really well. That's
a good idea. Blueberries, Strawberries, half

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.380
a banana. Hemp Seed Protein Powder is 50%
protein and it's 98% digestable. So for every

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.810
scoop you put in you're getting a lot of protein.
This is better than six hour energy drink.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:17.810
Now the first Ultimate Hemp Butter Smoothie
I'm making is going to have two tablespoons

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.230
of Cacao Hemp Seed Butter. The second Ultimate
Hemp Butter Smoothie I'm making is going to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.850
be one tablespoon Cacao Hemp Seed Butter and
one tablespoon raw organic Hippie Hemp Seed

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:42.510
Butter and the third Ultimate Hemp Butter
Smoothie is going to get two tablespoons raw

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.960
organic Hippie Hemp Seed Butter. Now I'm going
to put the lid on the Magic Bullet and blend

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.960
this up well. [Blending] I just made three
Ultimate Hemp Seed Butter Smoothies, three

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.850
different flavors, in only a few minutes.
[music]

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:29.249
So what do you think? It's delicious! It's
different! It's not the same old smoothie

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:36.249
flavor taste. It has texture in it and its
good. Yeah, it's not chunky or anything but

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:43.749
it's thick. It's not gritty! It's got a banana
flavor, I can taste the Cacao, I can taste

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:51.719
raw walnuts. Is that what it is Walnuts? No,
Its the hemp seed butter. OK, it has the taste

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.620
of walnuts and sunflower seeds. And if I wanted
mine sweeter, I could even add a little honey

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.150
to it.
