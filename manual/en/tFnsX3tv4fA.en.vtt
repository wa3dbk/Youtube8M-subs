00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.942
 

00:00:00.942 --> 00:00:03.150
JONATHAN MCDONALD: Upgrading
the Fox Mustang interior

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.980
is typically at the top
of most people's list.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.860
Here with me today is
Dean from TMI Products

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.895
to tell us one of the
ways we can do just that.

00:00:10.895 --> 00:00:13.270
DEAN SATTERFIELD: Jonathan,
thank you for having us here.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:14.790
We're very excited
to be with you.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.248
JONATHAN MCDONALD:
Great deal, man.

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:17.790
Dean, tell me a
little bit about TMI.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.081
DEAN SATTERFIELD: Well, TMI
Products was found in 1992.

00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.250
It stands for Tuccinardi
Manufacturing Incorporated,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.000
which is named after
the four brothers who

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.110
founded the company, AND mostly
started in Volkswagen interiors

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.120
and then moved into
Mustangs back in about 1994.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.750
About six, seven years ago, we
got into the Fox body Mustang

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.144
and late model
Mustang interiors.

00:00:34.144 --> 00:00:36.060
JONATHAN MCDONALD: That's
pretty cool-- didn't

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.920
know that about TMI.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.960
I always thought it was
too much information.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.720
DEAN SATTERFIELD: Not exactly,
sometimes people think that.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.630
But we try to give as much
information as possible

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.710
about great interiors.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.855
JONATHAN MCDONALD: Well, now
how long have you been with TMI

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:47.400
and what exactly
do you do there?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.290
DEAN SATTERFIELD: Well,
I'm the general manager.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.965
I started there about nine
years ago and just enjoying it.

00:00:50.965 --> 00:00:53.090
But I've always been in
the automotive aftermarket,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.830
including several years in the
Mustang part of it as well.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.746
JONATHAN MCDONALD: On
to the star of the show,

00:00:57.746 --> 00:01:00.770
the '03-'04 Cobra style
upholstery and foam for Fox

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.840
Mustangs.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.050
Dean, other than
the obvious looks,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.634
what makes it so much better
than the stock sports seats.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.800
DEAN SATTERFIELD: Well,
several things-- number one,

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.300
it's got about
three to four more

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.220
inches of bolstering
than normal.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.070
This is based on the SVO
Ford from '84 to '86.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.560
Ford put a much more aggressive
bolstered seat in them.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.310
We adapted that to the
regular Fox body GTs

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.852
and LX 5.0 type of cars.

00:01:21.852 --> 00:01:23.810
And so you've got extra,
extra bolstering here.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.490
Also the density and the
resilience and cushioning

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.320
of this seat foam
is superior to what

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.630
is originally offered with it.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.567
It's really it's a foundation
of an excellent seating position

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.900
as well as the strength to
hold you in place when you're

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.192
doing some performance corning.

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:39.483
JONATHAN MCDONALD: Well, that
sounds pretty cool, Dean.

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:40.610
How about the upholstery?

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:41.290
DEAN SATTERFIELD:
Well, the great thing

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.300
about the upholstery is that
we use all the original vinyls

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.950
on the outside seat trim
and side bands as well.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.580
But we also have the
uni-suede insert,

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.010
which is much more comfortable
in the summer and the winter.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.343
It's just like sitting on cloth.

00:01:52.343 --> 00:01:54.160
Because it doesn't
have that temperature

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.720
transfer like you get typically
on a vinyl or even a leather

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.480
product.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.706
And then we also match it out
with the HVO style French seam

00:02:01.706 --> 00:02:03.080
stitching on the
outside, instead

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.089
of the typical GT style
has a welt on there.

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:07.130
So it looks a little more
upscale, a more modern,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.490
a lot more comfortable as well.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.240
The other major thing is that we
use all the same original Ford

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.330
factory attachment methods,
including these plastic clips

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.330
that snip right on the outside
edge and all the same listing

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.349
loop panels on the inside
to attach it to the foam

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.640
and to the seat frame properly.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.870
So it has a factory finish.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.720
So it's no different
than if you just

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.555
did a regular GT installation
as opposed to doing this.

00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.680
And then you get the
additional bolstering and much

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.610
more performance and
comfort out of the product.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.240
JONATHAN MCDONALD: Wow, it's
like getting a whole brand new

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.452
'03-'04 Cobra seat while keeping
your stock seat frame and use

00:02:37.452 --> 00:02:38.660
an OE attachment [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.220
DEAN SATTERFIELD: Exactly.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.429
It's the best of both worlds.

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:42.386
JONATHAN MCDONALD: Well,
Dean, that is awesome.

00:02:42.386 --> 00:02:44.950
Thank you so much for coming
out and showing these off to us.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.730
DEAN SATTERFIELD:
It's my pleasure.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.450
We're really excited
about this Fox Cobra

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.741
option for Mustang enthusiasts.

00:02:48.741 --> 00:02:50.830
I'm glad you guys are
bringing them to market.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.420
JONATHAN MCDONALD: We offer
this upholstery with front foam

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.395
and front and rear
seat covers for '84

00:02:56.395 --> 00:03:00.782
to '93 Mustang coup,
hatchback, and convertible.
