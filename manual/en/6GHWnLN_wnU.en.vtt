Are you trying to stay out of the sun but
love the healthy glow that you get from it?

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.570
My name is Keeley Selvage from "Keeley's Skin
Solutions" and I'm going to show you how to

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.719
apply self tanners. The first thing that you
want to do is on the skin make sure that you

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.840
are good and exfoliated. By that I mean that
you get all the dead skin off that you can.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.820
Now you can do this with a wash rag and just
make sure that you rub it really well. You

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.250
can do it with a scrub for the skin and just
gently rub the skin. You can do it with a

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.730
loofah or even maybe an exfoliating cream
and that will work too. You want to make sure

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.920
that you focus on really exfoliating the dryer
thicker areas of the skin. Those areas are

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.129
going to absorb that self tanner really well
so you need to be careful and exfoliate those

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:05.890
extra. Then what you want to do is make sure
that on the areas and elbows, the knees, that

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.760
these areas have some lotion on them just
regular body lotion and that way that is going

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.900
to keep them also from absorbing too much
of that tint from the self tanner. You can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.980
go ahead and apply your cream while you are
using gloves because your hands will really

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:32.900
soak up that tint as well and just rub it
in really good and evenly and just do that

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.690
all over the body. Get someone to help you
do your back, that's going to work the best.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:49.820
Feel free to go over those elbows and then
when you are done you can quickly take some

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.280
of that self tanner and you can put it on
the top of your hands and then wash the palms

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.100
of your hands and that way you don't have
orange palms. My name is Keeley Selvage of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.450
"Keeley's Skin Solutions" and that is how
you apply self tanner.
