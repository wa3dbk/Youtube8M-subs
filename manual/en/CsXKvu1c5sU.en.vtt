00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:06.500
Welcome to the Church. I'm Monica Dennington.
This is the place that God is calling you

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.890
in these end-times in order to receive the
word of the Lord that is going to clean the

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.160
bride of Christ and make her ready for her
soon coming king.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.329
Jesus Christ tells us that anyone who wants
to do God's will is his mother, brother and

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:27.470
sister (Matthew 12:50). And he also told us
that when he established his Church, that

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.079
the gates of hell would not stand against
it (Matthew 16:18). The bible tells us that

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.500
the way we join the Church — or God's family —
is that we place our trust in Jesus Christ.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.520
Jesus Christ died on the cross in order to
pay for our sins that we might be reconciled

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.030
to God (John 3:16-17) — that we might be adopted
as sons and daughters of God (Gal 4:5 NLT)

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.620
And we also have a promise that if we
place our trust in Jesus Christ, not only

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.250
will we be saved from sin (Romans 10:9), but
that we will have an eternal live with God

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.750
as the bride of Jesus Christ (John 17:3).

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.850
That, my friends, is the Church — all of those
people who are born of God's Spirit. Jesus

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.659
tells us about this new birth, in John 3.
He says , "I tell you the truth, no one can

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.539
enter the kingdom of God unless he's born
of water and the spirit. Flesh gives birth

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:17.439
to flesh, but the spirit gives birth to spirit."
(John 3:5b-6)

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.850
This also answers the question, where is the
Church?

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.469
Jesus said, "The wind blows wherever it pleases,
you hear its sound, but you cannot tell where

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.909
it comes from or where its going, so it is
with everyone who is born of the spirit." (John 3:8)

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.459
So the Church is the people of
God. It is the city of God. It is the bride

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.759
of Jesus Christ (Revelation 21:2). And you
cannot place your finger on where the kingdom

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.600
of God is. As Jesus said, "The kingdom of
God does not come with your careful observation,

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.039
because the kingdom of God is in your hearts."
(Luke 17:20b-21)

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.490
The reason why we're here, ladies and gentlemen,
is that God has sent us (John 3:34) in order

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.329
to bring to you the pure spiritual water that
will clean you up as the bride of Christ
(Ephesians 5:25-27),

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.959
as is prophesied in the scriptures (Revelation 19:7-8a). And it tells us in the book of Revelation — in this prophetic book that tells us about

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.779
this end-times generation

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:11.000
in which we are living right now — before the
King, Jesus Christ returns in the clouds, there

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.880
will be a voice from heaven that says, "Come
out of Babylon, my people." God has sent

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.300
us here to you today to proclaim in your hearing
that the voice has spoken, that God is calling

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.410
you out of Babylon.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.910
As it says, "Come out of her, my people,
so that you will not share in her sins

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.910
so that you will not receive any of her plagues;
for her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.890
Give back to her as she has given; pay her back double for

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.990
what she has done. Mix her a double portion
from her own cup. Give her as much torture

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.090
and grief as the glory and luxury she gave
herself. In her heart she boasts, 'I sit

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.600
as queen. I am not a widow; I will never mourn.'
Therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her:

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.250
death, mourning and famine. She will
be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.090
God who judges her." (Revelation 18:4-8)

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.170
Now we know from the scriptures that the Church
that Jesus Christ established was and is unified (Acts 2:44 AMP).

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.820
There are no denominations,
there are no divisions within the body of

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.540
Christ in the kingdom of God (1 Corinthians
1:10). And we know also that the thing that

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.180
unified the Church after the resurrection
of Jesus Christ was the fact that they all

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.370
shared in one spirit (1 Corinthians 12:13),
and they all devoted themselves to one teaching (John 8:31).

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.360
And specifically, that is the
teaching of Jesus Christ and the apostles (Acts 2:42).

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.530
Now, as God is calling you out of Babylon in
these end-times, he has provided you with this place.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.760
This is where God has called you
to come to get the pure unadulterated word of God.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.760
The simple teachings of Jesus Christ and the apostles. Unadulterated by the politics of power,

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.720
100% pulpit free, straight from
the pages of scripture. This is the pure spiritual

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.569
water that Jesus will use to clean you up
as his bride, that you may be a bride without spot of wrinkle,

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.200
for he is coming soon (Ephesians
5:25b-27). As he says in Revelation 22:12,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.160
"Behold, I am coming soon, my reward is
with me, and I will give to everyone according

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:19.320
to what they have done. I am the Alpha and
the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.410
and the End." ( Revelation 22:12-13)

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.950
So whether you're a layperson, a pastor, a
professor, a politician, a doctor, a lawyer,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.120
a butcher, a baker; whoever you are — if you
are a member of the body of Christ, if you

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.790
are a part of the kingdom of God, if you're
born of the spirit — this is the place that

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.630
God is calling you to get your pure spiritual
teachings straight from the pages of scripture
(1 Corinthians 2:13 NLT),

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.990
without any human words or doctrines added to it, and without

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.740
any of God's holy words taken away from it
(Revelation 22:18-19).

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.060
This is where you are to come to learn to
obey the commandments of Jesus Christ. You

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.080
will learn about the heights and the depths
of Christ love for you (Ephesians 3:18b-19).

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.370
About how to accept God's invitation to the
wedding feast (Revelation 19:7-8). And how

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.700
to be the bride that God has always dreamed
of.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.070
So ready or not people of God, the time has
come to hear the voice that is now crying

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.139
out, "Come out of Babylon!" Now

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.870
is the time for the bride to come away with the king — now is the time for exodus.
