00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.713
Ah, this is probably a bad idea.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.760
I tell you, last time I saw someone banging this hard at door..

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.625
..I was making my special soup.

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.965
You know Boris soup is ready when neighbor calls you at 1 o'clock in the night..

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.240
..and tells you to stop boiling onions.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.520
Okay, here we go!

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.180
Take this you motherf-

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.680
Oh.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.100
Ah, you see, is typical case, as with neighbors.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.180
Always happy to bang on doors, but..

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560
Ooy, run away when they see me!

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.280
Or maybe that was because I still had knife in hand.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.000
But you know, still.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.980
Ooh, feels nice and warm here, like in sauna!

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.000
MORE STEAM, BI****S!

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.460
A Slav is in the house!

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.920
Ah, no wonder they have such a weak sauna.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.740
It's bunch of babies in here.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.960
Yeah, you see! This guy gets it!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.400
What the fuck is this?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.760
Aa, aaa! I see!

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.818
You have some gas problems here!

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.460
Don't worry! I know good guy, Vitali! I give you his number, no problem.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.644
I put his number here for you, don't forget to call, okay?

00:00:56.644 --> 00:00:58.784
But remember, only call past seven.

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:00.764
He works as cabdriver for day.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.260
You see, this is the problem with these secret labs.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.069
They leave all this sh*t laying around..

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.440
..don't fix their gas pipes..

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.161
..no wonder they fucked up.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.600
And you see, some careless asshole left his pet rat in here.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.160
I bet it's the same idiot who left the gas on.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.640
Of course I'm not drunk, why would you think that?

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.580
Of course, mama, I will get you the recipe..

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.380
..hold on..

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.140
Whoooooo!

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.740
Ah yes! I remember having this dream once.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.120
But instead of rats, there were girls.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.600
And instead of bullets I was shooting...

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.040
Noo, it can not be.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.480
It is!

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.320
Oh, shit, now it's a party!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.780
Christmas came early!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.720
Ooh, yes!

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.300
What? This game has zombies too?!

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.760
Man, is like the perfect game!

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.140
Zombies, mutants, bandits..

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.180
What else could I wish for?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.780
Oy sh*t! This is some next level sh*t!

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.460
These guys shoot back, man!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.100
This has to be the only game..

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.360
..where the shadow of the character is scarier than the monsters.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.980
You know who's my favorite enemy?

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.620
These crawler guys!

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.180
'Cause everyone else you have to follow around and they run away.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.340
Nope, these guys just jump at you!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.480
These zombie guys you can pretty much outrun anyway.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.160
And their aim is so bad they have no chance of hitting you.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.480
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.760
Okay, bad example.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.400
Ahaa! My best friend!

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.480
Hah, you don't scare me this time!

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.240
Yippie ki-yay motherf****r.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.100
Take that you piece of sh*t!

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.940
What?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.900
That's it? You're giving up?

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.880
Ah, come on man! I was just playing!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.080
So your close combat ability is party?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.960
Ah, whatever.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.480
I liked your jeans though.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.940
I give you award of best dressed enemy.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.180
*fake audience cheering*

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.740
Ahaa! My favorites again!

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.620
You see, these guys don't fuck around!

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.680
Okay, come on! You've got to throw something else at me!

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.639
If the next enemy that comes at me is another one of those crawlers..

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:11.139
I will be severely disappo-

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.460
HOLY SH*T! What the f**k is that?

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.400
Good move, game! Did not expect that!

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.438
Get the hell out of the way. Some big motherf***er is chasing me!

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.860
Shiit! I'm out of energy!

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.580
Wooh!

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.280
I think I'm safe..

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.340
The zone better watch out!

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.640
Because daddy has gotten an upgrade!

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.560
And stay down!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.720
Need help getting rid of pesky mutants?

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.580
Call Boris!

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.660
That's right!

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.560
Ah, look at the beautiful sunset.

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:51.835
Chernobyl is so pretty at this time of year.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.480
The tanks are out and the.. nuclear reactor is blooming..

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.040
Shut the fuck up! I don't need no narrating!

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.320
Feels a bit hot in here.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.540
Are you guys hot?

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.900
Hey, these things look familiar.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.140
Yes, yes! Of course I remember!

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.996
You are the fuckers because of who I didn't get to sauna!

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.120
Hah! That will show them!

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.040
Nobody messes with Boris!

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.620
Okay friends, looks like the game is over or I just ran out of bandits to shoot.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.962
Either way, thank you for watching my version of..

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.060
S.T.A.L.K.E.R - Shadow of Chernobyl.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.840
Definitely let me know what type of game you would like to see me play next.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.500
Don't forget to like this video if you enjoyed it, and share it if you loved it.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.080
This is Boris.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.820
It is literally 7 o'clock in the morning.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.920
I'll see you next time, friends.
