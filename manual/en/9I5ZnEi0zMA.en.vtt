00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.770
Tara: So we've just been doing our inside
hand to hand Charleston and as you can see

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.840
we can keep doing if forever. Sometimes that
happens, if you forget how to exit which is

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.660
what we're going to show you now, you will
be doing it forever. Jason: I hope you like

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.380
the song. Tara: And my particular rube. So
in order to close the gap, Jason's going to

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.060
tell you what to do. Jason: OK leaders, we've
gone from side by side, we've created distance

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.840
in order to do this move. So now it's up to
us, though the follower because she's just

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.260
following, has no idea what's going on. It's
up to me to know that I now have to close

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:41.510
the gap, boom and then kicking on through.
So let's break that down since I started to,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.909
and didn't tell Tara that I was doing that.
We've just done this, this bit of the inside

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:55.409
hand to hand. When we come back instead of
doing the hitch, kick and land with this,

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:59.980
this considerable distance between us, I'm
going to make up, make up the difference by

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.820
going kick, hitch, kick and come closer to
Tara. I close that gap and then as I come

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.550
around with my hand connection, instead of
being here, which I would be if I were far

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.480
away, I've stepped closer which gives me the
opportunity to then come around and put my

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.840
hand completely around her side, just like
side by side basic. Tara: OK, now who wants

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.060
to keep touching him? Jason: I want to be
touching Tara because she's a wonderful person

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.630
to dance with. OK. So let's see it from this
angle. We've had a lot of space, we've been

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:41.670
doing the inside hand to hand. OK, at this
point here I'm thinking to myself, "I'm going

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.310
back into standard side by side, so I've got
to close the gap". I've done the kick, we

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.920
do the hitch, kick and then I close the gap
as I land. Then coming around kick, hitch,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.590
kick, step, we're right back into that home
position of side by side.
