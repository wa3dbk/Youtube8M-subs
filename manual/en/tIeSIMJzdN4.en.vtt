00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.720
Meet the Tesla K80: Nvidia's most powerful
graphics card yet has an insane 24GB of RAM

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.730
Nvidia’s PC graphics chips may draw all
the attention, but supercomputing chips are

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.430
driving the company’s GPU technology ahead.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.020
The company on Monday announced an updated
Tesla K80 graphics card, which is its fastest

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.380
graphics product to date.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.410
Tesla is used in some of the world’s fastest
supercomputers to solve pressing scientific

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.869
questions.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.010
The K80 is based on technology similar to
that used in GeForce PC graphics cards, but

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.910
with some memory and throughput tweaks.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.010
The graphics card can be used by engineering
companies to simulate visual models, or by

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.440
oil and gas companies for geological research
to find the best drilling sites.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.140
Tesla has also been used in servers to deliver
virtual desktops to remote clients.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.210
The K80 delivers 8.74 teraflops of single-precision
performance compared to 5 teraflops on Nvidia’s

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.420
flagship GeForce GTX 980 desktop graphics
card.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.920
The K80 also has two times the performance
and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.360
K40, which was announced around the same time
last year.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.600
In 2016, Nvidia is promising even faster graphics
products based on Pascal architecture, a new

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.720
on-chip communication technology.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.310
Through a new interconnect called NV-Link.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.270
GPUs will be able to exchange data faster,
which will facilitate better performance.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.340
Nvidia says NV-Link is five times faster than
the PCI-Express 3.0 interconnect, which is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.090
used in most servers and PCs.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.979
Nvidia’s Tesla is one of many server accelerators
available.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.049
Intel sells the Xeon Phi chip, while Advanced
Micro Devices offers FirePro cards for servers

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.259
and workstations.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.409
Software needs to be written specifically
to take advantage of these processors, and

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.799
Nvidia offers its CUDA parallel programming
framework for Tesla.

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:14.749
One knock on GPUs has been the amount of power
they chew up in processing.

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.040
As a result, they have to be used for specific
tasks.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.680
The K80 chip is broken up into two graphics
processors, which share the balance of processing.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.670
Combined, the chip has 4,992 processing cores,
24GB of GDDR5 memory and memory bandwidth

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.370
of 480GBps.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.689
A technology called GPU Boost can kick up
performance for specific applications in bursts

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.059
to deliver better results.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:51.980
Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Quanta and Cray will
use the K80 GPUs in servers.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.840
Servers from HP and Dell will run on Intel’s
Xeon CPUs.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:01.739
Dell’s PowerEdge C4130 is a 1U server that
looks more like an appliance and will be able

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.829
to accommodate up to two K80 cards.

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:11.760
A number of C4130 servers could be used as
cabinets to build a supercomputer, said Jimmy

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.589
Pike, chief architect for Dell’s enterprise
solutions group.
