Hi everyone this is Mark Stoddard from Lava
Cable here in Owasso, Oklahoma.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.460
Today I am going to demonstrate how quick
and easy it is to put together our

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.040
Lava Solder free mini plug and mini ELC cable.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.960
Our new mini plug has upgrades that include
a smaller needle

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.300
that make it easier than ever before to get
a first time working

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.460
cable. I'm gonna demonstrate this making a
short

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.140
Right Angle to straight cable. The first step
is to strip about a half inch of

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.140
outer jacket using the stripping tool provided
on the second setting.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.770
The second step is to take the sleeve and
slide it on

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.390
Step 3:

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.000
is bending the braid over the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.930
end of the sleeve, trimming

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.930
the braid and the inner black layer and the
cable

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.490
Step 4: is inspecting to ensure that the cable
is centered

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.899
and that none of the braid or the inner black
layer

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.999
is shorting against the center conductor

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:57.740
If the braid shorts to the center

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.149
conductor the cable will not work at all
and if the inner black layer shorts to the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.579
center conductor
the cable will barely pass signal

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.720
and will cause your tone to sound very very
dark.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.580
The needle inside the plug is centered so
as long as the cable is centered within

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.040
the sleeve
the needle is going to make contact. Once

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.510
no shorts are verified.
Step 5: is pushing the stem on the sleeve

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.510
Step 6: is bending the cable over for a right
angle plug

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:45.519
or
sliding the cap on for the straight plug

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.519
and then twisting the stem
into the cap

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.939
maintaining downward pressure on the cable
so that the cable doesn't back out inside

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.859
out of the stem
and cause a short Step 7 is to test the first

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:17.500
end
before we put the second end on. We can do

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.120
this using a
continuity tester that you can get at

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.459
Radio Shack or anywhere it doesn't have to
be fancy, just a real simple continuity

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.870
tester
and then we're going to use that we're just

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.079
going to put that on there
fold it on with our hand and touch we have

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.200
no Light
so we know we don't have a short we can put

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.549
the second end on
and that is Step 8: is to put the second end

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.340
on and in this case it is
a straight plug so we are going to go ahead

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.340
we're going to slide our cap on
and repeat the steps that we just did.

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:14.010
With the straight plug it is important that
the braid

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.180
be bent over the end of the sleeve so this
forms a hook

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.180
preventing the cable from pulling out

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.910
and now we have a completed cable. part of
Step 8 is doing a final test on the

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.970
cable
we can do this using a cable tester,

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:03.190
a continuity tester, a multi-meter
or our guitar amp. In this case we're going

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.340
to use a cable tester
we're gonna plug it in and check it to make

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.760
sure the cable is good.
and we have a good working cable

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.260
in a very short amount of time Thanks for
watching everyone this is Mark

from Lava Cable here in Owasso Oklahoma we

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.350
hope you find the video
instructive and that it helps you put together

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.780
our revolutionary Lava Mini
plugs

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.780
and Mini Ultramafic or Mini ELC cable easier,
you have a great rock'in day!
