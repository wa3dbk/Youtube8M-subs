00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.930
You can call it Tetris Attack.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.490
You can jam Pokemon into it and say it belongs
there.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.310
But at the end of the day, if you’re swapping
panels around, horizontally, trying to stop

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.860
them from reaching the top of the screen,
competing with an opponent, and occasionally

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.230
advancing their progress yourself just to
get more ammunition, you know what game you’re

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.230
playing.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
And you can call it Panel de Pon, or Tetris
Whatever, or have a Pikachu on hand, whatever

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.860
you like.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.560
But you’re playing good ol’ Puzzle League.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.980
And it’s taken a long time to call it that
here in the states, but here we are, in an

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.850
alarmingly comfortable version for the DS.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.690
Welcome to Planet Puzzle League.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:03.039
The rules are simple: Three (or more) in a
row, horizontally or vertically.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.030
The more elaborate the cascade of gravity-fueled
reactions, the higher you score.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.470
And, if you’re in a competitive mode against
the computer or a friend, bigger chains result

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.040
in more garbage thrown to your opponent’s
side.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.630
The only way to eliminate said trash is by
completing a reaction adjacent to it, which

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.539
will convert one or more lines of the garbage
into viable, fissionable panels.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.670
You may notice that I’m holding the DS here
at a 90-degree angle; this allows for more

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.450
comfortable display of the panels as well
as easy thumb-access to the R button for calling

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.890
up more rows from the bottom.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.890
Call the DS gimmicky if you will, but certain
things just work better on it than anywhere

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:36.890
else.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.509
Could you imagine trying to play Elite Beat
Agents on the Wii?

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.149
I rest my case.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.289
Adding to the bevy of game modes are several
daily challenges, which offer two-minute time

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.890
trials and graph the results so you can measure
your improvement as the weeks pass.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.840
It’s a cute little trick picked up from
the Brain Age series and implemented in a

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.140
number of Nintendo’s Touch Generations releases.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.770
Also, in addition to the standard move-limited
Puzzle mode, there’s a Mission Mode which

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.090
presents a timed series of tasks, ranging
from “Clear Everything” to “Flatten

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.540
the Stack” to “Make a 10x Chain.”

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.300
While the game itself doesn’t feature too
many bells and whistles - and for that matter,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.540
no Yoshi’s Island or Pokemon branding in
sight - the cleanliness of the UI and no-nonsense

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.640
practicality of the controls give the game
a more professional, grown-up feel.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.689
And while there’s something to be said for
a little showmanship - certainly Tetris DS

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.819
stands as an example of this - when you’re
entranced in a game, trying to analyze contingencies

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.760
of contingencies of contingencies, you’re
never going to notice it anyway.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.270
If anything, you’ll appreciate the nice
techno backbeat as your eyes glaze over.

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.790
That’s how it should be.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:53.681
But if you absolutely need someone else in
your life, and slavish devotion to a puzzle

00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:57.670
game isn’t going to do it for ya... fortunately,
there’s Wi-Fi support for taking on the

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.400
world in a fit of panel-popping pique.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.870
That is, if there’s anyone on the other
end.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.109
I haven’t been able to find an opponent
yet, despite numerous attempts.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.749
I realize that online multiplayer is the wave
of the future... but what if there aren’t

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:10.969
multi players online?

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:13.890
What if you’re the only one at any particular
moment?

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.310
It happens more often than you think.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.310
Oh well.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.239
You can still just phone a friend whose friend
code you’ve obtained, throw down the gauntlet

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:28.220
verbally, and get your panel de on.
