00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.220
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: Glenn Farquhar's artistic expression
and vast range of works capture one's inspiration,

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.990
imagination and appreciation.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.640
His art not only features in glossy magazines
and publications, it graces the walls of key

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.300
places right throughout Australia.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.560
From suburban homes to multimillion dollar
developments and corporate offices.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.149
It's also managed to find its way into the
hands of serious art lovers right around the

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.149
globe.

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.440
Well Glenn's main interest lies in the interior
design industry.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.379
An industry with specific needs and high demands.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.789
His passion, inspiring people to create masterpieces
effortlessly.

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.329
Well Glenn, I'd love to just start off by
having you describe a little about your background.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.130
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Yeah well, the way I started was,
I started renovating homes.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.219
I've got a building background, and um, I
needed things for the wall to help sell the

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.219
properties.

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:58.890
I started creating my own bits and pieces
of art.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.559
And, one thing led to another and next we
had enquiries: 'Where did you get that?'

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.110
'how did you do this?' and um, here I am today.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.400
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: And I believe you started off as
a plumber?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.400
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Yes.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.400
Yes.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
That's where I started.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.700
And most people don't think a plumber is gonna
be an artist, but neither did I. Um, but ah,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.850
this is where I am, and it's worked out fantastic.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.850
I've got a great life.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730
I enjoy what I do.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.610
And ah, a lot of people around the country
and overseas enjoy my works.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.610
So, yeah.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:28.790
What else could I ask for?

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.229
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: When did you first start doing this?

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.960
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Ah, it was when I needed a piece
of art for our own home.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.240
Um, and, just played around, just threw some
paint around here and there, and um, it was

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.240
good.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.450
I wouldn't say it was my best piece by any
means, but, it was a start and um, we just

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:54.810
kept going from there and after I was accepted
by family and friends, I took it to people

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.180
who I thought might be able to use it as a
financial incentive.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.420
To keep it going.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
And it did.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:02.420
It's paid my way.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.400
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: So Glenn, what does your work actually
consist of?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.700
Can you explain a little bit about that cause
apparently you're unstoppable?

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.740
&gt;&gt; GLENN: [chuckles] Um, yeah well, I don't
restrict myself to any styles.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.340
Working with interior designers, it's a wonderful
way to learn because they have so many demands.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.980
And they just ask for all sorts of weird and
wonderful projects.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.510
Some of the things I shake my head and say:
"Who would want that?"

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.570
But, that's not my decision to make.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.050
My decision is to create it in a nice way
so my customers are happy.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.900
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: So where can we see some of your
work?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.620
&gt;&gt; GLENN: My work is basically all over the
country now.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.220
Um, overseas as well.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.220
There's works being sent across overseas,
but all sorts of development projects.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.520
Ah, highrise.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.550
Suburban homes.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.580
Corporate.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.990
It's really all over the country, so, just
look for my name on the bottom of the piece,

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.440
and you'll find me.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.239
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: What can we expect to see across
this whole DVD series, Glenn?

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.530
&gt;&gt; GLENN: What I'd like to show people is
how simple and easy it is to create artwork

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.700
for your home and at the end will look professional,
and not look like it's something that you've

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.270
tried very hard, but just haven't quite worked.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.280
There's secrets to creating artwork and make
it simple to get the effect that you want.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.980
And, it's not hard.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.380
It's just knowing those little secrets which
turn it into a professional work, without

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.480
any complication.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.530
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: So it's like you're going to indulge
us in a few little secrets of yours.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.570
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Yeah.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.040
That's what I'm gonna do for you.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.140
Um, you will be quite amazed at what you can
do with very, very, simple products and materials.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.820
Um, materials that you've got at home already,
a lot of them.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.069
The leftover paints that you've been renovating
your home with.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.460
All that type of thing all get used in the
artworks that I create.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.680
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: So who is gonna benefit from watching
these DVDs?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.230
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Well anybody with a love of art,
and who're a bit frustrated with trying to

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.569
work out how do artists get that finish to
their work.

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.419
Um, people who are looking to renovate their
home and on-sell their home.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.150
Or just someone who's trying to decorate their
home and really don't particularly feel like

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:30.650
going to a gallery and paying 5-6-$700 or
thousands of dollars when you can actually

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.469
create it at home, very simply , very cheaply.

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:38.740
And at the end of the day, when it's there,
people walk in and say: "Where did you get

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.330
that?" and, of course, you gotta tell them
it was you.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.300
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: What is some of the more general
points that you actually want people to take

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.139
away from the DVDS

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.650
&gt;&gt; GLENN: I just like people to take away
from the series that there's always gonna

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.919
be something else there that they can learn.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.180
And, the ongoing series that we will be presenting
will be showing different styles continually.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.580
Lifestyles change all the time.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.719
There'll be styles that I don't even know
that you're gonna be getting in the future

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:08.719
series.

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:09.719
But they will be there.

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.229
So, it's gonna be an ongoing process and you
can just keep on learning.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.310
If you want to end up selling your art as
well, I'm giving you the secrets to do it.

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.029
And people will be amazed at how simple it
really is.

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.850
To create something that's professional that
you see in the gallery and think: 'Gee that

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.750
person must have taken years to get to that
level'.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.090
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: Well I'm feeling very inspired Glenn.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.419
So, how about you show us how it's done.

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.169
&gt;&gt; GLENN: Yeah sure if you wanna have a go.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.360
I can show you how to do it if you don't mind
getting your hands dirty with a bit of paint

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.720
on them and a little bit splashed on your
clothes.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.720
Let's have some fun.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.449
&gt;&gt; WOMAN: Sounds like my kind of art.

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:44.990
[chuckles]
