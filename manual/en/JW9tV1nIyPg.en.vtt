00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:35.541

if it's the same dance.

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:37.649
How does your Lambarena go?

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.887
- It goes like this.

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:40.233

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.638
- Wow.

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:44.388
(violin playing)

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:03.007
(xylophone playing)

00:01:09.872 --> 00:01:12.789

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:58.416

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:03.110
- And you know what? Your Lambarena is

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.944
exactly the same as my Lambarena.

00:02:05.944 --> 00:02:06.920
- It is?

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.765
- Yeah, except for one thing.

00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:09.958
- What's that?

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:12.660
- I do my Lambarena with a lamb.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.760
(laughing) (lamb bleating)

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.319

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.082

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:32.338
Wow.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.627
Come on Lamby.

00:02:40.341 --> 00:02:42.759
- Bienvenidos a Sesame Street.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:45.104
- And welcome to Sesame Street.

00:02:45.104 --> 00:02:46.294
What's going on here?

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:48.828
- Haven't you heard? It's
the Latino Street Festival.

00:02:48.828 --> 00:02:51.004
- Both my parents where born in Mexico

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:52.776
