00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.080
Dansky

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.740
Very often when we talk about game games pushing boundaries

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.340
We talk about it as if it were something that only began happening in the last few years

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.700
But this is not a new phenomenon

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.480
We often talk about games pushing boundaries only in the context of video games

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.460
But this has been done long before we had screens to work with

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.560
Games doing more, games as an expressive medium, games as an art go back as far as games themselfs

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.160
This is something that's starting to be acknowledged when discussing truly ancient games

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.500
But we somehow often leave out our more recent history when asking the question

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.800
"What more can games do?"

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.420
James was talking about this to a friend of his, when that friend stopped him and said

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.960
Let me send you something I worked on 25 years ago

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.140
Sometime later this book arrived at James' doorstep

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.660
And with it came this note

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.580
James,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.760
I won't say enjoy it's not that sort of book

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.420
It came from a place of frustration over all the adult material we were doing while shying away from the real hard questions

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.280
And since Wraith was already out in the boonies public awareness, they let me take y shot

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.040
So nearly 20 years old, a laybor of love, here it is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.160
This work moved James enough to put together this episode

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.800
So Richard Danksy this episode goes out to you

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.980
For having to do this at a time when the very thought of touching such topics in a game might have caused you your career

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.100
The book is Charnel Houses of Europe the Shoah

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.900
It's a devastating book about the Holocaust

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.160
It uses the wraith universe to let people tell stories and explore the horror of that time

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.820
It's a book that understands what taking on a role means

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.220
And that sometimes there is more that we can do by standing in someone's shoes

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.060
Than just feel heroic and empowered

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.000
It is amazing that this book got made

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.260
Even today many game publishers are terrified of touching the subject

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.600
Think of how many times you have played World War 2

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.860
How many times have you stormed the beaches of Normandy or defended Stalingrad?

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.500
How many times have you perhaps even played as a nazi without even giving it a second thought

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.900
Now think of how many times you have entered a concentrationcamp in those games

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.760
Think of how often genocide and slaughter was even mentioned

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.280
For all the times we fought and refought this war in our virtual landscape

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.360
We've almost never approached what is perhaps it most important lesson

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.680
And yet here in 1997 Richard and his crew got this pushed through

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.160
They were working on a sub label at White Wolf

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.460
A label called Black Dog, created to make more adult games

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.380
Ofcourse many people there took this as a license to wallow in sex and violance

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.360
And follow the same juvenile path that we usually do when we talk about creating adult work

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.480
But their small team took this as an opportunity to do more with games

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.360
To show the unique power that roleplaying has to make us empathise and to help us understand situations

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.700
That lie well outside anything we may experiance

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.180
And they did so determind to do it right

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.200
They knew they were gonna hear a lot of angry voices saying: "You can't talk about these things in a game"

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.960
But they also knew that that wasn't true

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.960
In the same way that you'd never say that such important topics shouldn't use the medium of television

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.600
Or people shouldn't make movies that discuss such serious things

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.000
You can't say that something isn't appropriate for a medium

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.940
That type of generalisation doesn't even make sense

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.720
It's not in the medium, but rather how we use it. To determine wether we are treating a subject with respect

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.260
With that in mind they made a book that unflinchingly looks at the horror of that time

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.000
That is a treasure trove of information without being dull

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.180
That is engaging without lessening the blow

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.800
Or trying to shield this from the magnatude of humanity's crime

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.920
It goes into detail without being fetishistic

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.700
And explores how modern awareness of these events without being accusatory

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.000
But perhaps to me one of the most brilliant parts of this book is that it uses the game world to help support the discussion they're trying to create

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.420
In Wraith the game, Wraith's benefit from being remembered

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.180
From having people in our world hold on to their memories or presurve aspects of their lifes

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.480
And so here it is being used time and again without being ham handed or beating you with a point

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.760
To talk about what we're doing in the real world to remember these events

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.700
Or how they're being burried over

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.700
But it's perhaps best said by just reading you a few excerpts from the introduction

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.620
An introduction written by a novelist who writes about the Holocaust

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.500
Not some game producer or manufacturer

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.600
The novelist was sceptical at first

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.900
Here let me use her own words

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.720
She explaines why this work is important better than I ever could

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.180
For those of you who do read Charnel Houses of Europe the Shoah, forgive me for chopping up and pasting together this intro

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.700
The whole thing is worth the read and I would read it all here if i could

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.720
But here we go

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.880
"On the day Richard Dansky called me to ask me to write this essay

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.240
I started to argue

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.600
But a voice inside my head stopped me

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.040
"We must teach them through the tools with which they are comfortable" It said

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.340
Once upon a time I thought there were bards and storytellers who past down the words of the elders around campfires

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.940
Then came the erea the pen was stronger than the sword

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.140
But there are few bards now and thus we approach the millennium the pen deminishes in power

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.900
It is not the N-word or the J-word or what's politically correct or what's not that matters

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.680
It's learning that we're setting eachother apart without regard about human dignity

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.500
And making it possible for genocide reoccur when we say things like:

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.440
"There is a black man at the door." Instead of "There is a man at the door."

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.400
Or "I bought the car at a great prize, boy did I Jew. it him down"

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.680
And again I ask

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.760
"What do we do about it?"

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.320
"What can we do about it?"

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.060
The answer is that we must do what we can

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.420
Each in our own way

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.340
In short stories, in essays, in poetry and novels

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.740
And o so clearly in games

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.940
And so my thanks go out to you Richard Dansky and everyone who worked on this book

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.300
As well as people like Brenda Romero with her excellent experiment about mechanics as metaphor train

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.120
Or Luke Benward who has gained imagination as the only escape was never released because of it's subject matter

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.860
And his attempts to take on this topic really did almost end his career

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.580
And all the other designers out there pushing these boundaries in ways that demand respect

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.760
These are stories that must be told

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.080
See you next week
