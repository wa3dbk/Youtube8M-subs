00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.411
Hi, I'm Leah on behalf of Expert Village,
and today, I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:09.870
some quick and easy Turkish dishes. So now,
we're going to go ahead and mix the mozzarella

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:20.850
cheese into the other half of our sauce. It's
about 2/3rds of a cup or so. We'll stir them

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.310
in there, and this is the part that we're
going to use to top the dish. So we toss the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.821
pasta with half of it, and we added the feta
to that part. The parsley went on that part.

00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:36.370
And then, this is just going to get poured
over top, and it's going to ooze down into

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:46.240
the pasta, but it's also going to give us
a nice top. Okay. That looks good. And we'll

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.230
go ahead and pour that over, and we'll do
the same thing. We'll smooth it out with our

00:00:51.230 --> 00:01:19.970
spatula. We'll go ahead and scrape to make
sure we get it all. Okay. Just make sure you

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.700
cover all the pasta. If there's any sticking
up, you can just kind of push it down with

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:33.330
the spatula. And just to even it out, just
kind of roll it around. That looks good. So

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.700
we've pre-heated the oven to 400 degrees,
and we're going to go ahead and pop this in.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:51.390
And this is going to bake at 30 minutes at
400 degrees. So the pasta's been baking at

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.080
400 degrees for 30 minutes. We're going to
go ahead and check it now and see if it's

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.870
done, and it looks finished. You'll see that
it is starting to puff up and turn golden

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.119
brown on top. That's just what it's supposed
to do. And you'll see that the egg in that

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.500
mixture is what's making it puff up like that.
Now, we're just going to give it a few minutes

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.480
to cool off for a little bit, and then we'll
serve it.
