♫ I got my barbecue shoes on

00:00:30.076 --> 00:00:32.751
- [Voiceover] Welcome to BBQPitBoys.com.

00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.559
Today we're cooking up
some beer brats at the pit,

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.347
and it's real easy to do, all right.

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:40.456
I have an assortment here of bratwurst.

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:42.313
They're often called brats.

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:45.518
We've got all pork ones, just veal ones,

00:00:45.518 --> 00:00:46.655
pork and veal.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:50.068
We've got knockwurst with beef and pork.

00:00:50.068 --> 00:00:52.274
Use your favorite brats on this.

00:00:52.274 --> 00:00:53.877
You certainly get a good variety.

00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:56.594
These are from our local German butchers.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:00:59.566
And for this recipe you're
gonna need the normal veggies:

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:01.261
onions, peppers.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.025
These are bell peppers.

00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:04.813
We've got poblanos.

00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:07.063
We've got jalapeno peppers.

00:01:08.087 --> 00:01:10.618
Use your favorite peppers, of course.

00:01:10.618 --> 00:01:12.917
All right, now let's put this together,

00:01:12.917 --> 00:01:17.084
and the first thing we're gonna
do is chop up the veggies.

00:01:21.996 --> 00:01:24.527
Now, if you've never
had beer brats before,

00:01:24.527 --> 00:01:26.916
you definitely gotta check this out.

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:30.583
Oh man, this is some
good eatin' at the pit.

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:34.857
Now, there are a number of
ways you can prepare brats

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:35.937
for the grill.

00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:38.050
You could just do 'em direct,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.595
you can do 'em indirect,

00:01:39.595 --> 00:01:42.706
or you can use a beer,
like a poaching beer,

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:44.726
like we will do in this case,

00:01:44.726 --> 00:01:47.536
and that's about the best way to do a brat

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:50.036
is poach it in some fine beer.

00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:53.302
All right.

00:01:53.302 --> 00:01:56.065
The veggies have been cut up.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.985
And now we're gonna put in the beer,

00:01:57.985 --> 00:02:01.119
and we're using some
Session's red label beer.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.443
It's a premium lager.

00:02:02.443 --> 00:02:05.856
Lager really goes best with a good brat.

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:09.919
Choose your favorite Session beer on this.

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.893
And we're gonna use four, like I said,

00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:13.893
so about 44 ounces here.

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.439
And we're gonna warm it up.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.383
Of course, you wanna save a
few beers for the pitmaster,

00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:29.888
so be certain not to use
all the beer for the cook.

00:02:29.888 --> 00:02:30.721
All right.

00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:33.554
(laughs) Oh yeah.

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:37.448
All right.

00:02:38.844 --> 00:02:42.211
The beer is in the pan, it's heating up,

00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:46.294
and now I'm gonna throw
in just the onions first.

00:02:51.314 --> 00:02:55.481
This will allow the onions
to cook down in that beer.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.998
And I'm gonna add about two tablespoons

00:02:59.998 --> 00:03:01.998
of sweet butter to this.

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:05.522
Mmm.

00:03:06.778 --> 00:03:09.945
This looks good enough to eat already.

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:16.313
Session's and simmered onions.

00:03:16.313 --> 00:03:17.146
Whew, mmm.

00:03:20.308 --> 00:03:21.558
Now, next step.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.657
While we're waiting for the
onions to simmer in that beer,

00:03:27.924 --> 00:03:31.801
we're gonna put the brats
direct over medium heat

00:03:31.801 --> 00:03:34.565
and we're gonna sear 'em
for just a minute or two.

00:03:34.565 --> 00:03:36.654
We don't wanna cook 'em fully.

00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:38.489
We just wanna sear 'em.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.947
Get a nice charcoal
flavor, get some texture.

00:03:42.947 --> 00:03:44.642
You know all about that, right?

00:03:44.642 --> 00:03:45.475
Yeah.

00:03:46.546 --> 00:03:48.963
(rock music)

00:03:52.064 --> 00:03:53.731
Just turn 'em a bit.

00:03:55.315 --> 00:03:58.891
Of course, your veal brats cook very fast,

00:03:58.891 --> 00:04:00.493
they're very sweet,

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.258
so you just keep spinning again.

00:04:02.258 --> 00:04:04.417
You just want a little color and texture,

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.834
and once you get it, throw it in the beer

00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:10.951
just like that.

00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:14.230
(rock music)

00:04:38.452 --> 00:04:41.427
Now, I'm sure you know
all about cooking up brats

00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:44.182
or dogs on the grill and how to sear 'em,

00:04:44.182 --> 00:04:45.993
but we're gonna keep doing this,

00:04:45.993 --> 00:04:48.576
because we kinda like doing it,

00:04:49.778 --> 00:04:52.695
so just hang in there and watch us.

00:04:57.441 --> 00:05:00.941
Again, just sear 'em briefly on each side.

00:05:03.687 --> 00:05:06.287
They look good enough to eat
already, but they're not.

00:05:06.287 --> 00:05:09.370
They need to be cooked fully through.

00:05:13.765 --> 00:05:16.432
Throw 'em in the Session's beer.

00:05:20.731 --> 00:05:22.481
Put a bunch in there.

00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:33.174
All right.

00:05:34.848 --> 00:05:38.308
Now, we're gonna take
all those cut up veggies

00:05:38.308 --> 00:05:42.650
and we're gonna put 'em
on top like a blanket.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.483
Yeah.

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:49.245
Yeah, and doing it this way,

00:05:49.245 --> 00:05:52.828
the brats were fully
cooked, nice and slow.

00:05:54.492 --> 00:05:57.992
The veggies will cook al dente, all right?

00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:03.781
Do you smell that?

00:06:03.781 --> 00:06:07.364
It smells good! (chuckles)

00:06:10.522 --> 00:06:13.772
All right, through the miracle of time,

00:06:15.677 --> 00:06:18.677
these Session's beer brats are done.

00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:22.819
Take a look at that, yeah.

00:06:25.213 --> 00:06:26.546
Lord have mercy.

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:32.018
Now, you can serve your
brats up any way you want,

00:06:32.018 --> 00:06:36.103
on a fancy dinner plate or
just in a roll like this.

00:06:36.103 --> 00:06:38.287
Take a couple of these brats,

00:06:38.287 --> 00:06:40.787
load it up with these veggies.

00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.579
Serve it with your favorite condiments

00:06:44.579 --> 00:06:47.783
like sauerkraut or sweet and spicy mustard

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:49.200
or curry ketchup.

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:52.378
Mmm.

00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:55.818
Oh yeah.

00:06:55.818 --> 00:06:58.235
(rock music)

00:07:04.146 --> 00:07:07.931
There's no better eating
than some Session's red label

00:07:07.931 --> 00:07:10.431
premium lager beer brats, mmm.

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:12.596
Oh yeah.

00:07:15.454 --> 00:07:18.729
And, of course, we do apologize for eating

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:19.704
in front of you like this,

00:07:19.704 --> 00:07:21.901
but we call this pitmaster privilege.

00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:22.734
- Toast.
