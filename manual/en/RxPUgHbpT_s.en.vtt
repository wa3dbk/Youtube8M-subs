00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Rock Star San Diego and Rock Star Games return to the old west with Red Dead Redemption, a spiritual successor to last gen’s Red Dead Revolver;

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but is the game worthy of your fistful of dollars?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It’s 1911, the old west is on it last legs. Federate agents are being sent in to clean the lands of criminals and murderers; so the folk can be safe and businesses may thrive.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
John Marston, once an outlaw in his own right, is sent against his will to this unforgiving place to hunt down the men he once called brothers...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
...his first attempt at negotiation is met with a bullet,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
thanks to the aid of rancher Bonnie MacFarlane, he gets a second chance to go after his old "friends".

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Along the way, he meets some interesting people and shoots a whole lot more.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If you’re played any of the Grand Theft Auto games, you’ll find yourself in familiar territory with the game’s design.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
From the outset the majority of the land is yours to explore, and two additional areas open up later on;

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:26.000
in each of the lands you have individuals you can meet to initiate story missions, which can range from herding cattle, infiltrating hide-outs, to prolonged skirmishes against waves of enemies.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Alternatively you can wonder aimlessly across the map looking for diversions, of which there are many.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Table games such as poker and blackjack can be played for high stakes, as can horseshoes and the somewhat more dangerous five-finger fillet.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
You can take night watches, engage in duels, go hunting and take time to engage in some bounty hunting, infiltrate hideouts that reset over time and even go to watch a flick...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
...complete with title cards and piano music.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Along your travels in the open world you’ll be greeted with random events like a deputy asking you to recover a safe from thieves, or someone being attacked by a pack of animals.
00:02:00.00,00:00:07.00
You can also find Strangers, designated NPCs laid out across the map, who will give you an optional quest to partake in.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You’re free to do these at your leisure, or not at all, and some of them are almost heartbreaking; or just plain weird.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
There is an abundant ammount of wildlife, from rabbits, deer and coyotes, to more dangerous animals like wolves, cougars and grizzly bears.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
All fair game for your collection of weapons and once dead can be skinned for their fur and meat, which can then be sold to merchants.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:38.000
To get around, you really need a horse and the game will always provide you with a basic breed by default, different horse’s have different rates of stamina and speed; so it’s ideal to try to catch and tame a better one.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Taming involves a brief mini-game and once a breed has been tamed you can buy a deed for that type of horse to make it your default.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Travelling by horse feels like a good facsimile of the real thing, tapping the X button to make the horse gallop faster and holding R1 will pull on the reigns.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Rapidly pressing X over a short time however will tire the horse out so bear that in mind  or it will throw you off in protest. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Holding down X whilst riding in a group will make you match the speed of the group.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
There are alternatives to horses, stage coaches let you quick travel to towns, and the train will take you to any town that it passes through,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
although on the latter you’re forced to wait the journey out. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Occasionally your find yourself either as a Driver or passenger of a wagon, just be prepared on these occasions to engage in the odd shootout.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Weapons are authentic to the time, with revolvers, rifles, and dynamite;  while several sections involve much more heavy artillery such as gatling guns.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:40.000
John also acquires a lasso for non-lethal capture of both humans and animals, and it is quite amusing to drag a human behind your horse as you gallop over fields of cacti,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
although it’s more practical to hogtie your victim and carry him via horseback.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Although the aiming is more than adequate, it’s nothing compared to the game’s most powerful ability, dead eye mode.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Being in Dead Eye allows you to essentially slow down time to more easily aim and shoot at the enemy.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Eventually you upgrade it to include the ability to target specific body parts, upon which Marston will unleash lead on the selected enemies.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000
However the bar quickly drains, refilling over time, making sure that the mechanic never become a crutch to lead on.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Unlike most of his foes, John Marston himself is pretty resilient, able to take several bullets in quick succession before being downed; with the screen fading to indicate how close he is to death.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Keeping him out of reach of lethal projectiles allows him to regain health considerable quickly, putting him back in the game.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Along with his dead eye ability, it can make the game seem almost too easy at times, but it certainly is fun.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Being caught by surprise is often much more fatal, like blindly running into a random ambush, or getting pounced on by a cougar you didn’t see.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Negating death somewhat is the lack of any sort of real penalties, and the cleverly spaced mission checkpoints, 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
which never leave you with too much backtracking to do: it goes a long way to limit any frustration.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
The A.I. reacts well to your actions, with NPC’s running for cover or out of saloons when you fire your gun,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.000
characters will engage in banter amongst themselves, and the townfolk have something resembling a schedule.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Enemies in combat run to cover and activating try to avoid being in plain view,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
although at times they resort to somewhat too basic tactics, popping up and down like a whack-a-mole game. Combat nevertheless always feels fun and rewarding.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
While the game tries to portray John as a reluctant hero, you don’t necessarily have to play by the rules,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you can commit burglaries, murders or go on a homicidal rampage if you so wish.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:34.000
However make sure to wipe out any witnesses, or they’ll inform the local law enforcement, giving you a wanted level as well as putting a bounty on your head.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:44.000
You can lose the law by outrunning their perimeter, but the bounty will remain, attracting hunters until you either pay the bounty yourself or give a pardon notice in at a telegraph station.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Alternately you can give yourself in and do a spell in prison, paying the fine in the process with either cash or by going on a bounty hunt.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.000
However the game doesn’t really encourage this type of behaviour, with shops refusing to serve you, the law pinning for you blood; the benefits of staying on the honourable side of things tends to reward you more often here.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
During the review play-through, the controls did cop-out on more than one occasion, making it impossible to mount a horse or hogtie a bounty, or unable to stop running;

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
both problems were minor and thanks to the well placed checkpoints, solvable by simply reloading a previous save.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
In a game this large and complex, a few bugs are understandable.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Red Dead looks greats; in fact it looks like a downright beautiful open-world game.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Factor in practically nonexistent loading times outside of the initial boot-up and the quick travelling and it's incredibly impressive.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Detailed textures, immaculate draw distance and an eye for detail all play their part; as do humans who don’t look like they’re living in the uncanny valley.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The frame rate on the PS3 version takes a bit of a dip here and there where things get hectic, and there’s a tiny bit of aliasing issues while playing in Standard Def.
00:06:53.00,00:05:56.00
but for the main part Redemption is a visual feast for the eyes.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The soundtrack boasts some great music appropriate to the subject matter, but the music is more selective than a constant companion, with you during action and other pivotal moments,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
with ambient sound effects, and conversations taking greater precedence.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The script is well written, with hour upon hour of dialogue and goes from being touching to genuinely funny, while the voice actors are spot on in their roles.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Red Dead Redemption is a massively ambiguous game from a company that has never really done much by halves.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The detail is impressively grandeur and the game attached to it is of excellent quality.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
You shouldn’t have any reason not to mount up and head for the west.
