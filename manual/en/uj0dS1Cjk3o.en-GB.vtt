If you're a reader of The Daily Mail, the
Irish Independent, various beauty blogs, or

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.350
Elle Magazine, you might have seen the latest
skincare innovation to come out of Korea!

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.960
Pig collagen masks. For your face.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.150
Because collagen is important...in the skin,
right?

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.660
Elle even entitled the article 'Why you should
consider putting pig collagen on your face'

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.730
And I get it, they want people to click, and
I did, so I guess you win this round, Elle

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
Magazine?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.460
"However (and this is a big however), most
experts argue that applying collagen topically

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.170
may not be entirely effective, since collagen
molecules are too big to pass through the

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.170
skin's barrier."

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.390
OK, good, yes, yes...wait, why are you still
writing?

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.050
“given all the home runs SoKo skincare has
introduced to us so far, we're quickly learning

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.079
not to question, and just go with it.”

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.079
NO. Nooo.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.030
You know, I think this would be a really good
time to talk about how moisturisers work.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.819
And why smearing pig collagen on your face
won’t do you any harm, but probably won’t

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:01.819
do you any good either.

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:02.819
K? K.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:08.869
Right. Moisturiser has three main ingredients,
plus a fourth which is in almost every anti-ageing

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.490
serum, and we'll cover that now because it's
not really relevant.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.930
The fourth anti-ageing type ingredient actually
does kinda work, albeit temporarily: it's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.979
kind of long chains of proteins and when you
put them on your face they dry out and they

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.240
contract and so it gives your skin a sort
of temporarily tighter appearance.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.100
Or at least it does until it wears off or
you wash it off, but still!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.460
Right, but that's an aside.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.939
Three main ingredients of moisturisers:

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.909
One: water, two: oil, three: some kind of
emulsifier.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.170
Moisturising is about keeping moisture in.
And frankly for that all you need is oil.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.810
I mean Vaseline will do that and it's JUST
petroleum jelly.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.259
And a lot of people, including me, use Vaseline
on their lips, but it's kind of greasy for

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.579
smearing all over your face for everyday use.

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.740
So what you do to make it less greasy is you
mix your oil (which is coconut oil or olive

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.810
oil or petroleum jelly or liquid paraffin
or whatever) with some water (tap water or

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.530
rosewater, any kind of water you like).

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.210
What you want is for all of the oil and the
water to be mixed in together, but oil and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.410
water don’t like to mix, and that is why
you need an emulsifier.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.810
Because the job of emulsifiers, like glycerine,
is to keep the oil and the water nicely mixed

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.800
in together and notseparated out.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.490
For example: my moisturiser. And the first
three ingredients on my moisturiser?

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.611
1: AQUA (that would bewater). 2. Glycerin
(that would be our emulsifier) and 3. Liquid

00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:37.600
paraffin . I guess it just sounds better in
Latin.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.260
Basically those 3 ingredients are the ones
which are doing the majority of the work.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.390
OK, Jill, I hear you say, we've now discussed
what moisturiser is generally made of, and

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.620
that's wonderful, but what does that have
to do with collagen?

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.920
Well, the point of moisturiser is to keep
moisture on and around your face.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.960
But cosmetics adverts are always suggesting
to you (never outright STATING, because it's

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.340
a lie), but SUGGESTING that you will somehow
absorb these ingredients into your skin, and

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.740
it will make it better somehow.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.760
Hence the pig collagen, because pig collagen
is reasonably similar in structure to human

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.450
collagen, shockingly, and so the idea is that
it gets absorbed into your skin and is used

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.730
as a building block and...NO.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.540
Because your skin is good at keeping things
out. How good? Very good. Which means that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.130
all those claims about ingredients nourishing
your skin from the inside are nonsense. Yeah,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.540
they'll get through the first couple of dead
layers maybe, but they're not going to be

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.690
absorbed into your bloodstream.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.160
BUt JILL you say again. If they can make transdermal
nicotine patches and pain patches and contraceptive

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.790
patches, then why wouldn't this work with
collagen?

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.310
That is actually a very good question.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.630
And the answer is...SIZE.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:48.810
Among other things.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.840
So let's take a kind of nicotine patch as
an example. You have your nicotine molecules

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.700
in a reservoir covered by a membrane which
allows slow release of the molecules over

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.700
the course of hours.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.560
Added to this somewhere in the mix there will
be a permeation enhancer to help the nicotine

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.010
be delivered into your bloodstream through
your skin.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:13.260
The reason this works? Nicotine molecules
are very small. I mean, even for molecules

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.080
they're minute.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.320
For measurements of Molecular weight we use
the unified atomic mass unit (u) or the dalton

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.790
(symbol Da). They’re actually the same thing,
so I'm going to use Dalton, because I like

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.790
the word.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.590
Collagen molecules, for example, are between
15000 and 50000 daltons. Let’s take the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.480
small end, and say that our collagen molecules
which we're using were 15000 Daltons, and

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.740
we haven't done anything to make them smaller.

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.500
OK. Approximately how bug can molecules be
before they stop passing through the skin?

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.270
About 500 Daltons.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.340
Let me say that again.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.180
Small collagen molecule: 15000 Daltons.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.230
Approximate limit for molecules that can pass
through your skin? About 500.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.950
I mean nicotine molecules, for example? Yeah.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.389
The collagen is not going into your skin.
It’s sitting on top of your skin and acting

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.550
like a humectant, which is something that
retains moisture.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.380
(Glycerin by the way, also a humectant)

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.540
And maybe the collagen is ingratiating itself
into the fine lines on your face like Polyfilla

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.020
or spackle, or whatever you use to patch holes
in your walls, but it's doing that temporarily.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.980
If your skin is dry, just buy yourself a moisturiser
that doesn't make your face itch.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.070
(Incidentally if a moisturiser does make your
face itch it's probably because of the Parfum,

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.510
which is very poorly defined, generally).

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.120
Perfume free: works for everybody!

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.040
I bet that your Nivea or your Astral or your
Ponds or your Diprobase will do just as good

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.040
a job as the Progenium Nutra-Cellulose Vibrating
GJYComplex.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.150
Because SCIENCE.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.690
May I wish you all a very pleasant and pig
offal free day, and I'll see you soon.
