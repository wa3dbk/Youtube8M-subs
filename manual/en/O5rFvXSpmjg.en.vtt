Welcome everyone I'm Laura Shoe author
the Lightroom blog

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.879
and Lightroom workshops on video at http://laurashoe.com

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.960
recently I read an article about how to
add catch flights to eyes using

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.939
Photoshop

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.130
so I thought I'd show you how to do the
same thing here in Lightroom

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.269
I going to zoom in on my eye and I'm
going to paint in

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.939
a catch light with the adjustment brush
now any time I come into the adjustment

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.510
brush

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.400
I like to reset all the sliders so that
I don't accidentally paint with

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.720
something I don't mean to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.629
so I'll do so by double clicking on the word
affect I want to paint

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.260
with positive exposure and nothing is
happening in the photo

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.530
because I haven't yet said where I
want to use a fairly small brush

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.850
you can change the size of you brush
using the size slider down here

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.879
or you can use the left and right
bracket keys

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.649
on your keyboard I also want my brush to
have a soft edge

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.199
rather than harsh one so I've set the
feather slider here to 100

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.210
I'm simply going to click in my eye and
let go

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.539
to paint the catch light now this pin
that's a record of my changes is in

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.179
the way

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.599
me evaluating the catch light so as I
move my mouse

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:20.920
out at the photo the pin is hidden and
that's the case because I have

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.229
show edit pins here set to auto hide

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.759
now at this point the catch light has a
reddish cast to it

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.759
because adding four stops to exposure
wasn't enough

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.899
to blow out that area or turn it pure
white

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.110
we're seeing some of the underlying
residual color so in addition to

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.130
painting with positive exposure

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.200
I'm going to paint with negative
saturation

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.149
I'll go ahead and take it to -100 now at this
point

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.300
if I feel like I've added too much
exposure

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.759
I can simply adjust the amount it's hard
for me to tell when I'm zoomed in so far

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.319
so I'm going to click on fill to zoom out and I
think it's looking pretty good

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:06.009
I'm going to zoom back in to show you that if
you need to add more light

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.470
if +4 on exposure is not enough if
you have a dark eye

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.209
like this one you can also use the
shadow slider

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.280
so as we add light into the shadows
where we've painted

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.910
you can see how bright I can get that
catch light in my

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.040
way too bright of course another option

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.630
for example if you're working with a
light-colored I and shadows doesn't

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.170
work

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.890
is to add another adjustment right on
top of this one

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.150
if you have Lightroom 4 or earlier you'll
click on new

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.170
and you'll paint that area again if you
have Lightroom 5

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.570
you can duplicate this adjustment by
right-clicking

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.640
or control clicking on the pin and
choosing

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.330
Duplicate now there's a second
instruction sitting on top of the first

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.980
one

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.150
and as I move my mouse out you can see
the cumulative

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.500
effect of the two adjustments I can then

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.420
dial back the top adjustment to get just
the amount that i'm looking for.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.690
next I would hold the space bar down

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.490
so that I can click and drag over to my
other eye

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.610
now the eyes are of different brightness is
starting out so I very well might want

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.120
different settings for the catch light
in this eye so I'm gonna do a brand new

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.100
adjustment

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.420
and I'll start again with positive
exposure

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.600
and negative saturation and I'll click, move

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.050
my mouse out that's not enough so I'll

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.200
add light into the shadows maybe zoom
out so I can get some perspective here

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.220
and then I continue to work on it from
here I think they're too bright

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.020
at this point now this pin is active its
black

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.569
so I can simply dial back the exposure
cell to get back to this catch light or

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.340
this pin

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.970
I need to click on it to make it active
and then I can adjust

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.940
from here okay so that's how to add
catch lights using Lightroom
