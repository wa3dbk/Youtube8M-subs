00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.859
Can games express an idea simply through their mechanics alone?

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.279
Can they tell a story or raise a question using only their most basic element, play? These are fundamental questions

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.319
which we'll have to answer as this medium grows.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.830
How we answer them will help us to understand how to break away from merely emulating traditional media and evolve as our own art.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.660
Incidentally, James was challenged by another designer at a recent game convention to show an example of this.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.449
This is sort of a grand slam for us. It gives us an excuse to discuss a great topic, it lets James ramble about one

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:42.720
of his favorite old games, it allows us to provide an example for all of you to use

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.420
if this topic ever happens to come up in your conversations,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850
and it gives James the chance to win a bet.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.700
Well then, onto the game. Some of you may be eager for us to talk about the latest Fallout or Call of Duty

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.649
but I think it's important to learn from our past.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.869
Too many old games are being forgotten which is a shame because they're often the best to learn from.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.349
They tend to be simpler their mechanics aren't obscured by flashy graphics or the complex physics happening under the hood, so today

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350
we're going to be talking about Missile Command.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.549
For those of you who never played it, Missile Command was an arcade game developed in 1980. In this game

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.140
you used a trackball to fire rockets from three different missile defense platforms

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.800
in order to protect six cities from an unending reign of ICBMs.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.029
Given that this game was built over a quarter century ago,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.009
it doesn't have much going for it in the way of graphics or sound. The missiles are single pixel glowing dots,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.080
the cities are by bichromatic skyscraper silhouettes, and the explosions resound in that great old Atari rumble.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.620
And   yet it manages to express one of the most compelling narratives about nuclear war that we've ever experienced.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.640
How does it do so? Through play.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.109
This is a very carefully crafted game. Almost no element was haphazardly added.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.569
So let's look at them one by one. First the game is nonviolent; the player never launches a nuclear missile.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.089
They never fire at an enemy. In this game

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.500
the villain is unknown and unimportant. The game is entirely about trying desperately to save lives.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.620
Rather than losing its narrative and aggression and dominance, the game does something very rare for a video game:

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.320
It puts the player in a position of completely reactionary weakness.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.460
It does this to set the boundaries of the

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.700
experience which the player is exploring. The player can't get lost in the awesome power of nuclear weapons or revel in gratuitous destruction.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.649
That isn't what this experience is about. This is a story about being on the receiving end of a nuclear strike.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.380
Let's take a look at this narrative choice for a moment.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.089
This is a much more human, a much more relatable story than one of mass destruction and conquest.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.839
By choosing this narrative to focus on, the creator David Theurer has presented the player with a role they can understand; A role they can

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.840
emotionally assume as they experience the game;

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.600
That of an individual who, not only doesn't have limitless power as is the video game norm, but in fact has very little power to fulfill

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.629
a task of dire responsibility. So let's look at this role

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.290
and how its reinforced by play.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.619
When the player steps up to the machine, they take on the role of a regional commander of three small missile defense bases.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.630
This choice of scope is important. It's human and scale. We can understand six cities.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.160
We can imagine six real towns in our home state and project ourselves onto the experience.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.920
We can all emotionally invest in those few bases

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.479
and that handful of towns in a way that we simply couldn't if the game had tasked us with defending an entire country.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.770
Now before we even begin to talk about play, think about being the commander of these few, small,

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.600
poorly stocked facilities. You probably never expected them to be used.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.390
You probably think of yourself as part of a deterrent for a war that could never possibly come.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.079
But now, as soon as you put that coin in that slot, the war is upon you.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.639
So let's look at how this is reinforced mechanically. Missile Command, a 30 year old game,

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.619
comes with what is perhaps the best and most difficult set of moral choices any video game has ever presented.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.400
Inevitably, as you play Missile Command, you'll come to a point where you have to make a choice:

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.000
Who do you defend?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.909
You have limited resources and a seemingly endless onslaught to repel. Do you try and defend everyone?

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.269
Do you go out of your way and try to save that one distant town?

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.689
Or do you let it, and everyone in it, vanish in an instant of cataclysmic fire

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.389
so you have a better chance of saving the rest of the lives you're responsible for?

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.660
Do you let the soldiers under your command, men who know their duty

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.009
but at the same time trust you to keep them alive, die when it comes down to protecting them or your civilians?

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.320
Do you let a million lives get turned to ash

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.479
so that you can defend one of your military installations, vital for protecting the other 5 million for whom you're responsible?

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.790
Do you jeopardize the many for the few or

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:15.729
sacrifice the few for the many? The game reinforces all of these choices mechanically. You start the game with 6 cities,

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.119
But as cities die it becomes easier and easier to protect those that remain.

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.000
So do you let 5 vanish so that you can at least ensure the survival of the 6th?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.580
After all, you only lose when all

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.099
6 cities are gone. Also, each of your missile bases has

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.809
their own supply of ammo and their own strategic location.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.830
Losing any one of them early in a stage

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.089
severely hampers your ability to defend your cities. Thus, weighing the value of your bases against the value of your cities becomes a tricky question.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.879
Moreover,   the player has to make all of these judgments lightning-fast. They have to make them in real-time just as the character

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.460
they're playing would. The player can feel that tension and that

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.700
paralyzing indecision that accompanies choices of that gravity and, in the end, walks away with a new respect for anyone who has to make choices

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.869
of that magnitude with the speed and confidence they need to be made. And what's it all for?

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.649
What's the bluntest point made by this game? 
That you can't win.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.100
No matter how many stages you survive or how much time you spend playing, you can't beat Missile Command.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.440
Nuclear war has no winners; Your job is futile but you do it anyway

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.489
because you can buy people a few more minutes of hope. And what happens when you inevitably lose?

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:19.039
The game eschews the typical game over screen found in almost every arcade game of its day for something a lot darker.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.980
With two symbols it reinforces the horror of what's occurred in a way that most modern games fail to do with pages of script.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.909
It simply says "The End" across the flash of an incoming explosion.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.850
This is a game that tells a narrative about nuclear war and the human struggles to be found therein, and it does so solely with

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.110
its mechanics; balancing and incentivizing each side of impossibly difficult moral choices.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:43.960
It's stark and sobering in a way that few films or even books have managed to convey.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.120
But hey, that's enough fro  m us.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.400
We'll just leave you with the affect this game had on its creator.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.350
This is taken from an interview with Theurer, years after the game launched.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:56.360
He said "I'd wake up in the middle of the night from a nightmare where I'd see these streaks coming in and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.510
I'd be up in the Santa Cruz mountains, and I'd see it hit Sunnyvale

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.510
and I'd know I had about 45 seconds until the blast reached me.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.110
I had those nightmares once a month for a year after I finished Missile Command."

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.780
Theurer always thought of the six cities and Missile Command as the coastal cities of his home state of California.

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.809
Yeah, so not only can games tell stories and convey ideas through their mechanics alone,

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.710
They've been doing so for longer than most of us have been alive. Pretty cool, huh?

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.560
See you next week.
