On behalf of Expert Village my name is Seth
Williams. I work for D - K Service and I'm

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.820
here to tell you about simple street bike
brake repair and inspection. It's going to

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.040
be the reassembly or the brake caliper with
the brake pads. Make sure you put them in

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:23.650
the right direction. One pad facing on both
ways. Once you get those aligned in there

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:54.420
turn the pad over. Put in your pins. Put in
your cotter pins to lock your pins into place.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.120
Once that's finished you want to put in the
brake retaining pins in. This is where it

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:11.400
will get a little difficult as you need to
manipulate these around one of the brake pins.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:02:05.219
Sometimes a flat head screwdriver, sometimes
your fingers. There?s one. There?s Two. We're

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.910
ready for installation of the brake caliper
onto the mounting plates.
