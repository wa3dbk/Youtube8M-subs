00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.867
Cheryl Bailey:
How are you all doing today?

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:02.967
Audience:
Good.

00:00:02.967 --> 00:00:04.233
Cheryl Bailey:
Excellent.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.834
Well, first off, I'd like to
just take this opportunity to

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:11.900
thank the First Lady and her
staff to invite U.S. Soccer and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.667
the Women's National Team to
be part of this event today.

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:16.567
This is a pretty exciting time.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:22.367
And these women we have up in
front of us, these players,

00:00:22.367 --> 00:00:25.166
along with their team
mates and their coaches,

00:00:25.166 --> 00:00:27.500
do you all know what
they did this summer?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.767
Audience:
Yes.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:29.667
Cheryl Bailey:
What?

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:31.133
Audience:
Play soccer.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.000
(laughter)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.066
Cheryl Bailey:
Well, we're honored to be
here today to be part of

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.800
the "Let's Move!" campaign.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.433
It's a wonderful campaign,
something that soccer certainly

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:45.166
blends well with to get people
out there to be more fit,

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.734
to eat better, to nutritiously
think about what you're doing.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.033
And soccer, which
all of you play,

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:54.567
millions of boys and girls
across the U.S. play soccer.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.633
It's a sport that you
can play by yourself.

00:00:56.633 --> 00:00:58.300
You can go out and
just dribble a ball.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.467
You can get a group together
and just play a pick-up game.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:04.467
Or you can be involved
in organized leagues,

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:07.266
which I believe most of
you are which is exciting.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.467
So it allows you to have
fun, but also to stay fit.

00:01:10.467 --> 00:01:14.300
And when we went to the
World Cup this summer,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
there was an awful
lot of excitement,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.934
because this particular team
with their team mates and their

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.967
coaches probably provided
some of the most memorable

00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:23.033
moments in sports.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.433
It was certainly exciting.

00:01:24.433 --> 00:01:29.033
And it ignited the U.S. to
get turned on to soccer.

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:33.500
And you can look at them as role
models that clearly are part of

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.066
what's "Let's Move!" is: To
be able to get out there,

00:01:37.066 --> 00:01:40.133
to be able to think about your
priorities when it comes to

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.667
fitness and lifestyle,
and to just move.

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:46.000
To be active, to
be participants,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.433
and that's just an exciting
time for U.S. Soccer and the

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:51.667
Women's National Team
to be a part of that.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:54.433
So it's exciting
for us to be here.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.467
You're going to have a
wonderful clinic today.

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.300
And at this time, it's my
pleasure to introduce the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.467
First Lady, Michelle Obama.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:02.367
First Lady Michelle Obama:
Thank you, Cheryl.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.000
(applause)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.700
Thanks so much.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
You guys doing good?

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.567
Audience:
Yes.

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:09.667
First Lady Michelle Obama:
Yeah? We've got a
great day, don't we?

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.000
(laughter)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.600
You guys ready to
do some moving?

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.467
Audience:
Yes.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.533
First Lady Michelle Obama:
Yeah? Well, I am too.

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:17.367
So you're going to have
to be patient with me.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:19.200
I am not a soccer player.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.900
But I'm going to get out
there and do my best, okay?

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.500
Audience:
Okay.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.600
First Lady Michelle Obama:
I want to start by thanking
Cheryl for being here for that

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.934
wonderful introduction.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.200
We're going to have some
fun on the South Lawn.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.266
We've been doing events like
this for a little while now,

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.934
inviting kids from the community
to come out in my backyard and

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:39.233
to play a little bit.

00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.767
Now, we've done a little tennis.

00:02:40.767 --> 00:02:43.867
We've done a little relay races.

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:45.133
We've done a little
bit of everything.

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.834
Some double-dutch jumping rope.

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.000
We've done a little
bit of everything.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.800
And we're happy to have
the women's World Cup U.S.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.266
Soccer Team here with us.

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:56.166
We are proud of their
accomplishment this summer.

00:02:56.166 --> 00:02:59.100
I know that the President
and I and Malia and Sasha,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.767
we were glued to the TV.

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:03.266
How many people
watched the tournament?

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.600
Wasn't it exciting?

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.367
Audience:
Yes.

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.266
First Lady Michelle Obama:
What was your favorite part?
Was there a favorite part?

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:09.367
Audience Member:
When they beat Brazil.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:12.800
First Lady Michelle Obama:
Whoa, whoa, yes, when
they beat Brazil.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.233
That was powerful, wasn't it?

00:03:14.233 --> 00:03:17.000
Yeah. That's good.
Other favorite parts?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.867
What else?

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:20.400
What about some headers?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.300
Some good headers, yeah, yeah.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.433
Audience Member:
(inaudible)

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:29.066
First Lady Michelle Obama:
Well, we're just happy to
have these women with us.

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.467
And they are some of the
best soccer players in

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.200
the entire world.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.400
Can you imagine becoming so
good at something that you're

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.266
the best in the whole world?

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.367
Well, these women have done
it and they've made us so

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:41.734
incredibly proud.

00:03:41.734 --> 00:03:45.667
But let's not forget that
these women weren't born

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:47.433
super star athletes.

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.166
And that's something
that you all should know.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.433
I'm sure that none of you
expected to be standing here

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:54.367
at the White House, right.

00:03:54.367 --> 00:03:57.734
None of you thought that
soccer would lead you to this.

00:03:57.734 --> 00:03:58.633
But they didn't know.

00:03:58.633 --> 00:04:03.400
They started out like you,
as kids just having fun.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.200
You know, maybe just
playing in a league.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.300
Maybe just kicking
a ball around.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:08.800
And that's really the point.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.467
You don't have to become a
super star athlete to enjoy

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:16.367
sports and to move.

00:04:16.367 --> 00:04:19.066
But getting involved in
something fun like this can help

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.867
you in so many different ways.

00:04:20.867 --> 00:04:24.967
It's not just about how you
feel, but being physically fit,

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:26.433
it helps you in school.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.700
It helps you focus.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.133
It helps keep your mind
concentrating on what you

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:32.767
need to do.

00:04:32.767 --> 00:04:36.000
So there's a direct connection
between how healthy you are,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.967
the kind of food you
put in your body,

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:40.333
and how your mind operates.

00:04:40.333 --> 00:04:41.700
Did you guys understand that?

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.667
I mean, as athletes, you've got
to know that the food you eat

00:04:44.667 --> 00:04:47.834
and how you move is
directly connected, right?

00:04:47.834 --> 00:04:48.633
Audience:
Yes.

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:52.000
First Lady Michelle Obama:
And that's why I started
"Let's Move!" as First Lady.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.533
One of my biggest initiative is
making sure that kids like you

00:04:56.533 --> 00:05:00.600
all across this country are
getting the exercise you need,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.433
and that you're eating the
proper foods and you're

00:05:03.433 --> 00:05:06.500
understanding how that's
going to help you in so

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.934
many different ways.

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.166
And today is just one of
those ways where we can take

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:13.700
the movement and have
a little fun with it.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.400
But one of the things I want to
encourage you and everybody out

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.066
there watching to do, because
not every kid is fortunate

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:23.800
enough to be able to
be in a soccer league.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.100
So we want to encourage kids
to find ways to keep moving.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.633
Maybe it's not in a league, but
maybe it's just running around

00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.800
in the backyard like
we're about to do,

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.734
kicking a ball and
doing some drills.

00:05:33.734 --> 00:05:36.200
You don't have to always
do something organized.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.333
And we have something
called the President's

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.767
Active Lifestyle Award.

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:42.467
It's called the PALA Awards.

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:47.000
And it's a challenge to kids and
to families to be engaged in

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
some kind of physical activity
60 minutes a day for a certain

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.100
period of time.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.100
And if you do that, you can
earn a President's Award.

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.600
And to date, we set a goal to
have one million people earn

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.133
their awards here in a year.

00:06:04.133 --> 00:06:06.433
And we hit our year during
the World Wide Day of Play.

00:06:06.433 --> 00:06:08.367
Did anybody watch
that on Nickelodeon?

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.367
Audience Member:
(inaudible)

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:11.867
First Lady Michelle Obama:
You were at a baseball game.

00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:13.333
I'm sorry about that.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:15.567
But you were moving so
that was a good thing.

00:06:15.567 --> 00:06:17.667
But we surpassed our goal.

00:06:17.667 --> 00:06:20.567
1.7 million people in this
country have earned their

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:21.834
PALA Awards.

00:06:21.834 --> 00:06:25.333
And we want to keep that
number growing, okay.

00:06:25.333 --> 00:06:27.900
So I want you to spread the
word, challenge yourselves,

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.400
challenge the kids in your
classrooms, in your lives,

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.734
the people in your family to get
online and find out about how to

00:06:35.734 --> 00:06:37.467
earn a PALA Award, okay.

00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:38.767
Do you promise me that?

00:06:38.767 --> 00:06:39.633
Audience:
Yes.

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:40.166
First Lady Michelle Obama:
All right.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.066
Well, I'm going to stop
talking so that we can

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:44.000
start moving, okay.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.834
You ready?

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:45.300
Audience:
Yes.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.233
First Lady Michelle Obama:
All right. Let's get going.

00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:47.367
Thank you, guys.
