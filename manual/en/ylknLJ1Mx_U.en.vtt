00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.830
It is that time of the year.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.510
People are making resolutions, I am making
predictions.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.480
My big fitness predicton for 2012, today.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.900
[Music Intro]

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.029
What's up guys?

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.160
Jeff Cavaliere AthleanX.com

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.259
Getting together at the end of 2011, leading
into 2012.

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.940
As I said, this is the time of year for resolutions.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.620
Everybody wants to get in better shape in
2012.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.640
But I want to switch it up a little bit.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:49.150
There are a lot of 2012 workouts out there,
but I want to make a 2012 fitness prediction.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.730
That is, what is going to be the big trend
come 2012?

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.879
Now, if you have been with Athlean-X for any
length of time- if you are already on Team

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.390
Athlean, then you will know that the trend
is what we have been doing now for over 2

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.390
years.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.390
It is athletic-based strength training.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.930
So what I want to do is show you what the
difference is between old-school training

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.110
and athletic-based strength training.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.840
So you can see what it is that allows you
to get better results by doing so.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.800
One of the classic exercises is the one-armed
dumbbell row.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.940
So pull straight up and down, working your
back, OK?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.690
I know a lot of you guys are out there doing
it.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.149
Our 2012 exercise, you have to argue that
it is better.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.390
We have a body weight exercise which is a
pull-up.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.360
What we are going to do is a pull-up with
a mixed grip- one hand goes underneath and

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.390
one hand goes overhand.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.110
Immediately what you see here is, if I were
to let go, I spin, OK?

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.640
I have to hold myself back, centered, using
my abs, using the muscles in my upper back,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.440
tying it altogether so that I don't spin.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.670
I stay straight ahead, I work the bicep on
this side, I work overhand more on the back

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.670
on this side.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.360
Then I lift my knees up so that I make sure
that I get the core working too.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.440
From here I have got to pull straight up no
spin allowed.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440
OK?

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.750
It is a different form of pull-up; It is tying
all muscles groups together in unique ways

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.100
across the body: underhand, overhand.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.050
You try to tie them together obviously through
the core.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.340
For me, it is a preferred exercise.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.340
Why?

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.340
More muscles working at once.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.220
This is what we have in our body-building
bible, our old school exercise, this is what

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.220
we are doing.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.300
Now, if this resembles anything you do on
a sport field,or even in daily life, write

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.890
in and put your comment below and let me know
what that is.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.280
Because I still haven't found a real purpose
for this, other than trying to be a body-builder.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.620
That's the last time you'll ever see this
thing.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.810
At Athlean-X what we do, we do exercises that
are much more explosive and more importantly,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.820
ground-based, if you are going to be training
your legs.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.610
Because if you are an athlete, and you have
to be athletic, you have to be able to be

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.610
on your feet and move around.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.960
So what we have is a Bulgarian Split Squat
Box Jump.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.950
So we are down here, we put our foot up on
the bench behind us,OK, straight down into

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.950
our squat and then from here explode up.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.950
Straight back down again, and explode up.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:04.950
Down and explode up.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:05.950
Now you are getting a single leg Box Jump,
a single leg squat: explosive and effective

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.950
as ground base.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.310
I will take that any day over a leg extension
where legs and knees are working the way they

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.310
prefer to work here.

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.710
You also notice that the knee is in a good
position behind the toe every step of the

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.500
way, down here and up here.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.500
Finally, chest-old school again, bench press.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.880
Now there is nothing wrong with a dumbbell
bench-press.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.790
I mean we do them all the time;

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.460
We even do them with Athlean-X training in
athletic based workouts except the fact of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.110
the matter is there is nothing especially
athletic about doing a bench press.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.150
I mean, I don't know about you, but you don't
want to spend as much time on your back if

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.410
you are an athlete and want to compete.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.300
So what we do is ground-based close-chain
hands on the ground, and as always explosive.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.300
At every opportunity try to incorporate multiple
muscle groups work at once.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.885
If I could get my core to work with my chest
and my shoulders I am good to go.

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:57.500
So we have our twisting piston push-up.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.890
Down here, come down and we hop-in and back,
we hop-in and back.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.349
So with this jump a lot of core work, a lot
of stabilization; hop it out, back to center.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:15.680
In: there is an unequal distribution of weight
between the left arm here and the right arm.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.469
Then hop back to center.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:25.819
Now I can grap 100s and knock out rep after
rep of a 100 lb bench press.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:32.669
I can't do too many of these and that is just
to show you it uses your full body weight,

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.090
but in unpredictable ways.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:46.600
So guys, if you don't believe me, I always
talk about If you want to look like an athlete,

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.910
you have to train like one.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.250
Well, if you want to be a supreme athlete,
take it from one of the guys that I train

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.720
each and every off-season better than I can
say myself.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720
[Introduces new speaker]

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.180
&gt;&gt;Hey guys this is David Wright from the New
York Mets.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.340
As you can see by the sweat on my forehead,
I just finished Jeff Cavaliere's Athlean-X

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.340
Supreme Workout Challenge.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.780
Crazy workout, I can't say enough nice things
about Jeff as a trainer but also about the

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.780
workout.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.350
I am winded and still sweating and most importantly
my preparation and my performance.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.030
I use it on.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.250
I use it on a weekly basis.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:18.320
I wouldn't put my name to something I didn't
believe in.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.260
I believe in Jeff, the workout techniques
and the program.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:28.060
&gt;&gt;There you have it guys, that is the prediction
from me for 2012.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.990
You are going to see a big shift here; a lot
of jumping on the bandwagon of athletic-based

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.990
training.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.990
Strength training: becoming more powerful,
becoming more explosive, but looking more

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.990
athletic.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.990
Being muscular, being ripped, the whole combination.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.990
It is quicker, it is more effective, it is
safer.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.600
In the longrun, it is the training that you
are going to want to adopt.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.490
If you haven't already, head to AthleanX.com
right now.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.670
Become part of Team Athlean and get the Athlean-X
training program.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.480
Guys I know this is the time of year, guys,
that you make those resolutions.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.970
I know it is a great starting point for many
of you.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.050
The unfortunate thing is a lot of guys will
give up just weeks into January.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.300
That is because they are either not seeing
results fast enough with the program they

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.300
are doing.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.530
Or the program they are doing is not easy
to follow.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:01.970
Athlean-X will deliver both.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.830
A program that will deliver results quickly,
keep you inspired, keep you going, and it

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.970
will be a program that you can follow step
by step for 90 days, nutrition and your workouts.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.640
Guys thanks for a great 2011.

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.040
I look forward to bringing you more of these
videos here throughout 2012.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.210
As you can see more and more new stuff.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.080
Big, big things with Athlean-X in 2012.

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:39.870
I will see you guys back here next year.
