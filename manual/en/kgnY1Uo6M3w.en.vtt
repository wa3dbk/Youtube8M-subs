Hello and welcome back to logic
components. Today,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.490
we only have three things to cover: NOT, AND, OR.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.490
You're watching Episode 2 of Logic Components

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.940
Hello and welcome back to logic
components

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.340
yes we only have three gates to look at today.
nothing extremely complicated

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.530
but in order to facilitate this, I'm also
gonna share with you the concept of a truth

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.210
table

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.260
now remember in the first episode I said
that processing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.010
basically involves inputs, processes and
outputs

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.269
also recall that logic gates only work
with bits

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.890
and bits can only be 0 or 1. What
this means is

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.250
if a gate only takes one input then we can
be sure that

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.220
there are only grand total of two possible
inputs that this gate can take

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.290
obviously the gates we're looking at right
now have a consistent

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.590
output for every single input. To express
this in an

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.940
easy form, we actually write what is
called a truth table

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.950
well it's basically just a table saying
that for this input

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.520
I'll get this output. Now instead of
showing you an example

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.090
what I'm going to do is I'm just gonna jump
straight in to tell you about the first

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.560
gate

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.320
because this gate is dead easy to
understand, I'm gonna actually take this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.290
opportunity to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.700
also explain how truth tables work as
well. So let us kill two birds with one

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.430
stone

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.600
by taking a look at the NOT gate. Now, in a
logic diagram

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.710
we actually draw out a NOT gate to look like
this

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.730
it takes one input and produces one
output

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.740
and as its name implies, it's extremely simple

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.860
it is basically just an inverter. what
this means is

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.130
if it gets zero as an input, it produces
1 as the output

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.090
if it gets 1 as the input, it produces zero as
the output

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.470
so extremely simple. what you get for
input, you just have to invert it

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.940
and that is the output. So what does the
truth table look like?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.909
now the first thing you want to consider
is how many inputs are there

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.190
well since the gate itself actually only
takes one input

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.709
therefore, there are only two possible
inputs this gate can receive

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.069
0, or 1. So when given 0 what is the
output

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.720
well, it's 1, because it's an inversion. Given 1,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.260
obviously the output is zero. Therefore, the truth table

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.900
looks like this. So yeah these are
basically two extremely simple concepts

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.300
Your NOT gate simply inverts the input
Whilst a truth table simply lists out

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.430
all the input and output pairs. With that,

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.670
let us now extend our understanding
to gates that take in two inputs

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.080
we start off with the AND gate. What does

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.790
AND tell you? In fact, AND simply tells you
that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.280
if input one is true, AND input two is true,
then the output is true.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.480
So we look at zero, zero. Since neither of them are true,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.230
the output cannot possibly be true
therefore the output is

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.230
zero. Same for 10 and 01

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.849
remember that we need both input one AND two

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.270
to be true before we can have true as a
result and therefore

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.400
for both these entries the result is
still false

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.610
the only time can have an output that
it's true

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.940
is when both input one AND input two

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.630
are true. In other words, the only time that you can write "1" in the output

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.700
is at the very last row of the truth
table

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.690
this in a nutshell is the AND gate. So let's
move on to take a look at the last gate

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.390
of the day

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.110
and that is the OR gate. Now based
on what you've seen with the AND gate,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.120
you can probably put the pieces together
and guess what

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.340
the OR gate is supposed to do. If input

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.090
one OR input two is true, then the output

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.190
is true. So in your truth table

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.760
well zero, zero means that neither
one of them are true

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.510
and therefore your output has to be false. However,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.290
for 0,1 and 1,0, well one of them are true

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.660
and therefore, the output is true. Now

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.760
what about the last one? Well, as long as

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.919
one of the inputs are true, the output will
be true

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.139
therefore, if both are true that's been
better

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:23.599
The output is definitely true. And there you have it!

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.550
Today we've taken a look at truth tables as
well as three gates.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.949
The NOT gate, the AND gate, and the OR gate.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.979
everything we've talked about today
will serve as the

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.210
broad foundation for basically the
rest of the series

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.800
now just to clarify, your AND gate and your OR gate

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.969
does not necessarily need to have two
inputs

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:48.499
they could have more than two inputs.
Obviously they cannot have one because

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:52.259
you know, a comparison needs to happen. If
you have more inputs

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.319
the same kind of thinking process still applies.

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:59.860
For an AND gate, all the inputs have to be true
before the output is actually true

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.960
Whereas for an OR gate, all we need is one input to be true

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.189
for the output to be true, however many
inputs

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:11.339
go into each gate. Well that basically
wraps it up for this episode

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:14.599
Thank you very much for watching. I hope you
learned something, but until next

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:15.120
time

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.419
