00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.360
The bed is the platform on which your 3D printer prints

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.490
It is important that the surface is level
in relation to the extruder nozzle.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.220
A level bed is crucial in getting
consistent quality prints.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.660
Depending on your 3D printer model you
may have a heated bed

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.170
as the name suggests a heated bed is
hot so please use

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.010
care and caution when leveling a heated bed.  The nozzle should be

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.739
on when performing this procedure but
the filament should be removed.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.180
the bed has 3 leveling screws or
locations

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.870
location one

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
location two

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.970
and location three.  Position the nozzle over anyone of the three

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.970
bed leveling screws.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.720
The best way to determine the gap is to
visually see if the nozzle strikes the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.180
bed

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.180
when you press the Z-home button.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.410
If the nozzle strikes the bed that means there is no gap
between the nozzle tip in the build

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.340
Platform.  If you see a gap
between

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.550
the nozzle and the bed then the gap is too large.  Adjust the spring-loaded screw

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.550
with the wing nut to level the bed.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.380
Raise and home the Z-axis

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.990
and repeat until you have

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.380
nozzle level at this position. With the bed level to the first leveling position

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.620
raise the nozzle up 10mm

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:02.620
and move the bed to the second bed leveling position.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.219
now repeat the same procedure for the
second position

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.350
with the bed now level at the second
position

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.300
again raise the nozzle up ten millimeters

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.230
and move the nozzle to the third and
final bed leveling position

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.290
Press Z-home and repeat.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.540
carefully turn the wing until the
nozzle just barely touches the

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.470
now raise up to Z -axis ten millimeters

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.459
and repeat the entire procedure again for
all three positions

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.730
this is necessary because when you adjust
one

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.300
bed leveling position it
changes the level of the other two

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.569
positions.  With the nozzle in the center of
the bed, presis the Z-home button

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.470
the procedure to adjust the first layer
gap is the same as

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.520
leveling the bed but instead of adjusting the
bed leveling screws

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.630
you adjust the z-axis limits switch screw.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.880
On this particular model it is located on
the right hand side

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.880
on the nut trap block.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.400
so raise and lower the nozzle

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.400
on the center of the bed and  adjust that screw until the nozzle just barely touches the bed.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.570
Congratulations, if you have followed the
procedure correctly your build

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.030
platform is now level

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.590
and your first layer gap is set.  Please
keep in mind that this is not a one-time

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.380
event.   Leveling the bed should be done
periodically . You should level

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.250
anytime you remove the build plate, butmp the build plate out of position

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.770
or if you're having trouble parts sticking.
If you notice the first layers

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.380
are uniform or uneven then it's time to level
your bed.
