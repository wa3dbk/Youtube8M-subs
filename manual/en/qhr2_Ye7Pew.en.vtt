"Honey"

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.000
I know I've changed

00:00:13.902 --> 00:00:19.968
And I swear I'm better now

00:00:20.668 --> 00:00:22.705
Honey why don't you

00:00:22.705 --> 00:00:27.765
Honey why don't you love

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:29.517
Honey why don't you

00:00:29.517 --> 00:00:34.333
Honey why don't you love me

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:40.083
I'm holding on to everything we had

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:47.585
But nothing's ever gonna bring you back

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.400
I know you've changed

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.923
But I don't know how

00:01:15.923 --> 00:01:21.697
I beg for a love that's never gonna work

00:01:21.697 --> 00:01:25.382
Cause all my work just leads to nothing

00:01:25.382 --> 00:01:29.634
And nothing really matters baby

00:01:29.634 --> 00:01:31.198
Honey why don't you

00:01:31.198 --> 00:01:36.387
Honey why don't you love

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.009
Honey why don't you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.823
Honey why don't you love me

00:01:42.823 --> 00:01:49.261
I'm holding on to everything we had

00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:54.963
But nothing's ever gonna bring you back

00:01:54.963 --> 00:02:11.391
Oh

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:24.401
Nothing's ever gonna bring you back

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:32.339
I am not mad I'm calming down, calming down, for you

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.845
Honey why don't you

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:44.967
Honey why don't you love

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:46.408
Honey why don't you

00:02:46.408 --> 00:02:51.907
Honey why don't you love me

00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:58.344
I'm holding on to everything we had

00:02:58.344 --> 00:03:05.536
But nothing's ever gonna bring you back

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:07.348
Honey why don't you

00:03:07.348 --> 00:03:11.662
Honey why don't you love
