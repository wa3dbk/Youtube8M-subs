00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.640
Hello? World? Did you get the memo? We’re
starting now!

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.350
[intro music]

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:15.079
Hey guys what’s up? It’s LDShadowLady
here, and welcome the first episode of a new

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:16.400
series I am starting.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.080
Yes, it’s a Minecraft single player series,
you will notice there are a few mods in this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
game,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.189
And as you can see I obviously have Mo’
Creatures installed for the mo

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.029
Mo frikin’ cute creatures! That are just
buzzing around, like this little guy.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.930
OMG he’s just going in circles! He must
just be excited like me!

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.870
I also have the Extra Biomes mod,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.090
Which is going to add some really cool biomes
for me to explore.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.989
I am currently running the Shaders mod, oh,
fell in some water there!

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.670
Which makes my Minecraft look so pretty!

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.470
Isn’t everything so shadowy and fantastic?

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:57.739
Ooh! I also added the Smart Moving mod, which
allows me to… [laughs] fall!

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.710
What else did I add Mr. Bear?

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.530
Ok, ok, ok, I see you there. I see… Oh!
You fell in a hole!

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.290
You… You… ahhh he can probably get out
of there.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.250
Ohhh you are so beautiful!

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.250
[gasps]

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.860
Oh no! What was that noise? That sounded like…

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.290
Ok, I don’t care about you right now Mr.
Polarbear, but I swear to my

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.900
Dear Lord Jesus, praise the Genie that I can
hear and ogre.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.390
Ok, maybe I’m just imagining things.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.400
Bap beep bop be doo!

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.400
[gasps]

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.055
I saw that! I saw you do that!

00:01:38.055 --> 00:01:42.420
I also added a mod called Harvest Craft…
Goddamn dude!

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.690
I’m trying to do something right here!

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.150
Harvest Craft is a mod that adds a load of
food items to the game,

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.890
So I can make a various plethora of different
foods like:

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.140
Nachos, burgers, french fries, and banana
nut-bread… I’m pretty sure that’s actually

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.140
in there.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.790
So in this first episode, I’m just going
to have a wander around,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.420
And find somewhere nice to build.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.560
Admire the scenery, take it in.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.180
[sniffs twice]

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.180
Sniff it.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.569
Oh! What have we found here? We found turkey
island!

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.590
No but seriously what is this?

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.109
[makes turkey noises]

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.340
That looks like it could be a swamp over there.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.689
Don’t like swamps. Full of crocodiles.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:25.689
[gasps]

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.180
Oh I see one! Here they are!

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.569
WOAH! I just wanted to see the baby! Ok now,
we just run away.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.360
I’m just going to jump over that huge snake
there.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.469
Ok. Let’s just keep exploring.

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.040
Away from the crocodiles/alligators!

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.450
Oh! This is the savannah! Theres bears. Interesting.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.049
So cute! Can I? Nope.

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.319
This place is nice! There’s some flowers
here!

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.360
And loads of this stuff. I must find out what
this is.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.959
Oh yeah. Quicksand! Oh no.

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.959
[gasps]

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.299
I wonder if I stand in it… Oh god dude!

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.450
I am the biggest idiot in the world.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.220
Why did I? Why did I?

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.239
Remind me never the stand in this stuff again!

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.239
[gasps]

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.390
IT’S A BLUE TREE! I must build near the
blue tree!

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.790
It reminds me of the mother tree from ChaosVille!

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.269
So perfect! But when you get up close it looks
a bit weird.

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.670
We can just stay far away.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.200
This place is beautiful! It has a few trees,
lots of flowers, a lot of animals, a lot of

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200
feathers.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.379
Ooh an elephant over there? I mean who doesn’t
want an elephant in their backyard?

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:55.279
That’s an ass. I see an ass! I see you baby!

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.569
Shakin’ dat ass.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.859
Shakin’ dat ass.

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.150
Shake that ass.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.300
Ooh. It’s a bit mountainous here. Rather
mountainous.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:13.040
Goats. Ooh goat mountain goats! Their mountain
goats!

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.660
I think 
I want to build near here!

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.510
I really like this place. I really like this
flowery plain.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.950
And the grass that lies within it. I really
like this place.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.220
Ooh! It’s like a post box! Envelope box!

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.600
Where do you put the mail? Letter box!

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.030
It’s cool though. I like it! Blue tree up
there. This is a nice place.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.030
That could be my secret bat-cave.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.360
I’ll think about it. You know what? I will
set a Mini-Map marker.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.990
Yep, there we go. Ok, remembered forever.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:05.950
Ahh! OMG please tell me I’m… swimming!
I’M SWIMMING!

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.570
I can’t do this IRL, but I can do it in
this game!

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.510
What is that? What… A mushroom.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.140
As the day draws to a close, so does this
episode, actually!

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.410
I still don’t know where to build my house,
but I think this is the perfect place.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.560
So what do you guys think? Should I build
here?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.270
I don’t want to do anything unless you guys
are happy with it.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.080
So please leave a comment telling me if I
should build here.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.930
If not, tell me where you wan time to build.
Like, give me a clue guys!

00:05:38.930 --> 00:06:02.900
So I hope you enjoy this series, and make
sure to leave a like and a comment.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:03.900
Ok, bye!

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.902
