00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.430
In January, the World Economic Forum announced
that the global water crisis was the world’s

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.540
biggest risk in terms of societal impact.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.140
Every year, nearly a million people die from
waterborne diseases from unsafe water.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.660
At the same time, large parts of the world
are experiencing unprecedented drought, making

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.890
clean water a scarce resource.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.060
So is water a human right, and should it be
available to all?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.099
Well, on the one hand, clean water is a vital
resource that everybody needs.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.279
Yet, one in nine people around the world lives
without access to clean water, mostly in rural

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:31.970
communities.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.840
In 2010, United Nations Secretary-General
Ban Ki-moon said, “More people die from

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.790
unsafe water than from all forms of violence,
including war.”

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.850
That same year, the UN recognized the right
to clean and safe drinking water as a basic

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.269
human right.

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:49.790
One of the strongest factors for this classification
was the fact that access to water is necessary

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.230
to fulfill nearly all existing human rights.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.620
The UN called on the international community
to help provide “safe, clean, accessible

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.019
and affordable drinking water and sanitation
for all”.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.890
Part of the reason for such a deadly lack
of water is that while it covers over 70%

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.130
of the Earth’s surface, only about 2.5%
of it is drinkable fresh water, and most of

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.700
that water is frozen and inaccessible.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.270
As a result, water is actually a pretty scarce
commodity, and expensive to distribute.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.659
Many developing countries, especially in places
like Sub-Saharan Africa, have struggled to

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.380
finance the infrastructure necessary to deliver
clean water.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.860
Some have argued for the privatization of
water in order to cover the costs that the

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.100
government cannot.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.770
However, in countries like Bolivia, privatizing
water has led to less access, higher water

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.770
waste, and higher prices.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.770
In one Pakistani village, a company was accused
of extracted all of their well water in order

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.850
to make expensive bottled water, leaving residents
with limited access to any water at all.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.719
So is water a human right?

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.060
Most scientists and governments agree that
it is.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.369
However, the question of who is responsible
for ensuring that human right is available

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.610
to everyone is unclear.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.480
Politics aside, the devastating drought in
California is going to have a major effect

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.920
on the rest of the world.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:02.110
