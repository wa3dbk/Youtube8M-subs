00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.660
My name's Zenab Ahmed and I'm studying
second year Pharmacy at the moment.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.440
Well Pharmacy's a four year course as you probably know.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.509
There's a lot of things that are...different ways you can get assessed,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.100
in the pharmacy course and stuff. You have lectures, workshops, essays and stuff like that.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.080
The pharmacy group as a whole is a really nice community

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.069
so it makes it really enjoyable as a course, I'd say.

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.000
The social life at Aston is really alive, I'd say.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.539
There's loads of things you can do. I'm
involved in a lot of the stuff, like

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.500
student ambassador, pharmacy society, the Islamic society

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Because I'm from Halifax, I had to move down to Birmingham and it was quite a big move for me, it was whole new city

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.410
and I... I found that Birmingham was very multicultural and there was a lot of

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.100
different people that I met.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.800
One of the best things about Aston is that it's really close to the city centre so

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.100
so you can go to the city, you can go to town, come back, go to lectures and stuff.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.789
Living on campus was probably one of the
best things I've ever done. It taught me to be independent

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.739
taught me to be more social, meet new
people

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.950
it developed a whole range of skills just generally. You have to get up

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.580
by yourself in the morning, no mum to wake you up,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.619
you have to cook, clean etcetera, do your own laundry

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.900
believe it or not, so I think that's
helped me develop as an individual a lot.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.190
One major thing about Aston is that when we
first came, they put us into flats where we'd...

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.010
...with loads of different people from

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.439
different cultures, and that helped me quite a lot, One of my best friends now

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.669
was actually my flatmate from my first year so

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:37.130
I think the way they put people
together is really, really good.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.760
I'd recommend this experience to everyone.
It thrives in the research culture and stuff.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.300
One of our lecturers is actually a research specialist and stuff

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.220
so it's quite good to...being able to...being taught by

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.479
someone that knows everything first hand.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.549
At the moment, Aston University is looking into this drug called Metformin

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.320
for research and stuff, for diabetes, so as you can tell,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.200
that's a prime example of how research is quite important.
One of the main reasons why I studied...

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.909
chose to study at Aston was because it's got high employability rates.

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:14.300
They give you a lot of ways that you can 
develop your skills. For instance, in the first year

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.810
of my course, we have developing

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.400
communication skills, and stuff like that,
which is quite important in the working world.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.939
We also have a lot of contacts with really prestigious employers.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.629
For my course, they've got really good contacts with Boots, Lloyds and Sainsburys

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.049
which are really good to be able to work in there.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.059
The support at Aston University is really good. We have The Hub -

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:40.500
it's really good for financial support,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.880
we have the guild, which is really good for emotional support and generally

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.710
helps you get part-time jobs and
stuff like that.
