00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.569
In this clip we are going to talk about the
features of a sea kayak. Those long skinny

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.790
boats that really started it all. As you can
see on this boat the handle instead of being

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.930
on the top, is underneath. That way it's a
grab-point for swimmers. It's got longitudinal

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.900
deck lines, again grab-points, not only for
swimmers, but managing the boat up on the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.730
roof of your car, up a sea wall, steep shoreline,
what have you. This particular boat has a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.110
compass recess here so typically we would
have a compass here to help guide us. We have

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:49.180
deck bungees here and here and these deck
bungees are to hold spare paddles. Huge, huge

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.860
storage compartment on the bow, again flotation,
really robust hatch covers built to take a

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.940
beating, built to be immersed a lot. So, if
he wants to go out and roll his boat all afternoon,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.340
this is going to stay dry in here. Again we
have deck bungees on the bow. So, you've got

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.609
storage under here. Typically it would be
the chart room. So, it would have charts here.

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:21.759
Smaller cockpit, very form-fitting, easy to
put a skirt on quickly and then on the side

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:30.179
here, this is a skeg control. So, we'll get
to the skeg in a minute. It's basically a

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.119
fin that drops down out of the stern to help
you track straight in the wind. If he wanted

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.399
to engage it, he would slide this back and
then to disengage it, slide it forward. The

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.139
thigh braces, and on these type boats, you're
not sitting in them so much like a recreational

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:50.990
boat. They're a little snugger fit. So, when
he lifts his leg the boat responds. These

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.619
boats are much more responsive than anything
else that we've looked at today. And that's

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.689
what you want in this type boat. So right
behind Ron, you will see the small round,

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.240
what we call a day hatch. And that's a hatch
that he can access while he's on the water

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.959
paddling. So, if he needs spare water, spare
food, spare clothing, what have you, he can

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.579
store in there and access it himself without
having someone else come up and have to pull

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.000
it out for him. Again, another large storage
compartment on the stern, you'll see the longitudinal

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.540
deck lines go out all the way to the stern
with another grab point just under the stern

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.780
of the boat. So, it makes it really easy for
him to tow a swimmer in, or if he wants to

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.540
get out and swim around holding on to his
boat, it's an easy thing for him to do.
