00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.300
If you're thinking of pursuing a career in public health

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.833
as a manager, as a leader, as an advocate, as an

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:24.833
influencer, rather than an academic researcher, then this is the programme for you.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:29.000
The DrPH is a professional doctorate, which is intended for leaders or future leaders in public health.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.500
So within the research degrees programme at the London School, we've been offering the DrPH 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:44.000
as an alternative to the PhD since 1996. Over the last 10 or 20 years or so, there's been a big expansion

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.980
of DrPH programmes around the world, and there are now quite a few institutions which offer

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.200
a DrPH programme. And so we're at a stage now where the DrPH is a widely 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.840
recognised degree, and as a doctorate, it is on a par with a PhD.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:02.773
So I decided to come to the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine because it is

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.120
one of the most prestigious public health schools in the world.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.220
This School has the biggest scope and the biggest remit 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.520
and looks at all countries. And it is of course a top-class institution, so I decided to go for the best.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.660
The DrPH is an ambitious programme, it's in three basic parts. First part is the Taught Component,

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.840
it lasts approximately 10 weeks and is based in London. 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.760
At the moment, we feel that it provides really the best experience, so it's the one part of the programme

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.680
when students are required to be in London to do face-to-face work.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.600
I'd say the School is a very inspiring place to be. The location of Bloomsbury is kind of the hub of 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.240
academia in London, so it's nice to be in the heart of that.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.780
The students on the DrPH programme come from every part of the world. So in any particular year

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.060
we might have a dozen new students from a dozen countries. 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.840
So I think for students, one of the attractions of the face-to-face element, is being over a 10 week

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.960
period with a small group of people who like you, are passionate about making a difference in public health.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.960
It's nice to be around people who have the same values and interests as you.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.040
I've met a ton of new friends from around the world who share the same perspective of me and I've made

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.420
some lifelong friendships. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.940
The great thing about the DrPH is that students who come to do the DrPH have extremely

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.194
diverse backgrounds, they come from all over the world. And they come from all sorts of different 

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:36.634
backgrounds in terms of professional careers.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.980
The second phase of the DrPH is the Organisational Policy Analysis (OPA).

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.520
And essentially what the student does in that second phase is they go and work in or with

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.980
a public health organisation of their choosing. We don't identify 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.480
the organisation for the student, but we help the student. When the student is there, they

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.640
maybe doing some work for the organisation, but they're also doing an analysis we hope of something

00:03:02.847 --> 00:03:06.727
the organisation is concerned about of the way in which the organisation is structured and organised 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.800
and managed and/or the way that it is pursuing its mission to influence public health policy in practice.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.920
It's a really great project in a sense that you use public health theories as well as organisational and business 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.240
management theories to really assess organisations. You gain experience in leadership, management and  

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.240
it is quite an applicable way to become a public health leader.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.840
In terms of my organisational policy analysis, I got allocated a position as a researcher at the

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.180
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It has been a great opportunity for me 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:50.160
because when I firstly arrive, I had previously a senior managing position and a preliminary interest in HDA.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.440
And now, days after conducting the OPA and producing a paper for the ministry of health of my country

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.434
actually I got appointed as CEO of the Health Technology Assessment Institute in Spanish-speaking America

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.160
so it was like a whole thing meant to be.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.720
After the OPA, the students move on to the third component of the DrPH

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.000
which is the largest component and that's the research thesis.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.800
Now the research thesis can be on any topic covered by the School which is public health relevant.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.920
If I were to give advice to prospective students, I would say "find an area in which you are interested

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.360
and use the School's website to find researchers who work in that area, do a bit of background work, 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.740
read their publications, see their topics of interest and then reach out to supervisors". 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.640
It's intimidating at first, but everyone is very friendly, 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.500
and if it's not them that will work with you, they can recommend somebody else quite easily.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.000
In terms of applying for DrPH, the process is very similar to that of a PhD. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.533
And essentially the key to success to those getting in the building is really to identify a suitable supervisor

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.360
who can backstop your research.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:09.800
Normally the supervisor is chosen as the person who's most likely to be able to be the principle support during the thesis phase

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.200
but obviously that supervisor is also available throughout the rest of the programme.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.480
And because it's a School-wide programme, there is a programme Director whose responsibility is to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.980
ensure that all the students right throughout the programme have appropriate support.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.400
I have a wonderful supervisor who I can't speak highly enough of. She's supportive and encouraging 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.160
and definitely some wonderful and brilliant people here at the School.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.920
I think the School is so interesting because you have the naive romanticism of trying to save the world

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.400
and the other hand, the realistic constraints of the economic crisis, of budget constraints or capacity.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.080
So it's all the time like trying to move between two worlds around the challenges on how to succeed and 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.920
producing incremental changes and improvements in public health, bearing in mind both those aspects.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.600
I think that for young people looking to gain leadership experience, the programme is very helpful in that sense.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:25.520
The ability to plan, the ability to analyse stakeholders, the ability to use strategies to move things forward,

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.400
the ability to become a policy entrepreneur, the ability to be a good leader, I would say

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.640
those are the ones I am taking back home.
