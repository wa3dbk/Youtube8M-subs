00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:13.750
Now the thing you have to watch out for the
sustain pedal is Mediterranean to each other

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:21.950
that is two of them running you don't want
that sound it is ugly. See the note is running

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:52.510
that is holding down the pedal to long time
it. See you can even do it fast like that

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:19.569
one was you foot, now hold it down. Okay this
next pedal which would be the middle pedal

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:26.359
is called the sostenuto pedal or bass sustain
like different pianos has different place

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:32.679
where it sustains. But what it allows you
to do is play a bass not and sustain that

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:39.279
note while you can play the top note without
the notes ringing together. This requires

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:43.779
you to use 2 pedals at once the first we would
show you how to use the bass sustain to show

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:49.770
you how it works. Now if I play it up here
see I'm playing middle C and holding the pedal

00:01:49.770 --> 00:02:03.859
down but it is not active but if I play if
I play listen. Okay on this piano it starts

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:12.790
at F so let's start at low C now the note
is sustaining now I'm going to do this see

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:28.290
there is no sustain on the upper note and
unless I go here the low one ringing.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:39.120
So we can go now that is how you use that
pedal.
