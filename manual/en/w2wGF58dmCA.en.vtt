Got a little taste
of the spotlight.

New York City, it was all right.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:23.275
43-8, it was our night.

00:00:23.275 --> 00:00:25.130
The #1 defense held tight.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.175
Boom, like a

We got our belt, no
discount double check.

00:00:36.808 --> 00:00:38.804
We know who is the best.

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:42.297
We know that we got a
target square on our backs.

00:00:42.297 --> 00:00:46.289
Every single other team coming

Back up in this thing.

00:00:49.782 --> 00:00:54.273
Your Seattle Seahawks are
bringing back another ring.

00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:57.766
Here we go, and you know,
how we gonna do this thing,

00:00:57.766 --> 00:01:01.589

We got hardware on our minds.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.620
We're gonna lift
that trophy high.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.220
We're gonna watch
12th banner fly.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.100
See the hunger in our eyes.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.062

They don't want to get dirty.

00:01:26.982 --> 00:01:28.966
Hard work got 'em
dropping like scurvy.

00:01:28.966 --> 00:01:31.847
They know the river of
beating when Thomas and Chancelor

00:01:31.847 --> 00:01:33.430
they come over the
middle to meet 'em.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.414
Oh, oh please don't hurt me.

00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:36.763
Gonna make 'em retire early.

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:38.638
These other NFL teams
are not worthy to stand

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:40.450
