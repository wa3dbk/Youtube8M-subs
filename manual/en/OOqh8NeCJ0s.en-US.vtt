00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.320
Carving pumpkins at Halloween is a fun way
to spend time with children,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.320
get creative, and make wonderful seasonal decorations for your home.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.040
Anyone can carve a pumpkin, and designs can range from simple scary faces

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.220
to more complicated and intricate designs.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.220
In this video we'll cover tips that make carving a Halloween pumpkin easy

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.080
and inspirational designs for the perfect Halloween pumpkin.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.980
First, choose your pumpkin.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.240
Bigger isn’t
necessarily better, as it will involve more work.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.660
Make sure
it’s in good condition with no damage or mold present,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.120
and that it’s the shape you
want.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.100
Lay down newspaper to protect your work surface as this will be a messy job!

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.540
Use a serrated knife to cut a hole in the
top of the pumpkin, using a sawing action.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.680
If your knife is long, be careful that it doesn't poke out the other side into your hand.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.300
Make sure the hole is big enough to comfortably
get your hand inside – 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.720
especially if you’re planning to put a candle or tea light inside.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.120
Cut at an angle down towards the centre, so the lid has a lip to sit on. 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.940
Then, cut across
the bottom of the lid to remove excess flesh and fibres.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.780
The next part is the most messy -

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.900
scooping out the seeds and fibres with your hands
or a spoon.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.920
Don’t discard the seeds – you can roast
them to make a tasty salted snack.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.620
It's easiest if you use a spoon to scrape out some of the flesh before carving.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.680
Leave
the walls about half an inch to an inch thick.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.760
Don’t just compost the flesh, as it can be used

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.440
to make pumpkin pie, soup, or curry.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.780
Now it’s time to think about your design.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.100
You might want to practice drawing different designs on paper until you find one you’re happy with.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.560
Sometimes the simplest designs are the most effective, and they’re easier to carve.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.660
Then it’s time to copy the design onto your
pumpkin.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.560
In case you make a mistake, it’s best to use a red marker 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.820
which won’t
show up when the pumpkin is lit up in the dark,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.060
or a dry-erase marker that can be
rubbed off. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.500
Once you’ve drawn your design onto your
pumpkin,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.580
it’s time to carefully saw along the lines with a serrated knife -

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.640
older
children can help, with supervision.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.000
Push the cut parts out from 
the inside.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.020
Drilling holes to start and end the cuts can be helpful,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.820
as it makes starting the cuts much easier, and prevents cutting too far.

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.320
Carefully place a candle or tealight inside
the finished pumpkin,

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.040
or if you’re concerned that your pumpkin might get jostled or knocked over,

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.280
for safety why not use electric lights instead? 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.700
You can use flashlights, LED lights
or solar lights,

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.740
or if your light source is mains powered, cut a hole in the bottom of the pumpkin

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.440
instead of the top so you can hide the cord.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.660
Finally, display your pumpkin for everyone
to see and to enjoy the spooky effect!

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.500
To create more complicated patterns, it’s
a good idea to draw a template onto paper

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.060
(or download one from the Internet).

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.419
Fix it to your pumpkin with tape, and then transfer the design

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:14.079
onto your pumpkin by poking holes along the
lines with a needle or pin.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.340
Connect the dots as you carve. 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.820
You can make any design you
like – graveyard scenes, haunted castles,

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.100
horror movie characters, spooky silhouettes…the
choice is limited only by your imagination and skill.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.960
To make it easier to carve complex patterns,
you can use an electric drill,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.640
wood carving tools, or you can buy special pumpkin carving kits.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.460
Or, instead of simply cutting out a design,
why not try decorating your pumpkin in other ways?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.900
You could turn the pumpkin on its side
to use the stem as a nose;

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.680
arrange the pumpkin innards so they’re spilling out of the pumpkin’s mouth;

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.140
make rotten teeth with wood chips;

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.060
wrap netting around it to look like a spider’s
web; or make wild hair with liquorice or straw.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.640
Once you’ve mastered pumpkin carving and
decorating,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.860
you might want to get serious about creating the best pumpkin in town.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.840
Etching your design into the skin of the pumpkin
is a great technique.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.580
Use a sharp craft knife to carefully cut away the skin to create your design. 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.880
Cut right through in the traditional way in some areas but less deeply in others,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.400
so that the amount of light filtering through from the candle or other light source within varies

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.800
and creates an interesting pattern of light and shade.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.720
If you want to create something really different,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.380
you can go a step further and sculpt a design into your pumpkin.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.080
To do this, first peel
off the skin where your design will be.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.240
Use a toothpick to scratch the outline of your
design into the pumpkin’s flesh,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.880
and then use carving tools to carve away the flesh
to reveal your sculpture.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.660
Or why not try carving something other than
a pumpkin?

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.980
In Scotland and Ireland, turnips were originally the carving vegetable of choice.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.880
