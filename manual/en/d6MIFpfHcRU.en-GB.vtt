00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.240
Here are half a dozen or so new novelties that I have come across very recently.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.639
None of them are really classified as toys but they are actually very functional 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.950
most of them, and very interesting too. Lovely designs.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.949
These two blocks of wood for instance, one black and one brown wood, are actually clocks,

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.429
and when they are tapped they display, one with green and one with red LEDS.

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:28.390
They show the time and then a short time later they show the temperature, and then,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.129
 silently, they switch off again.

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:39.679
And when they are switched off, the fronts look as if they are completely blank faces,

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:40.789
just like the other faces.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.429
In fact the LEDs are hidden behind the blank face. But it is done so well that what looks

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.100
like a block of wood becomes suddenly a useful clock.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.739
Very nice idea. They are acoustic, and they
are quite sensitive, 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.199
so if you tap them or even just talk,

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.030
and they will perform, and come on again. I like these very much.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.350
Another item which I have other examples of,
but this is a really nice example, 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.500
is a staple-less stapler.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.170
The idea is you have a few pieces of paper which you want to join together.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.520
You put them in the jaws of the stapler - and
there are no staples at all in here - 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.180
and when you squeeze hard,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.490
you find you are left with an extraordinary arrangement with a little, 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.280
well it looks like an arrow that has been cut through the pages,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.910
and tucked underneath, and it holds several sheets of paper together quite nicely.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.610
And there is no swarf or any other little bits left over at the end. So very neat.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.610
So, a staple-less stapler, and a nice new version. This is quite a small one, 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.020
so very suitable for children.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.130
Another item which is really meant for campers outdoors - I like this very much.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.160
It is a lit up tent peg. To light it up you take out the battery protector, 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.080
and then turn it on.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.140
There is quite a bright light, and now I pop it back in again.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.880
Now this is much too delicate to bang into the ground.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.130
So what you do is to bang in a normal tent peg into the ground first, 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.880
take it out, and then insert this one in instead.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.580
And then it will show passers by at night time where the tent pegs 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.369
and the guy ropes are. A very sensible idea.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.110
Next, two food items I came across recently.
The first is a bit of a 5 second wonder, 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.040
but it is a bit of fun.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.230
It is a spread to put on your bread with jam, and it is called Middle Aged Spread - 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.100
which I have got plenty of!

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.530
But it is a nice name, and although I have not yet tried it, my guess is that this is

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.690
a good product since it is sold by a reputable company,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.920
so I expect it will be delicious to taste! I like that idea.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.890
This extraordinary item is actually something very well known indeed. It is a pepper grinder.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.950
You can either put peppercorns in there or rock salt.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.670
And this is really meant for people who are a bit arthritic. 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.950
They cannot hold and twist a normal pepper grinder.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.920
This one you do not hold and twist, you rub your hands together like that.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.540
And as you do so, the pepper starts coming out at the bottom.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.010
The young man who showed me the invention was very pleased

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.940
because a disabled lady who had lost one of her hands was able to use it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.709
between her remaining hand and her arm, and it still worked well.

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.150
Very sensible, and a very nice thing to have, especially for people who are arthritic 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.850
or maybe have some other handicap.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.170
A party item, which will be sent through the post in an envelope.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.209
And when the person receives it, this is what they do...

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.920
you take out the tube...

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.920
blow it up...

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.040
this is a non-return valve of course...

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.230
tuck this in nice and neatly...

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.230
and then put it on the table, and you have a very nice, cheerful greeting, 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.860
for a birthday party or whatever the celebration is.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.040
What a nice idea. A party balloon.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.390
And the final item which I got recently is this little bit of fun,

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.290
which is a woodland scene, a diorama it is called.

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.509
It is battery operated, and the idea is that there are little animals which are very shy

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:18.389
and they will only come out when it is very quiet.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:24.729
It takes a minute or so. And then the animals slowly emerge from behind the trees,

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:31.729
but the slightest movement - there is a little motion sensor at the front - 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.349
makes the animals disappear again.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.649
So we have a deer appearing, and a hawk, 

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:44.330
and a rabbit is going to emerge from under the rock,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:50.669
and a squirrel in the far corner, and a fox.

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:51.419
But they are ever so nervous.

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.419
And the slightest movement and ... they have disappeared again!

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.199
And they will do it again. They will reappear after about 10 seconds,

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.080
but whenever there is the slightest motion, they vanish so quickly.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.379
Here they come again...

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:22.379
so they emerge very, very slowly, from behind the bushes and trees, 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.889
but the vanishing speed is amazing, very quick!

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.129
Some nice little items then, from recent trade fairs.
