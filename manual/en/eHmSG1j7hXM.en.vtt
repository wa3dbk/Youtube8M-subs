00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.730
How to Create a Zoetrope.

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.730
For a fun novelty project, try making a zoetrope
at home.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.730
You will need A plastic coffee can lid A strip
of white paper 20&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot; tall A

00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:16.112
A pencil A ruler A plastic coffee can lid
A strip of white paper 20&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot;

00:00:16.112 --> 00:00:17.112
tall A strip of black paper 20&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;
tall Glue, rubber cement or tape A craft knife

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:18.112
A pencil A ruler A plastic coffee can lid
A strip of white paper 20&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot;

00:00:18.112 --> 00:00:19.112
tall A strip of black paper 20&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;
tall Glue, rubber cement or tape A craft knife

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:20.112
A pencil A ruler A plastic coffee can lid
A strip of white paper 20&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot;

00:00:20.112 --> 00:00:21.112
tall A strip of black paper 20&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;
tall Glue, rubber cement or tape A craft knife

00:00:21.112 --> 00:00:22.112
A pencil A ruler A plastic coffee can lid
A strip of white paper 20&amp;quot; x 1.5&amp;quot;

00:00:22.112 --> 00:00:23.112
tall A strip of black paper 20&amp;quot; x 3&amp;quot;
tall Glue, rubber cement or tape A craft knife

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:24.112
A pencil and a ruler.

00:00:24.112 --> 00:00:25.112
Step 1.

00:00:25.112 --> 00:00:26.112
Plan out your animation.

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.019
Assume there will be about 12 cells, or steps.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.480
The best animations for a zoetrope are cyclical,
like a man walking, or a sun rising and setting.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.480
Step 2.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.559
Place the can lid flat side down.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:39.559
Step 3.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.940
Gently roll the white paper into a tube and
place it into the lid, so that the rim of

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.579
the lid supports the tube of paper.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.469
You will have a drum with an open end and
the lid as the bottom.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:49.469
Step 4.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.180
Use the pencil to lightly mark where the inside
edge overlaps the inside of the white paper.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.180
Step 5.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.420
Lay the white paper flat and measure the distance
from the inside edge of the sheet to the mark.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.289
This will be the longer distance to the mark
you made.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:04.670
Step 6.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.750
Divide the distance by 12 — or the number
of steps in your animation — and mark a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.760
light line at the bottom edge of the paper
to divide each cell.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.760
Step 7.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.010
Sketch out your animation, beginning at the
left cell and moving right along each cell.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.010
Step 8.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.820
Gently re-roll the white sheet and place it
back into the lid to make sure all of your

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.710
cells will be shown.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.710
Step 9.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.480
Place the black paper flat with the white
paper on top and flush along the long edge.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.560
Make sure the light lines you made in Step
6 run along the middle of the black sheet.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.560
Step 10.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.200
Use the edge of the white paper to draw a
line down the length of the black paper.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.060
It will run down the middle.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.060
Step 11.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.690
Continue the marks you made on the white sheet
onto the black sheet.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.900
They should intersect the long line you made
in Step 9.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.380
Step 12.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.620
Move the white sheet to 1/8" inside of the
opposite edge of the black sheet.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.990
Step 13.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.360
Extend the lines again from the white sheet
to the edge of the black sheet.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.410
Remove the white sheet.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.950
The sets of small lines you copied on to the
black sheet should line up all the way down

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.140
the black sheet.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.940
Step 14.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.909
Use the ruler and pencil to connect the sets
of marks you made on the black sheet.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:15.290
Step 15.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.239
Using the lines you made in Step 13 as guides,
cut windows out of the black sheet with craft

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.239
knife.

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.830
The windows should start in the middle, run
about 1" down the line and be about 1/8" wide.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.830
Step 16.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.120
Carefully find the center of the lid and cut
a 3/8"-wide X in the top.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.180
Step 17.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.610
Run a light bead of glue along the inside
edge of the lid's lip.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.610
Step 18.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.110
Gently roll the black sheet and place it in
the lid so that the slits are furthest away

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.519
from the lid.

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.519
Step 19.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.950
Gently press the black paper out against the
lid's lip so that it bonds to the glue on

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.969
the lid.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.540
Set aside to dry.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.540
Step 20.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.620
Poke the pencil down through the X you had
cut so that it sticks out the bottom.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.879
The brass eraser holder should snag on the
cut edges of the lid’s X. Step 21.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.120
Gently roll the white sheet and place it inside
the drum so the bottom of the animation rests

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.889
on the lid.

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:07.889
Step 22.

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.400
Clasp the pencil between your palms and slowly
rotate the drum while looking through windows

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.640
from the outside in to the opposite side of
the drum.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640
Step 23.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.670
Watch your animation in glorious Zoetrope
vision.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.560
Did you know A convection-powered version
of the zoetrope was built around 180 A.D.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.610
by the Chinese inventor Ting Huan.
