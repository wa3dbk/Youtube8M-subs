00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey everyone.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.370
Welcome back to Keep Calm and Bake.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:09.130
I'm Caroline; I do a Youtube cooking show,
and this week's recipe is going to be how

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.000
to make jammie dodgers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.289
Who's a jammie dodger?

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.590
We're going to make the biscuit dough now.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.200
And there are a few ingredients, but don't
worry, we've written them all in the description

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.320
box for you.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:41.180
Add your flour, ground almonds, icing sugar,
next the butter, bit of vanilla.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.010
Pulse all those bits together first, and then
you can add your egg yolk in.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.320
Pulse until you just see it's just coming
together.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.989
Now, you can take all the dough out now, and
just push it into a ball with your hands.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.890
It's very soft at the moment, so I'm going
to wrap this in cling film and leave it for

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.469
an hour in the fridge.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.159
Now, I really want to know who named these
biscuits jammie dodgers, because that really

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.640
is a good name.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.240
Okay, so in the fridge, a good hour.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.340
It's going to help it firm up.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.650
Dough is chilled and now ready to roll.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.700
Yay!

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.500
So to make your dough, put your dough in a
floured surface and cut it in half.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.689
Put one half to one side.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.250
Now roll that piece of dough out to about
three millimeters thickness.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.890
So you don't want this to be too thick.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.730
Get your cutter, and start cutting as many
circles as you can.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.250
All shapes, they can be any shapes you want.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.930
Once you've cut them out you can just pop
them onto a lightely floured baking tray.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.950
Once you've cut out the circles in the second
piece of dough, don't forget the hole.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.010
So you need to put a hole in the middle of
the biscuit, and I'm actually using the nozzle

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.420
of an icing tube, a nice big fat one.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.920
If you can find a heart shaped one that would
be amazing.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.080
Now you need to basically just make the hole
because it wont be a jammie dodger without

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
it.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.470
Cut that bit out.Try to get it in the middle.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.290
It takes focus.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.680
Now you have to transfer them carefully onto
your baking tray.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.710
Be very delicate when you put them on.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.989
It needs a gentle touch.

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.210

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.300
So you keep going.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.709
Make sure you've got the same number of tops
and bottoms.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.180
We're going to do even numbers.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.300
These go into the oven for ten minutes, ten
to twelve.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.959
Just until you see they're lightly golden
one top

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.030
I've taken the biscuits out of the oven and
left them to cool down completely.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.920
Now for the fun part, we can start assembling
them together.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.690
First up, I'm actually going to sprinkle icing
sugar.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.790
Dust the ones with holes in with icing sugar
first.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.280
Now, you've got to do this bit first before
you put the jam in.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.190
So I've got a little sieve.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.180
Just give them a good generous coating.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:43.590
Woah, maybe not too generous.There you go,
a little dusting, there you go.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.970
Next bit, get the biscuit without the hole,
and we're going to spread about a teaspoon

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.170
of jam right in the middle.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.520
I want to spread it all the way to the edges
as well.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.410
You can use raspberry jam, strawberry jam,
or even, go crazy, maybe pineapple.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:12.900
Then you get your biscuit with the hole in
and fit it nicely on top.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.019
And push it down a little bit so the jam oozes
up the top.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.709
And that is your jammie dodger.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.060
Ooo, Very nice.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.000
