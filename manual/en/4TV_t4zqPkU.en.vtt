00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.379
I was starving actor for thirteen-point-
five years.

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.630
I know what it is to have talent, have passion,

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.309
have a dream, and have no one believe in you.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.870
Here's how Winners Talent works: you
stay here rent-free,

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.400
I act as your manager, earn twenty percent
on the jobs you book.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.220
You get my representation, my coaching, and
most importantly,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.699
a creatively nurturing place to stay
surrounded by others with big dreams,

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.430
like you.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.460
I'm peeing with the door open!

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.420
Ah ah ah! Sit! Sit! Stay. Good boy.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.610
You really are a horrible manager.
- You're a horrible manager!

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.990
I'm a casting director.
- Look, honey I don't wanna be rude, but

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.420
these look like they were taken in your
back yard.
- Oh, they were!

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.509
Well, its manager's back yard, actually,

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:25.000
but, I live with him.
- This is more uncomfortable than wearing sandals at a urinal.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.810
...you've probably heard that one before.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.600
 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.860
House rule number one?
- Uh, "zero negativity".

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.130
EH! Wrong!
- I mean is it really that bad?
- It's like "Bigfoot on his period" bad.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.950
(LOUD LAUGHTER)

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.250
Were you using my iPad on the toilet?
- You're breaking up with me because you're pitchy?

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.819
 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.340
Is C3PO the new Django?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.340
Honey, I havent been put on hold since the Heat won a championship.
...Well aren't we

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.869
a bunch of sports fans?
- I'm home alone!

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.190
I guess it's true what they say you
really can't rise to the top until ya hit

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.910
rock bottom.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.300
There's a mandatory

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.160
tip, sir.
- Speaking of shitty, I just had a son.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.600
Goodnight.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.300
- Hey, is there a guest house?

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.640
 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.400
