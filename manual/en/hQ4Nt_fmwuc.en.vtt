00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.649
hi I'm Sophie and welcome to my world
today we're going to go fly a kite but

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.969
to do so first thing we're going to need
to do is make a kite and to make a kite

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.890
all we need is a couple simple things
we're going to start with a brown paper

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.550
bag
just your average lunch bag we're going

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:28.349
to need a pair of scissors a popsicle
stick glue stick or tape hole punch some

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.230
yarn some magic markers and if you like
for a little bit of flair some paper

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.960
ribbon or some regular ribbon that's
going to give it that feel now first

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.020
thing I'm going to do is I'm just gonna
take some magic markers and I'm going to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.570
decorate my bag and I can decorate this
any way I want easy I've got a couple

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
done that are already made here you can
see I had a lot of fun and made some

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
hearts and swirlies now once that's all
done once it's all decorated what I'm

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.010
going to do next is open my bag up now
I'm going to take my finger and I'm

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.880
going to push it into the center kind of
make like a little peak I'm gonna fold

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.119
that just crease it and now I'm going to
take my paper punch what I'm going to do

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:24.990
is just do half a punch right at that
fold there so that now you can see I

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.569
have a little hole now
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.560
take a piece of string now you can make
your yarn or string as long as you like

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.929
I'm just going to make mine short for
purposes of today I'm just going to cut

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.670
a little piece of string and what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to tie it

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.600
to my popsicle stick right in the middle
here now the reason I'm using a popsicle

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.509
stick instead of just making a knot and
putting that piece of string into my bag

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.020
with a knot is because this is going to
give it some extra added strength so

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.579
that it doesn't pull through the hole in
the top of my bag now I'm going to take

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.770
my string and I'm going to feed it
through

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.250
now you can see it's going to start to
pull up and in I want to make sure that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.650
my string isn't going to come off so I'm
just going to take a little piece of

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.959
tape before I pull it all the way in and
just tape that around let's make sure

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.550
that that stays secure and doesn't slide
off of my popsicle stick just like that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.200
okay there's my basic kite I can stop
right here if I want to it really will

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.720
fly beautifully without anything else on
it but to make it really pretty I'm

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.470
going to add some paper streamers now
you can cut these to any length I find

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.920
that you know about three feet is
great and I'm going to use my glue stick

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.670
here I'm just going to take the glue
stick and I'm going to rub it all over

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:02.000
the bottom here take my streamer place
it on the glue stick take another

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.989
streamer place it on the glue stick and
I think I can do one more streamer here

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.350
I'm going to add a little more extra
glue and then just glue that right there

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:32.360
now I've got some streamers on my
beautiful kite now what's amazing is if

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.200
you actually take this out into the wind
and you run with it it will actually get

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.519
some really good loft and it'll go
really high in the sky the longer that

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.780
your string is running with it is the
best way to make it go high so let me

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.170
show you a couple of these that we've
decorated in different ways I've got

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.150
this one here that has some beautiful
silk streamer ribbons on here and I've

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.150
actually used crayons and then over here
I've got a little wild and crazy' with

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.720
the magic marker but here's something
fun that I wanted to show you this one I

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.820
actually decorated with some photographs
of some friends of mine and some

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:13.730
stickers and you can see that even this
one without any streamers flies really

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.250
well so I'm going to challenge you to go
fly a kite

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.790
