Hi, I'm Brenda Thompson, registered dietitian
and owner of Life Skills Nutrition. In this

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.680
segment I'm going to talk about healthy snacks.
Planning ahead to avoid extreme hunger that

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.670
drives you to make poor choices is the best
way to snack healthfully. Place nutrient dense

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.990
foods in your office, car, and purse helps
you get through those times when you are hungry

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.920
and prevents you from making poor choices.
Select snacks that contain two food groups

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.309
helps you get a variety of food throughout
the day. Here is a plate of options which

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.159
is full of healthy snacks. Here we have some
pita chips with hummus. These are called ants

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.491
on a log which children love, but they're
also fun for adults and the children in all

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:51.459
of us. It has peanut butter and raisins, and
then here we just have some crunchy celery.

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:56.120
It actually takes more calories to chew celery
than you receive from the celery, so that's

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.539
an excellent snack. Here we have cheese. This
is some low fat mozzarella and then cheddar

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:09.280
cheese. This is really good too if you want
to add to a small whole wheat tortilla and

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.869
throw it in the microwave and melt it a little
bit, that's an excellent snack. These are

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.369
two choices of trail mix, this one has some
nuts, and seeds and dried fruit. This one

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.689
has a little bit of chocolate in there, so
that if you have a sweet tooth, that's a really

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.299
good way to go. However, you do want to watch
the amount that you're eating. This is about

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.249
two serving sizes. So a very small handful
is one serving size of trail mix. These are

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:41.320
some mini bananas, which are great. You can
unpeel them, put them in the freezer, maybe

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.619
put a little bit of peanut butter on top.
Again, here is some options of fruit, dried

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.009
fruits and nuts. These are dried cherries,
which are wonderful with walnuts. Peanuts

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.549
and raisins, which are a big hit with kids.
Pistachios are fun because they take you a

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.639
little bit longer to get into. So sometimes
when you just want something a little bit

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:07.319
crunchy, fresh fruit is always a great option.
And then we have some other assorted nuts

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:14.030
here on this side. One of my favorites is
combining carrots and tomatoes together. It's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.040
a really good, healthy snack and very low
calorie. With the carrots you can also make

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.480
a homemade, low fat, ranch dressing using
milk so you get some calcium there. So those

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.620
are some low fat options. Selecting some of
these low fat options will help you be successful

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.480
in losing weight and will keep you from eating
high sugary snack foods that often have a

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.590
lot of calories and very little nutrients.
