00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.799
Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house,

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.300
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.040
The stockings were hung on the chimney with care,

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.820
in hopes that Santa Paws,
soon would be there.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.660
The Huskies were nestled
all snug in their beds,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.620
while visions of snow falling
filled up their heads.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.440
Outside of their window
the moon shines so bright.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.180
What a perfectly beautiful
Christmas eve night.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.920
Then out on the lawn there,
arose such a clatter.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.860
They sprang from their beds and wooed,
"What was the matter?"

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.100
They raced to the window
and started to bark.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520
What could be seen
out there in the dark?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.440
The dog stopped their barking
and a silence fell.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.540
Then there was a noise,
a soft jingle bell.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.180
Outside stood a man,
who was dressed all in red.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.860
With him he brought
eight (8) dogs and a sled.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.940
The huskies were quickly
all filled with cheer

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.320
and in that moment they knew,
Santa Paws was here.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.200
With a 'Whoa' and a 'Haw'
and a 'Hike' and a 'Gee,'

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.220
he called out their names with,
oh so much glee.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.580
Now Tundra!  Now Spirit!
Now Kira and Balto.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.800
On Isis!  On Koda!
On Miko and Togo!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.520
To the top of the roof!
To the top of the wall!

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.380
Now, mush away!
Mush away!  Mush away all!

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.360
With some yipping and howling
and a few with a wolf,

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.380
the dogs mushed and bounded
right up onto the roof.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.500
Then faster than the huskies
in the house could believe,

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380
Santa Paws magically came,
right down the chimney.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.980
With a bundle of presents
to put under the tree,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.480
the three (3) huskies wondered,
"Oh, what could they be?"

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.390
Santa Paws turned and smiled
and then, wiggled his nose.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.340
And then in a flash
up the chimney he rose.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.220
He sprang to his sled
and gave his team a 'Hike!'

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.060
And away they all mushed
out into the night,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.600
But as they mushed into the dark,
what did the dogs heard?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.860
"Merry Christmas to all
and a Happy New Year!"
