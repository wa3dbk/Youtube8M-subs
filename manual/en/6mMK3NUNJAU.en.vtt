00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.190
It seems like everybody wants to lose weight,
and what is the best diet for weight loss?

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:17.190
It is really a diet that — seemingly a paradox
— is a diet that has the most fat. If you

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.490
want to lose weight, you eat more fat.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.830
And this isn't really that new. This dates
back to at least 2007 as published in the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.539
Journal of the American Medical Association.
Let's have a look.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.109
So this is the famous A to Z Study. It's a
12 month randomized trial of 311 overweight

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:42.670
or obese premenopausal non-diabetic women.
And again, published in the Journal of the

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.129
American Medical Association. They looked
at four different diets: the popular Atkins

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.639
Diet, which is really low carb, the traditional
American diet that we still hear recommendations

00:00:53.639 --> 00:01:00.639
for, which is a low-fat, high-carb diet. The
Ornish Plan, which is a very high carbohydrate

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.260
diet, and finally the Zone Diet, which is
somewhat of a low-carbohydrate diet. But for

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.219
our purposes in this video I'd like to just
compare the Atkins Diet and the Ornish Diet,

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.469
because they represent the extremes.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:20.469
Atkins Diet gets 44 percent of it's calories
from fat, as opposed to a much significant

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.259
reduction of carbohydrates down to 34 percent.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.609
And that's just exactly opposite, pretty much,
of what the Ornish plan recommends. As you

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.350
will recall the Ornish Diet is one that's
low in fat and high in carbs. So let's compare

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.170
the Atkins program to the Ornish program in
terms of what the Journal of the American

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.229
Medical Association has to say.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.439
Well the Atkins Diet gives you a lot more
saturated fat in terms of grams per day:

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.149
27 versus 17 for the Ornish Diet.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:57.149
Now the body mass index on the Atkins diet
went down by 1.65. That's a measurement basically

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.719
of how fat you are. On the Ornish Diet, not
anywhere near a significant reduction in comparison

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:06.439
to the Atkins Diet.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.430
The percentage body fat down by about 3 percent
eating more fat and half that amount on the

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.740
Ornish plan.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.450
Triglycerides, a powerful marker for risk
for heart disease, reduced by close to 30

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.730
points by eating more fat on the Atkins program,
and about half that on the Ornish program

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.280
that tells you to go on a low-fat diet.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.280
HDL, or good cholesterol, increases on the
Atkins Diet by about 5 points, no change on

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.820
the low-fat Ornish program.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.720
LDL, or so called bad cholesterol, goes down
on the Ornish program, for sure, and not much

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.970
change on the Atkins program.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.560
What about fasting glucose, which we know
is significantly related to risks for Alzheimers

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.730
Disease, down almost 2 points on the Atkins
program, and down by about less than one point

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.150
on Ornish.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.550
Blood pressure goes down significantly eating
more fat, and even the bottom number, the

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.910
diastolic, goes down significantly more eating
more fat on the Atkins program.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.910
And as you see here, the Atkins program is
a diet that favors much more fat and a significant

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.400
reduction in carbohydrates, in comparison
to what so called US experts recommend, which

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.990
is a diet that is much higher in carbohydrates.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.190
Published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, and this dates back to 2007,

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.620
the A to Z Trial clearly indicates that when
we increase our consumption of good fats,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.340
and dramatically reduce our consumption of
carbohydrates, a variety of cardiovascular

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:53.340
risk factors improve in favor of the high-fat
diet, and you'll even lose more weight.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:04:00.860
