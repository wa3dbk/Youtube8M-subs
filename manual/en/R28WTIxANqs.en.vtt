00:00:03.831 --> 00:00:05.411
- Hey, thanks for stopping into Heinen's.

00:00:05.411 --> 00:00:07.691
I'm chef Billy Parisi, and
I've got a great recipe

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:08.951
for the whole family.

00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:12.431
We're gonna make a delicious
pot roast with root vegetables.

00:00:12.431 --> 00:00:14.691
This is a really easy recipe to prepare,

00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:17.071
and the best part is
when it comes to cooking,

00:00:17.071 --> 00:00:19.150
you can pretty much forget about it.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.171
What we wanna do is slice
some baby red potatoes

00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:25.031
and Yukon potatoes right in half.

00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:28.461
We are gonna peel and slice some kohlrabi,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:32.662
sweet onion, turnips, parsnips,

00:00:32.662 --> 00:00:35.782
celeriac root, and carrots.

00:00:35.782 --> 00:00:37.142
All the vegetables are cut.

00:00:37.142 --> 00:00:38.862
The worst part is over.

00:00:38.862 --> 00:00:41.362
Let's move over to our chuck roast.

00:00:41.362 --> 00:00:44.462
We're gonna season all
sides with salt and pepper

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:48.062
and in a cast iron dutch
oven pot, on high heat,

00:00:48.062 --> 00:00:50.222
we're gonna hit it with
a little bit olive oil

00:00:50.222 --> 00:00:51.782
and we want to caramelize

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:55.042
this steak very, very well on all sides.

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:58.122
Once it is brown, we're
gonna remove it from the pot.

00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:00.342
We're next gonna place
all those vegetables

00:01:00.342 --> 00:01:02.482
that we just chopped right in there.

00:01:02.482 --> 00:01:04.662
You wanna get those nice and caramelized.

00:01:04.662 --> 00:01:06.502
Once they are brown, we're gonna

00:01:06.502 --> 00:01:08.053
put the steak back in there,

00:01:08.053 --> 00:01:10.633
We're gonna deglaze with just
a little bit of red wine.

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:13.733
We're gonna cook that until
it's pretty much gone.

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.373
We're gonna add in some
fresh rosemary leaves.

00:01:16.373 --> 00:01:19.513
Then we're gonna hit it with
a little bit of beef stock.

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:21.233
We're gonna season it
with salt and pepper.

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.483
Pop a lid on it.

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:24.533
It's going in the oven on 350 degrees.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:27.213
It's gonna take about
two, two and a half hours,

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:29.033
but remember, every 30 minutes,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.473
we have to come back and baste it.

00:01:31.473 --> 00:01:33.194
All right, it's been two hours,

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:36.773
and our pot roast smells
absolutely amazing.

00:01:36.773 --> 00:01:39.447
What we're gonna do is
remove the char grills.

00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:42.097
We're gonna slice it up
and plate up everything.

00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:44.237
This is comfort food at its finest

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:46.437
that the entire family can enjoy.

00:01:46.437 --> 00:01:48.897
It's absolutely loaded
with flavor and the meat,

00:01:48.897 --> 00:01:52.397
after braising for two hours,
is so juicy and so tender.

00:01:52.397 --> 00:01:54.157
You are gonna love it.

00:01:54.157 --> 00:01:56.737
