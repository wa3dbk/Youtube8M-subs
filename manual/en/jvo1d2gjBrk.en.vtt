&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: Art is so
powerful in a school community.

00:00:08.696 --> 00:00:12.046
It's a place where children can find
expression for their deepest emotions

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:15.936
or just the fun and silly ones, and
it's a quick, easy space for kids

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:17.976
to find a way to talk and
communicate with each other.

00:00:31.076 --> 00:00:33.046
&gt;&gt;At Glenview we partnered
with local community artists

00:00:33.046 --> 00:00:37.646
to support social-emotional learning,
communication, conflict resolution

00:00:37.646 --> 00:00:40.456
and to help students build
partnerships across boundaries.

00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:43.486
When we looked at our data we found

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:45.716
that we had challenges
with girl relationships.

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:48.126
A lot of our time was
being spent resolving them,

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:50.326
so we reached out to Allison
Kenny who brought us Girl Power

00:00:50.406 --> 00:00:51.976
to help solve all of our
girl-friendship issues.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:56.000
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: This
game is called "Yes!"

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:56.976
What's it called?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.976
&gt;&gt;Students: Yes!

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.536
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: Because in Go
Girls we practice saying "Yes!"

00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:04.096
to the things that are fun
and the things that we can do

00:01:04.566 --> 00:01:06.426
to feel good about ourselves.

00:01:06.536 --> 00:01:09.256
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: We found great
success with our Girl Power program

00:01:09.546 --> 00:01:10.986
so we expanded to Kid Power.

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.706
We brought it into the
classroom for every student,

00:01:13.756 --> 00:01:15.666
girls and boys, during
the school day.

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:17.866
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: This is what
our kid power can help us do.

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:21.326
Okay. Show me your trashcan.

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:24.536
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: The Kid Power
trashcan is a tangible way for kids

00:01:24.616 --> 00:01:27.906
to manage hurtful words and throw
them away to keep their hearts safe.

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:28.706
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: I love it.

00:01:29.116 --> 00:01:30.566
Okay, I'm just pretending.

00:01:30.636 --> 00:01:31.056
Here we go.

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.306
You're stupid.

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.976
Catch it, throw it away, hand
on your heart, say, "I am-- "

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:38.086
&gt;&gt;Student: I am so nice.

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:39.566
&gt;&gt;Allison Kenny: Give
him a round of applause.

00:01:46.046 --> 00:01:46.796
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk:
Communication skills are taught

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:48.356
through our Art Without
Judgment class.

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:50.536
It's taught byJahi ,
our resident artist,

00:01:50.536 --> 00:01:52.926
and it helps students
learn how to give feedback

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:55.656
in respectful ways to their peers.

00:01:55.656 --> 00:01:57.896
&gt;&gt;Jahi: Today we're gonna
work on our language.

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:01.516
And the language we want to work
on are "Wows" and "Wonders".

00:02:01.516 --> 00:02:04.906
&gt;&gt;Natalie Walchuk: Jahi's
students are thinking critically

00:02:04.906 --> 00:02:06.366
when they reflect on
each other's work.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:09.216
They offer an affirmation first
and then a critical question

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:09.976
to keep everyone digging deeper.

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.216
&gt;&gt;Student: I wonder why
Cameron crossed his out?

00:02:15.316 --> 00:02:16.476
&gt;&gt;Jahi: You know, I wonder that, too.

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:19.246
To make it a snowflake.

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:21.516
Michaela, here's my wow for you.

00:02:22.826 --> 00:02:26.796
Wow I like the frame of it
and I wonder who's that?

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.336
&gt;&gt;Student: I think
you did a good job.

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:30.926
&gt;&gt;Student: I think you did, too.
