00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.000
Maybe the principal would like to see what
you've been reading during class.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.100
I haven't seen you in here since last year, Red.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.000
If I remember correctly, you drew a picture
of Mr. Moore being eaten by a vampire.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.600
It wasn't a vampire; it was a zombie.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.080
Grandpa, I'm home.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.500
I'm leaving now, Grandpa.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
Hey! Get away from there!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.300
Why are you dressed like that?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.200
I'm a professional wrestler.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.800
Do you have what it takes to get in the cage
with the Rhode Island Strangler?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.200
Wrestling's stupid.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.700
What are you doing out here?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
You ever heard of the legend

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.500
 of the Lost Dutchman's Gold?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.500
Bunch of baloney.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Hey. Wake up.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.500
 I found something.
