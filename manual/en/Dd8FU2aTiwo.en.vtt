00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.940
Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. Lasagna is

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.010
definitely one of the most known and loved dishes on the planet but

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.819
it can get rather boring so I'm going to mix it up a little bit

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:17.819
So join me today as i make my version of lasagna cupcakes.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.859
I have a fry pan on the stove on a medium to high heat. 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.139
So to that add in one chopped up onion

00:00:31.139 --> 00:00:34.710
then some chopped up mushrooms 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.390
Then we are going to stir fry these for about a one minute

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.870
just until the onions start to soften up

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.210
It has been about a minute so to that add in our mince chicken

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.020
then just break it up

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.260
keep breaking it up and keep stirring it until all the chicken is cooked

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.960
all the way through 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.860
Now that the chicken is cooked all the way through we are going to add in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.240
two teaspoons of minced garlic

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.510
And then some pasta sauce and you can choose any that you like, im going to use 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.240
mushroom and tomato, just pour that right in

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.500
I have turned the heat down

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.120
to a low to medium heat

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.820
so mix this all through 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.670
Next add in one and a half teaspoons of dried oregano

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.330
and half a teaspoon  of dried basil 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.650
and mix it through 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.200
If you like add some salt and pepper to taste but me personally the herbs are enough

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.920
Next we are going to bring this to a simmer and let it simmer 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.040
for about ten minutes

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.880
Next we are going to use a muffin tray holder

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.120
Next grease it with some cooking spray oil

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.229
Next with our wonton wrappers place one wonton in each

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.040
muffin hole

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.900
Next place in some ricotta cheese

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.780
this is low fat ricotta cheese

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.620
If you can't find ricotta cheese where you're from at this end of this video will be a link

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.309
to a video i did earlier on how to make ricotta cheese

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.860
Next add some of the chicken mixture from the stove

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.949
grab that

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:21.099
and place it just inside there

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.019
and then sprinkle on some mozzarella cheese

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.799
Next on top of the mozzarella cheese place on another wonton

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:31.949
firmly push that down

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.519
Next place some more ricotta cheese

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.119
then some more of our chicken mixture

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.040
and finally some mozzarella cheese again

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.870
Next we are going to place this into a pre heated oven at one hundred and ninety degrease celsius

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.909
for about ten minutes just until the cheese is nicely melted. 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.259
And there we have it, our lovely

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:53.099
healthy

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.619
lasagna cupcakes

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:59.349
Now you don't have to stick to chicken you can use mince beef if you like as its

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.829
up to you on the type of meat you use

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.779
But by using these wonton wrappers 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.449
it really does help to make these cupcakes allot healthier 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:14.449
but enough of that lets give one a try

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:19.249
that is so good

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:20.339
its hot

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:21.759
but its so good

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:26.229
all i can say is wow they are that good they really are

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.709
I think that is a perfect combination it really does work

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.230
and those wonton wrappers are still nice and soft

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.700
but they hold their shape 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.649
but when you place everything onto a wonton they taste simple delicious 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:43.179
and it is a much more fun and healthier alternative to lasagna so please give

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:46.939
it a go and let me know what you think because I'm sure you will not regret it
