[MUSIC]

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.449
Pickle Springs natural area offers cool, moist canyons and spectacular views

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.449
from sandstone bluffs.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.340
During the time of the great glaciers,
plants and animals moved south ahead

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.460
of the advancing ice.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.270
Mammoths wandered the cool canyons at Pickle Springs

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.210
grazing on the lush northern vegetations 
supported by the area's acid soils.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.990
Today the mammoths are gone,

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.190
but many of the plants remain

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.190
relics of that earlier climate.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.790
The spring and creek are named for William Pickles.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.310
A settler from Illinois who owned the
land from 1848

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.330
until sometime in the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.450
early 1860s.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.900
According to local legend, he was shot
by Sam Hildebrand, and a band of renegades

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.900
sometime during the civil war.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.240
Only a few scattered blackjack oak, 
farkleberry and shortleaf pine survive 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.030
on the overlook.  

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.009
The small size of the trees belies her
age

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:16.519
The pines at the edge of the overlook 
began growing here while Missouri

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:23.519
struggled through the civil war.

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.169
During the past millions of years

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:45.999
water, ice, rain,  

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.539
wind and plants have worn away part of the hard sandstone, 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:54.219
creating fantastic formations and deep, cool canyons. 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:58.099
The weathered sandstone created the acid soils which support many of the areas 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:05.099
unique plants.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.739
Pickle Springs natural area -

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:21.629
a trail through time.
