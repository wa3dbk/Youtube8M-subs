00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:47.210
Okay so today, we're going to show roughly
how I make a knife from blank steel, up to

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.000
the finished product.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.610
Okay, so now we're, obviously we've ground
the blank. We're going to do the heat treatment

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.750
now so, this is my heat treat oven. I'm going
to preheat this up to 500 degrees before I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.720
put my blank in. It's just a matter of flicking
this on. So I'll pop that on, now that will

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.229
preheat up to 500 degrees where it's ready
for the blank.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.420
Alright so, the oven's up to temperature now.
500 degrees. So we're going to pop the blank

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:35.140
in and get it up to 800 degrees for the heat
treat. So it's just a matter opening the oven

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:44.689
up and popping the blank into there. Popping
the blank in. Close the door. We're just going

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.689
to turn this up to 800 degrees and then once
it's got to temperature we'll pull out the

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.000
steel to soak. There we go.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.710
Alright so the knife's now been in there having
a good soak at 800 degrees and we're now going

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.000
to quench it in the oil and that will be the
heat treat all complete.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.340
Alright so we transfer it from here straight
into the oil, quick as possible.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.160
Just hold it in there for awhile just to let the steel
cool down.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.150
And there we go. That's the blade heat treated.
That's the blade quenched in the oil, so I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.090
actually use old engine oil just obviously
it's easy to come by and it cools the steel

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.579
down really quickly. You can use like a brine
solution but it can get quite a bit of spit

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.900
back from that which obviously, coming at
high temperatures, can be quite dangerous.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.680
Engine oil has also got its downsides. It
can flare up and stuff like that, but it's

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.840
just a matter of being careful and taking
precautions. So now that this is quenched

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.410
we are actually going to temper it slightly,
take some of the hardness out of it and just

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.410
make it less brittle and then it will be on
to the handling after that.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.989
Right. Now I'm going to temper the steel,
basically just to soften off the stress points

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.660
on the knife. So, across here. Obviously you've
got a tube that's going to go through there

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:54.459
and thin the steel. Going to de-stress it
there along the spine of the blade. Heat it

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:01.459
with a blow torch then dunk it straight into
the water and that will cool it down. So,

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.000
we just heat that up with a blow torch.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.290
As it comes up to temperature you'll actually
start to see a colour change in the steel.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.960
And on there now you can actually see, it's
going up into the spine of the blade slightly.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:44.000
That's it. So now, that is ready now to put
a handle on.
