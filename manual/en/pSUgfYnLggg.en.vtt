00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's get started.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.140
So, plug in your machine.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.490
Reach over here.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.469
Put the power cord into the machine, and you've
got a switch right beside it.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:13.670
Turn it on for your light.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.400
What you do want to do is plug your machine
into a surge protector.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.950
That's just going to keep things safe no matter
what machine you're actually using.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.480
Let's start by winding a bobbin.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.410
First up, let's go ahead and lift up the presser
foot, little piece of paper that comes from

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.730
the factory there.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.550
It will come with one bobbin inside the machine
and about three additional ones in your accessory

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.570
bag.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.280
These bobbins are specific for this machine
so when you're purchasing them from your Husqvarna

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.670
Viking dealer, make sure you tell them that
you've got an Emerald sewing machine.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.720
They'll know which bobbins to get you.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.980
For threading up your machine, we've got two
different ways to thread is put onto a spool.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.309
Either it looks like it's got little criss-crosses
on it or the thread is what's called 'stacked

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.950
thread' whereas you look at the spool, the
threads go right next to each other all the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.110
way up and down.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.729
Depending on which spool you have, you'll
have a ... For the stacked thread, we're going

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.070
to lay it down.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.969
Here is one of your spool caps ... Is actually
stored on the machine when it's shipped to

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.639
you ... And then you'll have another one in
your accessory box.

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:23.140
So, this is will be what we're using since
I have a smaller spool that we'll actually

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.979
wind up with and then make sure that spool
cap goes all the way on.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.850
Don't let any gap in between there.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.159
Now, if I was using this spool with the thread
that's cross-wound, I'm going to pull out

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.249
the vertical spool cap and then place the
thread on it like so.

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:40.030
And then it will spin like that.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.729
That actually will help in a lot of different
threads that you're using, and sometimes depending

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.319
on how they're set up, they will come off
one way better than the other.

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.560
We're going to take our thread, come underneath
the guide in the back, and this is the pretension

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
right here.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.819
You can almost put your fingernail in it and
it snaps.

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:04.149
Go in and cross there, and we're going around
it clockwise.

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.609
Bring it all the way over.

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.830
Then take your thread and from the inside
to out in one of your holes, thread the bobbin

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
all the way through.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.530
I like to put this on, push this over to engage
it.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.120
Now, if you step on the foot control right
now, the needle is going to go up and down

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.120
like that.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.950
To prevent that for making extra noise, all
you need to do is take your hand wheel and

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.260
pull it out.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.090
By holding the thread straight up and stepping
on the foot control, that will go ahead and

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.810
let that thread eventually break off and continue
to wind the whole rest of the bobbin.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.200
These really fill up fast and they fill up
full so these bobbins are a great size for

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
this machine.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
I love them.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.870
Once you get it all ... Once it gets it all
the way full, it will stop spinning so just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.510
keep your foot on the control.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.900
When you're done, clip the thread.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.230
Take the hand wheel, push it back in, that
will engage the needle front going back up

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.460
and down.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.070
Then take your bobbin then slide it all the
way off.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.040
Let's go ahead and thread the machine next.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.850
This pretensioner are for the bobbin.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.650
You don't get your thread in there, and maybe
it just goes around loosely.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.150
This bobbin will not feel as tight and firm
as it should, probably kind of looks squishy,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.250
and that is not a bobbin to use in your machine.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.490
Do kind of rewind it and use it for a ... Wind
it onto another bobbin, that will really help.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.790
When we go to thread the machine, we don't
use the pretensioner, and go ahead and follow

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.580
the arrows straight down.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.600
Do make sure your presser foot is up.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.400
If it's down, then your thread's not going
to get into all the places it needs to go.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.260
Come up, and we're going to go all the way
back on the right side.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.940
Bring it to the left, and then all the way
down.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.570
It will hook into this top little take up
lever.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.680
There's one guide on the top of the needle.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.920
And then, we'll give you an up close use of
the needle threader in just a second.

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.760
We'll do that in a separate video.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.660
And then just pull that loop right on through.

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.350
For putting your bobbin in, what you want
to do is look and have your thread coming

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.850
off the left hand side of the bobbin.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:15.230
That will actually match your little picture
you'll see on the door of your bobbin area.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.880
Make sure that goes all the way down.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.269
Look for a little groove right here at six
o'clock.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.590
There's a little tiny arrow noting where it
is.

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.000
Make sure that your thread drops in there
and then pull it to the side.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.900
It's going to go about just a big quarter
inch length.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.490
That is the tension down here.

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.360
Let it go ahead and lay off to the side, and
to bring the bobbin thread up.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.810
Hold the thread form the needle with your
left hand and take one full stitch.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.099
Here's a key with this machine.

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:46.529
One full stitch always means that the take
up lever comes back up to the highest position.

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:49.880
I'll never forget my mom teaching me how to
sew and that was the first thing she taught

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.880
me, and you know what?

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.259
I've never had sewing machine issues.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.219
It really is the first thing to learn.

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:59.409
One full stitch, all the way down, all the
way up while you're holding the thread.

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.370
It has now brought up a loop that happens
to be your bobbin thread.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.090
Pull that right on out and put both those
threads underneath the foot into the back.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.610
Then you can take the door, place it into
its ledge on the left.

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.270
Click it down on the right.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.460
And we are ready to sew.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.460
Let's see how we've down.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.009
So, we're going to go ahead just take your
fabric.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.240
Anytime I test sew a machine, I take a piece
of fabric and fold in half.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.240
Sewing on a single layer is just really not
anything we are going to get any good results

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.240
on.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.240
We're just going to set it in there.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.240
Reach in here.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.849
Lower down the presser foot and let's sew
(machine sounds).

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.110
Oh, I love how these machines sound.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.050
They're so ... They're almost just ... They
sound so rich and full.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.639
Now, when I stop sewing, make sure that when
you are going to take your fabric up, bring

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:48.479
this take up lever to the highest position
... I'll keep reminding of you that but when

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.819
you get into that habit ... When you take
this up, lift up your presser foot, slide

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:53.819
it to this side.

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:57.070
We have little cutter at the back corner of
the machine here.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.960
And I always go from back towards me, and
I can do this with one hand.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.259
Cuts the thread beautifully and then you see
you've got a perfect seam as you go.

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.360
Let's do this again one more time.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.360
We're lowering it down.

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.870
Do you notice I don't have to hold my threads
when I start to stitch?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.150
That's because of this.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.590
We've completed the stitch.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.669
We've brought it up form the last stitch we
took, and now it's ready to start the new

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:19.669
stitch.

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.490
You always watch people holding on those threads
and you don't as long as you do the proper

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.490
technique.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:28.719
And when you start with your needle in fabric
first ... If you're going to be way back here

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:32.849
and that fabric's not underneath your needle
for the first stitch, yes, hold your threads.

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.229
But most of you will find yourself, just slide
in a little bit and then you can use the reverse

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.909
button, hold this down.

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:43.249
Take a few stitches back and forward and those
are locked in completely as you go.

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:48.449
If you want to stop and turn a corner, drop
the needle into the fabric, lift up your presser

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.839
foot, turn your fabric and away you go.

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:57.319
Whether your machine is stopping with the
needle up, even though it looks like the stitch

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:58.559
is done, it is not.

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:03.029
Take that take up lever all the way back to
the top, pull it out to the side, cut your

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:07.769
thread, and we are ready to move on to see
what other accessories come with this machine.
