00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.359
Did you know that you use addition all
the time?

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:20.939
Wen you  put money into your bank account,
you're adding to your balance.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.119
At the grocery store, you add items to your
cart.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.289
When you add, you're combining two or more
numbers to get a larger number.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.930
This larger number called the sum.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.250
For example, if you already have
three lemons and you go to the store

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.990
and buy two more, you now have five lemons.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.170
You can write this as: three plus two
equals five.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.990
The plus sign is used when you add.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.640
When you're adding, be sure to keep
place values in mind.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.430
Place values determine the way you read
and write a number.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.000
let's look at the number is six hundred
and thirty two.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.360
Two is in the ones place.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.400
The three is in the tens place.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.070
And the sixth is in the hundreds place.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.600
An easy way to add numbers is to stack 
them according to their place values.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.990
if you want to add twelve and three,
first stack twelve, the larger of the two

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.620
numbers, on top of three.

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.690
Notice that the ones position for each
of the two numbers are lined up vertically.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.830
Place a plus sign on the left of the stack
and draw a line at the bottom.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.810
Now you're ready to add.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.770
Three plus two is five.
So put a five below the line.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.420
The one in the tens place has nothing to 
combine with, so bring the one below the line.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.420
The answer, or sum, is fifteen.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.639
And those are the basics of addition
