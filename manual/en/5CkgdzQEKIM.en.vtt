hello everybody I just wanted to come on
here and say an enormous

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.770
massive thank you to every last one of
you no matter how you engage with me

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.550
whether you're watching the videos on YouTube, on my site whether you've 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.630
bought a course, or been on a workshop however it is, 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.130
because without you I wouldn't be doing
what I'm doing now

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.580
yeah I still love doing photography I
still love taking pictures and going out

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.650
you've no idea what a buzz I get

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.039
out of the teacher, I had no idea it was going to be this rewarding when I set out 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.420
on this path

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.509
to be honest with you I was kind of
nervous I was a little bit scared

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.170
because

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.710
let's face it putting stuff out onto the
internet if someone doesn't like it 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.489
they're gonna tell you in no uncertain terms, and very very quickly, 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.800
and yes sure some people don't agree
with some of the things I said well that's

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.079
fine everybody is entitled to their own
opinion their own views and beliefs.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.360
The YouTube channel is now over a hundred thousand subscribers that couldn't

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.539
happen without you and your sharing the
videos and telling people

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.680
but it has been an amazing journey and every time 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.829
I see you guys post a picture on the
Facebook page or make a comment saying

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.080
learnt a new idea or got a new concept, it is 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.090
incredibly personally rewarding for me
and I really thank you for allowing me

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.869
to make

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.280
my income and run my business doing
something which gives me such

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.070
a buzz, I couldn't do it without you, and I really want you guys to get that.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.090

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.820

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.689

long time and I remember seeing your

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.380
