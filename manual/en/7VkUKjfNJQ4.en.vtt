00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.340
So in any sort of steeper or looser conditions,
it's a fact of life that even with minimal

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.430
braking input, your bike is going to get loose.
It's going to lose traction and you are just

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:28.740
going to have to become comfortable with that.
You know, the way we become comfortable with

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.680
what our bike does when it looses traction
in either loose rocky conditions or similarly

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.820
in wet, muddy conditions is that we have to
remember what the natural tendency of things

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.020
to do when they are disturbed and on a hill
is roll down the hill. So, I hit the corner

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.730
and I hit the brakes. And all those rocks
and stuff under my brakes wanted to slide

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:58.100
down the falling of the hill. So, I just loosened
up my grip a little on the handle bars (which

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.879
is the exact opposite of what most people
do when their bikes lose control; they tend

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.250
to clamp down and death grip the bars or "white-knuckle"
it and hope that pulls things out). But what

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.270
you really need to do is let things find their
natural sort of stasis; their natural way

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.270
of balancing and being. And when you are in
a corner, that's a light grip on the bars,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.780
a finger on each brake in case you need to
hit them. And you just keep yourself centered

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.300
between the wheels and just really get comfortable
with that. And that's the sort of thing that

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.700
if you have a gravel driveway near anywhere
you live, you can just go out and try to carve

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.510
figure eights in that driveway. Put on your
knee pads and just get used to what the wheels

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.680
do when they break loose and scatter around.
Because, in a situation like that, you're

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.759
going to, your wheels are going to break loose
because it's just sort of pebbles. So, you

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.170
just light on the bar, lower your center of
gravity, distribute it between the two wheels.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.259
It's kind of like if you put weight on the
wheel that is starting to slip out, you make

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.729
it get traction. If you put the weight on
the other wheel, you can make it slide more.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.220
So, going in there, I put my weight forward
because my back wheel was loose and I wanted

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.360
it to just get out there and I wanted to follow
the front wheel. It's kind of like what I

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.200
was doing when we were talking about cornering.
I mean, that's a corner too, but it's also

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.030
loose so what we do with brake distribution
is different.
