00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.590
Hi I'm Teri Masachi in the finishing
shop

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.630
Today we have a porch rocker

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.040
unfinished, unassembled, and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.160
I'm going to paint it.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.599
We have done a
past video on this very same rocker

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.779
that was stained and clear coated.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.140
The difference between the two projects

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.580
is this

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.560
we can assemble this right out of the box

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:36.319
because it's gonna get painted

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.300
I don't have to worry about

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.620
glue when I put it in this area here

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.970
if it gets on the outside of the hole
that's no issue

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.290
because its gonna get painted

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.490
With the stained rocker,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.500
this particular piece

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.300
I had to make sure
that the areas were taped off so the

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.320
stain wouldn't interfere with the glue
adhesion

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
and I left it unassembled until it was
stained

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.849
and then I assemble it after that to
finish it

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.120
big difference between the way you
approach these two

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.200
you do sand all the parts

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.979
before you put them together

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.179
that's just really common sense

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.139
it's so much easier to sand these when they're flat

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.759
and they're not all put together and
difficult to reach

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.079
so they did both get sanded

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.200
so

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.799
The instructions on this are pretty
straightforward. You put some glue in the

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:33.119
hole and you start building this rocker

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.819
So that's what I'm gonna do

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.400
Begin with 120 on the finishing block

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.959
and sand every flat surface

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.640
Work from 120

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.720
to 150 to 180.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.840
It is tempting to power sand the seat

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.659
The spinning disk would damage the slats.
Use the block

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.820
Sand the flats of the arm with the block

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.219
and use folded paper for the edge of the
crest and the edges of the arm

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.100
The inside edges of the slats

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.940
are sharp and rough sawn.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.820
Work into those cracks with folded paper

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.160
The posts and rungs need smoothing

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.900
with the maroon non-woven pads.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000
The most difficult part of the whole rocker

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.559
is in between the spindles on the back.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.940
The micro zip is the only tool that will do it.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.380
The rocker is all sanded.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.770
Now apply the glue around the inside of the hole and slip the dowel in.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.220
Do not fill the hole with glue.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.780
Get all four dowels in position

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.500
Lower the front leg assembly onto the four dowels

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.680
Put the seat assembly in loosely before
attaching the arms

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.879
Glue the rockers on and screw the seat and
arms tight

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.020
Allow the glue to dry for six hours

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.279
Okay.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.620
Assembled.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.720
I've tacked it off

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.620
Get rid of all the remaining dust

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.319
and now we're going to prime

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.460
If you have been hesitant to use aerosols

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.140
or your past experience has
been less than pleasant in that they

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.580
drip and they run

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.920
Let's just do a quick primer on how to
correctly spray with an aerosol

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.760
you might also want to think about

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.459
investing in one of these nifty little
can handles

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.040
it makes the spray can more like a spray
gun

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.820
and also it relieves that bent

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.060
frozen finger from what I call spray gun
finger

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.060
you clip it on

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.780
and now you've got a trigger

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.900
rather than a finger

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.580
and this creates much less fatigue

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.120
the other really important thing to
never forget

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.350
when you're spraying

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.140
is light multiple coats

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.500
do about 12 inches away

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.680
don't try to be too close cuz that's
when drips happen

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.420
and you want to just keep light, light
passes

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.720
just like that

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.320
so that you're not at any one point in
time stopping in any one space to

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.030
be able to

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.750
get that horrible dripping and drooling

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.419
then you're sunk

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.499
you have to stop let it dry sand it down
and then repaint so

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.380
the other thing you need to wear a
respirator

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.660
we're gonna spray this out in the garage
where there's plenty of air

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.280
Good idea to have a fan.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.820
Really good idea to have a respirator

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.620
These are not good for you

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
so let's get suited up

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.180
and we'll get this thing primed and then
we'll talk about the color coat

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.320
Support the rocker up off the floor with saw horses

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.420
Apply the primer with light multiple passes

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.890
up and down the various parts of the
rocker

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.460
tip the rocker back for better

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.080
access to all the areas

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.360
under the seat and under the rungs.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.160
Work forward, backward, under, and over

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.620
until everything is thoroughly primed

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.620
The primer is quick drying and can be
sanded to perfection with 320

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.470
All the rough surfaces become glass
smooth

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.000
Use the maroon non-woven to smooth the
rounds

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.370
Tack off all the sanding dust thoroughly

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.860
Spray the green color coat as carefully
as the primer

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.710
Light, multiple coats

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
The contrasting green

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.270
over the white makes it easy to see
progress

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.300
We're back from the garage

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.110
The green is beautiful

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.070
Hunter green happens to be one of my favorite colors

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.400
Beautiful, beautiful color on a porch rocker

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.149
Could just set this right outside.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.419
There is one more step that needs to happen

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:09.259
This is just the color coat.

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:11.259
If you want further protection

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.620
there is a clear coat that you can do

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.909
in an aerosol and it would be the same
technique

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:21.240
You're gonna wanna scuff and then you're
gonna clear coat

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.159
but this green actually has to set up
for 48 hours

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.759
We can't do another thing here with this
now.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.920
So wait 48 hours

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.580
make sure it's good and dry and then scuff
if you have any

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.159
drips or sags that would be when to
solve those problems

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.959
and then do a clear coat

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.300
After that

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.610
you wanna make sure it's cured for five
to seven days before you actually sit in it

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.160
So aerosol painting is not so bad after all

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:52.069
specially with the handle

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.060
And we were able to

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.240
get this rocker finished with all the
hand sanding tools

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.500
and it was a pretty straightforward
project once you

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.150
figure out how to really master the art
of aerosol painting.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.750
Good work
