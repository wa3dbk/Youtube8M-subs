00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:23.467
The Burmese Python is an invasive species found in the Everglades.

00:00:24.598 --> 00:00:29.598
It is an opportunistic feeder, loves to eat birds and recent 
 studies indicate that they are feeding on bird eggs too.

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:35.483
They also like to eat small mammals and are especially fond of rodents.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:57.178
In this instance, a python killed a rat and the commotion attracted another python.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The sent of the dead rat gets all over the first snake.

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:12.624
And the second comes in there to eat the rat but it gets 
 confused with the rat’s sent and the actual prey becomes indistinguishable.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
So both pythons are coiled around each other, trying to find the prey.

00:01:54.404 --> 00:01:58.400
The coils of the larger snake around the head of 
 the smaller snake will prevent it from breathing.

00:01:59.694 --> 00:02:02.690
Within thirty minutes, the smaller python will be dead.

00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:08.720
When the larger python feels that life is fading out of 
 the smaller python, it lets go, positioning itself for feeding.

00:02:12.337 --> 00:02:17.340
As the larger python feeds on the rat, 
 it just continues swallowing the smaller python.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The process of eating such a large animal could take a couple of hours.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:01.650
During that time the snake is extremely vulnerable to attack from other predators.

00:03:03.914 --> 00:03:07.910
If the weather conditions stay warm enough it can 
 take ten days to digest such a meal.

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:13.160
After a big meal like that, the python doesn’t 
 really have to eat for several weeks.
