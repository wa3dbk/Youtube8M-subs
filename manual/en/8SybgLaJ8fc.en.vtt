00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:19.700
In our exhibition we present 
a large variety of Sou Fujimoto’s models.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.700
He made them all with his assistants in his 
Tokyo studio. As models, they seem

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.000
rather simple and hand crafted, but they convey futuristic concepts about living in cities

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:44.500
which, in some cases, could not be put into 
practice in the presence.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.000
The metaphors “Architecture as Forest”
and “Forest as Architecture” are central

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.220
to Fujimoto’s thinking – and so is his
refusal to use straightforward terms. There

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.000
is always the relation between inside and
outside, between openness and closure - this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:27.000
polarity of terms gives shape to Fujimoto’s
work and we try to show this in a variety

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.260
of small-scale models, but also in the actual
size replica of the “Final Wooden House”

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:38.630
in our sculpture garden. So we are in the
lucky position that a real building completes

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.869
an architecture exhibition.
