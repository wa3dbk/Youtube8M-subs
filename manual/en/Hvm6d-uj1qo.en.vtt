00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.440
glacier bay national park in southeast
alaska

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.709
is a stage for a truly magnificent
interaction

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.559
it is a convergence of wildlife on a
grand scale

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.519
it is home to the stellar sea lion

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.140
sea otter

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.070
humpback whale

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.849
mountain goat

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.800
the grizzly bear

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.279
and the tufted puffin among others

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.909
when animals converge on food sources

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.260
interplay of wildlife

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.680
is truly breathtaking

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.890
the salmon had begun to run

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.270
and had attracted a pack of wolves near tidal inlet

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.870
time passed

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.970
and confrontation between grizzly

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.310
and wolf began to emerge

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.630
one morning

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.150
as a sow and her three cubs crossed a waterway

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.700
they came up on a large male grizzly

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550
male grizzlies

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.480
are known to eat cubs

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.570
out of the safety of her young she moved
north

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.729
and waiting just ahead were several
wolves and their offspring

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.440
mother had found herself in quite a
predicament

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.710
continue forward

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.159
and face off with the pact

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.659
or turned south

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.100
and re-encounter the stronger male
grizzly

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.850
she chose the pack

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.440
now that first contact had been made

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.030
the short cubs began standing on their
hind legs to get a better view

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.470
the young wolves disappeared into the
brush to avoid conflict

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.229
the oldest cub charged the wolves while
mother did the same

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.780
outnumbered

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.780
the family was easily surrounded

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.809
the oldest cub continued to chase the
wolves before returning back to mother

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:40.399
a cub that has undergone stress will find
comfort in nursing

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:42.919
this sow waited until it's safe

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.189
she nursed her young

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.499
and kept a vigilant eye on the wolves nearby

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:54.639
the grizzly family eventually moved on

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.539
young wolves re-emerged from the brush

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:03.799
and life continued as though nothing happened

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:09.119
every encounter we have with the
wildlife that share this with world with us

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:11.339
is as special

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:12.069
as it is fleeting
