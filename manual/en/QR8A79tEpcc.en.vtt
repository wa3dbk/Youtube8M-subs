00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
here is the mould I used for the
choco cheese cake

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.690
it is a custom made homemade mould
that prevents you from buying moulds that will serve only rarely

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.050
for this you need aluminium foil

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.769
a ruler, a chisel and a coin cutter

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:32.490
I measured 60 cm.  I cut the foil

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.520
I cut a second part of 10 cm

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.570
to hold the mould at the end

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:41.900
then I bend the foil
every ten centimetres to make it rigid

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.810
I put it in shape to position it
on the coin cutter

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.000
Then remove the coin cutter

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.530
Then we hold the mould with the strips

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.150
donâ€™t hesitate to adapt the
mould diameter to your needs and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.579
now we have more than to
