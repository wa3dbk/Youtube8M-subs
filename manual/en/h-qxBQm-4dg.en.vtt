Welcome from AC News,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
let's see today's trailer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and cinema news is coming up!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It seems as the project for a biopic

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho is actually happening.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Anthony Hopkins will interpret the role of the famous director and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Dame Helen Mirren is stipulating the contract

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for the part of his wife, Alma Reville.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The biopic is based on the book by Stephen Rebello

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
which will be adapted by screenwriter John McLaughlin.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The director will instead be Sacha Gervasi.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Maybe the project will be supported by Fox Searchlight

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
instead of Paramount and the shooting should start April 2012.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Gore Verbinski's movie Lone Ranger

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
had been put aside for financial problems,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but now it's again happening also thanks to a member of the cast, Tom Wilkinson,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
who insisted for the making of it.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Wilkinson should interpret the role of the villain Latham Cole.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Disney and the producer Jerry Bruckheimer

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
are also concluding contracts with Barry Pepper,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The release date should be the 1st of May 2013.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That's all for today,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
