00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
Hi.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.770
I'm Sam with Grocery Coupon Network.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.400
And today I want to talk to you about some
great deals on toys.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.160
Now, toys are something that if you have kids
or buy these for other people who have kids

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.060
and feel like you always need to get them
and have them on hand.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.130
Or there's always something your kids want
or there's always a holiday or birthday coming

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.130
up.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.190
So I like to stock up on toys throughout the
year and have them if we're invited to a classmate's

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.630
party or for upcoming holidays, like Easter
or Christmas or birthdays.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.680
And it's a great way to kinda spread out your
cost for these items and get really great

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.680
deals.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.440
So what I do is I buy a lot of toys, like
what you see here, and hold on to them until

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.100
I need them for somebody or use them for different
things.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Like this Play-Doh I'm going to use for Easter
gifts, the little Easter party that we're

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.100
going to.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.640
And so when I buy it now, I can get a really
great deal on it and hold on to it until I

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.180
actually need it and not pay the full price.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.040
So I want to tell you what these deals were
and where I got them.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.190
These were all from Target.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.620
And they have some really great toy deals
going on right now.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.640
And this happens -- on the summer, they get
a little ____ and basically you're gonna get

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.010
the best deals on toys at any store by stacking
a store coupon and the manufacturer's coupon

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.690
and buying it when it's at the lowest price.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.520
This is the general rule of thumb for people.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.330
So what I did was this Play-Doh stuff was
on sale for $9.99.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.000
This 24-pack of colors was $9.99.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.780
Usually it was $15.00 and some change.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.180
This was $17.00 and some change, usually,
and it was on sale for $9.99 also.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.590
And last weekend, in the inserts, there was
this Play-Saver insert.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.770
And these coupons are also available online.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.710
So you could use your insert and if you need
additional coupons you can print them up online.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.240
And there were coupons that you could pair
with Target coupons.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.700
Target has a lot of really good toy coupon
right now.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.480
So that's how I got the really good deal on
the Play-Doh.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.260
There was a $3.00 coupon in the Play-Saver,
and the $3.00 Target coupon on specific Play-Doh

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.390
packets.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.690
So I ended up paying $3.99 for this 24-pack
of Play-Doh.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.010
This Swirling Shake Shoppe, which is also
-- here, I'll move it out so you can see it

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.569
-- was also on sale for $9.99, and usually
it was over $17.00.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.610
And that was the regular price.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.500
Also had the same $3.00 in the Play-Saver
insert, and then I used the $3.00 Target coupon.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.490
So it made this $3.99 because it was also
on sale for the $9.99.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.810
So those are both great prices and Play-Doh
sets and Play-Doh, in general, is something

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.069
that is always loved as a gift in my house
by my 4-year old.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.260
And it makes for a good birthday gift if you
were to go to a classmate's party.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.260
Now, this was a really fantastic deal.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.230
It was on a price cut for $19.73, I believe.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:18.310
And a little while back, Grocery Coupon Network
had a printable coupon for $5.00 this Fisher

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.680
Price Laugh and Learn Puppy House, and it
was also off the puppy itself, the stuffed

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680
puppy.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.110
So a $5.00 off coupon and then in the Target
ad this week, they have some special 50 percent

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.629
off coupons, and one of them applied to this.

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:40.980
So it was $19.73, 50 percent off, which makes
it just under $10.00, and then $5.00 off that.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.030
So, in the end, I paid $4.73 for this.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.710
It's perfect for a gift for my almost 1-year
old for his Easter basket, so I was happy

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:50.960
to get it.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:04:00.530
These little Marvel Rescue Hero guys were
normally $7.34 at Target, and they were on

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.970
Price Cut for $6.99.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.200
Now, only select one, so you gotta look to
make sure that the one you're getting is the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.860
one that's on Price Cut.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.420
So what I'll do is I'll take a couple to the
scanner and double-check them to make sure

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.840
it's the right price.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.700
So $6.99.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.410
And then also in this Play-Saver insert or
available online, there was a $3.00 manufacturer

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:29.169
coupon for these specifically, and Target
had a $3.00 store coupon.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.580
So that made these each $0.99.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.580
So I know my son is gonna like these.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.520
And, again, a perfect Easter basket item.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.330
So if you want to score great deals on toys,
be on the lookout for deals that you can pair

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.129
with store coupons and manufacturer's coupons,
stack the coupons and you can get great stuff

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.129
really cheap.

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:54.930
Now, to keep these toys, I have a space in
my closet called the Gifts Closet.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.139
And it's just a really big open kind of shelf
and I put all the gifts there.

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.169
I've already started Christmas shopping for
this year, probably in January.

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.969
And anytime I see a great deal on something,
I pick it up and put it in there.

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:13.069
There's a lot of kids in my extended family
that we exchange gifts with.

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:17.849
So I like to have a lot of stuff, and it's
not a huge cost then come December.

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.180
So be on the lookout for great deals and start
your own gift closet and stock it up throughout

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.479
the year.
