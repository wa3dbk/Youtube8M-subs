00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.420
What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.639
Today I'm going to show you how to make sure
that you're nailing each and every one of

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.170
your Lower Ab exercises so that you can get
the most out of them.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.150
You see the Lower Abs are definitely the most
difficult to train and why?

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.480
It's because that they're naturally weighted.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.539
If you think of the exercises that you do
when you're training your Lower Abs, you're

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.619
naturally weighted.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.529
You're lifting the lower body, you're doing
bottom up movements which always involve lifting

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.110
the weight of your own legs.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.399
Now weighted Ab exercises are great for adding
additional fitness to your Abs.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.020
You've probably seen guys that have a nice
flat stomach but flat stomachs are for women.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.230
We want to have Ripped 6 Pack Abs and in order
to do that you have to make sure that you're

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.340
overloading those muscles.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.960
The principles still apply here and Lower
Ab exercises will definitely do that.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.530
Now with that being said, what is one of the
best way to train your Lower Abs?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.050
It's with a Hanging Leg Raise, some variation
of a Hanging Leg movement.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.591
We have lots of Hanging Leg movements that
we incorporate into ATHLEANX and even if you

00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:03.780
can't do those,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.110
you can do modified versions, like a Captains
Chair.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.799
But there's a problem with that.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.060
There's 4 things that people do wrong when
they do these exercises and I want to show

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.229
you today, how we can fix it.

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.899
First and foremost, when you approach a bar
to do a Hanging Leg Raise, try this.

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.490
Switch your hands around.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.090
Don't use an overhand grip, grip underhand.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.500
Your biceps are naturally strong and should
be able to contribute to your ability to hold

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.670
onto the bar.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.289
A lot of people complain that they don't have
enough grip strength to stay on the bar long

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.109
enough to fatigue their Abs.

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.039
If you go underhand, you're going to have
that added strength of the Biceps to help

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:38.039
you do that.

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.049
You're going to find that you can do a lot
more reps just by making this one little tweak.

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.890
The next thing you have to make sure you do
is to stabilize your body.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.259
You can't be doing what I'm showing you here.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.600
This is straight garbage.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.740
Now we've seen it in a lot of different gyms
and actually it's become a lot more popular

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.890
lately.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.890
It's garbage.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.869
You're not actually using your Abs very much
at all.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.939
Matter of fact you're just using momentum
to swing your legs around.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.359
The more you swing, the less your Abs are
moving.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:05.039
The stiller that you remain, the more your
Abs are working.

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.030
So you want to stabilize and make sure that,
even if you have to reset between every single

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.030
rep, do it,

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.820
take the extra split second to make sure you're
doing every single rep out of the stable position.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.710
Next big key I want you to focus on, is what
is your body doing once you initiate the exercise.

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:24.760
See if you imagine yourself as a sheet of
paper, you should be rolling that sheet of

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.420
paper up, not folding it.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.380
You can see here the difference.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.850
Here I'm actually folding my body, I'm literally
folding by just using my Hip Flexors and that's

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.850
the problem.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.850
The Hip Flexors will dominate this movement.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.010
And even the people that do this will say,
yeah but Jeff, I still feel this in my Abs

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.010
when I do that.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.570
Yeah, because your Abs are working isometrically
to stabilize your Pelvis as your Femurs rise

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.570
up,

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.980
but that doesn't mean that they are doing
all that they can do.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.020
And this is where I think that we have the
big problem.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.570
We have the big problem because you're not
actually overloading your Abs in the shortest

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.100
amount of time possible.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.730
It will take you much longer to fatigue an
Ab isometrically than it would to actually

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.100
fatigue it throughout it's natural movement
pattern.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.970
So let's get it to work and get it to work
fully and do that by what showing what I'm

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.910
doing here, roll like a piece of paper.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.160
Curl your body up.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.460
Get your legs and you're whole body curling
up in one motion.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.200
Which leads me to our 4th point.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.200
Show your ass.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.660
That's right if someone's standing in front
of you and they're watching you do this,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.810
they better be able to see your ass on every
single rep.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.760
If they're just looking at the top of your
knees, you're not doing it right.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.010
You want to make sure that you're getting
your Pelvis into a posterior tilt and you

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.660
can guarantee that by showing your ass, like
I said, to whoever is watching in front of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:35.660
you.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.330
Lower Ab exercises are the most effective
because yes, they're the hardest.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.570
And you never see a guy walking around with
a great set of Lower Abs that has no Upper

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.570
Abs.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.880
So if you have very limited time, let's start
working on some of these harder Ab movements.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.080
And again, I've showed you the Captain's Chair,
if you have to start there, start there.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.670
But even there, you're still going to demonstrate
the same principles here, they always apply.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.960
If you're looking for a complete program that
shows you all the exercises to get the most

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.350
out of your Ab work but at the same time,
the meals to help you show them,

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.090
then head to ATHLEANX.COM right now and get
our ATHLEANX Training System.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.380

This is Washboard Wednesdays, whatever else

Ab related, and I'll cover it in a future

Alright we'll be back here again real soon.
