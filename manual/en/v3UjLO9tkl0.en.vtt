00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.060
We've had a delivery, I like presents me,
and I like packages coming, because it

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.160
means the day's moving on and it's a
collection of ground cover plants so I've

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.100
cleared an area and I've cleared the
area and what happens is the weeds grow.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.020
Now to stop the weeds growing, you need
some ground cover plants, and these are

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.119
absolutely perfect, there's a collection
of 30 here, and these are ready to go.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.520
They're beautiful things, this is Dianthus Deltoides, look at that, you couldn't find

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.809
a better plug than that to be honest
that's perfect and doesn't matter what

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.660
the time of year as long as you don't have to
dig the ground with a pick these will go

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.059
out ok but what I'm gonna do is plant
them on in a pot so these are going to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.140
be good sized plants in a month or so.
These will be good size plants, ready to

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.449
go and I'll cover that ground in no time
and it really is very simple a few

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.920
pebbles in the bottom so multi-purpose
compost and with a plug like

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.670
this, you just pop it in a little bit
more compost around and you can have 30

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.720
of these done in no time
and bear in mind they're gonna grow on

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.259
and make a beautiful plant, cover that
ground with flower and colour and give you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.930
lots of pleasure for years to come but
you can plant them out perfectly well

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
out in the ground in the cold, it'll just be
a little bit slower than they would be

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
if you do it the way I'm doing it but
just potting them on but it's as simple

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.250
and as easy as that. I'm gonna grow 30 of
these and I might even get another

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
collection because they do all sorts of
collections now I'm starting off with a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.189
ground cover collection and there's some
beauties to go at Helianthemum, Sun

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.979
Rose or Rock Rose as they sometimes
called, they really do sparkle in the sun

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.229
Companula Carpatica, oh wonderful, I
see them there's a beautiful and there's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.210
so many sedums around, Thymus Serpyllum creeper oh i tell you what,

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.439
there's some wonderful things or the
Dianthus Deltoides, which I'm starting with,

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.280
maidens pinks they're called,
they'd really old-fashioned plant but

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.080
beautiful, Gypsophile baby's breath,
Prostrata pink,

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:19.440
Sedum Spurium, Serastium, or Dwarf
Asters, a little Daisy heads smiling at

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.950
you, I can't wait,
once I start reading that catalogue, I'm

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.520
done for.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.560
so if you've got an area garden that's a
bit of a problem area ground cover

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.470
plants are what you want they take no
maintenance they're brilliant

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.580
I planted those see them last weeks they
grow for fun spread across the ground

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.780
and they're beautiful just a few things
this is dianthus deltoids an

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.400
old-fashioned pink when the Sun comes
out and it will they're going to be

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.270
fantastic
now the only thing about these is gravel

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.640
in the end the dry slopes and the that
the Alpine area is that they grow they

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.590
will good drainage I'm very poor soil
put that in the right position give it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.940
plenty of drainage it's gonna take off
it'll cover this area no problem at all

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.330
by next year I'm going to plant up these
two areas and it's got a lot of

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.770
fantastic really is good
