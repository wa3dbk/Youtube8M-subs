00:00:08.951 --> 00:00:11.190
Welcome to the Smoke Learning Channel.

00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:13.469
In part four of this video series,

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.711
we’ll composite our crosshair into the binocular scope and add a bit of animation to enhance it.

00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:23.236
Now we will be doing some tracking in this video.

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:26.194
In order to do any tracking in action,

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:31.404
you need to connect the background because we always track on the background as the reference.

00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:35.442
Next we’ll add the crosshair.

00:00:35.648 --> 00:00:37.911
Double-click on the Action node.

00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:41.883
Now press CONTROL+N to add a new media input.

00:00:42.244 --> 00:00:45.632
Connect the colour frame to the red front input.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.083
And connect the Gmask mode to the blue alpha input.

00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:57.256
Ensuring the Action node is selected, you will see the crosshair composited in the result view.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:00.144
Hovering over the ConnectFX schematic,

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:04.686
press the ESC keyboard shortcut to bring up the Action Schematic view.

00:01:05.448 --> 00:01:10.688
If you need to, pan the schematic view using CONTROL+COMMAND.

00:01:10.688 --> 00:01:15.577
Now we would like to track the crosshair to one of the small buildings in the distance.

00:01:15.902 --> 00:01:21.278
To start the tracking, double-click the Axis node of the crosshair image object.

00:01:21.932 --> 00:01:27.637
In the Object menu, click the STABILIZER button to enter into the tracking tools.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:30.621
As a reminder, the image you see here

00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:34.770
is the background connected into the Action node in ConnectFX.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.951
Now this is not something I would normally do

00:01:38.152 --> 00:01:42.271
but it will give you practice when tracking objects moving off screen.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.250
Pick up the tracker box and place it on this small object in the field.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.737
Press ANALYZE but as soon as the object goes off-screen, click anywhere to halt the track.

00:01:54.266 --> 00:02:01.357
If you have any crazy keyframes, press OPTION+D a few times until all the bad keyframes are gone.

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:05.526
So to change a tracking reference in the middle of a track,

00:02:05.526 --> 00:02:10.027
change the tools pull-down menu from SELECT to ADD POINTS.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:16.519
Hold CONTROL+SHIFT and pick up the tracker box and move it to another object in the field.

00:02:16.927 --> 00:02:24.196
This sets a new reference at the frame we are on but it does not disturb the previous tracked keyframes.

00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:27.915
Press ANALYZE to pick up from where we left off.

00:02:28.868 --> 00:02:33.453
Once the tracking is done, you can scrub the time-bar to check the track.

00:02:34.383 --> 00:02:39.621
If you are happy with the result, press the RETURN button to exit the STABILIZER.

00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:44.525
In Action, ensure you are on frame 1.

00:02:45.084 --> 00:02:50.397
Now the tracking data is in this axis node, so we must not adjust it.

00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:55.162
To do any offsets, we need to add another axis node.

00:02:55.752 --> 00:02:57.798
Switch to the ACTION BIN menu.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.843
Drag out an axis node and drop it into the connection underneath the tracking axis.

00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:08.283
Now double-click on this axis to bring up its Object menu.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.493
Scale the crosshair down to 15% and position it over this building.

00:03:15.682 --> 00:03:21.378
To add to the effect, we will reveal the crosshair by scaling it up using animation.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:25.412
On frame 1, turn on Auto-Key.

00:03:25.925 --> 00:03:28.718
Set the scale to 0%.

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.762
Go 6 frame forward.

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:34.749
Set the scale to 25%.

00:03:35.722 --> 00:03:41.573
Finally, go 2 more frames forward and set the scale back to 15%.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.038
Turn Auto-key off.

00:03:44.648 --> 00:03:49.441
This will create a popping effect when the crosshair appears over eight frames.

00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:55.291
Now I’d like to have another two more crosshairs appear but offset in time.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.502
We can reuse the tracking data in the top axis node as well as use Action’s instancing capabilities.

00:04:04.097 --> 00:04:07.603
Select the node containing the animation and the offset.

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:11.743
Press COMMAND+D twice to duplicate it.

00:04:12.248 --> 00:04:14.730
Now just spread the nodes out a bit.

00:04:15.446 --> 00:04:18.969
Connect the tracking data to each of the new nodes.

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:24.619
Next connect each of the axis nodes to the crosshair image object.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.494
By having multiple axis nodes connected to a single image object creates instances.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.764
This will all become clear in a few seconds.

00:04:34.872 --> 00:04:36.918
Select the second axis.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:42.387
Move the crosshair over to the far right of the scope and decide on a final position.

00:04:43.212 --> 00:04:47.823
Now select the third axis and position it over the other building.

00:04:48.276 --> 00:04:52.032
When you scrub the time-bar between the first eight frames,

00:04:52.032 --> 00:04:56.469
you will see all three crosshairs appear simultaneously.

00:04:56.708 --> 00:05:02.521
If that is what you want than great, but I’d like to have them appear one after the next.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.567
To do this, we will use the animation tracks editor.

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.641
Switch to the Animation Editor.

00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:13.976
Change the view mode from CHANNELS to TRACKS.

00:05:14.235 --> 00:05:20.106
Hold down COMMAND and draw a selection box over the second and third axis node.

00:05:20.777 --> 00:05:23.897
If you don’t see any highlighting in the scrollbar,

00:05:24.132 --> 00:05:28.226
scroll down to the highlighted action node and expand it.

00:05:28.226 --> 00:05:31.745
This will eventually reveal the selected axis nodes.

00:05:32.496 --> 00:05:37.488
Click the FRAME ALL button to fit all exposed animation tracks to the window.

00:05:38.314 --> 00:05:41.364
Go to Frame 14 in the time-bar.

00:05:41.594 --> 00:05:47.579
Now drag the middle control point of the second axis to start its animation at frame 14.

00:05:48.595 --> 00:05:52.665
So the animation is eight frames with a six frame delay.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.926
Click the timecode slider, type 14 and click the ADD Button.

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:02.617
Press ENTER to close the calculator.

00:06:02.617 --> 00:06:09.556
Now drag the middle control point of the third axis to start its animation at frame 28.

00:06:10.261 --> 00:06:14.979
If you scrub the time-bar now, you will see the delayed animation.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:20.042
Smoke also has the option to apply offset animation expressions

00:06:20.042 --> 00:06:23.490
but we wont be covering that in this video series.

00:06:24.055 --> 00:06:30.465
In the next video, we will add a few lens characteristics to the scope POV to improve the look.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:36.626
