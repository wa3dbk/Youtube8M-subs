DADDY BRAD: Remember back in the day before
video games when kids used to play outside?

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:10.090
That’s right, Daddy-O, I’m talking about
hula hoops, hopscotch and horse shoes.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:24.070
This episode it brought to you by Baby Bjorn
– classic baby gear, Baby Bjorn.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.890
I like to introduce my kids to the fun and
simple activities we used to do when we were

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.500
little and what could be more fun and simple
than hula hoops.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.050
Now once your kids get the hang of it here’s
a cool game you can play. Get two cups of

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.260
apple juice and then see who can drink their
apple juice first while they’re hula hoping.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.399
You can put anything in your cup that you
want.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.510
Hopscotch! All you need is a rock, some chalk
and a side walk. Draw squares on the side

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.399
walk like so and number them one to ten. Throw
your rock and then hop on one foot avoiding

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.290
the square with the rock on it on the way
up. Hop on one foot on the way down and pick

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.750
up the rock. It’s a great coordination building
game for the kids and you can also teach some

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.750
numbers.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.880
Horseshoes are a great game for adults but
they can be heavy and hard to throw and not

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.200
to mention dangerous for kids. That’s why
I like recommend horseshoes for kids. AKA,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.680
Corn Hole. All you do is throw this bag of
corn into the hole. All you need is six bags

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.970
of corn and some plywood with holes in it.
You can buy it at any sporting goods store

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.810
and you can order it at Fundex.com. The object
is to throw the bags of corn into the holes.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.500
Scoring is much like horseshoes. 3 points
if you get it in the hole. One point if you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500
get it on the board.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.290
