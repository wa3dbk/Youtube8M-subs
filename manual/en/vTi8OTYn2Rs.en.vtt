00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.100
Caboose: Oh, no, no, no don’t. *explosion* Ahhhh... crap.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.420
Simmons: Hm...I need to tell Sarge about this. *activates his radio* Sarge, come in; this is Simmons.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.640
*on the radio*
Sarge: Grif, I do not want to discuss this anymore. You need to shower on a regular basis. It's regulation.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.560
Simmons: Sarge, hey Sarge...

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.080
*on the radio*
Grif: Why? Our suits are ventilated. They push out the stink.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.360
Simmons: Grif, Hello...God damn it...

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.120
*on the radio*
Sarge: You’re just gonna give away our position with those green wavy lines coming off you.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.720
Grif: Okay, I’ll shower...occasionally.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.240
Sarge: Every day.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.320
Grif: Every day?! How can I tell how long a day is?!The sun never sets around here!

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.940
Grif: Why the hell doesn’t the sun set? *shifts off the radio* Shouldn’t we be talking about that first?

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.500
Simmons: *walks in*
Sarge: Simmons, how’d the latest reconnaissance mission go?

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.320
Simmons: Sarge, I have some really exciting news. I just think everyone is going to find this very, very exciting.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.520
Sarge: Well, spit it out.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.960
Simmons:The Blues...are completely undermanned right now.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.060
Sarge: What do you mean by "undermanned"?

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.320
Grif: What do you mean by exciting?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.360
Simmons: It looks like they have received no reinforcements after the last mission.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.180
Simmons: I need to double check my numbers, but if it’s just Caboose over there, that means we have a four man advantage.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.700
Grif: Oooh...What part do you need to double check?

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.120
Grif: Is it the part where you counted their guys or the part where you counted our guys, 'cause they both sound really tough.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.200
Simmons: Shut up Grif, no one's talking to you.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.300
Sarge: Hmm...This could be strategically advantageous.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.100
Grif: Or maybe it was the part where you subtracted 1 from 5.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.720
Grif: *sarcastically* Math can be hard, Hey Lopez!

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.980
Lopez: *walks in* Sí?

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.500
Grif: Fire up your calculator unit, we got a doozy!
Lopez: *Grumbles*

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.200
Sarge: He can’t do that, I had to remove that application in order to install a new free app I downloaded.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.640
Sarge: It’s a program that could be vital to the morale here at our new base.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.920
Sarge: He he, I don’t want to spoil it for you boys, but let's just say it is hilarious.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.040
Grif: Actually, you do need to recount. We don’t have five guys; we only have four.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.340
Simmons: We got Donut back.
Grif: You can't count Donut.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.820
Simmons: Why not? He’s unconscious right now, but when he wakes up...

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.980
Grif: Unconscious? *shows Donut unconscious* He’s been out for three days. I think it’s okay to upgrade him to comatose.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.920
Simmons: Well, I think we should count everyone. I’m an equal opportunity counter.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.880
Grif: Yeah, because I’d hate to go into battle without *Donut*.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.620
Simmons: I mean hell, if I’m counting you as a soldier, I should count the vehicles, some of the bigger rocks we have laying around here...

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.480
*from sniper rifle scope*
Simmons: Fuck it, let’s give the trash can a gun.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.440
Grif: At least I can subtract five and one without double-checking.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.240
Simmons: *offscreen* Oh, can you?

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.820
Ghost Church: Uuuhh, great. I’m sure this will all end well. *walks away*

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.760
Ghost Church: *walks towards Blue Base*I just can’t believe that those idiots are responsible for my death...Twice!

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.920
Ghost Church: It’s embarrassing is what it is.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.820
*inside Blue Base, it's up in flames*
Caboose: Oh no fire, that’s bad. Bad fire! Bad fire go away.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.960
Ghost Church: I mean if I was killed by an alien or a monster, or you know some kind of sorority blow job massacre, that I could handle. *reaches Blue Base*

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.400
Caboose: Please stop burning...Nothing else burn!

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.740
Ghost Church: And look at this, this is my legacy? I mean, what did I do with my life to deserve this?

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.760
Caboose: I mean it!

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.080
Ghost Tex: *suddenly appears behind him*
Ghost Church: Church: Uuhh, this is it’s all gone so wrong.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.780
Ghost Tex: Well, what are you gonna do about it Church?

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.260
Ghost Church: Do? What can I do Tex? I’m dead, I’m gone.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.800
Ghost Tex: Oh come on Church. They say you’re never *completely* dead if someone still remembers you.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.600
Ghost Church: Y-Y-yeah. But look who’s left to remember me. Him?

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.260
Caboose: *runs out of the base on fire* Oh God, now I’m burning. That’s much worse then other things burning!

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.560
Ghost Church: Sure feels like being dead. Like all the way dead.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.980
Ghost Church: Like somebody encased me in cement and then fired me into the sun dead.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.220
Caboose: *still on fire as he runs towards the water* Oh god, why does it keep chasing me? *falls into the water as the fire is extinguished*

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.760
Caboose: Aaaaahhhhhh...that’s nice.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.240
Ghost Church: It’s just a long way back for us.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.000
Ghost Tex: Okay. So, then we’re done?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.180
Caboose: *walks back into the base* Okay, let’s try that again. But with less fire on me this time!

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.660
Ghost Church: No, no we’re not done.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.640
Ghost Tex: Well if we’re not done, let’s get started. *camera shifts to the sky*

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.620
Ghost Church: Hey have I ever told you how helpful you are to me?

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.000
Ghost Church: I mean, you’re so full of fucking wisdom. What would I do without you?

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.300
Ghost Tex: Mm....I try my best.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.900
Ghost Tex: And you have no one to blame but yourself.
