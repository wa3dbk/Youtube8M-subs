00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
generally has a new book coming out but
but

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.400
what i will work on straight honest with
you said back in twenty ten

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.740
and it's getting a lot of publicity now
inc because her new book is coming out

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.610
and its perfectly relevant to these
times because of mit romney being in the

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.090
race here in the presidential race in
america

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.619
wish you talk about

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.230
she had been as he would give me a lot
of money numbers of harry potter books

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.890
so our evening about moving abroad so
you don't have to pay as much taxes here

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.820
was a response first she said

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.189
i'd just remain a domicile taxpayer for
a couple reasons the main one was that i

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.350
one of my children to grow where i grew
up

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.400
that proper roots in a culture as all
the magnificent as britain's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.510
to be citizens with everything that
implies a real country

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.910
not free-floating express living in the
limo some tax haven associating only

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.030
with the children of similarly greedy
tax exiles

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.680
by immediately lover

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.970
right now not all experts are greedy or

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.490
trying to avoid taxes

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.200
but certainly some are

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.680
and she says i don't wanna be with those
guys that basic i don't to be in that

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.020
room and she's absolutely right

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.290
but the second part of it is even better
she says

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.110
the second reason however

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
was that i am indebted to the british
welfare state

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.870
the very one that mister cameron would
like to replace with charity handouts

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.400
when my life hit rock bottom that safety
net threadbare though it had become

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.299
under john majors' government

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.350
was there to break the fall

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
i cannot help feeling therefore that it
would have been contemptible

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.010
just scamper for the west indies at the
first neff

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.280
of a seven-figure royalty check

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.110
this if you like is my notion of patriot
s

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.580
here here

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.420
uh... is or so

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.710
that's exactly right

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.150
am remember mit romney

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.770
also had help from the american welfare
state

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.790
his father when he first moved from
mexico to the united states they were in

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.280
a mormon compound in mexico and they
came here

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.359
dot welfare health

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.189
and mit romney now brags about that but
he was a burn the bridge behind and as

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.000
you are pays taxes all

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.570
hello

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.400
now i'm not only

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.449
hasn't paid about thirty percent in
taxes in the years that we know heat

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.519
popped up in part without the no one
here in just a list all the way up the

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.069
forty percent wow

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.240
but is there is money the cayman islands

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.130
is as money in bermuda area as money in
the swiss bank in kansas china and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.139
everywhere

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.919
but it's not just that

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.740
it turns out he also did something
called

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.519
in i'd be jeans

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.150
you know what that inspired him

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.969
it turns out it's called an
intentionally

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.809
defective

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.750
guarantor trucks

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.799
is that amazing

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.469
is attached shelter

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.659
that in the title says intentionally
defective

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.339
what new other accounts for the rich
call it

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.349
they call it

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.589
i_d_

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.349
uh... literally another u_n_ up

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.449
you see the i_d_ g_t_e_ so they get it
from there but they'll simply because it

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.999
lets them avoid all taxes

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:03.849
what did he do with this

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.539
he had made a hundred million dollars
any moved it into a trust that look

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.479
again you do an effort is a great does
that make sense

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.870
now that ronnie's trust because of
financial accounting trace and because

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.119
of a good investment in doubleclick

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:21.049
one of having f thousand percent return
wife antacid live in the american dream

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.159
no problems so far

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.209
now here's a prop

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.169
the estate tax if u pass it on your kids
and grandkids is fifty five percent

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.259
and a gift tax also prevents you from
split at passing it on immediate

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.739
so that if you pay that

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.049
goblets but of course the whole point of
i did it

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.289
is to avoid off

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.999
so you know what percentage but i think
eight instead

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.509
zero percent

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:47.889
zero

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.839
misses a hundred million dollar trust
you know that saves you

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.729
fifty five million dollars

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.889
he doesn't pay the fifty five million
dollars this who does

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.749
'cause we had a people's war somehow
right

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:07.119
we've got the social safety net week but
we also have the ordeal subsidies

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:11.019
we have all the things and then locally
cobb's fireman teacher's assistant

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.659
light's gotta pay for that

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.749
and lord knows that lord look both admit
not a lot of therefore

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.870
so he takes his money runs

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.619
whether it's in the cayman islands or
through these

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:24.849
trust shenanigans in fact

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.450
and stephen bright stone now works at a
law firm

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.919
that is familiar with these tricks anne
said quote

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.680
romney uses

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.020
every trick in the book

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.970
it's gonna be hard to do tax planning
the future

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.819
he's bringing attention to things that
weren't getting attention now i love

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.379
that quote

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.260
has because

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.780
he sent mad you love the whole world
know all the crew contractually new

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.560
to protect the ranch

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.790
take the burden has shifted on the
middle class and poor

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.860
shirish

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.590
at some missing that look at the
contrast between rowling

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.779
and romney

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.229
it tells you all you need to know about
ronnie

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.380
and what kind of a man he is
