Hi, I’m Grace.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.930
And I’m Ruth, and we’re students here
at the University of Birmingham.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.950
We know how difficult it can be choosing the
right university.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.470
There are a lot of factors to consider, ranging
from financial aid to your particular course

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.470
of study.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.070
However, we’re confident that the University
of Birmingham is an excellent choice in all

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.910
academic areas, and we’re here to show you
around and help make the decision-making process

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.460
a little bit easier.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.080
The University of Birmingham is known for
its commitment to academic excellence, and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.910
its rankings among other UK and world universities
reflect that excellence annually.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.680
According to the 2013 Complete University
Guide, Birmingham ranks 23rd out of 116 institutions,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.370
with nearly 30 subjects individually ranking
in the top 20.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.900
The University has always been at the forefront
of research.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.280
Eight alumni and staff members have been recognized
with Nobel Prizes.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.240
Furthermore, according to the most recent
Research Assessment Exercise results, 90%

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.210
of the University’s research has global
reach, meaning it’s recognised internationally

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.510
for its originality, significance and rigor.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.660
The RAE ranks research subjects individually,
and the most recent results placed the following

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.770
areas in the top ten.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.580

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.780
For many students and their families, fees
and funding are one of the biggest factors

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.040
when it comes to choosing a university.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.190

students from all walks of life in achieving

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.190
