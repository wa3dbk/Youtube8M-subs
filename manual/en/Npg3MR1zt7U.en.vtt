Hello, this is Jory Caron, host of "Is it a Good Idea to Microwave This?" In case 
 you guys don't know, this is, like, an informative little thing right here. Check this out!

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:25.948
Take your mouse, bring it over to "subscribe," left 
 click! Congratulations! You can now watch this episode!

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.694
Jory: Is it a good idea to microwave this?

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:39.031
Let's find out! Here at the Jory Caron Laboratory, safety is our number-one concern. And that's 
 why we hide behind this giant tin foil shield. It's to protect our nuts...

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.673
Jon: Jory! You forgot about Richard Allen!

00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:52.009
Oh, yeah, the mouse right here? Donated by Richard Allen. Thanks, Richard! A bunch of 
 other people donated mice, but this one was the mousiest of the mice!

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:56.119
Jon: Should we mention the other people who donated mice to us?

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:00.392
Oh... Thank you, Donnie Norris and wow4ever!

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.296
Jon: Yeah! Thanks, everybody!

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:05.964
Jory: Okay, let's go!

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:06.969
Jon: Into the laboratory!

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:07.699
*clicking of mouse*

00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:18.301
Jory: We also have these fans. They're to circulate the air. No one really 
 cares! And here's the Sharp carousel microwave. Her name's Tracy, I believe.

00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:19.601
Jon: It's Tracy!

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:28.980
Jon: I'm so glad that we're finally back in Sharp territory, because, for awhile 
 there, plus two episodes with Vanessa, we were GE-Sharp territory all over!

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.156
Riley: (in exaggerated Boston accent) It's shah-p!

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.257
Jory: (in Boston accent) Shah-p! This one's shah-p!

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:34.601
Riley: Shah-p territory!

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.660
Jory: How do you like your cheddar? Shah-p!

00:01:35.573 --> 00:01:37.573
Riley: Shah-p cheddar!

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:40.964
Jory: So, in goes the mouse. I'm gonna put it 
 up like that, just so, hopefully, you can...

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.370
Jon: That is a clever idea!

00:01:42.772 --> 00:01:44.770
Jory: I know!

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.940
I wonder how long I should put it in there for?

00:01:46.807 --> 00:01:48.810
Jon: Riley, I'll give this one to you!

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:52.280
Uh... Seven minutes?

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:57.110
Jon: Alright! He has a good idea for 
 once, you useless son of a bitch!

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:58.820
Alright, let's get outta here!

00:01:59.722 --> 00:02:05.720
Jon: And... rock! Alright, we're in. The mouse is underway! I 
 think I saw a spark, but I'm not positive.

00:02:04.784 --> 00:02:08.780
Jory: Yeah, it's probably from the inhaler... No! That's from inside the mouse.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.430
Jon: Oh, yes! We have...

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.030
Riley: Somethin' good!

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:14.670
Jon: Yes! The laser is optic-izing!

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.970
Jory: It's optic-izing, that's for sure!

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.140
Riley: Oh, dear! It's smoking!

00:02:17.904 --> 00:02:19.900
Jory: Oh! It just popped! Did you guys see it hop there?

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:22.870
Jon: Nah, you're makin' this [beep] up!

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.520
Jory: No, it actually hopped!

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.410
Jon: Dude, you're makin' this up!

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:27.730
Jory: (in silly voice) It's glowing inside!

00:02:28.382 --> 00:02:30.380
Riley: Wow! Wow-ie-wow!

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:30.890
Jory: Wow-ie-wow-wow!

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:39.550
Jon: It's pretty foggy. If it catches on fire, I'd suppose you'd find out 
 about it, right? Yeah! Just like the iPod! I ask, and I receive!

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.640
Jory: So now, I'm gonna go in there and turn that bad boy off.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.090
Riley: Can I get the fire extinguisher?

00:02:42.447 --> 00:02:44.450
Jory and Jon: NO!

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:45.200
Riley: Damn!

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.160
Jon: Let's go find out why it is still burning!

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.570
Riley: Ah! Masks on!

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.670
Jon: There's a high level of smoke in the air tonight.

00:02:51.688 --> 00:02:53.690
Riley: Remember, kids- smoking is what? BAD!

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:58.340
Jory: Bad for you! Smokey says, "Don't try this at home!" Ready?

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:03.050
Jon: Whee! Tracy handled that one like a pro!

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:07.480
Riley: Oh, dear!

00:03:07.664 --> 00:03:09.660
Jon: Whoa!

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
Jory: I think that's the problem right there...

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.120
Jon: (in midwestern accent) That's why your computer don't work no more, Mr. Robertson!

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:19.030
Jory: You know how when, sometimes you have to talk to Tech 
 Support, their first thing is: "Well, is it plugged in?"

00:03:20.945 --> 00:03:22.940
Jon: Their second question should be: "Did you put it in a microwave?"

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:28.240
Jory: "Did you put the mouse in the microwave? Is it smoking? Is 
it on fire?" That's what they should ask ME, at least...

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:30.980
Riley: Oh, dear! Look at the little tumor it's growing!

00:03:30.744 --> 00:03:34.740
Jory: You may be wondering, is it a good 
idea to microwave a laser optical mouse?

00:03:34.552 --> 00:03:36.550
Jon: Dude, you're just molding it!

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.720
Jory: What the hell?!

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:39.620
Jon: Look at the ergonomics on that mouse! 
 It's whatever you want it to be!

00:03:41.555 --> 00:03:43.560
Jory: It's memory! It's a memory mouse, actually.

00:03:43.824 --> 00:03:45.820
Jon: It's a memory phone mouse!

00:03:45.525 --> 00:03:48.520
Jory: I'm gonna go ahead and say it's NOT 
 a good idea to microwave a mouse.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:51.070
Jon: Because, frankly, you can buy a betterly, egronomically designed mouse.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:53.040
Jory: "Betterly"?!

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:54.520
Jon: That's what I said!

00:03:53.433 --> 00:04:03.430
Jory: That's Logitech- "betterly ergonomic." So, that's it for "Is it a Good Idea to 
 Microwave This?" I'm your host, Jory Caron, and I'll see ya next week. 'Bye!

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:10.340
*end credits play*

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.120
Riley: That's not the first time I've heard 
 that noise before! (slaps on glove) Alright!
