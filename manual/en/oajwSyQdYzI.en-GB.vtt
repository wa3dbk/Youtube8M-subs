00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.280
(Don't take this disclaimer seriously)

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.320
Video made for fun in 2012. Also I'ma add subtitles to this. Pointlessly.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.080
(Yay, YouTube vid corruption)

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.820
ABE: This is Rupture Farms.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.760
They say it's the biggest meat processing plant on Oddworld.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.660
I used to work here...

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.840
Well, I was really a slave...

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.860
Like all the others.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.720
That's me.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.940
My name is Abe.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.540
I was employee of the year.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.960
Now, I'm dead meat.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.600
I crossed the meanest boss in the world...

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.560
Molluck, the Glukkon.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.000
My whole life changed, in just one day.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.100
I was working late one night...

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.780
At Rupture Farms.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.640
We used to make "Meech Munchies"...

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.600
Until the meeches were through.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
We still made "Paramite Pies"...

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.540
And we made some good "Scrab Cakes", too.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.500
I thought I had a good job.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.094
But that was before I knew...

00:02:24.094 --> 00:02:28.234
How we'd make "New 'n' Tasty", I was still to find.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.700
The truth, it turned out...

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.820
Now that would blow my mind.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.900
The Glukkons were scared, 'cause profits were grim.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.600
SLIG: Okay, boss. Here ya are!

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.700
GLUKKONS: [unintelligable sounds of disapproval]

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.040
ABE: Paramites and Scrabs had been turning up thin.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.980
MOLLUCK: As you can see, things are going down.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.900
GLUKKON: What'cha gonna do about it, huh Molluck?!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.520
MOLLUCK: Watch.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.060
ABE: But Molluck was cool.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.640
He had a plan.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.840
GLUKKON: Ah-ha!

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.120
ABE: This new kind of meat...

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.880
It was us!

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.660
MOLLUCK: We've got plenty of Mudokons! We'll chop them up!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.280
[Manic cackling, evil laughter]

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.320
ABE: I just had to escape...

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.200
I just had to be free...

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.000
And I didn't even know,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.220
I had a destiny.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:54.880
So...

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.680
GET ME OUTTA HERE!

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:11.360
AUTHOR: See video description for more coherent credits...

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.740
I think I was high or something when I wrote these.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.240
But at least you get to look behind the scenes!

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.560
