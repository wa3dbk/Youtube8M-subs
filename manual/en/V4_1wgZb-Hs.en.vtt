00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.180
Let’s talk about safety while you are gone
and the dog is alone in the car. You may want

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.680
to take your dog’s collar off while he is
in the car so he doesn’t catch it on something

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.690
and choke. Also, make sure that your dog doesn’t
sit in a hot car. Are you aware how hot it

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:30.680
can get in your car in just a few minutes?
Excessive heat can cause brain damage, breathing

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.460
difficulties and any death. A like colored
car and rolling down your windows a few inches

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.219
can help. Keep in mind the more your windows
are down, the more easily someone can steal

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.379
Fluffy. Another thing about windows if the
engine is running an open back window will

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:59.160
allow dangerous carbon monoxide into the vehicle.
Look very carefully for pens, coins, sharp

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.920
objects and anything that you would not want
a bored dog to swallow. Next to the seats

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.831
and under the seats are places where these
things hide. In fact, here is some paper and

00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:13.580
a pen here and you can use a ruler to get
those things out if you need to. Believe me

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.970
your dog will find these things if you don’t.
Let’s talk about bitter apple spray. It

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.869
works well for most dogs. You can spray it
on items so your dog won’t chew on them.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.640
They don’t like the taste or the smell.
If you have a puppy or dog that mauls or bites

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.890
you or nips you, you can even put the bitter
apple spray on your arms and hands. You can

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.119
also spray it at the dog’s mouth but never
the eyes. Soon your dog will be conditioned

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.700
to stop in the middle of doing something unwanted
even by just seeing you hold the bottle. Lastly

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.929
dogs riding in the back of open truck beds
should either be in a kennel or a harness.
