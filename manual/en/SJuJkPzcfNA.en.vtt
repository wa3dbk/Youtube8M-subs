00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:26.108
Welcome to the free practice!

00:00:27.071 --> 00:00:28.699
I actually want to be a rally driver...

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:33.182
...and coincidentally Ford came up with the Focus RS 
and invited us to come and drive it.

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:35.309
So I'm completely going wild right now.

00:00:45.107 --> 00:00:49.315
Ford was kind enough to invite us 
to drive this car in Southern France.

00:00:49.677 --> 00:00:52.789
Yeah, very nice but the weather 
here is just like in Holland...

00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.729
...it's raining, it's 3 degrees centigrade, 
wet snow is coming down so now and then...

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.279
...and if we follow the test route and go up
a bit higher, we actually end up in the snow.

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:09.117
The Focus RS seems familiar 
because we know the Focus ST...

00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:13.826
...I've driven it once, a bright orange one. 
It's a very good car.

00:01:14.072 --> 00:01:19.035
And the guys from Ford have a very nice saying 
about the similarity between the RS and the ST.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:25.316
They say: "The ST is like a dolphin 
while the RS is more like a shark.

00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:31.232
They are both well-developed animals but 
one is a bit more playfull than the other."

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:37.758
The Focus RS is a rally machine. 
So what is it up against?

00:01:37.905 --> 00:01:44.166
The Subaru Impreza WRX, 
the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo X, those kind of cars.

00:01:44.276 --> 00:01:49.083
Also the VW Golf R32 comes close 
but it has a lot less horsepower.

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:55.680
But there is one big difference,
all of those cars are four-wheel-drive...

00:01:55.681 --> 00:02:00.081
...but Ford didn't think they'd need that 
so they've only given it front-wheel-drive.

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:05.420
And still you'd think that front-wheel-drive
combined with 305 HP would be a mess.

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:07.471
No! It really isn't that bad.

00:02:07.472 --> 00:02:09.863
Of course you can break the 
traction very easily...

00:02:10.116 --> 00:02:15.311
...but if you're a bit carefull you can really 
accelerate out of corners very, very quickly. 

00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.233
It's really bizarre.

00:02:19.763 --> 00:02:21.064
It's an absolute monster.

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:27.070
It's top speed is 163 mph and it does 0-62 
in 5.9 seconds. That's really quick.

00:02:27.663 --> 00:02:34.119
The torque curve is fantastic so you can just keep going, 
even when you're just driving on normal roads.

00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:35.153
It's unbelievable.

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:43.147
The engine doesn't need a lot of revs to come 
alive, even low down it picks up very nicely.

00:02:43.557 --> 00:02:46.941
But the real fun starts at around 2500 rpm...

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.217
...that's when the turbo kicks in and then
 this thing is just so quick.

00:02:54.305 --> 00:02:57.997
The nice thing about this RS is 
that it is very 'adjustable'.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.884
You can just drive it to the limit.

00:03:01.196 --> 00:03:07.637
First you get some understeer, but you can 
feel it coming through the steering wheel.

00:03:07.913 --> 00:03:11.942
If you lift off in a corner, the back 
will come round nicely...

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.350
...you should be able to get it completely sideways...

00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:18.267
...but to be honest I haven't really 
tried that on these narrow mountain roads.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.432
But it's really a car to find the limit with. 
It's really suitable for that.

00:04:02.032 --> 00:04:08.458
In Geneva I spoke with Jost Capito, 
the head of Ford Motorsport.

00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:13.497
He explained how the front suspension 
works and why it is this good.

00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:15.507
The front suspension is called 'RevoKnuckle'.

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:19.454
Normally you've got the McPherson suspension 
but now they've sort of split that.

00:04:19.455 --> 00:04:21.125
The steering axle is now separated...

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:25.060
...so they were able to put the strut 
closer to the centre of the wheel...

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.687
...and now it doesn't move 
about that much anymore.

00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:35.103
That means the camber of the wheel remains
the same. If it stays flat, it's better.

00:04:35.195 --> 00:04:42.674
That's one of the tricks Ford has 
used to give the RS more traction.

00:04:48.876 --> 00:04:52.139
This car was tested extensively on the 
NÃ¼rburgring, over 3000 miles...

00:04:52.261 --> 00:04:57.188
...but they only tested it in the winter months 
so Ford hasn't released an official time yet.

00:04:57.432 --> 00:05:01.480
Nice to know is that Ford has a 
handling circuit in Lommel, Belgium...

00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:07.791
...and they drove this car there and it was 
faster than the Ford GT. That's quite something.

00:05:10.832 --> 00:05:16.110
Of course this isn't a cheap car but 
I'm convinced it'll be worth every euro.

00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:19.544
You can have so much fun with this car.

00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:23.524
So if you're into real driving 
and you like this sort of car...

00:05:23.525 --> 00:05:26.358
...just go to the dealer because this is it.

00:05:40.954 --> 00:05:42.317
Drive off straight away!
