Hi, welcome to ABC Open, 
I'm Catherine...

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:11.662
and I'm Benj, in this video we're going to show you
some of the things you can use

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:13.630
to make a mini documentary.

00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:16.479
The first thing you'll need is something 
to record your story with.

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:18.219
You can use a video camera,

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:19.770
a digital SLR,

00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:23.397
a point-and-shoot, or even your smart phone.

00:00:23.407 --> 00:00:28.146
Whichever one you choose, make sure your
lens is clean, your batteries are charged

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:32.438
and make sure you have a large memory
card because video takes up a lot more

00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:34.050
memory than photos.

00:00:34.174 --> 00:00:38.166
Get to know your camera, if you're shooting
with a smart phone make sure

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.508
you shoot horizontally, not vertically.

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.834
Otherwise you end up with large black
stripes down either side of your picture

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:45.649
when you put it on the television.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.539
Also, make sure your lens is at the top,
otherwise you can discover that your

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.247
project is upside-down when you 
import into your computer.

00:00:52.247 --> 00:00:55.882
Make sure you know where the built-in
microphone is, so that you don't

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:57.995
accidentally cover it with your finger.

00:00:57.997 --> 00:01:01.627
Most cameras do have an in-built microphone
but you can also add an

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.343
external microphone like this
to improve your sound.

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:08.842
You want your shots to be sharp;
smart phones, most camcorders

00:01:08.842 --> 00:01:11.198
and point-and-shoot cameras focus automatically,

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:14.237
but with digital SLRs it's a bit 
more tricky.

00:01:14.237 --> 00:01:16.627
I like to focus before I start videoing

00:01:16.631 --> 00:01:21.021
to do this, I either use the AutoFocus
button or I can manually focus

00:01:21.024 --> 00:01:23.298
using the magnification button.

00:01:23.298 --> 00:01:27.618
However I can't use the magnification
button whilst filming and if I try and use

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.149
Auto Focus whilst videoing, 
this is what happens.

00:01:32.536 --> 00:01:36.305
To make sure you get some shots that are
rock-steady, and to give your video

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:39.072
a more professional look a more 
professional look put a tripod in your kit.

00:01:39.072 --> 00:01:44.178
A monopod is also handy, it's a great
option for getting your shots stable

00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:45.556
when you're on the move.

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:49.834
You can even make your own stabilising
device, grab a soft bag of rice

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.723
and you've got a great, sturdy base for 
your camera.

00:01:52.723 --> 00:01:54.242
It's really good for low-shots.

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:58.172
Another option is a wearable camera,
you can mount this camera on a car,

00:01:58.187 --> 00:02:00.242
on a bike or even on your own body.

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:03.462
It's a great way to get footage that feels
like it's right in the thick of it.
