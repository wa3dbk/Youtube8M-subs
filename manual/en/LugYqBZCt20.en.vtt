John: Hey guys, John, here with RealTruck.com.
Today I'm going to show you

00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:10.539
how to install this Wolo electric air horn
onto a Dodge Ram truck. Okay,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.850
guys. We all know how our factory horns sound,
something like this. [horn

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.070
sounds] But we kind of want something a little
bit cooler on our Dodge

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.000
truck. So that's why we're going to put that
Wolo Bad Boy electric air horn

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.079
onto this truck. Then when we get done, we'll
let you see what it sounds

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.710
like.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.679
The first step of replacing any factory horn
is to get it out of the

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.829
vehicle. I've gone ahead and taken this one
out so you can see what's going

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.989
on because it's buried deep in this fender.
They're not all in the same

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.339
location. You'll have to track down the location
of where yours is. So once

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.780
we've got this out, what we want to do is
go ahead and unplug it. That way

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.199
we can use the factory installed horn wiring
which will allow us to

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.909
continue to use our horn button on our steering
wheel.

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.110
What we need to do with our factory wires
because we're going to use the

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.600
factory horn button is go ahead and cut these
ends off. Then we'll need to

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.030
crimp on some of these spade style connectors
onto our wire. The reason why

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.670
we need to do that is because our new horn
system has these spade ends on

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.579
it for negative and positive. We need to have
something other than the

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.890
original wire clips which obviously don't
fit.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.429
Now depending on what make and model of vehicle
you have, yours may have a

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.340
style like that or it may not. We're going
to go ahead and snip these wires

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.340
off of here. In this instance, because we're
not going to have enough space

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.329
in between these, what we're going to have
to do is we're going to have to

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.909
strip this back a little bit to give us some
room to open these up where

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.560
it'll go into our new horn a little bit better.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.210
Once you get those apart, give yourself a
little bit more room and where to

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.950
work with, go ahead and strip those back.
We'll attach the spade connector

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.300
which you can get at just about any hardware
store or your local automotive

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.090
store. You can see these . . . they call them
factory fender plugs or

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.360
something along those lines. What we're going
to do is we're just going to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.420
pop that out. There will be a hole there where
we can fit our new horn

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.930
perfectly right in there with the bolt that
it comes with for mounting.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.920
Right now we're going to go ahead and hook
this up.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.180
Now if you look down inside here, you can
see that these are marked plus

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.180
and minus. Of course, your black is going
to be your minus or your ground,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.040
in this case. So we're going to make sure
we plug that one into the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.600
corresponding connection spot. The other one
will go onto our positive

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.840
side.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.430
So what we want to do is go ahead and pull
this body plug out of here.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.560
Don't worry about it if you accidentally cut
it off or whatever because

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.320
you're not going to reuse it anyway. This
is the mounting bracket for our

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.590
horn right here. We're going to go ahead and
slide that up underneath there

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.940
and put our bolt through. Once we have that
in place we can go ahead and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.940
finish bolting it up. Not keep in mind you
don't need to over tighten that

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.560
because it's not going anywhere. We've got
it wired up. We've got it bolted

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.190
up. Let's go push the button and see how this
thing sounds.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.190
Okay, guys, there you have it. That's all
it takes to install that Wolo

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.210
electric powered air horn onto your car or
truck. So until next time, happy

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.600
motoring.
