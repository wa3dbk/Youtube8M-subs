00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.969
 - I feel like there
 isn't enough emphasis

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:05.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
in life on doing things
that make you happy

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:09.075
   and I feel like if
   we do more things

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.177 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and we promote
 things like the arts,

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:13.646 size:88% position:44%
   I feel like it would just
   be a much better place.

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:19.019 align:start position:0%
 I am interning with an
 organization called ArtReach.

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.990 align:start position:0%
ArtReach partners organizations
that offer art and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.894
cultural experiences such as
the Philadelphia Museum of Art,

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.297
   the Penn Museum of
   Art and Theater,

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.566
and we bring those organizations

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:36.569 align:start size:88% position:13%
in connection with human
service organizations

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.338
and those are made up of people

00:00:38.338 --> 00:00:39.773 align:start size:88% position:13%
   who would like
   access to the arts

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:43.209 align:start position:0% line:0%
  or who have not necessarily
  had the opportunity

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:45.945 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
  to gain that access
  traditionally.

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:47.847 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I got my internship
  with ArtReach

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:50.483
through Civic House at
Penn and so Civic House,

00:00:50.483 --> 00:00:53.720
their entire purpose
is just social advocacy

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.122 align:start position:0%
   and community service
   and just doing good works

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.191
   for the community.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.194
 I think Civic House
 has been really great

00:01:01.194 --> 00:01:04.597 align:start position:0%
   in that they're just
   really intent at making us

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.666
better servers in the community

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.535
  and trying to equip
  us with the tools

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:10.170
   that are necessary
   to make it so that

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.439
   we can actually
   have a difference.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.308 size:88% position:44%
   I feel like Penn
   perfectly couples

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:19.512
  pre-professional experience
  with creative experiences.

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:24.484 align:start position:0%
  While the university
  stresses how important it is

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:27.520
  to gain the necessary tools
  and things of that nature

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.056 align:start position:0%
  to go out into the
  workforce and be successful,

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:33.226 align:start size:88% position:13%
I also feel like they've
made it very possible

00:01:33.226 --> 00:01:34.894 size:88% position:44%
   in giving me the
   tools and outlets

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.597 align:start size:88% position:13%
 such as organizations
 like Civic House

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:40.166 size:88% position:44%
   and they've given
   us other outlets

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.402
  so that we can pair that
  pre-professional experience

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.804
 with the personal experiences.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.676
 As far as what I want
 to do in the future,

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.312 align:start position:0%
  I'm really trying to
  figure out how I can couple

00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:56.149
 the legal profession
 with arts management.

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:59.018 align:start size:88% position:13%
  I think that will
  be a good way for me

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.254
  to like officially
  affect change within

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.923
  the arts community.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.092
 I think art's awesome.

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.528
   Everyone should do
   something artistic

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:10.830
in their lifetime, just try it.
