00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:10.500
50 years ago Barbie Millicent Roberts first
appeared before the world of toys. Barbie,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.630
as everyone called her, has become one of
the most successful toy in history.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.870
Ruth Handler watched her daughter Barbara
play with paper dolls, and noticed that she

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:24.390
often enjoyed giving them adult roles. At
the time, most children's toy dolls were representations

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.040
of infants. Realizing that there could be
a gap in the market, Handler suggested the

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.990
idea of an adult-bodied doll to her husband
Elliot, a co-founder of the Mattel toy company.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.680
During a trip to Europe in 1956 Ruth Handler
saw a German doll called Bild Lilli. The adult-figured

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.440
doll was exactly what Handler had in mind,
so she purchased three of them and took them

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.749
to Mattel. The Lilli was based on a popular
character appearing in a comic strip. Lilli

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.050
was a blonde bombshell, a working girl. The
Lilli doll was first sold in Germany in 1956.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.589
Mattel acquired the rights to the Bild Lilli
in 1964 . The first Barbie doll wore a black

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.820
and white zebra striped swimsuit and signature
topknot ponytail, and was available as either

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.170
a blonde or brunette. The doll was marketed
as a "Teen-age Fashion Model," with her clothes

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.980
created by Mattel fashion designer Charlotte
Johnson. The first Barbie dolls were manufactured

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.690
in Japan, with their clothes hand-stitched.
Around three hundred and fifty thousand Barbieâ€™s

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.340
were sold within a year.
According to Barbie's parents, the Mattel

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.350
Company, 90% of all American girls between
3 and 10 have had at least one Barbie.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.100
Today, however, Barbie is facing an identity
crisis. There are many rivals in market. Bratz

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.610
dolls, for example, came to life seven years
ago. They look more like today's pop stars

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.910
with lots of makeup and miniskirts. Bratz
is a challenge for Barbie, as the company

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.350
offers a wide variety of clothing too.
Indeed, sales have been going down over the

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.860
past year, partly because of the world's economic
crisis.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.150
Barbie still has a lot going for her. More
and more doll lovers all over the globe have

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.660
become collectors. They trade Barbies or buy
them on eBay. Other look for special and rare

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.350
Barbie dolls, like Scarlett O'Hara from "Gone
with the Wind".

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.150
On the international scene, Barbie remains
number one. Although Mattel has been selling

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.209
fewer Barbies in the United States over the
past year. In January Mattel opened its first

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.019
Barbie store in Shanghai, where girls can
shop, eat or even become their own fashion

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.159
designer.
Barbie is present in the virtual world at

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.900
Barbiegirls.com. users can play games and
chat with other Barbie fans. there are Facebook

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.980
groups and YouTube channels.
Barbie has changed her image many times over

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.389
the past decades. Originally she wore blond
pony tails and had bright red lips. In the

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.939
80s she changed to a more colourful neon look.
For her 50th birthday Mattel is planning some

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.349
big events. Fashion designers from all over
the world have been called to make new clothes

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.439
for Barbie. She is also scheduled to be a
big star during a New York fashion week.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.930
How long will Barbie stay on as a celebrity
in the world of toys. Hard to stay, but 50

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.829
is definitely not the age to retire.
