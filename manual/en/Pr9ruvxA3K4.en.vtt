00:00:02.585 --> 00:00:04.889
That's a very
grave charge, son.

00:00:04.954 --> 00:00:09.563
Are you aware that it's unlawful
to practice medicine without
a medical license ?

00:00:09.626 --> 00:00:11.296
Yes, sir, l am.

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:15.202
Are you aware that running a medical
clinic without the proper licensing...

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.536
can place both you
and the public...

00:00:17.601 --> 00:00:19.705
in a great deal of danger ?

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.741
ls a home a clinic, sir ?

00:00:21.806 --> 00:00:24.945
lf you are admitting patients
and treating them...

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.481
physical location
is irrelevant.

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:31.320
Sir, will you define
treatment for me ?

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:36.159
Yes. Treatment would be defined
as the care of a patient
seeking medical attention.

00:00:37.357 --> 00:00:40.663
Have you been treating patients,
Mr. Adams ?

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:43.732
l live with several people.
They come and go as they please.

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:45.734
l offer them
whatever help l can.

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:47.869
Mr. Adams...

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:52.043
have you or have you not
been treating patients at your ranch ?

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:57.515
Everyone who comes to the ranch
is a patient, yes.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.451
[ Murmuring ]

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:03.788
And every person who comes
to the ranch is also a doctor.

00:01:05.787 --> 00:01:08.025
l'm sorry ?

00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:10.628
Every person who comes
to the ranch is in need...

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.432
of some form of physical
or mental help.

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:15.434
They're patients.

00:01:15.498 --> 00:01:20.877
But also every person who comes
to the ranch is in charge of
taking care of someone else--

00:01:20.938 --> 00:01:22.908
whether it's cooking for them,
cleaning them...

00:01:22.973 --> 00:01:25.878
or even as simple a task
as listening.

00:01:25.943 --> 00:01:27.880
That makes them doctors.

00:01:27.945 --> 00:01:33.256
l use that term broadly, but is not a
doctor someone who helps someone else ?

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:37.460
When did the term ''doctor'' get
treated with such reverence, as,
''Right this way, Doctor Smith''...

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:40.462
or, ''Excuse me, Dr. Scholl
what wonderful footpads''...

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:44.233
or, ''Pardon me, Dr. Patterson,
but your flatulence has no odor'' ?

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:46.901
[ Laughing, Murmuring ]

00:01:46.966 --> 00:01:50.540
At what point in history
did a doctor become more...

00:01:50.603 --> 00:01:54.845
than a trusted and learned friend
who visited and treated the ill ?

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:58.080
Now, you ask me if
l've been practicing medicine.

00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:01.252
Well, if this means opening
your door to those in need--

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:03.687
those in pain--

00:02:03.752 --> 00:02:09.163
caring for them, listening
to them, applying a cold cloth
until a fever breaks--

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:11.528
if this is practicing medicine,
if this is treating a patient...

00:02:11.593 --> 00:02:14.165
then l am guilty
as charged, sir.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.836
Did you consider the ramifications
of your actions ?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.205
What if one of your patients
had died ?

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.607
What's wrong
with death, sir ?

00:02:22.672 --> 00:02:25.144
What are we so mortally
afraid of ?

00:02:25.208 --> 00:02:28.481
Why can't we treat death with
a certain amount of humanity
and dignity and decency...

00:02:28.545 --> 00:02:31.183
and, God forbid,
maybe even humor ?

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:33.185
Death is not the enemy,
gentlemen.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.189
lf we're gonna fight a disease,
Iet's fight one of the most
terrible diseases of all--

00:02:36.253 --> 00:02:38.190
indifference.

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:42.330
Now, l've sat in your schools and heard
people lecture on transference...

00:02:42.393 --> 00:02:44.331
and professional distance.

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.901
Transference
is inevitable, sir.

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:49.503
Every human being
has an impact on another.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:53.042
Why don't we want that in
a patientldoctor relationship ?

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:57.515
That's why l've listened to your
teachings, and l believe they're wrong.

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:01.484
A doctor's mission should be
not just to prevent death...

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.685
but also to improve
the quality of life.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:06.923
That's why you treat a disease,
you win, you lose.

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:12.231
You treat a person, l guarantee you,
you win, no matter what the outcome.
