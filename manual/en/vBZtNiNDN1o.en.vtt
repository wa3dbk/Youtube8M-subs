00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.300
This is the ESOcast!

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.640
Cutting-edge science and life behind the scenes

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.580
at ESO, the European Southern Observatory.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.280
Tourists will know Chile as a land of

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.580
natural wonders and dry deserts.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800
Few know that one of Chile's most precious

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.430
assets is its pristine night sky.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.600
In an almost unworldly location in the Chilean Andes,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.420
ALMA is nearing completion.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.250
The Chajnantor Plateau at 5000 metres altitude.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.510
The largest ground-based astronomical project in existence.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.000
The single-dish APEX telescope is also

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.400
on the Chajnantor Plateau.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.040
ALMA studies the building blocks of stars,

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.000
planetary systems, galaxies and life itself.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.620
ESOcast is produced by ESO, the European Southern Observatory.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.900
ESO, the European Southern Observatory,

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.800
is the pre-eminent intergovernmental science and technology organisation in astronomy,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.800
Among both ground and space-based observatories, ESO is the most productive observatory in the world.
