00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.760
London is a city shaped by its historic layout.
And transport is about more than just getting from A to B.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.840
Transport is absolutely critical in the way we live our lives.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.340
If we get our transport system right
we can make London ever more liveable…

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.000
…and we can make it ever more economically attractive as well.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.750
Cycling on London’s main roads has almost
trebled over the past decade.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.910
24% of all vehicles in central London
in the morning rush hour are now bikes…

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.090
…and on some routes it’s two thirds of all vehicles.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.090
To cater for this, the Mayor plans to transform provisions for cycling.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.590
The idea of the Mayor’s Cycling Vision means
less crowding on the Tube, it means fewer cars on the streets…

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.000
…it means less pollution, it means less congestion…

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.460
…it means less competition for parking spaces,
it means fewer cars in front of yours at the lights.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.440
Investing in cycling makes life better for everyone.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.900
The funding that supports the Mayor’s Vision is substantial.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.750
We are spending almost £1bn – £913m –
over a ten-year period on this programme.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.630
The Vision's success depends on the cooperation 
of the 32 London boroughs and the City of London…

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.350
…the Canal and River Trust, Network Rail,
the Royal Parks, a whole host of other agencies.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.120
Their combined efforts could persuade
millions of Londoners to try cycling.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:34.000
In both inner and outer London, 4.3m trips made every day
could be made by bike…

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.280
…and 80% of those trips would take most people
less than 20 minutes to cycle.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.650
I tend to use the bike for short journeys
that might be awkward to go some place by Tube…

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.720
…or it’s a bit longer than I actually want to walk.
It’s a way of getting some place quicker, fast and efficiently.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.820
The streets of central London will be opened up 
to cyclists as never before.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.800
A network of cycle routes will cover central London like a grid…

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.630
…easy to follow as you zip across town.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.310
London’s outer boroughs also have significant
potential for cycling.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:12.750
In outer London, the vast majority of journeys
by car are less than a mile and a half.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.409
Why not make those journeys by bicycle where that’s possible?

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.029
It would greatly civilise and improve our urban existence.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.379
The Mayor has allocated more than £100m over 10 years
to transform cycling in the outer boroughs.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.000
Waltham Forest, Enfield and Kingston-upon-Thames
have been awarded funding through the mini-Hollands programme.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.840
The idea is to make those boroughs
places as good for cycling as their Dutch equivalents would be.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.439
These are going to be fantastic places
for cycling where we help the boroughs…

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.790
…to put in interventions that will encourage large-scale cycling.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.230
That mean redesigns of the town centres,
it means good routes from the town centres…

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.340
…to the rest of the boroughs,
it means cycle hubs at railway stations.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.750
In the mornings I get straight here,
leaving my helmet and my jacket and the lights…

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.320
…and all the paraphernalia behind, and it just means
I jump on the tube as a normal commuter.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.840
People who choose to cycle longer distances
between inner and outer London will benefit…

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.840
…from new and improved Cycle Superhighways.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.489
We are going to do the longest substantially segregated
urban cycle route in western Europe…

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.900
…that’s going to go all the way from Barking
in the east way out to the west.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.180
In both central and outer London, the Superhighways
will link with quiet side streets, or ‘Quietways’.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.000
How the Quietways are going to work is, we’re largely going to use
back roads, side streets, canal towpaths, routes through parks…

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.300
…and we're going to signpost routes
which will be beautiful and interesting and quiet and peaceful.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.400
And people who are new to cycling and nervous about cycling…

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.299
…will enjoy them a lot more than they enjoy
pounding along the main road.

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.969
People new to cycling can get free or discounted
training through their borough…

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.969
…before they head out onto the new cycling network.

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.000
I think the best thing I did was have a cycling lesson.
It gave me so much more confidence. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.219
I felt much safer on the road. I learnt a few rules 
that just made me feel that I could cope with anything.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.279
Ensuring that cyclists feel safe is a big
part of the Mayor’s Vision.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.340
We will be looking to provide segregation
of some routes where that's necessary…

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.940
…especially through junctions where we feel 
that cyclists need more protection.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.320
A network of joined-up, signposted, safer
routes will make end-to-end cycle journeys…

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.200
…easier than ever before,
encouraging an 8-to-80 cycling culture throughout London.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.750
We are looking at a slightly different
group of people, perhaps slightly older people…

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.400
…slightly more women, people from different ethnic communities.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.380
If we can crack that one, we really are into very serious 
levels of cycling right across the city.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.290
In 5 or 10 years’ time what we’ll see
is a city where people feel safer cycling…

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.800
…feel confident cycling, and choose to cycle
because they really enjoy the experience.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.870
London will be a city with a world-class transport
and cycling network.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.840
Cycling is hugely important because
it’s the cleanest, greenest way of getting around…

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.650
…and it gets you fittest and makes you feel better.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.840
