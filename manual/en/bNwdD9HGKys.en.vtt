Hello, my name is Ana

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.524
I am a veterinarian and
I work for EFSA.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:17.395
I am here to talk to you about
non-foodborne zoonotic diseases.

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:20.393
A zoonosis is a disease
that is naturally transmitted

00:00:20.394 --> 00:00:23.270
between animals and humans.

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:28.945
There are 200 zoonotic
 diseases described.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:36.930
We think that 75% of the diseases
that emerged in the last 10 years

00:00:36.931 --> 00:00:41.794
have origins from animals
or products of animal origin.

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:46.372
We often think about zoonoses
as foodborne diseases

00:00:46.373 --> 00:00:50.728
– for example salmonellosis,
a disease that is contracted

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.393
by the consumption of
contaminated food.

00:00:53.393 --> 00:00:56.293
But there are other ways
of transmission, and

00:00:56.294 --> 00:01:03.750
you might remember a disease called
plague, a disease caused by a bacteria

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:08.628
originated in rats and
transmitted by flea bites.

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:12.785
We think this disease decimated
approximately one third of the human

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:15.441
population during the Middle Ages.

00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:23.100
Or another important disease – rabies –
a disease of carnivores

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:27.102
and bats, transmitted
mostly by bites.

00:01:27.103 --> 00:01:32.207
This disease still causes
55,000 deaths a year.

00:01:32.208 --> 00:01:35.217
So how are these diseases transmitted?

00:01:35.218 --> 00:01:41.799
Well, they can be transmitted
by direct contact.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.074
For example, for avian flu,
we think most human cases

00:01:46.075 --> 00:01:52.262
originated from contact with
live or dead infected poultry.

00:01:52.263 --> 00:02:01.975
Or through vectors – for example,
Lyme disease is transmitted

00:02:01.976 --> 00:02:06.374
by the bite of infected ticks
that transmit the disease between

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:10.813
various hosts, for example deer, or
animals and humans.

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:16.500
But also via air.

00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:23.375
Q fever, a disease  mostly of ruminants,
is mostly transmitted via air

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:27.750
and it was responsible in 2010
for a very large outbreak

00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:30.668
in the Netherlands causing
many deaths.

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:36.269
What can we do in terms of preventing
and controlling these diseases?

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.269
Well, there are complex diseases
where hosts, humans or animals – live domestic

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.351
animals or wildlife – interact with
pathogens, and these can be virus,

00:02:51.352 --> 00:02:57.750
bacteria or fungi, but where the
environment also plays a role.

00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:01.851
The key to preventing and
controlling these diseases is

00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:06.782
to understand this complex interaction,
and we think that for that,

00:03:06.783 --> 00:03:10.080
a multidisciplinary approach
where medical doctors,

00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:14.779
veterinarians and other scientists
collaborate is the solution.
