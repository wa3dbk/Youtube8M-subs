00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.870
I know there's already a video about
leading lines within this section

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.580
but leading lines aren't just about finding a river and the right location

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.070
for a leading line you can find leading
lines in the environment all over the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.550
place

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.679
for example, look what we've got going on here

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.600
now that's a very very very strong
leading line coming up through the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.150
picture

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.619
leading you back to me, and if step out to the side a bit you can see that

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.580
even if I wasn't in the shot this
leading line is still coming around here

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.599
and taking you up to the door of the priory

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.460
and the tree and the building and if we had a blue sky going on you'd have a nice blue

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.440
sky up there instead of just

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.079
a white area where the cloud is. To find a leading line

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.530
it's more about four and moving yourself
around two line elements up

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.239
so let's go and look for some up.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.469
Here's another classic leading line for you, look at

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.440
this wall is running all the way along
here from the cooler the picture

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.420
all the way off into the distance taking you to the door of the priory

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.170
and the building beyond, it's absolutely
brilliant and it's so easy.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.750
But how did we find that?

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
Right, i came wandering here from over here

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.080
we went came up the path here

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.280
and then you just sort of wander round the corner

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.659
and here we go you see, looking up towards the priory, and as you could probably

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:24.659
already see we've got this

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.040
footpath going on, now the foot path is itself a

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.610
leading line, and if you just take a picture
from pretty much where you're standing

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.450
now

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.299
like this. Turn my camera on, it helps.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.619
we've already got a

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.509
leading line going on in the foreground
up to the Priory

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.869
its kinda natural. But the strength has increased

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.100
by bringing into the edge and really pushing it in through the picture

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.740
picture

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.020
and that was done by using this wall and to film me just now

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.850
Jane was lying on the floor here with
the video camera

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.899
propped up on that little tiny

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.040
stone there like that so the camera

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.459
is looking that way and of and it's the
wide angle at the lens which is picking

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.530
up all the stuff that's going on in the
background

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.920
so this is my understanding your lenses to an extent as well in order to achieve these

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.379
things,

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.500
but let me take that picture, how would you take that picture? well you have to first of all

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.450
not be too embarrassed when everyone
stares at you when you lay on the ground

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.290
like this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.629
So i'm going to get in low and get that leading line into the corner,

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.000
because this is a very

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.970
big depth of field we want for this shot. I'm using

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.459
f11 there we go, so there you go.

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.420
that's that leading line recorded with
the camera you see how easy this is

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.629
let's go and look for another one.
