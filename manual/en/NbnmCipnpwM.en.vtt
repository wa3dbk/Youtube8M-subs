THE PRACTICAL GUY 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.180
Hi there welcome to my laboratory 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.040
Today I'm going to make an amazing experiment 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm going to show you how to turn this simple bottle...

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.200
...into something... just crazy. 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.040
Safety first! 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.820
I will use a big plastic bottle and isopropyl alcohol 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.960
Isopropyl alcohol is not very easy to find though

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.320
Put just a little bit of the alcohol into the bottle 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720
Shake it 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.020
Now see what happens when it burns 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.300
See?
