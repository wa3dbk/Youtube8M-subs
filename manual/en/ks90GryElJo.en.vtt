00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.290
So now we're ready to sew the body of the
messenger bag. We already have the strap made,

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.889
we're ready to go on that. And now we need
to make the body of this messenger bag and

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.670
we're going to sew it along both sides of
these seams and then serge it off. So let's

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.370
just go ahead and start sewing it. And this
is where I had those holes on that one side.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.700
And I'm not even worried about that because
they don't have to be exact, exact, but just

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:29.800
kind of. Because it's my friend's purse and
she's not too worried about that. As long

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.400
as I don't have holes showing. So I'm just
going to start sewing a straight line down.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:42.320
I'm going to go all the way to the bottom
and make sure that you back tack here. And

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.720
at the bottom, make sure that you back tack
also, it's very important. There we go. So

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.820
now I'm going to go over here on this side.
And my fabric is really flimsy, so I'm just

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:05.320
going to kind of lay it where I want it and
smooth it over. There you go... and these

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.970
seams are going to be on the inside and we're
going to serge them because we don't want

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.490
them fraying. So I'm going to hold it like
this, and this is the bottom, and I'm going

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.810
to measure from here to here to make sure
that that's seventeen inches. Yeah, it's seventeen

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.352
inches right there. I'm going to start at
the very bottom, and then tack it. I like

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:30.020
to start at the very bottom because I know
that if the bottom is straight then the top

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:39.080
is going to be straight. Smooth it over...then
smooth this over. And when I get to the top

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.150
over here, I'm going to actually measure it
again. So I have a ruler down here so I'm

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.990
going to measure this again as seventeen inches.
That'll be about right here, so I'll just

00:01:50.990 --> 00:02:00.010
hold it. When you get up here to the top you
need to make sure you back tack it. And before

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.759
we're finished with making the body of this
bag what we need to do is serge these seams

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.810
in the same color of thread that we sewed
with that. So in the next clip I'm going to

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.470
show you how to serge this off so we'll do
that next.
