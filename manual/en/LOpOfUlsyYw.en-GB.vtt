00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.920
Peter is new to the north Queensland coast, and about to amaze the world.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.400
The mayor's daughter, Margaret is the brainiest girl in school,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.160
but just can't get it right at home.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.620
I can't help myself - when I do an exam, the answer just...comes.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.820
Wayne's the Donut King's son, and the school bully, to boot.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.160
Peter!

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.220
Ahh!

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.200
Who unfortunately, drops into their lives.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.980
Wayne! You scared us to death, Wayne.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.180
Together, this unlikely trio is about to rewrite history.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.400
It's a boat, Wayne. A very old one.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.780
The truth now, Wayne.
Tell Daddy the truth.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.620
If you tell us where you got them, I'll let
you play with my gun.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.500
On the boat from Rome.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.500
It's fantastic! This is amazing!

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.980
It's just an old boat.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.540
And old boat that will make Gamma famous!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.840
We're doing it, Pete. We're making a fortune.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840
What's happening, Daddy?

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.000
Nothing. They tested the boat and they found traces of varnish and Dulux high gloss.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.619
That boat's about as Roman as The Pope!
We've all been tricked.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.440
The Gamma boat's a fake.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.600
The fun-filled Peter &amp; Pompey.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.120
It's Kate's 14th birthday. She's a very special girl.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.060
First champagne birthday for our daughter, Kate.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.920
But Kate's world is about to be shaken.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.120
Dad? Why didn't you tell me?

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.840
You could have just said no, of course you're not adopted, and that would have been the end of it.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.520
I can't lie. Not to Kate.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.480
Sometimes you have to lie to protect people.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.539
I want to find out who my mother is.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.380
Why? Why do you want to know who she is?

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.360
Because she's my real mother.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.240
It's her. I've got her number.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.220
Why did you come here? I told you not to.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.420
I had to come.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.800
I've got a husband who doesn't know you exist.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.480
Did mum have you before she met my dad?

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.260
We're sisters.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.020
The heart-warming Princess Kate.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.239
Alice and her mother had been happy for years.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.020
Alice. Do you know who I am?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.960
You're my useless, no-good father.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.880
Whether you like it or not, Alice - he's a
part of our lives.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.960
I just want us to have a go at being a proper family, alright?

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.400
No, it's not alright.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.020
You think you can just come and go whenever you like, and then run away again.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.580
Alice!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.220
Alice decides it's time to take to the road.
Along the way, she meets up with Mick, another runaway.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.080
We've been on the road for seventeen hours.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.400
Wake up, you mongrel!

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.580
Keep an eye out for crocs.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.040
Where else could she be?

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.340
How on earth would I know?

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:27.540
Look out!
