00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.910
Welcome to step number three of the cornrow
tree braids hairstyle in this step I will

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
be sharing with you some haircare tips that
will apply with your new style to help you

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.490
to take care of your hair my very first tip
is to make sure that you are cleansing your

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.619
scalp and braids if you wash your hair maybe
twice a week once a week or every two weeks

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.300
whatever the frequency is that you like to
apply with washing your hair the same thing

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.449
will go with wearing this tree braids hairstyle
so when you are getting ready to wash her

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:44.930
hair make sure to braid your extensions in
large-size braids or put them into large ponytails

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.440
the reason why is because this will prevent
your hair from tangling as you concentrate

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.460
on cleansing your hair and scalp when cleansing
your hair and scalp you want to make sure

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.370
to use the shampoo that you normally use when
washing your hair of your shampoo has a watery

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.100
consistency this is the perfect consistency
to wash with but if your shampoo is a little

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.700
bit thicker than that make sure to place it
inside of the applicator bottle with a little

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.030
bit of water to get it to a very watery consistency
this is very important when using it on your

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.260
braids because this will help you to effectively
cleanse your scalp as well as wash out all

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.890
of your product with ease if you take your
normal shampoo especially if it has a thick

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.179
consistency to wash your hair and will take
you a long time to wash all the soap and a

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.020
lot of soap will build up on your hair over
time and that could lead to breakage so when

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.090
washing your hair wind up all of your extension
hair in large braids or ponytail and then

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.069
use a watery consistency shampoo to wash your
hair and braids my second tip is to make sure

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.929
that you are moisturizing your hair when you're
wearing this tree braids hairstyle you won't

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.859
see your hair until you take out your extensions
so it's hard to gauge whether or not you know

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:04.139
if you need moisturization are not and that's
why daily moisturizing will best so make sure

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:09.759
to put your favorite leaving moisturizer work
conditioner into a small travel size bottle

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.610
with a little bit of water so that it's a
watery consistency the key to keeping your

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.670
hair very moisturized clean and healthy is
that when you are caring for your hair that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.030
all of your products are watered down this
will stop you from adding too much product

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.920
to your hair as well as incorporating all
the moisture that you need so take your favorite

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.140
leaving conditioner or your favorite regular
conditioner whichever you like to use out

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.780
it inside of a small travel size spray bottle
with a little bit of water and then spray

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.420
your braids this will keep your braids moisturized
in the to follow up use your favorite oil

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.580
to spray directly onto your braids and oil
your fingers to run him down the parts of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.620
your scalp my very last tip that I will often
use to make sure that your hair is thoroughly

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.540
dry when wearing this tree braids hairstyle
is very easy to have a buildup of moisture

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.680
if one you had you sweat a lot on your scalp
or you haven't thoroughly dried your hair

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.841
will washing make sure that you're able to
dry your hair by using a hooded drier her

00:03:10.841 --> 00:03:17.380
to sit under the your hair is dry or by using
a bonnet dryer to thoroughly dry your hair

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.600
that's prolonged with moisture and is not
being dried out correctly or enough will lead

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.840
to mildew and sometimes you can tell because
it will have a weird smell so to avoid that

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.540
make sure they always cleansing your hair
moisturizing and drying it so those are all

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.560
of my haircare tips that you will be using
