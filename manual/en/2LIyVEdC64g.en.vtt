00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.990
Hey everyone it's Chad from GadgetGuruHD.com
and this is my full thoughts and comparison

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.320
between the iPad Air and the LG G Pad 8.3
Google Play Edition.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.410
The iPad has been around for a long time and
is the undisputed most popular tablet on the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.530
market, but the Play Edition G Pad also has
a lot going for it.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.930
Which one is best for you?

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.920
Let's find out.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.930
The original iPad really shook up the tablet
market in 2010 and it was another example

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.560
of Apple innovating, but since then there
hasn't been many groundbreaking changes until

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.170
now.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.030
The LG G Pad 8.3 is LG's shot at finding a
midway between the iPad Air and iPad Mini,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.239
it's larger than the Mini but still smaller
than the Air.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.030
Google has taken a real chance with LG as
the 8.3 is the first Google Play Edition tvablet

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:44.119
to be brought 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:55.640
to market.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:25.710
We're going to start off with the build quality,
which may be the best things about each of

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.710
these tablets.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.120
This newer generation got a new design upgrade
from the previous 4th gen iPad.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.870
This makes the iPad Air quite literally a
blown up iPad Mini Retina, which in my opinion

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.590
is a good thing.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.710
Both the Air and G Pad have a solid aluminum
construction that not only looks great, but

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.390
also feels great.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.050
The G Pad has more of a brushed aluminum look
while the Air has a solid color, either space

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.569
grey or silver.

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.021
The only thing I've been disappointed with
is the speakers on both the iPad and also

00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.900
G Pad.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.220
The G Pad's speakers are located on the back
which makes them an ideal location to be covered

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.840
up and muffled.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.830
The iPad's sound quality is less than stellar
and it would've been nice if they were a bit

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:20.040
louder.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.860
As far as how the tablets feel in the hand,
they're very similar because of the aluminum

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.220
body.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.170
The main difference however is the actual
size of each of them.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.989
Obviously the Air isn't a one handed device,
but the G Pad is somewhat usable with one

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.370
hand.

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.840
As far as the actual dimensions of each device
goes, the G Pad measures in at 216mms in height

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:52.860
and 126mms in width while the Air towers over
it coming in at 240 mms tall and 170 mms wide.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.909
Ever since using smaller form factor tablets
like the Nexus 7 and G Pad I've found that

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:03.090
lugging around larger devices like the Air
becomes a pain.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.340
However, the new slimmer form factor of 7.5mm
and the incredibly light weight of 478 grams

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.120
or one pound definitely makes one reconsider
the Air.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.200
Honestly though, I still prefer the smaller
size of the G Pad, but that's something you'll

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200
each need to find out for yourselves.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.760
The iPad Mini Air features the same beautiful
retina display that has been shown on the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.390
last several generations.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.889
The only thing you'll want to consider is
that it's possible the next generation features

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:36.789
a 4k or 2k resolution screen.

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.449
The G Pad doesn't have a bad screen but it
isn't mind blowing or amazing.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.710
You might have noticed in my speed test comparison
how dim the G Pad was, and that's something

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.440
I've had issues with.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.039
I enjoy the larger display of the G Pad, but
the iPad Air wins 10 times out of 10 in terms

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.479
of clarity.

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:01.120
The LG G Pad Google Play Edition costs $349
and is only available in black which is pretty

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:08.830
steep considering the Nexus 7 2013 can be
had for about $150 less.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:18.850
However, with the G Pad you do get the Android
OS and expandable storage, so it's definitely

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.259
enticing for those that need extra space.

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:29.250
Now the iPad Air can be purchased in two color
variants, space grey and silver.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.919
The cost of the iPad Mini is $499 for the
base model, and like all Apple products there's

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.530
no expandable storage.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.979
Now both the iPad Air with retina display
and LG G Pad are extremely powerful.

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:46.660
If you want the benchmarks and actually specifics
then you can check out my Geekbench 3 comparison

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:58.630
between the iPad Air, LG G Pad 8.3, iPad Mini
Retina, and Nexus 7.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.310
Despite the iPad Air's not too impressive
specs, it is still real nice and surprisingly

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.310
powerful.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.690
It features the new A7 chip and has 1GB of
ram.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.720
On the other hand, the LG G Pad 8.3 has an
ultra powerful quadcore snapdragon 600 processor

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.270
and 2 gbs of RAM.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.300
Both of these tablets have no problem navigating
through its operating system and they are

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.240
both a pleasure to use in terms of the fluidity
and smoothness of each of them.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.599
I've tested each one out with high graphic
intensive games and they perform very well.

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.759
I'll be honest though it's tough to beat how
smooth the iPad Mini Retina is and it shows

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:36.009
in that comparison.

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:41.530
Both the iPad Mini 2 and LG G Pad 8.3 are
fantastic tablets and they're each great in

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.530
their own ways.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.290
The iPad Air is a bit tough to purchase simply
because it's so expensive, but if you have

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:55.360
the extra money to spend and prefer a larger
display then definitely go for the iPad Air.

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.550
However, if you prefer Android and the stock
Android experience then go for the LG G Pad

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:02.550
8.3.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.340
Anyway, hopefully this video helped you all
decide between these two great tablets, if

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.440
it did please give this video a thumbs up
