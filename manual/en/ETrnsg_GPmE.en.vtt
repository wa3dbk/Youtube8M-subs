00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.827
Hey, hi.

00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:16.729
What are you doing here?

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.627
Well, I forgot something in the classroom yesterday.

00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:24.718
I had to come back this morning to pick it up.

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.195
Oh no, poor you.

00:01:27.195 --> 00:01:29.394
Wait, before you go into your office, you'll need this.

00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:30.792
What? What is this.

00:01:30.792 --> 00:01:32.331
No, no, no, it's a prank electrical pen

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:33.601
No, I swear, it's not!

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:34.928
Wait, wait, wait...

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:37.231
You want another pen?

00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:39.239
I'm telling you, you'll need a sharp pencil.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.489
What's all this about...

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:45.600
I don't like this.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.128
Oh no...

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:50.702
What is that?

00:01:50.702 --> 00:01:55.603
You have 2 minutes and 15 to pop as much balloons as you can.

00:01:55.603 --> 00:01:57.543
NO!

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.283
Ok, autonomous period is over!

00:02:10.283 --> 00:02:11.325
Let's go!

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.964
[Québec swearing]

00:02:29.243 --> 00:02:37.782
1 minute 40 seconds remaining!

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:40.120
[more Québec swearing]

00:02:49.545 --> 00:02:51.813
I don't have my glasses!

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.058
1 minute!

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.325
It's a mess!

00:03:02.325 --> 00:03:05.662
What did you guys do last week?

00:03:18.321 --> 00:03:22.844
I'm exhausted!

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.862
30 seconds left!

00:03:28.862 --> 00:03:32.303
Double points!

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:40.589
Who blew up the balloons?

00:03:41.174 --> 00:03:43.474
20 seconds!

00:03:51.411 --> 00:03:52.810
10 seconds

00:03:54.303 --> 00:03:59.308
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:06.672
For the winning alliance

00:04:08.596 --> 00:04:11.070
A speech, a speech!

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.243
I am, huh, I am very, very proud for this amazing award

00:04:17.243 --> 00:04:20.654
It was a difficult competition, very demanding

00:04:20.654 --> 00:04:23.516
Unfortunately, I couldn't meet the challenge.

00:04:23.516 --> 00:04:25.652
I will do better next year.

00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:29.158
Thank you for the consolation prize.
