00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:25.960
Well, weíre almost halfway through our countdown
of the top 25 Wii games of all-time.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.260
And if you thought it might have some kind
of predictable midpoint monotony...well, Iím

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.820
guessing you didnít expect this.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.719
Coming in at #15, itís the fifth best-selling
Wii game in history...itís New Super Mario

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.260
Bros. Wii.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:57.120
And Iím also guessing people will say, ìWait,
how can New Super Mario Bros. Wii be only

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.659
the fifteenth best Wii game?î Well, keep
in mind that fifteenth-best still means itís

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:03.659
one of the best.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:08.840
This is an ultra-polished, super-tight, vintage
platforming experience, the likes of which

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.439
Nintendo does best...but thereís nothing
particularly Wii about it.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:29.810
This game is way too good to ignore, but itís
too safe to rank any higher.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:36.579
From a little too safe to a little too...well...to
this.

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.060
The games of Suda 51 are notorious for being
among the most twisted in the entire industry,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.280
but theyíre also known for being stylish,
innovative and fun...characteristics that

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.899
also define the very best Wii games.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.860
Like two peas in a pod full of corpses, the
combination of Suda and the Wii led to No

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:18.849
More Heroes 2, one of its generationís boldestóand
most deplorableóaction games.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.370
From the moment it was unveiled, everyone
knew Capcom had something special in Project

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.930
Treasure Island Z.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.150
But even after a big marketing campaign, huge
prerelease buzz...and a stupid name...Zack

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.700
and Wiki didnít have the retail impact it
deserved to.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.549
Nonetheless, this brilliant puzzler is still
one of the Wiiís best games...and a go-to

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:59.810
example of how its controller could revitalize
an entire genre.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.340
Like Zack and Wiki, Boom Blox is one of those
games that perfectly sums up what this system

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.340
is all about.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.650
It combines a simple conceptójust knock down
all the stuffówith a simple control schemeójust

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.720
throw stuff.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.371
Not many Wii games have motion controls as
satisfying and enjoyable as Bash Party, and

00:03:19.371 --> 00:03:25.450
its level editorócomplete with seamless online
integrationóopened up user creativity like

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:39.920
few Wii games have.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.820
You could be cynical about this game.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.711
You could say itís too easy, itís too sweet,
itís too...pretty and pink...and freaking

00:03:47.711 --> 00:03:48.849
Molly Ringwald.

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.680
Beneath that semblance of sugar and saccharine,
this is actually one of the most cleverly

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.790
designed platformers on the system.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.610
Epic Yarn turns Kirbyís world into an arts
and crafts store, and although the effect

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.359
is just beautiful, itís the way the idea
is woven into the gameplay that makes Kirbyís

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.780
Epic Yarn such a joy to play.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.490
It may not be hard, but...you know...cottonís
not supposed to be.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.880
And I know this is hard, but youíre going
to have to wait for the top ten.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.580
Because this wraps up part three of our feature
on the top 25 Wii games of all-time.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.770
Come back for part two, place your bets...and
go play Kirbyís Epic Yarn.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.170
Itís okay, guys.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.910
Thereís nothing to be ashamed of.
