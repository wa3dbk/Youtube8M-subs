Anthony's alive? Oh yippidi doodle daddle!
Shut up!! Please

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.960
Previously on Smosh...
Do you promise you're gonna destroy that video of me?

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.440
That extremely horribly embarrassing video of you? Yeah, if you find all of the eggs.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640
Let's get you outta here man.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.640
Sucker.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.769
Ian: Holy crap it worked!
Anthony: Well, what's going on?

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:38.699
I: God, I never thought the simple injection of bat urine and Little Tito's Hot Chunky Salsa would actually work, but it...

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.459
worked. What's the last thing you remember?

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.469
A: Uhhh, I was reaching for the egg in the fountain and then...

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.229
and everything went black. I: Oh, yeah. I have a good explanation for that.You died.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.360
A: What?
I: Yeah! Yeah yeah, I stole your body from the morgue and put you in Cryostasis...

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.180
until I can find a cure for death.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640
A: How long was I dead for?

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:12.210
I: 30 years. 
A: 30 years? I:Yeah.
A: How come you don't look any different then? I: Duh... Botox.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.310
Yeah, not much has changed.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.879
Google bought Canada, aliens came to Earth and we got these cool little bar codes on our...
 Anthony: What? Did you say aliens came from Earth?

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.199
I: Yeah, yeah, they're called Zenglars. Um, they live here with us, and yeah, they're pretty cool.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.219
A: Do they have like those stereotypical big... Oh my God! That thing's hideous!  
I:That "thing", is my wife. Sally.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.420
Sally: Sup...

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.860
Anthony: Sally's a man? 
Ian: It's a Zenglar. No gender. Doesn't matter. Okay? In fact...

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.040
We just passed a law in California saying we can marry Zenglars.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.369
Which is exactly what I did. Which is something that we've been waiting for, for a long long time. Isn't that right honey? Yeah?

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.930
Yeah, of course the Mormons are trying to ban it. 
Sally: Hey, you got something written on your face right here.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.140
Anthony: Does it say I'm stupid. 
Sally: Yep. 
Anthony: Is it misspelled?
Sally: Yep.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.619
Hey wait, you're that guy with the really embarrassing video! 
Anthony: You showed him? Ian: Yes-

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.518
I showed HER. But it has like 40 million thousand bajillion views! So, you should be proud.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.019
Anthony: Well, then I guess you wouldn't mind if I showed everyone this.
Ian: Wait wait. No, no no. All right,

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.359
All right, all right, all right. We can talk about this alright?

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.120
I think I can fix this.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.190
Unknown Man: Who goes there? Ian: Um, sir, there's something I need to ask of you.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.470
Make it quick, peasant. My patience is waiting. Ian: Uh...

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.530
I need you to teleport us back through time. *laughs*

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.560
Sir: There's only one way I would teleport you back in time.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.700
(singing) I rule the land of space and time.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.700
Going to the past

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.700
is like hitting rewind.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.700
(singing) We need to go

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.700
to the year '09...

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.700
(singing) To get something

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.700
from this friend of mine.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700
(singing) I'll do that,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.700
but it is not free.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
Kill Burt Reynolds,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.700
my mortal enemy.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.700
(singing) I would normally do

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.700
that in a flash.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.700
(singing) But he has

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.700
got a cool mustache.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.700
(singing) Then you are

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.700
not a friend of

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700
mine. I will not

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.700
let you travel

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.700
through time. Going through

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.700
time, I will not permit.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.700
You

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700
losers can eat

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.700
my-- (pow!)

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.700
(birds chirp)

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.700
 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.700
(Anthony counting down)

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.780
Anthony: Alright so, what's the plan?
Ian: I got an idea. Let's go.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.340
Past Anthony: 9... 8... 7... *Falcon Punch*

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.940
Ian: All right, Anthony. Get all the eggs and my past self will give you the video. 
Anthony: I got it this time, don't worry.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.940
Here I come!!!

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.369
Dude, can you just show me where the last egg is? I can't find it. I looked everywhere.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.800
Past Ian: Oh, yeah, sure. I'll show you where the last egg is, but only because you suck so bad at Easter egg hunts. Booyah!!

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.360
Anthony: Dude, what are you doing? Save me! Ian: Do I look like David Hasselhoff to you?
 Anthony: Just pull me out man...

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.220
What are you doing? If I die in the past,I'm gonna die in the future!

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.240
Ian: Oops.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:57.560
Ian! Oh, dog biscuits! Ian! Ian! You're in a minefield! Past Ian: Huh-*Dies* Ian: Oh Fu-*ded*

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.860
Anthony: Don't do it.Dude, please don't. No!!!

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.860
