00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:12.730
what's up everybody Justin here we're doing
some formula 1 racing this week down at 5280

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:21.180
raceway in lakewood, colorado. Got this car
out there for the first time my Tamiya F104v2

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:30.369
Pro edition car check out the race video coming
in and let ya know how it goes. Alright what

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.579
you're seeing in the race section big picture
that's the main event for Formula 1 class

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:40.649
that night just a few of us out there that
night but that was good for me. It was my

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.829
first night driving the car still learning
how to do setup and things that with these

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:53.340
little F1 cars lot of new stuff. I haven't
raced on-road cars in easily over 20 years

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.380
back when I used to race an RC-12L and old
Bolink Eliminator back in the 80's and early

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.750
90's. Getting used to these things it was
a learning curve but I thought I did alright

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.090
for my first night out, I didn't break anything
and the car was pretty durable had a couple

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.020
bad hits into the wall things like that but
it held up pretty good. The front bumper on

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.600
these things are flexible rubber plasticy
kind of material and other than that the wheels

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.000
and tires most of the other impacts so, they
hold up pretty good. I'll let you in on some

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.060
things I learned this night racing out at
5280 raceway, some of the things I wasn't

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.850
aware of with on-road cars. I started off
my practice sessions with no tire sauce or

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.840
anything like that didn't really know what
to do when I was out on the track driving.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.810
The more I drove the more the tires gunked
up with carpet and carpet goo, the track surface

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.220
was of course carpet as you can probably tell
in the video by now. So what would happen

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.220
as I would gather more and more stuff on my
tires the car would have less and less traction

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.759
to the point where I couldn't even give it
a little squeeze of the throttle without the

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.060
backend wanting to spin out on the car. Very
frustrating, one of the local guys out there

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.090
noticed my frustrations or the car not driving
well and brought me over and gave me some

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.480
of the beginner tips on how to prep these
things and get them ready for racing on the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.010
carpet. So I got my lesson on car preparation
and cleaning of the tires for these things,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.260
there are a few things you're gonna want to
bring to the track or have available at the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.959
track if you're racing on rubber tires. I
think the process is mostly the same for foam

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.130
tires other than you probably don't need to
clean them like you do rubber tires but what

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.790
you need to do when the tires get gunked up,
pretty much after every run, they recommended

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:03.380
cleaning them with a motor cleaner. I got
this Duratrax Power Shot motor cleaner they

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.140
had at the track, that's one way to clean
them. One of the other guys that was local

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.720
there also recommended the tire compound,
I got some SXT tire compound for these as

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.560
well, what he did was just rub some tire compound
on the tires and wipe em off real quick then

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.900
re-apply the tire compound for the race. So
basically was clean the tires off, get them

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.900
nice and clean like they are now, no gunk
on the rubber for the most part pretty clean.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.560
Then apply your tire compound five to ten
minutes before you run so after I got that

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.530
done the first time on the car I had tons
of traction, it was incredibly easy to drive,

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.510
traction wise. The car had other issues mostly
driver issues, but at any rate I had lots

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.000
of rear traction and front end grip. I was
actually able to do some laps and get around

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.519
the track without spinning out and sliding
out all over the place. So that was a big

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:12.769
thing, make sure you do that, keep the tires
clean and using the right tire compound will

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:22.880
help hugely in enjoying your F1 car for sure.
So as far as the race goes, the car was driving

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.810
good, obviously there wasn't a lot of people
there. Couple of the other guys driving were

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.900
fast drivers so I was just trying to go at
my own pace and stay out of the way. I think

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.460
I ended up running mostly in the twelve second
range for that track, mid to low twelves,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.960
the faster guys were running I think low eleven's
pretty consistently so I got some time to

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.780
make up the track is really short so while
one second doesn't seem like much it is quite

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.150
a lot on a track like that. Got a lot to work
on but looking forward to it now that I got

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.830
the tips for getting the car setup and the
tire stuff. Looking forward to driving it

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.000
again so I'll probably be heading out to this
place more in the future and also try to get

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:15.870
some outdoor on-road racing on a asphalt track
at a local shop here. I'll keep the video

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.310
running from the race hope you enjoyed, stay
tuned for more of this guy, we'll try to get

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:27.449
some more video in the future and as always
please like, subscribe, and share down below

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:35.810
we appreciate it and thanks for watching,
catch ya next time.
