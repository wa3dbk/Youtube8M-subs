00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.509
Spring onions, green onions,
scallions, and shallots are all related members

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.140
of the onion family that we consider delicacies
of spring. I am the Produce Lady and I want

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.289
you to learn more about using these versatile,
flavorful veggies. Onions have been cultivated

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.539
since at least 3000 BC and probably derived
from the wild varieties of the species in

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.460
the mountains of Central Asia. Spring onions
are immature onions that are harvested before

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.490
a prominent bulb has formed and their tops
are still green. The bulb and the bright green

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.490
tops are edible raw or cooked. Spring onions
should have crisp, bright green tops and firm

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.950
white bottoms. In most recipes, you can use
spring onions, scallions, and shallots interchangeably,

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.140
according to your tastes and seasonal local
availability. Before handling fresh produce,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.680
remember to always wash your hands with soap
and water. To prepare your onions for storage,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.230
remove rubber bands and damaged leaves before
wrapping in plastic bag. Store onions in the

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.880
refrigerator crisper - away from odor sensitive
foods like mushrooms and corn. Note that they

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:26.880
have a tendency to become slimy or moldy if
too tightly sealed. Wash all varieties of

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.130
spring onions immediately before preparing
to remove all grit and dirt especially between

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.950
the leaves. Trim the roots and the green tops
down to where they are crisp. Then chop to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.950
desired sizes. Onions may be eaten raw or
cooked. One cup of spring onion has only 32

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.240
calories and nearly 3 grams of fiber. Spring
onions are a great addition to egg dishes

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.010
like omelets and frittata. Include spring
onions with other seasonal vegetables for

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:04.549
a delicious stir fry medley. Be adventuresome
and create your own unique recipe to use with

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:10.780
whatever seasonal produce you have on hand
to make a quick, easy supper. You might combine

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.300
the lightly cooked veggies with your favorite
prepared pasta and cheese. Contact the family

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.560
and consumer science agent at your county
North Carolina Cooperative Extension Center

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.560
for more ideas about preparing healthy meals
to eat at home. Serve your family the very

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.160
best foods possible and learn about the farmer
who grows the nutritious food you will be

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.680

markets for the finest and freshest locally

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.470
