I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace Lawns. Want
to talk about deer control. As we, as a society

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.180
build out farther and farther and into areas
where we haven't been before, deer population

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.530
is starting to become a problem for us. As
one person told me one time, they had a deer

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.560
problem, and I laughed and told them that
the deer had a people problem because we were

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.730
moving into the country. The problem with
the deer is that they will eat your plants

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.710
and grass and do some disruptive damage. So
we'd like to have a plan to keep that from

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:49.270
happening. Now, you'll notice in some areas
where people will put cages around their shrubs,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.040
and things like that. That's not a very attractive
solution. But there's several things you can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:04.309
do from a natural standpoint that maybe would
at least slow them down. On the perimeter

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.009
of your properties, or at least in the area
where you know the deer are coming from, you

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:18.771
can plant several different types of plants.
The oleander shrub is poisonous, the deer

00:01:18.771 --> 00:01:24.689
recognize that by it's smell, and they will
stay away. The hollies, different hollies

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:33.549
with the jagged-edge leaf, the deer don't
like that either. Lantanna has been a long

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:41.959
detriment for the deer, they turn from that
as well. So by planting some lantanna, holly,

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:49.990
or oleanders, either one or combinations along
your border area would serve to help keep

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.789
them away. Another thing, of course, would
be to put up a fence. But in order to keep

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.840
the deer off with a fence, you have to have
a fence about ten feet high. Another thing

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:15.500
that you can do would be to take an egg, beat
it, mix it with one pint of water, and spray

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.010
the perimeter. But first, before you spray
it, you need to let that egg sit for two days.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.390
So let's go over that again. Beat the egg.
Mix it with one pint of water, let it sit

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.370
for two days, then spray your perimeter. That
smell will drive the deer away. But this is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:42.110
a process that needs to be repeated once a
month. Another nice, safe thing to do would

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:49.020
be to visit the local hair salon or the barber
shop. Get the hair that they sweep up off

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:56.080
the floor. Pack it in an old pair of pantyhose
or something of that nature, an old fruit

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.480
sack or something. Tie it to a stake, and
put stakes up ever so often across and around

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.850
the perimeter of the property. They smell
the human smell of the hair, the deer won't

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.880
come near you, either. And I do know from
a personal standpoint that that does work

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.550
rather well. Sometimes it's not the best in
the world, because as the sack or the things

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.650
deteriorate, you start having hair, but it
is a very good, safe practice and it does

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.910
work. The only other thing that you might
consider, and this is only going to depend

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.550
on your area, in some areas this is illegal
to do, and I'm not recommending it because

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.020
of that, but it is something to consider if
it is allowable. And maybe in the far corner

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.650
of an area, you could put a deer feeder. Have
the deer come to that feeder, and maybe by

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.660
doing so they will leave your property alone.
But before you do that, please check with

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.640
your neighbors to make sure they don't mind
you doing that, and check to make sure that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:13.630
it is not illegal, because some places it
is, some places it isn't. The egg-water spray

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.029
is good. The hair is good, and the plants.
Those are probably your three best bets to

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.169
control your deer.
