00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.930
Whassup, everybody.

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.560
My name is Kid Glyde.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.080
I'm the leader of the Dynamic Rockers, pretty
famous B-Boy.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.830
I travel around the world, I organize events.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.670
I've been dancing for 15 years.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.789
So I think I'm pretty credible to teach you.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.470
Be positive, be strong, let's do it.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.100
Right now, I'm about to show you one of my
signature moves.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.110
I called it air glide.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.920
It's also called a gremlin or flagpole.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.140
This was before I knew what it was because,
I was pretty young when I first did it.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.410
You know, I was like a teenager, probably
16-17 and I actually did the move by accident.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.380
Me and my pop's were like, "Yo, what is an
air glide?"

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.340
You know, after all the glides we made up.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.079
So, that happens a lot with moves you know,
people make up moves, they don't know that

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.579
it was already done, and they just put names
to it.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.210
So, right now I'm going to show you the air
glide and it's basically me putting my hand

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.511
down like this and just spinning around my
hand.

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:09.260
My hand stays stationary as I spin on it and
my legs, I mean my whole body is just spinning

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.260
around.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.260
Alright?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.310
It's pretty insane.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.430
So, I'm going to start real quick, kind of
like I'm about to do a flare alright?

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.189
I put my hands down, (my palm down) and right
away with no momentum, (I create some momentum),

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.340
and I just spin around like that.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.340
Alright?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.260
So, watch it very carefully.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.630
So, palm on floor, and I spin around.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.630
Alright?

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.641
Let's do it again.

00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:48.100
And watch how my body is kind-of tight and
my hands up in the air trying to counter balance

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.420
my weight.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.689
Alright, so that was a pretty fast version.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.500
You can do it slow, you can do it fast depending
on how you want to do it.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:08.560
So, you just saw the air glide, one of my
favorite moves, and try it out!
