00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.690
Peremyachi is a Tatar and Bashkir national dish.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.159
In fact, this is individual-sized fried in vegetable oil pies stuffed with a meat.

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:16.100
I was asked to cook a meal Tatar cuisine. Cooking!

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.949
For the dough take: 1 kg of wheat flour, 0.5 liters of milk, 1 tsp of dry yeast,

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.699
100 g of butter, 2 tbsp of sugar, 1 egg, 0.5 tsp of salt.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:32.300
For the stuffing: 500 g of beef or lamb, onions, salt and pepper to taste.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.300
First, make the dough.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.900
Pour milk into a bowl.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.800
Warm it up a little, with sugar.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.000
Only to room temperature.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.880
A maximum of up to 30 C.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.000
It took just 2 minutes.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.020
Still I'll check with my finger.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.560
Milk is warm.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.500
If milk is hot, the yeast will die.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.560
Add yeast here.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.260
Leave them for 15-20 minutes.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.800
It took 15 minutes. During this time, I melted the butter.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.740
Melted butter is warm.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.840
Add it here.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.520
1 egg.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.640
Do not forget about the salt.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.400
Mix.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.180
Gradually add the sifted flour.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.190
Sift a little and knead dough.

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:25.400
I made a soft elastic dough.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.000
It really doesn't stick to hands.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.500
Hands are almost dry.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280
The dough is ready.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.459
Leave it in a bowl.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.239
Cover with a lid and put in a warm place.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.478
It can be sun-warmed, placed near the warm radiator, or you can just wrap it with a towel.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.280
The main thing, there must be no drafts, because the dough is afraid of them.

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:03.139
Grind the meat in a meat grinder.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.220
Crush onions in a mill.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.230
You can just chop it.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:23.459
Done.

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.159
The result is cut onions.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:32.419
If you grind the onions, it will become gruel.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.020
And so it turns into a pieces.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.920
Add salt to taste in to the mince.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.449

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:54.449
Mix all thoroughly.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.800
Add 2 tbsp of water or milk to the minced was more soft.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:13.479
The dough has risen. Begin to mould peremyachi.

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:19.162
Sprinkle the table with flour.

00:04:19.162 --> 00:04:24.938
Make dough balls the size of a small apple.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.140
Place on the table.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:44.260
Roll each ball with a rolling pin to diameter of 10-12 cm.

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.990
Something like this.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.990
Put minced onto center of each dough circle.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.870
Remove excess.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.870
Make such tucks.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.340
Fold all dough to the center and leave a circular hole.

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:21.349
Diameter 1-2 cm.

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.619
Leave the dough for some time to make it risen slightly.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.980
Make the following one.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.480
While peremyachi were standing for 20 minutes, I heated butter.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.400
I'll fry pies in wok.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.940
Take the pie.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:53.100
Dip it into the oil with its hole down.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.570
Fry pies in hot oil on each side until golden brown.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.580
The bottom side is browned.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.140
Turn on the other side.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.680
Add oil in the middle.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.200
Fry the second side.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:36.040
Look at the bottom side. It is also already browned.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.860
Place the pies on the grill, to remove excess oil.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:46.380
You can drain it on paper towels.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.140
Cook over medium heat.

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.820
The heating must be regulated according to your stove.

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:59.880
Take the following pies and dip into oil.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:09.060
Place fried peremyachi in a large bowl or pot.

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:15.699
Cover with a towel to make peremyachi cooled down a bit and become softer.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.280
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:58.000
