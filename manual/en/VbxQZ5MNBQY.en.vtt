00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.170
The Brier that Returned

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.170
A beautiful lady named ‘Brier’ was captured
by Mongolians

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.580
and was sold to a country far away.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.580
Brier left home 10 years ago
but never forgot about her parents and siblings.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.670
“That moon must be watching my parents.”

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.820
One day, the owner realized Brier missed her
family,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.199
and he called for her to come to meet with
him.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.199
“You work well and you have a kind heart.
I will let you visit your home.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.969
But you must come back in 10 days.”

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:02.159
Brier returned home with a very happy heart.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:09.159
When she got home,
the house was gone and nobody was there.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.560
“The people who lived here left.”

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.560
Brier was very sad when she heard this.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.609
Brier searched many villages to find her parents.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.549
“Mother, father!”

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.930
Brier could not find her parents.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.350
Time passed and the 10 days were almost up.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.350
“What should I do?
If I return, I’ll never be able to see my

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.119
parents again.
I have to find them even if I have to break

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.469
my promise!”

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:13.469
Brier broke her promise with the owner
and continued to search for her parents. But

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.760
she could not find them.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.760
Brier ended up dying in the mountain.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.230
Time passed and many white and red flowers
bloomed

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.970
everywhere Brier had searched.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.000
People named these beautiful red white flowers
“Brier”

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.919
because of Brier’s dedicated search to find
her family.
