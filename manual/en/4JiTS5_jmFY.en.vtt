00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
Hello internet! My name is Hazel from HazelNuttyGames

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.680
and this is a closer look at the barber shop customization options

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.200
for the new female Draenei model in the Warlords of Draenor beta.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.820
Alright, let's get started and take a look at some of the hair styles.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.280
We have the 'nape' look.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.700
Very elegant.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.060
The 'sassy' hair.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.420
It's going in all kinds of directions.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.220
We have the 'hairband' style.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.820
Nice and big through the back.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.540
This is the 'trouble' style of hair.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.620
Borrowed from Blood Elves.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.400
This is the 'shy' look.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.300
The 'high tail'.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.740
I feel like that ponytail is angled down quite a bit more than it used to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260
I feel like it used to go straight out

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.100
This is the 'soaked' look.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.300
Little bit of a draenei specific embellishment there.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.240
I wonder if that's intentional.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.760
This is the 'slicked' look.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.680
It appears to be functioning incorrectly at the moment.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.460
This is the 'straight' hair style.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.940
We have the 'flipped' look.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.100
very popular among draenei ladies.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.920
'Cute' hair

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.980
A set of adorable pigtails.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.900
This is the 'feathered' look.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.340
We have the 'buns' style.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.920
The 'Jeweled Band'.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.120
And those curls have gotten some nice definition in the back there.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.860
Lovely.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:13.859
'Bangs'

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.880
Those come quite low down her face.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.220
'Elegant'

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.820
Again, I feel like that ponytail has angled down quite a bit more than it used to.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.280
Still looks lovely.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000
The 'bounce' style.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.240
Alright, let's take a look at some of the hair colours available

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.720
these have changed a bit

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.640
This is a darker blue

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.760
we have rich brown

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.420
Bit of a purple tint to the brown.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.020
This is the lighter brown.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.320
And this silver- you may not be able to see it super well

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.220
but it's got a definite tint of pink to it.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.220
Really pretty light pink hair for Draenei now.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.220
I see that being very popular.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.420
We have black hair.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.180
and we're back to where we were!

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.460
So I'll show you the horns- they don't really seem to have changed much

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.600
but they might have gotten a little bit of extra texture

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.740
so we'll run through those

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.940
We've got 'curled' horns.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.840
Your 'arced' horns.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.000
your 'high' horns

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:49.960
'spread' horns

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.880
'grand' horns

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.880
'Short' horns

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.980
And the 'sweeping' horns which tend to get back and out of the way of your hair.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.260
And those are your new barber shop options for the female Draenei!

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.540
Thank you so much for watching.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.320
