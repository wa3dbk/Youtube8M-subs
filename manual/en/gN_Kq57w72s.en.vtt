We recently discovered this colorful „Chocolate Bomb“ on Pinterest and simply had to try it.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:17.120
The optical illusion of the sweets falling out of their floating packages makes this cake so special.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.920
The recipe and the list of ingredients is linked in the box below the video or can be found at http://amerikanisch-kochen.de

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.840
As a base, you can simply use almost any cake that you like.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.640
The only important thing is that it’s covered in ganache.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.040
We already prepared the cake for this video.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.000
This cake was made with the basic recipe for our Candy Cake.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.080
If you would like to know how to make this cake, we have linked the recipe for you in our infobox.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.400
It is important that the cake is slightly shifted when placed on the cake plate.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.160
The first step is to place chocolate bars around the cake. Leave a gap of about 14cm.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.960
The chocolate bars should stick to to the cake thanks to the ganache.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.960
Instead of chocolate bars, you can use long cookies, ladyfingers or wafers.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
Everything you like basically works.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.040
Cut of a small corner of the sweets packaging...

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.280
...pour the contents into a bowl and fill the empty wrapping with saran wrap.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.800
This way, they will look as if they are still filled with candy later on.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.200
When all bars stick evenly, you can spread the candy over the cake.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.600
Again, feel free to use whatever candies you like.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.640
Finally, the candies are used to fill the gap and „glued“ to the cake plate with some ganache.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.360
When this step is done, all that is left is to place the packaging on the cake.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.440
Now for the last and most elaborate step.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.640
In order to simulate the „floating“ effect, you stick wood skewers into the cake...

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.320
..and „glue“ chocolate and candy to them.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.760
Unfortunately, you have to take a break every now and then between these steps.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.440
The chocolate has to harden before you can proceed.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.440
In order to keep the chocolate molten, simply place the bowl in warm water.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.440
Finally, the packaging is added to the skewers and our cake is ready.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.800
