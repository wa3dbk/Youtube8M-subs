00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:32.040
The Fisheries Improvement Program was established
in the early 1990s and was designed and set

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.390
up to improve habitat in Lake Havasu.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.150
The Fisheries Program contributes to opportunities
on the lake for recreation by offering over

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.950
800 acres of artificial habitat for fishing.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.489
There are a lot of people that know where
it is and they fish it.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.570
The BLM is committed to working with our partners
to ensure that the fish habitats are maintained.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.640
The primary partners in the program are Bureau
of Land Management, U.S. Geological Survey,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.640
U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife, Bureau of Reclamation,
Arizona Game &amp; Fish Department, California

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.470
Division of Wildlife, and Anglers United.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.800
The maintenance crew for Lake Havasu Field
Office is the operational support in executing

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.700
the Fisheries Improvement Program.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:29.430
We put in artificial habitat and we augment
that artificial habitat with brush.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.790
We receive the brush from the landscapers,
we use heavy equipment to off-load it from

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.340
their trailers and we put it on racks, we
bundle it and weight it with sandbags and

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.200
we load it on our boats.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.630
The primary purpose of the artificial habitat
is to provide nutrients into the lake and

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.860
also to provide habitat for your fry to survive.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:04.240
The bundles create structure and most game
fish like to hide on structure, some of these

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.440
fish require cover.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.470
The volunteers throughout the years were responsible
for construction of the habitat and the actual

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100
placement of the habitat in the lake.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.480
We take the input from our biologist based
on how much brush is needed in each cove and

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.790
then we have to coordinate to physically get
the brush into the locations, a lot of times

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.099
we’ll have fishermen follow us into the
coves to see where we’re dumping the brush

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.980
and try to get an edge up on the other fishermen
and it’s kind of interesting.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.830
Fishing in Lake Havasu at the present time
is probably the best desert lake in the country.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.510
And so it has increased the productivity and
this is reflected in what people are catching.
