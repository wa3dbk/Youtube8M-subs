00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
My name is Tor-Arne Eilertsen.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I live in Kasfjord, just outside Harstad in North Norway,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
where I run a farm with dairy and meat production.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I have a VMS from DeLaval,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that was installed in January 2008,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
so I have been in operation almost for five years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
In addition, I have Feed First controlled cow traffic

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which I use in the production together with the VMS.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
On average, I have between 50 and 60 cows in production.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I am very fascinated by the opportunities we have today

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
of combining high technology with the biological element

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that the cow represents in the production process.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The single most important factor in milk production,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
before getting to the VMS,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is to have a well-functioning barn environment.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And most importantly, well-functioning cow traffic.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
There are many theories on what is the most efficient way

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of getting the cows to walk around in the barn.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
It is desirable to have the cows in movement most hours of the day

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In order to make gain the best possible cow trafic...

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
many factors have been discussed.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
One is frequent distribution of roughage with the feed wagon.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
There should be constantly roughage on the feed table,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
allowing cows free access to it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That is probably one of the most important factors.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But I have found that the single most important factor,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the cow's real driving force to circulate

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
so that I can get them for milking whenever I wish to,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that is the concentrate feed.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It represents the heart of the cow traffic.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Personally, I believe that the concentrate is the driving force in the barn.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
There are several things that are

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
important when it comes to motivating the cows with the concentrate.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Today, many farmers use a rule of thumb saying that
33
00:02:37,000 --&gt; 00:00:42,000
there should be one concentrate feeder per 25 cows in a barn,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
counting the robot as a feeder.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I believe this is wrong.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
One feeder for 25 animals

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
is not enough, in my view.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Also, the robot should not count as a feeder.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The fact that I have

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
well-functioning cow traffic, means that I can

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
make the best use of the VMS and its possibilities.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And this is a prerequisite for achieving good cow health.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
When the cow traffic works well,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
When the cows are passing the Smart gate several times a day,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000
then I can catch the cows to milkings as often as I wish.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I have reached the point

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
where the cow traffic is working the way I want it to,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
so I can utilise it more effectively together with cell count measuring.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
At each milking the cell count is measured for the individual cow at that specific time.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Furthermore, the udder should be emptied as often

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
as the calf would suckle in a natural situation,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000
up to 10-12 times a day.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
In that way you get healthier cows, and this is what I try to do...

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
...with the controlled and traffic and cell count measuring.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
When I see that the cell count of a cow is rising,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I reduce the intervals between milking for that cow,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and with gate control catch her in for milking more often.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Normally, when the cow is milking around 8-9 kg, depending on the yield of the cow,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but 9 kg is probably the herd average for when a cow is approved for milking.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
If I see that the cell count for a cow starts to rise,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
especially for those whose cell count often varies, then I reduce

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the milking intervals, cutting the level for milking permission down to as low as 5 litres.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
When I do this, you very quickly see that the cell count goes down in the first day or so,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
instead of rising or remaining at an unphysiologically high level.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
This happens relatively quickly in the first 24 hours.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The earlier the milking interval is reduced, the quicker the cow

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
will get down to a physiologically normal cell count.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
This is the fundamental idea behind this system,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
which has had a very positive effect on my production.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I find the OCC to be very reliable, giving a highly accurate

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
measurement of the cell count.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But the most positive aspect of using the cell count compared to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
methods used previously, and still in some other robots,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is the fact that the cell count immediately tells you if there is something wrong in the udder.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
If a cow has acute mastitis, the high cell count will let you know straight away.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You can also monitor variations in conductivity and salt content,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
but these change much slower, and you will not have the answer as quickly as with OCC.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
OCC measures the cell count of each cow, at each milking.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000
In my mind, the OCC unit is a sound investment, as it enables you to

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
implement measures at an early stage, so that only a few individuals

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
will require going to the step of starting treatment with antibiotics,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
which means added costs and increased workload in terms of milking the cow separately,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in addition to lost production.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I would say that the small cost of taking each sample will repay itself

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
many times over - as will the cost of purchasing the OCC unit for theVMS.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
It is probably the most successful investment I have made in this barn,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
apart from the VMS.
