00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Was this peculiar event a result of extraordinary auroras or gigantic solar flares?

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It remains a cosmic mystery. Some time between AD 774 and AD 775, our planet 
 was hit by an extremely intense burst of high-energy radiation of unknown origin.

00:00:05.376 --> 00:00:07.376
Was this peculiar event a result of extraordinary auroras or gigantic solar flares?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Why are there no ancient astronomical records describing such an unusual event?

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.780
Why are there no ancient astronomical records describing such an unusual event?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Scientists detected the mysterious radiation burst when looking at the amounts of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 
 in tree rings that formed during the AD 775 growing season in the Northern Hemisphere.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The increase in 14C levels is so clear that the scientists, led by Fusa Miyake, a cosmic-ray physicist from Nagoya University in Japan, conclude 
 that the atmospheric level of 14C must have jumped by 1.2% over the course of no longer than a year, about 20 t

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A massive supernova, for example, should have been bright enough to produce a 'new' star visible even in the daytime, as was the case for 
 two known supernovae in AD 1006 and AD 1054. Such an explosion would have needed to be brighter than either of these, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
One possibility is that ancient astronomers did not record the event because it occurred in the far southern skies, which was 
 the reason why they couldn't see it. However, if it did happen, today's X-ray and radio astronomers

As for solar flares, he says, anything that could have produced the required amount of 
 super-high-energy protons would have vastly exceeded the most intense solar outburst ever recorded. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It might be possible, he says, for CMEs to be accompanied by conditions in which an unusual 
 number of protons are accelerated to super-high energies, even without the flare itself being 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"We know much more these days about how important proton acceleration is at the shock 
 fronts that precede CME structures as they propagate towards Earth," Baker says.  

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"It would be fascinating," Baker adds, "if there were some record in China or in the Middle East that 
 reported powerful aurora or some other such event" around the same time as the observed 14C increase.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Was a massive supernova, or giant solar flare responsible for the radiation burst that 
 took place over 1200 years ago? We do not know.
