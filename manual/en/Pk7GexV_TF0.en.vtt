00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.410
This is the Kemper Profiling Amplifier a completely
new concept in guitar amp modeling, it's now

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.831
finally available to buy, so let's test it.

00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:16.970
The first thing to say is the the Kemper comes
loaded with sounds and you can download more

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.400
sound profiles from the Kemper website, that's
really no different from any other modelling

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.400
amp.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.670
The big difference with the Kemper however
is that it enables you to profile that is

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.560
the say model whatever amp you like.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.850
Here's how to do it, set up your amp as usual
and mic the sound so that you're happy with

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.010
the recorded sound.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.370
You don't have to mic the speaker you can
also use a direct out.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.409
Now unplug your guitar from the amp and connect
the microphone cable to the return XLR on

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:50.010
the back of the Kemper, connect the direct
out on the Kemper to the input of the amp,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.960
plug your guitar into the input of the Kemper
and to monitor what's happening in the Kemper

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.860
you can connect the main outputs to a mixing
desk and monitors, it's not designed to be

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.360
used with any normal guitar amps so once you've
modelled your amplifier you then use the Kemper

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.040
with a full range system such as striaght
into a recording set up or a live PA.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.900
So now we're plugged into the Kemper and the
Kemper is connected to our reference amp in

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.770
this case a two rock jet 22 combo, what you
do next is choose a rig from the browse mode

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.100
and choose something similar to your reference
amp.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.340
You can also profile effects if they're connected,
but let's keep this simple.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.300
Now change to profile mode set the output
level of the profile amp to roughly the internal

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.460
volume of the Kemper and balance up the levels
between the 2 sources, you can flick through

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.720
them easily on the front panel.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.400
When you're happy, press next, ok now comes
the fun bit, first hit the profiling button

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:54.290
and it all goes a bit scooby doo.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.290
Once you've profiled the amp there are various
options to help you manually refine it but

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.490
when you're happy you can store the resulting
profile as a new rig to be recalled whenever

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.830
you need it.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.160
What's also interesting is when you recall
the model you can even modify the gain, EQ

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.280
and all the basic sounds of the amplifier
- adding effects, taking them away, doing

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.480
whatever you want and that's it.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.700
So we've covered how to use the Kemper but
the next section we're going to profile a

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.580
number of different amplifiers and compare
the amps themselves with the profiles we've

00:02:21.580 --> 00:03:36.790
created in the Kemper, here we go.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:04:49.940
[music]

00:04:49.940 --> 00:06:06.919
In this comparison you've heard 4 different
amplifiers, we got a sound we liked out of

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.210
each, we modelled them in the Kemper, we plugged
straight into the Kemper and we compared them

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.210
directly.

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.250
We have to say we were a little bit synical
about the Kemper's ability before we began

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.740
this test however we've modelled Vox, EVH,
Marshall and Pure Rock amplifiers and we have

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.569
to admit that the Kemper has handled them
all with ease, it's extremely impressive.
