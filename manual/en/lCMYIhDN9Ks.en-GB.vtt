00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.920
Some of the problems that I've encountered

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.550
were just for the fact that I was always
used to having hair, longer hair

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.910
and for about three years or so

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.320
when I started to lose the hair, it felt for me 
it just didn't feel natural what I was used to

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.189
so, yeah, it did have slight affects on my

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.720
personality - I would be quite, erm, careful when I
was going out

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.300
thinking should I wear a hat etc -

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.880
so yeah, that's some of the problems with self appearance.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.640
Well I chose GetHair for the simple fact that

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.360
I would advise anybody, do your research
that's the number one priority

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.500
don't look at prices. I know

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.890
the financial aspect is very important but
the most important thing is to make sure

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.489
you go with a very good company.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.820
I've done my research, I've looked around

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.660
I've shopped around and 
after coming to GetHair,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.020
I just thought it was very, very personal

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.130
They treat you very well.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.950
They're not pushy at all. They ask you what you would like.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.360
This is what we do, this is how we do it
and it's completely up to you.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.940
They're not forcing anything to you.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.740
Not trying to push any deadlines, not
trying to say,  come

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.920
by this date just for you to actually come
with them.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.060
They just provide you with the information

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.280
and left it completely into your hands.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.340
The first day post-operation, it was
great

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.570
the doctor showed me, erm,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.710
the mirror which had about, probably
this close to my face.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.860
Looked really good. 
The second we stepped out

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.380
and i got to go into the elevator
with the doctor

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.320
and their team, the big mirror there and
that's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.539
about five minutes after when you seen
that, that was like, wow

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.740
because straightaway I just saw

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.269
a thick dense hairline compared with other
people so it wasn't

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.540
a shot very from close which is
quite unnatural to be looking at that

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.190
but I saw it in the elevator, it looked from a
distance, you could just see

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.730
how dense the hair looked post-operation
and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.019
confidence-wise already I'm just really
looking forward to the next six months

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.720
when the hair starts to grow.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.320
My experiences with GetHair have been

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.629
absolutely amazing since not even day one.
I'd say before the first email I sent

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.239
just to make an enquiry.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.569
The information that I received again was
not pushy

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.079
was not forceful, again, just explains
what they do.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:54.769
I've been to their website, I've had a clear look, I've come down here

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.980
to their office in London, I've had
a clear look around,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.629
I mean, I was given all the time I needed,
ask all the questions I wanted to.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.730
I think the first meeting was over in an
hour and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.310
again that was just for my own
reassurance

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.719
at how things were and then after that

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:17.430
I booked an appointment for two months after

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.559
the operation, erm, again

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.769
you think quite apprehensively about
going to another country

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.139
to do an operation - it's quite odd.
But again, as soon as I land there

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:32.019
no problem at all - the driver there he'll have

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:36.230
your name up on his sign, you go straight
to him. Very helpful.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.659
Erm, takes you straight to the hospital
straightaway

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.479
and despite the fact that I'd got to the hospital quite late

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.489
they were still just so friendly at the
hospital. Provided me with a nice meal

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.000
it was fresh, very clean hospital,
very hygienic.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.109
The first evening, the nurses
there were

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.680
again, very reassuring, always

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.160
made themselves available if I needed
anything.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.680
Then the next day which is the operation,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.159
again, I had the chance to sit down with the doctor

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.389
telling me what I would like, this is how
they would do it

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:12.729
after examining my photos etc.

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.340
And had nice little surprise for the
fact that we got even more grafts than

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.430
expected which is absolutely amazing.

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.590
The operation itself was
absolutely painless

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.020
no problems. I ended up watching TV
throughout the whole thing really.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.280
Stopped half way after they'd taken out the grafts

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.560
to be counted etc, have some lunch,
again that was very nice

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.310
straight after that

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.370
we went to open up the channels
to put the grafts in and again

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.410
that was done really professionally and
they did not rush their work.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.070
They took their time. Everything was concise

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.020
and kept on reassuring throughout the whole
thing -  how are you?

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.690
Is everything okay? And, yeah, and then
straight after that, like I mentioned before

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.970
had a full look of it and it was absolutely
amazing

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.490
and straight after that I was given
instructions...

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.440
instructions of every single detail that
I needed and for even the minor things

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.990
just how to sleep for the first few
days was given that

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.390
and finally on the third day, which is
the day I was leaving

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:17.920
to come back to London,

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.360
I've got an after-care session,

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.800
and, again, no language barriers 
whatsoever.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.440
Told me exactly how to look after my hair - exactly how to do

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.220
everything I needed from now
until a year to a year and a half's time.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.170
And then went back home.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.800
The doctor gave me her email address -  
any questions I needed, she said

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.350
come straight to her - gave a phone number as well  
any information.

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.510
So that again provides reassurance the
fact that I've got the contacts here in London.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.370
and even if I wanted to go to the doctor directly as well

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.870
is really professional and just a great
experience overall.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:05.190
Would I recommend GetHair to somebody
else who wants

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.840
to grow their hair back with 
confidence? Whew,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.200
I already have - simple.
