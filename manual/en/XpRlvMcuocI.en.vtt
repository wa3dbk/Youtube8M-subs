00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.220
When the winter comes the cold temperatures

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.320
makes us think about having delicious hot drinks

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.440
like hot chocolate

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.440
would like to have one?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.240
so wait because I will tell you a special recipe

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.320
shortly

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.800
creamy hot chocolate is usually made with a chocolate bar

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.180
that melts when we put the hot milk

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.300
you can also put small chocolate pieces on the bottom of the cup

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.820
but it is easier and charming to have the chocolate in a stick

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.600
choose the type of chocolate

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.500
it can be milk, dark chocolate or a mixture of both

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.500
or even some pieces of white chocolate

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.040
melt down the chocolate in hot water or in the microwave oven

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.640
mixing every 30 seconds

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.640
with the melted chocolate you put it in cups of cupcake

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.640
silicon cups

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.940
or what I like most - plastic coffee cups

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.460
but the secret is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460
after you put the hot chocolate in the recipient

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.880
you have to give minor knocks on a hard surface

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.040
to take the air off that may be inside the chocolate

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.540
to finish you can choose

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.160
wood ice cream stick, plastic stick

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.840
or for a special flavour cinnamon sticks

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.840
wait until it cools off

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.840
and your hot chocolate is ready

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.480
to drink or to give as a gift to beloved ones

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.060
but giving a second thought

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.060
in order to have an even better hot chocolate

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.720
