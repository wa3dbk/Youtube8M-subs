00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.680
Alright, check it out, very exciting, we're
doing the 2 gigabyte GTX 285 today.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.520
Very, very nice. They doubled the frame
buffer, and that's going to give you

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.190
some incredible gains in performance 
especially if you're running

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.730
really, really high resolutions like 2560 x 
1600. Well the additional frame buffer

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.860
will keep the GPU fed nicely, it's going to
increase your frame rate,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.530
and it's going to stop your frame rate from
dropping off,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.060
if you're cranking up those settings,
especially in games like Crisis.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.210
Especially when you turn on iCandy like
antialiasing.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.650
Those things really kick up how much frame 
buffer you need to use,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.060
and they also kick up your hard drive usage
sometime as well,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.890
when you're trying to buffer this massive
image. So, very nice card.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.780
Now, looking at it, looks pretty normal on
the front and on the back,

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.620
it is your standard reference design,
nothing really too special on here,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.880
but everything else, you know obviously
looks really cool.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.090
No back plate unfortunately, but it's still
Ok. Now,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.070
let's talk about frequencies. Reference
frequencies for the GPU,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.330
so GPU is right there, on the other side,
it's 648 MHz,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.250
the ... user at 1,476 MHz, or your shader
quarters are...

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.990
Your shader clock, whatever you want to call
it. Your memory though,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.450
is where it's a little bit different.
There's an extra entire set of memory chips,

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.170
and they're actually all aligned around the
GPU, over here,

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.530
there's a bunch of memory chips. You have 2GB
in total of GDDR3,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.300
and that's clocked at a 2484 MHz effectively
which is very, very nice. Now obviously,

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.740
PCI Express 2.0, it will work on regular PCI
Express, as long as it's x16, and it fits.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.790
It will actually work and you won't lose 
any performance, or at least a very

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.820
non-noticeable amount. This does do 2 and 3
way SLI. So right now if you want to have

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.690
the fastest computer on the market, this is
what you're going to use. You're going to use

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.450
the 2 GB GTX 285 and you're going to 
run 3 of them in SLI,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.840
and perhaps a 1900 GT for Dedicated Physics.
Now, looking over here,

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.130
you got Dual 6 pin PCI Express adapters, so
you're going to need about 550 watts

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.300
to run one of these, or you can get a little
bit more if you want.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.750
If you're going to run SLI I will recommend 
750, an if you're going to go for triple SLI,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.690
I recommend up to a 1000 and that's when you 
really need

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.710
to get into those 1000 watt power supplies.
It's a 204 watt TDP and when you overclock it

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.300
it goes a little bit higher, I'd say about
215, 210, it's not a huge difference so...

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.030
So that's really important to know. You also
have your audio loop cable,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.090
that combined with the HDCP Support and the 
HDMI Support and,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.180
this audio loop cable right here. This is
going to plug into your SPDIF header,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.070
and then plug into here and that's going to
give you 7.1 channels of audio,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.410
out through the HDMI, which is going to go
through the DVI,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.260
and into your dongle, and it's going to go 8 
channels of audio,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.330
7.1 surround sound, to your TV, or your
surround sound receiver,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.830
through one cable which is extremely 
convenient I might add.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.250
Now, also on top of that, you do have the 7
pin S-Video right there,

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.820
and of course these two dual link DVI's. And
these are DVI-I's,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.100
just so you know so they do both analog and
digital and they're dual linked.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.090
You can tell that it has all the holes open.
That's why you know, it's dual link.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.410
And as most high end video cards, obviously
you're going to be now. If you want to use

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.780
2560 x 1600, and 1920 x 1200, with either 3D
or even by itself, it's just 2560 x 1600,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.480
you have to use a dual link cable, Ok? It's
not an option, you won't be able to do it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.850
with a regular DVI cable, so make sure you
get one. If you're going to use

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.330
the 30 inch monitors, important. Now, these
are powered by dual 400 MHz RAM DAX,

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.810
they'll 2560 by 1600 at 60 hertz with both
on, or it'll do 2048 by 1536 at 85 hertz.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.740
If you want to do a single one, you can go
up to 240 hertz

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.080
at 2560 by 1600. Now, everything else
is about the same.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.100
Direct X 10, ShaderModel 4.0, OpenGL 2.1, 
CUDA, PhysX, GeForce 3d vision certified

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.900
ready which is really cool. If you haven't
checked that out yet you definitely should.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.490
In the box you have 1, make that 2, Molex to
6 pin PCI connectors for your power,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.260
in case of an old power supply. I wouldn't
use these long-term if I were you.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.420
PCI... This is VGA actually to DVI dongle,
so if you're using an older monitor,

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.290
you can definitely use these, they are handy
to have. The HDMI one,

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.610
that I already mentioned is going to do a
lot for you if you have a big TV.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.480
Very cool to hook up your computer to your
TV, especially your desktop for gaming.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.920
Very fun. The audio loop cable that we 
already talked about. A quick start guide,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.860
a driver disk, which... Wouldn't use it. Go
online and download the latest ones,

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.020
'cause you get huge performance games.
Every time they have a driver update,

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.580
you got like a big gain at performance. And
it's so worth it. It's free money,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.200
free performance, you don't have to pay
anything for it.

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.660
Here's nice, 20% off of Mirror's Edge, which 
is a great game I might add if you've never

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.170
played it. It works with PhysX, and it's
actually a really fun game to play.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.650
Didn't get a lot of credit, but I think it's
pretty fun, I don't know.

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.090
And also an advertisement for the killer Z 
new MPU Network processing unit,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.860
which is very cool. So, that is it. The 2 GB
version of the GTX 285,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.530
this is already the fastest single GPU card
in the market,

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.930
now they doubled the frame buffer for the
people to have really big monitors,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.130
you'll also get performance gains, when you
turn on iCandy, like antialiasing.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.410
Which is going to make everything look a
little nicer,

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.220
and it's not going to slow you down, so 
It's not going to drop your frame rate

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.970
horrifically, because of the large frame 
buffer. So really good stuff,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.480
if you have any questions on it, email me, 
and I'll see you guys next time.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.860
For more information on the EVGA GTX 285 
with 2 GB of frame buffer,

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.760
type in E145-0283 into the search engine of
any of these major retailers.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.690
