00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.779
Hello. And welcome to the wonderful world
of washing your clothes. Today we're focusing

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.500
in on washing your colored clothes. Next step,
we've come over to our machine, and I'm going

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.660
to show you how to load your machine. Now,
I have here about a medium size load, so,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.030
what I'm going to do is, I'm going to shake
it out, make sure there's nothing stuck in

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:31.050
there, or trapped in. Put it in. Shake this
out. Make sure there's nothing in there like

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.149
a red sock. Make sure there's no children
or pet's down in there. Nope. We're OK. OK,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:54.600
shake this out. Make sure it's turned...(indistinct).
Alright, OK. Shake this guy out. And, shake.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.940
Just make sure everything's ready to go. So
there we have a nice size medium load. Now,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:07.691
what you're going to do is, you're going to
look on here, and I would call this a normal

00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:12.440
load. So, I'm going to move this dial over
to normal. Going to look before I even start,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.960
again at my water temperature of cold, warm,
or hot. And I'm going to want cold, because

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.730
I've already presorted and prioritized and
I know what my clothes need. So, turn it over

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.420
to cold. Water level. I know that this is
a medium load. It's not a large load or a

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.770
small one. And this is very important nowadays,
with water conservation and energy conservation,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.050
so don't just throw it in and hope for the
best. Look at this water level, and put it

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.430
on medium. OK. Now, since I got my handy dandy
samples, I know how much I'm going to need

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.210
for this medium load, but what you need to
do is to look at your detergent, and there

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.280
is a line on either the bottle or the cup.
And you're going to put in enough for a medium

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.590
load. Don't put too much detergent in, because
then your clothes can have residue, and you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.560
don't really want to waste detergent. So that's
going to go in. And also, same thing for your

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.700
fabric softener, they come usually with a
little lid. And you can determine it's a medium

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.430
load, so you're not going to need to fill
it to the front, and that's going to go in

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.910
your fabric softener container inside. So,
there...one last look. Everything's ready.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.959
And we are ready to start washing our colored
medium load of laundry.
