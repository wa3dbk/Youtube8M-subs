Person on the phone: "You don't sound too good,"

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.240
*sniff*

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.920

Every support is gonna tell you  the same thing:

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.500
When you're playin' support out there,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.260
The idea is you wanna get the- all the kills that you can.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.960
