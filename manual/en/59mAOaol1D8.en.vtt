On this website, you can find the carmods

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Don't forgett to search under Gta San Andreas.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I already got a carmod for a uranus.(A carmod
are 2 files)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The file cartexturenscript.lua and meta.xml
are in the Description

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
replace name with the name of the texture
files.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
replace CAR ID with the ID of the car

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now you have to change the names also in the
meta.xml

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now place the script into the recourcefolder

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:25.200
and start the server

00:03:45.200 --> 00:04:00.000
and the script

00:04:01.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And now you finished.
