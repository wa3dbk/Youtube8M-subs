00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.545
- And soak up all the liqui,
liqu, liquid moisture.

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.552
Soak up all the liquid?

00:00:07.552 --> 00:00:09.401
- Hey everyone, how's it going?

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.484
I have a delicious and yummy healthy treat

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:14.520
for you today.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.019
We are going to be
making some chia pudding.

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.234
If you guys ever heard of tapioca pudding,

00:00:19.234 --> 00:00:21.956
this is way better, and way healthier.

00:00:21.956 --> 00:00:24.130
Now if you never heard
of chia seed before,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.812
it's been linked back way, way, way back

00:00:26.812 --> 00:00:28.499
with the Mayans and Aztec,

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.526
they used this as their
main source of grain.

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:35.081
And in today's world, we
use this as a super food.

00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:36.950
And a super food is basically something

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.284
that is high in nutrients,
and low in calories.

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:41.989
So this packed with proteins,

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.581
antioxidants, calcium,
and all that good stuff.

00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:47.881
You should definitely Google this

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:51.355
so you can learn more of
the Chia seed benefit.

00:00:51.355 --> 00:00:52.635
So I love to put this in my drinks

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:56.313
and I also love to make this as a pudding

00:00:56.313 --> 00:00:58.710
which I am going to show you guys today,

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.148
and how you can build your own pudding.

00:01:01.148 --> 00:01:02.225
Okay, so let's get started.

00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:04.277
I'm going to make myself a big jar.

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:05.943
I like to use the white chia seeds

00:01:05.943 --> 00:01:07.629
so make sure that you find this,

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.291
and you can find this at your
local health food stores,

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:11.733
or supermarkets.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.009
Now I'm going to use a big spoon,

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.365
which is equivalent to a tablespoon.

00:01:16.365 --> 00:01:20.963
So I'm going to start with
one part of chia seeds.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.289
And then I like to use almond milk.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.321
You can use other dairy products,

00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.962
or other non-dairy products, if you want.

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.522
I just love almond milk.

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:35.632
So I'm going to pour three
parts of almond milk in here.

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:39.445
So aside from the almond milk,

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:42.554
you can also make this using juice.

00:01:42.554 --> 00:01:46.272
I usually, I don't have a
measuring spoon that I go by,

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.426
but what I usually do
is I just fill this up

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:50.498
to almost a quarter of the jar.

00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.347
Then I would pour in the drink and I would

00:01:52.347 --> 00:01:57.347
pour the drink up to like
three quarters of the jar.

00:01:58.361 --> 00:02:01.530
So this is mango juice.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.523
And just mix it up.

00:02:04.598 --> 00:02:07.219
And that is the base to
making your chia seed pudding.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.600
I'm getting hot right now,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.856
let me just put my hair up.

00:02:10.856 --> 00:02:12.257
All right, so now it's the fun part

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.025
and this is when you can add stuff

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.447
and build your own pudding.

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:17.520
I usually like to use a coconut milk

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.693
to make this more creamy.

00:02:19.693 --> 00:02:24.332
I would fill the rest of my
jar in with some coconut milk.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.256
And if you want to make this sweeter,

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.820
I think that the almond milk

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.177
and the coconut milk makes
this flavorful enough,

00:02:30.177 --> 00:02:32.940
but if you want to add in more sweetness

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.378
then I would recommend using one spoon

00:02:35.378 --> 00:02:37.552
of organic cane sugar.

00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:40.803
You can also use organic coconut sugar,

00:02:40.803 --> 00:02:42.956
or you can use agave, or honey,

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:44.541
whatever you want to use.

00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:47.142
I also like to use some fruit preserve,

00:02:47.142 --> 00:02:49.722
which is already sweet as it is.

00:02:49.722 --> 00:02:52.505
And I also like to use
some crushed pineapples.

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.801
I would also mash up some bananas

00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:56.549
and add into this.

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.072
All right, so I'm going to cover this

00:02:58.072 --> 00:03:00.348
and then put it in my fridge so that way

00:03:00.348 --> 00:03:02.989
the chia seeds can soak up all the liquid

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.106
and become gelatinous,

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:08.786
and more like a pudding consistency.

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:11.177
Now with this one

00:03:11.177 --> 00:03:13.127
you can leave it as is because

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:15.382
it's already sweet from the fruit juice.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.191
Or you can make it more creamy.

00:03:17.191 --> 00:03:18.918
I think I want to make it more creamy.

00:03:18.918 --> 00:03:20.035
I love coconut milk

00:03:20.035 --> 00:03:22.473
and if I can add coconut
milk in everything

00:03:22.473 --> 00:03:24.545
I would probably do so.

00:03:24.545 --> 00:03:26.049
I'm actually doing it now.

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.146
Ah ha ha ha.

00:03:27.146 --> 00:03:30.565
All right, so let's do that.

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:31.920
Mmm, it looks yummy,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.033
it looks almost like mango wasee.

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:36.311
So I'm going to store this in the fridge

00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:39.011
and let it sit for a couple of hours.

00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.449
I usually prefer to let this sit overnight

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.558
before eating it, it's
just so much more yummy.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:46.183
Another one of my favorite flavor

00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:48.723
is peanut butter, or almond butter.

00:03:48.723 --> 00:03:50.470
And I'm going to use
almond butter for this

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.095
just because it's easier to mix

00:03:52.095 --> 00:03:54.228
and it's also very healthy.

00:03:54.228 --> 00:03:59.023
So I will just scoop
in about two big spoons

00:03:59.023 --> 00:04:01.075
of almond butter.

00:04:01.075 --> 00:04:05.789
So over in this jar I already
premixed some chia pudding.

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:09.344
And what I'm going to do
is scoop in the pudding.

00:04:09.344 --> 00:04:10.563
Pour in the chia pudding so

00:04:10.563 --> 00:04:15.563
as you can see it looks very
similar to a tapioca pudding.

00:04:16.273 --> 00:04:17.574
But what I like about this,

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:20.296
it's actually better than tapioca pudding

00:04:20.296 --> 00:04:22.470
just because I love like the texture

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.420
and the consistency of this pudding.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.472
It's almost like it's gelatinous,

00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:28.281
but inside it's crunchy, you know,

00:04:28.281 --> 00:04:30.312
you get a crunch from the seeds.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:33.177
And it's so delicious.

00:04:33.177 --> 00:04:35.026
You have to definitely
taste this for yourself.

00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:37.713
And then I would just mix it.

00:04:38.846 --> 00:04:41.162
All right, so then I'm
just going to let this set

00:04:41.162 --> 00:04:45.449
in the fridge with the
rest of my chia pudding.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.771
Mmm, so good.

00:04:48.008 --> 00:04:51.102
Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmmmm.

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:54.063
Okay, so for the fruity flavors

00:04:54.063 --> 00:04:57.537
I like to use either
pineapple, crushed pineapples,

00:04:57.537 --> 00:05:00.971
or mashed up some bananas.

00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:04.714
And I think I'm going to mash
up some bananas for this.

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:11.209
Mash mash mash mash mash mash mash.

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:15.267
You can also like pour in
some vanilla extract too

00:05:15.267 --> 00:05:19.573
if you want to have that
vanilla-y sweet scent.

00:05:19.573 --> 00:05:22.479
Now it's time to pour this in.

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.876
I like to add the fruits to the bottom,

00:05:24.876 --> 00:05:26.156
just because it just, I don't know,

00:05:26.156 --> 00:05:28.128
it looks yummier that way.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:30.260
You can just, you can do this to the top

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.497
of chia pudding.

00:05:34.384 --> 00:05:35.707
All righty, so that is it guys.

00:05:35.707 --> 00:05:38.204
All you have to do is
put this in the fridge,

00:05:38.204 --> 00:05:40.135
let it sit for a few hours,

00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:41.801
or take it out tomorrow night

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.279
while you're watching
a movie with the hubby,

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:45.905
or with the family.

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:46.940
Share this with your friends,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.120
take it to class with you,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.522
take it to school with you,

00:05:49.522 --> 00:05:50.050
whatever.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.710
This is delicious for as a breakfast,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.946
or as a daytime snack.

00:05:54.946 --> 00:05:56.389
I absolutely love this,

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:58.603
it's so healthy and delicious.

00:05:58.603 --> 00:06:01.670
Also I am still doing my
most engaged subscriber

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.645
of the month.

00:06:02.645 --> 00:06:04.414
So if you are my most engaged subscriber,

00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:05.896
then most likely you will win

00:06:05.896 --> 00:06:08.030
and I will give you a goody package.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.081
If you're wondering what's this all about,

00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:12.013
all the information is below this video.

00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:13.982
I make new videos every week,

00:06:13.982 --> 00:06:15.750
so I will see you next week.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.056
Ciao!
