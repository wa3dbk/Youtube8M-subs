00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.769
If you look up at the night sky in any direction,
past all the stars and more stars and galaxies

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.180
and superclusters of galaxies… you will
see light that has been traveling for 13.7

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.780
billion years to reach earth. It's the oldest
and most primeval light in the universe, a

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.060
picture of our cosmos in its hot younger years,
and it's called the "Cosmic Background Radiation,"

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.970
Of course you can't really see this light
with your naked eyes, because it's in the

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.200
microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum.
But it is visible to radios and radio telescopes,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.050
and even makes up a small portion of the 'salt
and pepper' on an analog TV.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.109
Where does this luminescent background come
from? Well, just after the big bang, the entire

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:39.399
universe was still so small it would have
been very dense, scorchingly hot, and, because

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.059
it hadn't yet had time to get rough and uneven,
it would also have been scrumptiously smooth.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.760
For a while, things would have been so sweltering
that electrons didn't settle down as parts

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.760
of atoms or molecules but instead roamed freely
in a kind of red-hot cosmic soup. That soup

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.899
would have had lots of light bouncing around
it, too, scattering off of electrons and protons

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.870
like a hall of mirrors or the interior of
the sun...

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.309
However, as the universe expanded, there was
less and less energy to be had in any one

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.441
place.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when things had cooled to just
below the temperature of the sun, pairs of

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:10.000
electrons and protons no longer had the energy
to resist each other and they fell into the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.310
electromagnetic embrace we call the hydrogen
atom. These electrons were so enamored by

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.500
their new proton love interests that they
effectively began to ignore all the light

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.110
bouncing around them. So, with fewer free
electrons for light to interact with, the

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.120
universe suddenly became transparent, and
all the pent-up light was sent forth in whatever

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.740
direction it had been headed after its last
scattering, doomed to travel alone and unnoticed

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.530
through the cosmos. That is, until it bumps
into something solid…

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.960
When we finally see it here on earth, this
light has been stretched so much by the thirteen-billion-year

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.770
expansion of space, that, like a record slowing
down, its frequency and color have shifted

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.240
from the original sunlight-white all the way
to cool microwaves. Thus, it's often called

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.090
the "cosmic&nbsp;Microwave&nbsp;background radiation",
or CMB. And just as we can tell the temperature

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.320
of a red or white-hot iron from its glow,
this light tells us the temperature of empty

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.600
space: currently around 2.725 degrees Kelvin,
or minus 270 degrees Celsius.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.289
However, the universe isn't&nbsp;exactly 2.725
Kelvin in every direction… if we look closely,

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.379
there are small and seemingly random but noticeable
bumps all over the place, kind of like milk

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.860
that's starting to curdle. Our best understanding
is that these cosmic curds formed as quantum

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.130
fluctuations in the otherwise creamy infant
universe, and then began to coagulate as the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.239
universe cooled and expanded.
It's hard to overstate just how small, or

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.409
un-bumpy, these fluctuations of temperature
and density were to begin with - the hot or

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.530
cold spots were hotter or colder than their
surroundings by a factor of about one in a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.599
hundred thousand - that's like noticing that
a bacteria makes a beach ball bigger.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.480
But, while this clumping of the universe initially
resulted in small variations like the ones

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.889
we see in the CMB, later on the chunky curds
of primordial soup attracted each other gravitationally,

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.550
and they ultimately coagulated and coalesced
to form all of the massive structures in the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.239
universe that we see today, like planets,
stars, galaxies, and superclusters of galaxies.

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.680
So when we look up at the night sky past those
galaxies and see the ancient light of the

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.129
cosmic microwave background radiation, we're
literally seeing the starting point, the proverbial

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.810
cream, if you will, from which the starry
curds of the universe congealed. Or quite

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.040
simply, proof that the moon really is made
of cheese.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.909
To give you a more complete experience of
how awesome the cosmic background radiation

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.650
is, we've made an ADVENTURE! map showing it
as if it were the out-of-this-world geography

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.909
of your favorite fantasy series - except it's
really the first picture taken of our universe

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.309
as a baby! We've included pictures of constellations
and galaxies with the map, plus an overlay

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:34.049
of what the sky looks like in infrared. And
if you're feeling imperial, you can help name

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.689
the oceans and mountains on our map. Head
