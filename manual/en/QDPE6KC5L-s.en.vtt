Before I start, I want you guys to take a
second and to like our Facebook page and to

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.110
follow us on twitter both links are in the
description below. James and I decided that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.179
we

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
will start doing giveaways and the only way
to be informed about these giveaways are by

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.410
following us on both social medias. Okay let's
get started.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.750
number 5

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.730
The Batman Roller Coaster by Six Flags situated
at Georgia is considered one of the most

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.539
popular and funnest ride. However, it was
a different story on June 8th 2008. Asia Leeshawn

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.910
Ferguson who was 17 years old at the time
rode the batman ride and due to the speed,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.950
his

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.220
hat was lost in midair. As soon as the ride
ended, the 17 year old attempted to retrieve

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:53.670
his hat which was located across a fence that
marked "restricted area." Unfortunately that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.610
was not enough to stop Asia. He was able to
jump over the restricted fence and that's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.790
when

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:05.460
he found himself facing the fast ride going
at 50 MPH towards him. The teen was instantly

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.780
decapitated by the ride.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.009
number 4

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.670
On June 3rd 2011 the Pleasant Tech Academy
took its students to a field trip at the Morey's

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.229
Mariner's Landing Pier in New Jersey. The
young 11 year old Abiah Jones who was riding

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:20.370
the

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:26.170
ferris wheel by herself fell about 156 feet
to her death, that's the equivalence of a

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.460
ten

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.710
storey building. How she slipped out of her
seat is unknown as the doors of the seats

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.130
open

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.549
inward which makes it difficult for someone
to climb out.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.630
number 3

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.600
In 1951, Battersea Park was the host for a
fun fair as part of a Festival for Britain.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.450
May

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.479
30th 1972, what should be a day for people
to enjoy, laugh and celebrate turned into

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:49.740
a day

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.250
of terror. The fun fair included an infamous
ride called "The Big Dipper" a three car

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.350
wooden train which rode at 50 mph. The ride
was always the main spotlight and brought

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.409
a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.420
long line up of people, mostly children. That
day 31 people had boarded the ride. The ride

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.489
was going as planned until it reached 15 metres
above the park. Suddenly, the train

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.510
detached from its drive chain earlier than
it should have, the operator in charge could

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.590
be

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.760
seen struggling to activate the breaks. The
train slipped backwards and hit a tight turn

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.840
and derailed from its tracks. Two teenage
boys including an eight-year-old girl died

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.270
at the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.580
scene...two other children died later. The
park amassed several charges including

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.080
manslaughter, the ride was deemed as a "death
trap."

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.980
number 2

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.970
The Mindbend is the world's largest indoor
roller coaster and it's situated in Edmonton

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:50.400
mall in Alberta, Canada. Its first operation
date was on March 16th 1986 and everything

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.530
went well, but exactly three months later
the unexpected occured. Upon completing the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.690
second inverted loop, missing bolts on the
left wheel assembly from one of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.390
the bogie caused the ride to disengage from
the track. This lead

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.400
the train to stall at the top and sliding
backwards finally crashing into a concrete

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.400
pillar. Three people died from the accident
and one was injured with his legs pointing

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.819
opposite directions.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:16.670
number 1

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.140
In a small town of Berdsk in Siberia is where
the fatal death of six year old Sasha

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.519
happened. The young six year old hopped he
fence of an amusement park and wentstraight

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:27.629
to

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:32.500
the park's Ferris Wheel. The park was closed
at the time and no one was there to operate

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.209
the control system, but Sasha somehow was
able to turn the machinery on. He then hopped

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:38.340
in

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.390
one of the seat of the ferris wheel and rode
in it. As bystanders watched, the six year

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.519
old

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.349
decided to switch seats during mid-ride by
the time he realized that he couldn't, it

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:49.560
was

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.860
already too late. The ferris wheel was already
gone too high and Sasha was left hanging to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:02.000
a metal bar 15 metres high. Bystanders just
stood there and laughed some even took a video.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.930
About 5 seconds of hanging on, Sasha fell
to his death. I decided to not post the video

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.860
here as it would go against community guidelines
on YouTube. But, if you look find it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.739
around the web, you will see the kid screaming
for his dear life seconds before his fall.
