OK, before we start any braid, of course you
want to check to make sure that you can get

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.960
a comb going through there so it's easy to
separate. Tilt his head back. And we have

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.350
our hair right here, of course we're not going
to use all of it. Depending on how wide the

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.320
braid is, is going to decide how much hair
you're going to use. I'm going to use about

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:28.570
this much, just to get it started. Kind of
get it together and go in, those spare strands

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.910
you can just drop. Clean that up later. Now
what you're going to do is you're going to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.950
take this middle piece, make sure you have
an even length on each side, and grab it in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:49.680
the middle. And grab a decent sized piece
of hair, proportioned to how thick this is.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.570
And you're going to start it just as if this
was the hair that was attached to the scalp.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:02.640
Try to bring it really low, OK. Cross that
over just like a braid, and cross this over.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.670
And we're going to get it one more time to
get the natural hair back in the middle. That's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.219
how you start it. Now you're going to add
this hair to the extension and go underneath,

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.999
add hair to the extension. It's just the same
as if we were only using the hair that was

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.640
attached to her head. It's just a little tricky
because it's long. You've got to make sure

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.450
you get it out the way. And this hair is fine,
just keep going underneath. You're going to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.079
lose a few strands. No worries, just keep
going. And we're just going to keep continuing

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.689
back, just like any other braid. Just be aware
of where your end pieces are. Make sure you

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:59.659
keep it out of the way. And be sure to be
very tight. Keep this out the way. Move this

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:10.979
here. And we're grabbing the second strand,
to go underneath. There we go. And as you

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.540
can see, it's just starting to come in to
a nice braid. Just keep adding and working

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.980
backwards. And try really, really to be aware
of keeping this hair separate from each other.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.540
Don't let it get tangled.
