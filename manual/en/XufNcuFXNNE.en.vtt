00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000

were a lot of cars in the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
accident. The lady that was

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
she was still in the car. Her

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.133
especially on the

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
driver side," Authorities shut

Escambia and Santa Rosa County

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000

waiting to get back to her home

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
BITE PERKINS "That area has

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
bad accidents all the time.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's one of the worst one's I've

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.933
seen," Perkins says she feels

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
terrible for the people

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
involved, but

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
blessed that she wasn't

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
BITE PERKINS "When you see

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
something like that you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
think, is it someone I know? Is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
it my daughter? It's terrible.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
On a beautiful sunny day, it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
