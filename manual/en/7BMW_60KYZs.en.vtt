00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.400
I'll be talking about Yu-Gi-Oh today. These
are monsters you want to look for, for your

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.860
Different Dimension deck. We have D.D. Survivor;
easily and MVP of most Different Dimension

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.390
decks provided he's removed from play.Whenever
he's removed from play, during the end phase

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.020
of that turn he is special summoned back to
the field. He's a very modest eighteen hundred

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.780
attack, very low two hundred defense. Concerning
how he's going to be in attack position most

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.690
of the time though, you should be fine. Eighteen
hundred attack is enough to weather some of

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.310
the best four star monsters that are played
in the current format. You can bash them,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.260
which means they lose both of them or you'll
easily over power them. If you bash, which

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.690
means take equal attack monsters and destroy
each other. If you have Macro Cosmos or Dimension

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.730
Fissure out, he's going to return to your
field at the end of your turn special summoned.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.090
Which means, you lost actually nothing. The
best time to use Survivor of course, is when

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.280
you have Dimension Fissure or Macro Cosmos
on the field. You've got to watch for your

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.520
opponents back row, because he might pull
a trick which might destroy Macro Cosmos or

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.990
Dimension Fissure which means, he won't be
removed from game when he's destroyed. He

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.020
can do this as part of a chain, so you want
to watch out. You want to be conservative

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.180
somewhat when you're attacking things, when
you're opponent has that back row. You never

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.020
know what tricks are up there. And, D.D. Survivor
will only survive if you keep your back row

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.770
in tact. You've got to keep your trick of
the trade there or you're going to lose him.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.900
Best case scenario, you have one or both of
them on field. So, even when he destroys one

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.610
he might not be able to destroy the other.
In which case, you can attack relentlessly.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.220
You can also use him for tribute and he still
returns at the end of turn. The only requirement,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.619
is that he be removed from the game. It doesn't
matter how but he has to be removed.
