00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.360
Fundraising has already begun

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.360
for the three Australian kapa haka
who were victorious

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.080
at the qualifiers
held this year in Sydney.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.040
While money is an issue
for the three kapa that made it,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.320
they can't wait
to strut their stuff

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.240
at Te Matatini 2015.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.080
Anzac Pikia is in Sydney.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.160
Sydney played host

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.960
to the Australian National
Kapa Haka Festival,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.040
But a team from Perth
took the victory.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.520
For Manawa Mai Tawhiti,
champions of Australia -

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.640
it was a piece of cake.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.880
Easy, easy as.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.640
That's what I thought anyway.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.800
Te Raranga Whanui,
a Sydney-based group,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.520
were winners last competition,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.560
but bridesmaids this time around.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.160
Really good.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.800
I was proud to see

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.240
my partner up on stage

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.400
because today
is all about being Maori

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.320
here in Sydney, Australia.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.240
Turanga Ake is from Brisbane

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.600
and competed
at Te Matatini last year.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.280
We'll see them again
onstage in 2015.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.680
These three groups
will represent Australia

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.560
at Te Matatini 2015.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.280
Their long journey to Christchurch
starts with fundraising.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.960
It's hoped the next Australian
qualifiers in 2016

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.080
will be held in Perth.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.000
At the end of this month,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.360
Te Tai Rawhiti
will hold their regionals.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.080
Anzac Pikia reporting from Sydney,
Australia, for Te Karere.
