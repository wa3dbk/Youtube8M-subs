00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.830
Angry Birds Rio basically plays the same way,
but the entire game feels like it has been

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.830
upgraded.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.830
Quite a bit of the interface has been redone,
there are far more things to collect, and

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.830
they've even added parallax scrolling to give
the game quite a bit more visual depth.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:35.830
The 60 included levels are all designed incredibly
well, and seem to have solutions where you

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.830
can brute force the level by destroying it,
or looking for the single weak spot which

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.830
sets off a Rube Goldberg-like chain reaction
of destruction.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.830
I hope these improvements eventually make
their way over to the proper Angry Birds and/or

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.960
Angry Birds Seasons, as it would be really
sweet to need to deal with a big and crafty

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.410
boss pig.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.660
The collectable items are also a nice touch,
really giving reason to replay levels beyond

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.660
scoring three stars.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.449
Really the only down side is the clear display
of when additional content is coming, with

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.270
blank menu spots for May, July, October, and
November 2011.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.540
I think I prefer just being surprised when
an Angry Birds update lands than knowing I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.920
have to wait so long...

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.860
And I doubt I'm alone on that.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:12.290
Instead of killing pigs, you've got to break
fellow birds free from cages in the first

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.230
world.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:29.580
Then in the second world you're defeating
monkeys.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:40.970
The 60th level has a boss fight of sorts where
you've got to fling birds at Nigel, the bad

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.680
guy of the movie.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.356
You even get to fling Blu and Jewel, the two
main character birds of Rio.

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:47.356
It's all really well done, and any fans of
Angry Birds will have a fantastic time playing

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:48.356
through Angry Birds Rio.
