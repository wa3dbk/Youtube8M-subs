00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.672
 

00:00:14.672 --> 00:00:18.120
Chromosome 10 is
extraordinary.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.270
We all know what it's like if
we're forced out of bed way

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.500
before 5 o'clock
in the morning.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.470
It takes us a long
time to wake up.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.760
We all have a day within, a
biological clock, also called

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.220
a circadian clock.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.440
And what this does--

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.620
and it really can't be
overemphasised--

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.400
is regulate almost every aspect
of our physiology and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.760
behaviour, fine tuning
physiology and behaviour to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.030
the varying demands of activity
and rest, cranking up

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.940
hormones and metabolism in
anticipation of activity, and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.850
turning it down again in
anticipation of sleep.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.020
So the sleep-wake cycle, changes
in blood pressure,

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.520
changes in temperature still
show a near 24 hour

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.390
oscillation, but it wouldn't
be exactly 24 hours.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.040
And so what needs to happen
every day is that this

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.600
slightly drifting clock needs
to be adjusted to

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.900
environmental time.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.740
And the most important signal
that the clock needs is

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920
exposure to the light-dark
cycle.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.540
And that light-dark is detected
in mammals such as

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.490
ourselves by light-detecting
cells within the eye.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.240
It's critically important that
the body clock is adjusted

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.750
every day by the light-dark
cycle.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.610
If you didn't get that daily
adjustment, then internal time

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.570
would be abnormally
synchronised with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.350
the external world.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.480
And perhaps the best example
of that is jet lag.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.730
So we knew that these
photoreceptors were in the

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.140
eye, because if you prevented
light getting to the eye, then

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.470
the body clock no longer
responded to light.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.980
So there's something
in the eye.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.550
The big problem was that it
was very difficult to

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.310
understand how the classical
visual cells of the eye could

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.900
be detecting overall brightness
within the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.300
environment.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.910
For vision to work, the visual
cells grab light.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.440
They send that information
off into the brain.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.070
And then essentially
they stop working.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.700
So you have a series
of sharp images.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.390
And it was very difficult to
understand how that image

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.600
detecting system could also
get an appreciation of the

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.930
overall amount of brightness
and hence time of day.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.770
So there was a big puzzle.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.850
We started using mice in which
the rods and cones had largely

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.520
degenerated as a result of
inheritive retinal diseases.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.440
So these mice had lost most
of their rods and cones.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.550
They were visually blind.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.500
And we wanted to see whether
they could still regulate

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.620
their body clocks.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.460
And what was absolutely
extraordinary is that these

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.830
visually blind mice were able
to regulate their body clock

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.070
to the light dark cycle
perfectly normally.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.693
The mouse would get up, run in
its running wheel, and then go

00:02:54.693 --> 00:02:57.840
to bed at the same time day
after day after day.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.860
And so we thought, my goodness,
there is something

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.370
really interesting
going on here.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.640
There had to be another class
of light-sensitive

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.550
cell within the eye.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.910
And the big question, of course,
is, well, if it's not

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.580
the rods and cones, then which
of the cells of the inner

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.410
retina could it possibly be?

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.380
Eventually the light sensitive
molecule was found, and it was

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.870
called melanopsin, or OPN4, and
that gene is located on

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.840
chromosome 10.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.980
I think knowledge about
this new system

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.750
is really very important.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.220
If you think about it, we know
that there's about 40 million

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.480
people worldwide who have
no sense of visual

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.680
sensitivity at all.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.840
Now understanding that there's
another light sensor within

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.850
the eye could hugely improve
the quality of life and the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.620
sense of well-being of
those individuals.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.650
And at the moment,
very little is

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.540
discussed about those cells.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.190
So the fact that melanopsin is
turning up in chromosome 10

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.500
makes chromosome 10 my
favourite chromosome.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:22.663
