00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:07.490
A warm, light weight and packable option for
cold weather or year round use, the Therm-a-Rest

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.420
NeoAir XTherm MAX Sleeping Pad doesn't cut
any corners.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.921
Unlike a lot of weight saving, spaces saving
back packing style sleeping pads, it has a

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:21.010
really tapered cut.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:29.300
The fully rectangular NeoAir XTherm Max sleeping
pad really does serve as a sprawling and comfortable

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.710
sleeping base.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.090
Let’s take a closer look at its innovative
design.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.740
One of the first things visual that jumps
out at you on the NeoAir XTherm MAX are these

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.800
horizontal baffles.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.530
Traditionally inflatable sleeping pads have
had a series of long, vertical baffles.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.530
And when inflated those sometimes can give
kind of a bouncy pool rafty feel for lack

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:02.790
of a better term and aren’t always the most
comfortable base for sleeping upon.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.630
That is different on a pad like this.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.429
You get really nice, consistent support and
sta-bility on this and it really diminishes

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:11.429
that effect.

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:21.850
What is out of view on this pad and exists
inside the actual baffles is a series of reflective

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.850
barriers.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.950
There is some separation in there as well.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.079
This pad does not rely on insulation for its
warmth, so it does away with the bulk and

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.159
the weight that you often have when you are
using insulation.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.569
Instead, those stacked reflective barriers
take the heat of your body and throw it back

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.460
in your direction, rather than escaping into
the ground or into the air.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.420
It gives this pad an R value of 5.7, which
absolutely is a year round worthy value.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.069
So you can be confident using this on snow,
in winter or throughout the year.

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.810
The pad does come in a couple of different
sizes.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.730
I have got the regular length here in front
of me, so 20 inches wide by 72 inches long.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:17.380
A larger size gives you some addi-tional width,
25 inches wide by 77 inches long, so a much

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.730
bigger base.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.220
In both instances you have got a nice two
and a half inch thick base beneath you, which

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.040
really, again, lifts you up off the ground,
allows that creation of space and that reflectivity

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.970
that makes this such a warm and comfortable
pad.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.360
In terms of the weight, the regular comes
in just over a pound at 17 ounces and the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.080
large is just a few ounces heavier than that.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.310
Packs down nice and small because of that
inflata-ble design and the absence of, in

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.090
this case, unnecessary insulation.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.820
The same feature that makes this so light
weight, makes it so packable and such a great

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.730
option for back packing is also what makes
it a pad that you do have to blow up.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.100
It is an inflatable pad.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.620
You have got the nozzle right here at the
upper end of the pad for that purpose.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.660
Certainly you can blow it up by mouth.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.280
It takes a little bit of time, but not an
excessive amount of energy.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.130
But Therm-a-Rest does include a pump sack.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.400
So what you are seeing here is not just the
stuff sack for the pad, though it serves that

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.510
purpose, certainly.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.680
It also is a pump sack.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.250
And what I mean by that, there is a nozzle
attachment right here at the bottom of that

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.250
sack.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:45.960
Just wraps around the nozzle itself and you
fill that pump sack with air and you use that

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.710
to introduce air into the interior of the
sleeping pad.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.740
If you don’t want to blow it up, you use
the pump sack to do that and save yourself

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.710
the effort and the energy of doing that by
mouth.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.090
The other potential benefit of that is when
you blow it up by mouth you can introduce

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.150
moist or wet, damp air into the interior of
the sleeping pad and over time that can start

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.590
to wear away at the interior of the pack and
potentially shorten its lifespan.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.229
Using the pump sack will cut down on any of
those negative effects and extend that lifespan.

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:28.310
It is also worth mentioning Therm-a-Rest does
include a field repair kit with each of these

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.310
pads.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.289
So if you do run into some kind of issue in
the back country, something that causes a

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:41.180
leak, you can repair that in the field instead
of being stuck without the warmth and comfort

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.050
of a sleeping pad.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:50.639
The Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XTherm MAX inflatable
sleeping pad, just such a great bal-ance of

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.740
weight, warmth and performance.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.330
Got that nice packable size, perfect for back
packing, weighs just over a pound.

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.379
And then that 5.7 R value which means you
can con-fidently turn to this pad in varying

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:08.151
conditions and regardless of the season.
