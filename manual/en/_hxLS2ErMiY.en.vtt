This is Nev Lapwood and Dan Gerstner

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.440
This tutorial is all about Methods.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:22.510
It's filmed at Boreal in California and Whistler
Blackcomb in Canada

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.470
A method is without a doubt the most iconic
trick possible on a snowboard.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.750
It's stood the best of time throughout the
history of snowboarding and is still a favorite

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.910
trick amongst pro snowboarders.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.650
You can definitely tell how good a rider is
by the style in their method.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.640
It'll take years to perfect.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.670
This video has broken down steps that you
can try to start developing your methods.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.670
What is a Method
A Method is a Mellon grab, tweaked up behind

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.920
your back, combined with a backside shifty.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.100
The movement is quite complex to learn because
there are several different techniques happening.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.329
Once you get the muscle memory, it eventually
happens with ease.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.939
The easiest place to learn the movements of
a method is on a trampoline as you can practice

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.810
the position over and over in a very safe
controlled environment.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.770
A method is generally done on straight airs
and not often combined with other tricks.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.759
It's common to see it done when busting out
of the pipe, big hips in the park and on natural

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:29.759
backcountry features.

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.249
A method is without a doubt the most iconic
trick possible on a snowboard.

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.249
It's stood the best of time throughout the
history of snowboarding and is still a favourite

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.249
trick amongst pro snowboarders.&nbsp;

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.880
The grab is done with your front hand on your
heel edge like a mellon grab.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.499
You can grab either behind your front binging
or in front of it.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.689
This is usually a "no grab" zone but this
is one of the only grabs where it's acceptable

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:55.170
to grab here but only if you do it well and
definitely don't grab your heel.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.459
Step 1
Backside shifties

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.380
The key behind shifties is counter-rotation
where your upper and lower body twist against

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.470
each other while in the air.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.880
We have a tutorial dedicated to shifties so
make sure you've watched that video first.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.230
You need to have backside shifties dialed
to perform a solid method.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.780
Step 2
Mellon Grab

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.880
Make sure you have your mellon grabs on lock
down as it's using the same hand to grab on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.180
the same edge as a method.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.000
Get out our grabs videos for more info on
mellons.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.980
Step 3
Melon Grab extended behind your back.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.830
This is a really good stepping stone for a
method but it's not an actual trick you do

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.030
for style.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
Don't let anyone see you trying this step
because it looks horrible and only newbs do

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.720
it.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.600
Try it when no one else is watching you ride.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.430
Step 4
Add backside shifty.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.900
Step 4 is the most important step to turning
these stepping-stones into a real method.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.650
It's where you add your backside shifty into
the trick so that he base of your board is

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.850
facing where you flying, not towards the snow.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.910
You should be able to build up this step relatively
quickly and from here it can take considerable

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.970
time to refine your methods.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.790
You can either shiftie and grab your method
at the same time or you can grab first then

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.790
shifty.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.570
Both ways can be stylish.

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.280
Some riders find it easier to do their shifty
after grabbing.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.570
As you're learning it's very normal to only
have a small shifty.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.340
In general the more you shifty, the better
it will look.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.790
As you progress, a good method should have
at least 90 degrees of shifty.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.070
If you anticipate a little before taking off,
it'll help you to shifty more.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.400
Look closely and you'll see that my upper
body is wound slightly towards the tail of

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.320
my board as I take off.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.120
This makes it easier to get more shifty in
the trick.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.620
Step 5
Back leg position

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.430
Extending your rear leg while in the method
adds even more style to the trick giving it

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.069
more of a boned out look.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.290
Try kicking out your back out like your trying
to tap something.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.320
Your back leg should be up parallel with your
front leg so your board is parallel with the

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.210
ground or try to get you back leg even higher
than your front leg.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.310
A method on this angle below parallel is not
as stylish.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.990
Step 6
Crank it

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.600
Once you've got all the basic fundamentals
of a method it's time to start cranking it.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.070
Putting effort into this trick.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.000
This is not just some trick to do casually.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.530
When cranking a method you can add your own
style.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.540
Pushing your hips forward and arching your
back is one way to crank your own style into

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.860
a method.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.940
I find that taking off slightly on my toe
edge helps me to add that extra bit of counter-rotation

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.160
to crank a method harder.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.190
This is also why methods are common on a backside
hip as it's naturally leading you into that

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.850
slight backside direction.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.870
Step 7
Refinement

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:15.870
Practice makes perfect.

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.440
A lot of practice.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.790
The more methods you do, the better you'll
become.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.880
Get someone to video you doing a method so
you can see how your style is.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.180
Compare the finer points of your method to
the steps in this tutorial to see where you

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.860
can improve.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.440
Go back to the tramp and practice methods
until the movement is engrained into your

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.440
mind.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.120
Style is very important in a method.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.980
You have to make sure this trick is smooth
and stylish while being cranked with authority.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:50.400
If it's a messy or forced movement, it won't
look as good.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.780
Summary
You methods won't be awesome at first.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.520
Try doing mellons tweaked up behind your back
when no one is watching you ride.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.430
Then quickly add a backside shifty.

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.650
From there you can follow the pointers of
this tutorial to refine your method.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.320
Some of the most famous past and present shredders
are known by their methods including, Craig

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:08.320
Kelly, Jamie Lynn, Terje Haakenson &amp; Nicholas
Muller.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.800
This trick is not going anywhere and helps
to define style in your ridding.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.610
Practice them often.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.240
