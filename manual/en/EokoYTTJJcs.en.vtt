Hello my name is James Colonna from Cherry
Hills Studios on behalf of Expert Village.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.370
In this next clip we'll be talking about rudimental
breakdowns and more specifically how the paradiddle

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.800
there's really so much many different rudiments
there involved with paradiddle. You have grandma's

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.520
with are very marching percussion rudiments
basically has a paradiddle there is padada's

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:37.570
which is a paradiddle there are herta's which
is paradiddle . And what I'm going to do is

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.260
I'm going to show you how by understanding
what your right hand and your left hand is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.240
doing you can move in and out of these rudiments
flawlessly with no problem what so ever, because

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:59.470
you understand that the same motion is your
doing are in every single rudiment that your

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:11.659
playing in the series. Now for those who don't
know a paradiddle is 6 notes and a sequence

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:19.659
of right left right right left left okay and
that's what I'm going to be basing all of

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.880
this off of. The first thing I'm going to
do is going to go from the paradiddles into

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:34.880
the grandmas now the grandmas is basically
a paradiddle without that last diddle, so

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:50.729
instead of right left right right left left
it becomes right left right right left, right

00:01:50.729 --> 00:02:01.290
left right right left so your taking that
second left out. (drumming) Now once we've

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.390
moved that paradiddle to the grandma the sequence
of right left right right left we're going

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:24.079
to take out that first diddle and turn the
grandma into a herta and a herta pattern is

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:40.680
right left right left right left right left
so instead of doing right left right right

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:56.900
left and your basically your thinking of a
paradiddle still right left right right left

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:10.760
left you can now take it and think of a herta
right left right left and I'll snap my fingers

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.159
as where the other beat that other diddle
would come from a paradiddle's. So it would

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:21.559
be right left right left right left right
right left, right left right right left okay

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.889
(drumming)
