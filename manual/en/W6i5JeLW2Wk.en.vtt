00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.280
Hello, this is Lenny with the Exmark Technical
Service team. Just want to cover a few items

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.740
as far as quality of cut, deck cleaning, and
maintenance to make sure that your Exmark

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.260
machine is cutting as good and as well as
we know that it can. One of the things that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.320
we see most consistently when dealing with
quality of cut is simply maintenance here

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.800
in the service department. So some of the
things that you need to keep in mind to keep

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.590
that machine cutting as well as you want it
to are: (1) tire pressure, (2) keeping your

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.960
idlers greased, (3) ensure you have proper
belt tension, (4) proper service and maintenance

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.559
of the blades, (5) keeping the deck clean,
(6) keeping the deck adjusted, whether it's

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.290
left or right for the level of the deck, or
front to back for deck rake. Deck rake is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.010
actually the forward tilt of the rake on the
machine. So if you line the blades to the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.350
front and the back of the machine, the front
blade tip is actually lower than the rear

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.570
blade tip. What that allows the deck to do
is make a seal with the grass on the front

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.640
of the machine, and allows the deck to pull
air in from the back of the machine to give

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.750
you the best discharge of those grass clippings.
On a 60-inch deck, we usually want about 3/16-

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.000
to 1/4-inch of deck rake. How you obtain that
is simply by loosening these chain bolts,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.770
and using your set screw to drop the front
of the deck, or raise the rear of the deck.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.599
But slight adjustments can actually be done
with just the tire pressure alone. What deck

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:41.709
level talks about is if the front blade tips
on the left side blade and the front blade

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.979
tip on the right side blade should measure
the exact same cutting height off the ground,

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.630
as so should the rear blade tip. So if you're
a little low on the right-hand side, adding

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.349
a pound or two of pressure to that right-hand
drive tire will effectively raise the right-hand

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:59.759
side of the deck, and get you the nice, level
cut that you're wanting. One of the best things

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.330
that you can do is keep the deck as clean
as possible. What we recommend is using air

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.130
instead of water. A backpack blower on the
machine works great to blow all the debris

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.590
off the top of the machine. However, when
you're going to clean underneath the machine,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.690
it's going to take a little more physical
labor. So one of the things that we've introduced

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.410
is a little jack and receiver stand to help
get the front end of the machine off the ground

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.410
in order for you to get underneath that. I'll
show that here real quickly.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.750
So now we have the front end of the machine up in the air

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.219
to where we can service the bottom side of

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:40.120
it. So a few things that we might want to
do are as follows. (1) Check our blades--make

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.709
sure they're sharp, make sure they're serviceable,
make sure each of the tips line up with each

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.879
other and that we haven't hit something to
cause one of those to bend down or bend up.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.909
(2) The other thing that we're going to have
to do is occasionally scrape the bottom of

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.629
the deck to remove the old grass build up
from underneath there. The best time to do

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.459
that is right after you've pulled in from
mowing. If you allow that grass and debris

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.799
to dry over time, it can really become as
hard as concrete, and becomes very difficult

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.870
to scrape off. One of the other good reasons
to clean the bottom of the deck is if you

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.719
happen to have some chemical or some of that
other type of stuff in your grass, or if you

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.810
do have a turf disease and you get rid of
it later on, if you don't scrape the bottom

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.519
of the deck, it can cause your deck to carry
that disease on throughout the summer in your

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.109
turf. So it would effectively be ruining anything
that you've done for your grass. So we've

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.969
covered a few of the items that will help
you keep the quality of cut of your Exmark

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:33.719
where you believe it should be. In the end,
however, there are thousands of variables

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.890
that can affect the quality of cut of your
machine. If you experience a diminished quality

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.340
of cut of your machine, your local Exmark
dealer is the best point of contact to get

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.450
that machine back to the point of where it
was right off the showroom floor. Thank you,

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.689
and I hope you found this helpful.
