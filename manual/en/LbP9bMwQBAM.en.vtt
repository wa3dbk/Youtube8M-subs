00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:04.504
(knocking)

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:05.643
- Oh, hey girl, come on in,

00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:06.826
welcome to my crib!

00:00:06.826 --> 00:00:09.227
So I just got my apartment
completely redone

00:00:09.227 --> 00:00:11.682
by my girls Mary and Leah from A Fab Life.

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:13.656
They hooked a brother
up with so much stuff

00:00:13.656 --> 00:00:15.860
from my favorite stores, and flea markets,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.579
and APt2B.com, and I
was like, "Oh my gosh,

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:19.981
"I love this place."

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.433
I did an apartment tour in San Francisco,

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.758
y'all loved that, so I was like,

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:24.381
"You know what, I need to
do a new apartment tour,

00:00:24.381 --> 00:00:27.212
"now that I'm living in LA
with this amazing place."

00:00:27.212 --> 00:00:29.394
So, let's get down to business.

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:31.345
Oh, hey, welcome to my room.

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:36.024
This is where all the
magic happens (laughs)

00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:37.668
I have no excuse for this.

00:00:37.668 --> 00:00:39.470
So as you can see, I'm kind of obsessed

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.954
with British boys, I
just love a nice accent,

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:44.790
and a beautiful man attached.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.853
But, there's one exception to the rule,

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:49.795
and that is the one man
who made it onto the wall,

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:51.373
among all the British boys,

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:53.522
my one (mumbles).

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:55.054
Okay, so this little
shelf is a whole bunch

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:57.434
of trinkets and things that
I've collected over the years,

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:59.140
fortune cookies that I've collected,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.823
a postcard that the (mumbles) project

00:01:00.823 --> 00:01:02.356
sent me the first time I ever made a video

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:03.292
about them, they sent me.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:04.185
Every time I go to Disneyland,

00:01:04.185 --> 00:01:06.170
I gotta wear a hat, and those are my hats.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.328
Okay, so now, let's go
check out my closet.

00:01:08.328 --> 00:01:10.067
I have hoodies, and my sweaters,

00:01:10.067 --> 00:01:12.367
and my vision board, and my jeans,

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:15.257
and all my short-sleeve button downs,

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:17.497
a whole bunch of t-shirts and everything.

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:20.045
Everything that you've ever seen me wear

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.545
is from this room.

00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:25.167
Let's go on over to my study.

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.942
This is where I edit, and
you may recognize that,

00:01:27.942 --> 00:01:29.509
it was the background in my old videos.

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.402
Sometimes I film in
here, sometimes I don't.

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:32.968
But this is where all the editing happens.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.324
Here is my living room,
and it is, like I said,

00:01:36.324 --> 00:01:40.248
completely done by Mary
and Leah from A Fab Life,

00:01:40.248 --> 00:01:42.488
they knew exactly what I wanted.

00:01:42.488 --> 00:01:44.880
I told them I wanted
it to be grandma chic,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.857
and a whole bunch of trinkets and stuff,

00:01:46.857 --> 00:01:49.243
and mismatched and floral,

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:51.727
and something that my grandma
and my grandpa could have

00:01:51.727 --> 00:01:54.770
in their apartment if
they were cool and hip,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.372
so that was the goal, and I
think we really accomplished it,

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:59.971
and let's dive in a little deeper.

00:01:59.971 --> 00:02:01.626
First and foremost, I was really nervous

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:03.345
to get a couch because I
was like, "I don't know

00:02:03.345 --> 00:02:04.564
"how I'm going to frame the room."

00:02:04.564 --> 00:02:06.805
But we got this couch from Apt2B.com,

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:09.139
and I absolutely am in love with it.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.490
I want something that
people can just come over

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.739
and lounge in, and feel
comfortable to just hang out,

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.375
and I want an apartment
that is just super chill,

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:18.907
and super fun and casual.

00:02:18.907 --> 00:02:20.462
So we got this, I love it,

00:02:20.462 --> 00:02:21.937
we got all these different pillows

00:02:21.937 --> 00:02:23.331
from a whole bunch of different places.

00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:24.204
So when we were trying to figure out

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:26.318
how we were going to
decorate this little couch,

00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:27.331
we got all those pillows,

00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:29.435
and I was like, "We need
a throw of some sort."

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:30.851
and the girls over at
A Fab Life were like,

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.350
"This is going to be amazing."

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.335
I didn't know what their game plan was,

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:35.843
but now that I have it on my couch,

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:37.532
I don't know how I would live without it.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.378
I'm obsessed with it,
I think it's from Ikea.

00:02:39.378 --> 00:02:43.772
And like I said, I really like floral.

00:02:46.283 --> 00:02:47.945
But it's not just floral
that I'm obsessed with.

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:51.084
I'm also obsessed with antlers.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.953
And finally, I am also
obsessed with globes.

00:02:56.222 --> 00:02:58.510
So I got this record player on Fab.com,

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.508
I fell in love with it,

00:02:59.508 --> 00:03:01.204
and I had never had any vinyl before

00:03:01.204 --> 00:03:02.422
but once I got my record player,

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:04.467
I was like, "Okay, I need to
start finding more vinyl."

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.446
So, every time I go to the flea market,

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:09.366
I go and get more vinyl, and I
have a little mini collection

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:12.110
going on here of just a
whole bunch of albums,

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.719
that I love now, albums
that I've loved in my past,

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:17.900
and I just put it on,
and I love my ambience.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.072
And finally, I have a little reading nook

00:03:20.072 --> 00:03:21.453
to round off the room.

00:03:21.453 --> 00:03:22.591
Okay, now that you've seen the rest

00:03:22.591 --> 00:03:25.273
of my apartment, let's
go check out the kitchen.

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:26.876
We have, a pretty basic kitchen,

00:03:26.876 --> 00:03:28.872
which you may recall from when I did a

00:03:28.872 --> 00:03:30.672
My Drunk Kitchen with Hannah Hart.

00:03:30.672 --> 00:03:33.016
It's got cookbooks, and my radio,

00:03:33.016 --> 00:03:35.258
and my coffee maker,
and then a whole bunch

00:03:35.258 --> 00:03:37.115
of pictures that I've
collected over the years

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:40.471
from YouTube stuff, my best
friends from San Francisco,

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:42.490
a whole bunch of Darren Criss magnets,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.085
you can change the outfit,
it's kind of fabulous.

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:47.302
And then my mom, if you can see that,

00:03:47.302 --> 00:03:49.508
she's the best, I love her,

00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:51.424
and then a magnet that
my mom got, it says,

00:03:51.424 --> 00:03:52.469
"Waiting for the right guy,

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.208
"meanwhile, having a great
time with the wrong ones."

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:59.191
And then, I got on my fridge,

00:03:59.191 --> 00:04:01.489
a whole bunch of pictures
that I have accumulated

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.034
over the years on Instagram.

00:04:03.034 --> 00:04:05.345
I found a little website
where you can make magnets

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:06.830
out of all of your Instagram pictures,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.767
so these are some of my favorite people,

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:10.546
favorite memories, and a whole bunch

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:12.692
of people that you might recognize.

00:04:12.692 --> 00:04:14.469
I don't know, a whole bunch
of YouTubers on there.

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:16.465
And then every time that I've ever drank

00:04:16.465 --> 00:04:21.027
a bottle of wine, I've kept the cork.

00:04:21.027 --> 00:04:22.930
So you have all of those.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.553
I drink a lot, and I'm not even sorry.

00:04:25.553 --> 00:04:27.912
Okay, so that is my new apartment tour,

00:04:27.912 --> 00:04:30.129

of while they were
putting it all together.

00:04:42.418 --> 00:04:43.998
