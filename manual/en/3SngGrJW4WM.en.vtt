00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.790
Hi, I am Brian Halvorsen and I am a dentist.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.280
I have been in practice for over 35 years
and I have written a book about my principles

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.860
on holistic dentistry.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.460
The book is called Great Teeth for Life.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.460
In this video, I will discuss receding gums.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.029
Now, you can have various reasons for receding
gums.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.440
In the younger generation, it's mainly due
to possibly over infusia gastic brushing which

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.300
is literally wearing away the surface.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.420
So the gum withers away and exposes mortar
root.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.730
This is slightly complicated by the fact that
it depends on where the tooth is actually

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.620
positioned on the jaw bone.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.820
And sometimes, it just isn't bound to surround
the tooth to start with.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.170
And it quickly may just shrink back.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.690
This is not a disease and it is not likely
to cause the loss of a tooth.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.249
It may be unsightly and you may then need
to talk to your dentist about how possibly

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:08.159
you could meet the help.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.909
But this is not a disease.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:18.759
The next possible situation where you may
notice receding gums is actually purely aging.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.619
As we get older, the gum and the jaw bone
does shrink back from the roots.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.289
So this again, this is a natural process but
I often find my patients do get slightly alarmed

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.599
when they see that their roots are more exposed.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.840
And again, possibly unsightly.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.649
Now, by trying to brush them, you can't do
the brush them back.

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.459
Once actually these gums have shrunk back,
all you can really do is keep them healthy

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.939
by good hygiene around where they join the
tooth.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.549
Trying to comb the gums back will only lead
to some pockets blowing up and possibly gum

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.859
disease.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:05.229
Now, gum disease is often the most common
cause of receding gums and this is where the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.269
bacteria and the plague would have actually
caused the bone to shrink back because of

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.610
disease and this is again permanent.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.819
We cannot push the gums back to where they
used to be without actually covering up the

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.709
disease process.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.420
So what we try to do especially with the help
of a hygenist is actually to make sure that

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.180
as the gums recede, all the various root shapes,
everything else are kept clean.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.030
And so that this process does not proceed.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.970
Ironically, when the gums are shrunk and they
are kept healthy, we may not see the gums

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.049
shrinking back.

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.569
But by keeping them looking healthy and are
healthy, we can actually stop this process

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:54.769
from occurring.

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.599
I hope these tips and explanations may explain
about receding gums.

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:00.470
Thank you. .
