00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.300
Having conquered the worlds of game development,
Formula 1 racing, and worldwide travel, it’s

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.510
somehow fitting that Japanese studio Kairosoft
should look to the stars for its next solid

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.970
gold classic.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.930
Epic Astro Story cherry-picks the best bits
from Game Dev Story, Grand Prix Story, and

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.140
World Cruise Story and combines them to produce
a mobile title that will ensnare you utterly.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.820
Instead of dealing with irate programmers
or Prima Donna footballers, Epic Astro Story

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.590
has you colonising planets, forging alliances
with alien races, and battling with all manner

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.570
of ferocious monsters.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.519
The game can be roughly divided into two sections:
construction and exploration.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.600
To sustain your colony you need to generate
revenue by manufacturing goods, attracting

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.190
tourists, and exporting items.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.409
In order to do these things you’ll need
to create an effective cityscape, with roads

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:53.729
linking all of your buildings and domiciles
to house your burgeoning population.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.649
Pretty soon, you’ll run out of usable space.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.749
That’s when the exploration component comes
into play: by assembling an Away Team (a neat

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:06.070
reference to Star Trek) you can gain access
to unexplored regions that not only throw

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.450
up monetary rewards but also grant additional
space in which to expand your colony.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.060
Of course, you can’t completely overrun
the planet without facing at least a little

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.200
resistance.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.170
Your Away Team will often come under attack
from malevolent forces, so you’ll need to

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.090
arm them with weapons and clad them in armour.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.079
Both of these can be developed and manufactured
internally, with research points being used

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.159
to improve the capability of your technology
and thereby construct even more impressive

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.409
items.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.869
Like all Kairosoft titles, Epic Astro Story
sucks up your spare time like a Dyson fresh

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.130
off the production line.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.659
It’s so embarrassingly addictive that you'll
almost certainly miss social events as a result

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.659
of its allure.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.750
However, it’s not entirely perfect.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.869
The controls are a bit of a headache: when
placing roads, buildings, and other structures,

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.359
it’s sometimes awkward to pick the correct
spot.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.539
You’ll find that you sometimes build in
the wrong place and have no option but to

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.900
knock down the structure and start again - a
situation that can leave you out of pocket.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.289
There’s a definite feeling that Epic Astro
Story would be improved with a mouse-driven

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.369
interface, but it’s not a complete disaster.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.600
By holding your finger down on the screen
during construction you can be more precise

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.120
about where you place your buildings and overcome
this quibble.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.560
Epic Astro Story pulls together the very best
qualities of Kairosoft’s output: it’s

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.190
painfully addictive, surprisingly deep, thoroughly
rewarding, and boasts a pixel-heavy retro

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.709
look that's both appealing and archaic at
the same time.

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.340
In short, if you’ve experienced - and loved
- the company’s previous offerings, then

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.489
this is not going to disappoint.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.680
On the other hand, newcomers should steel
themselves for one of the most compelling

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.440
mobile games of recent times.
