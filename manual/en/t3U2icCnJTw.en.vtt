Hi, everyone. I'm Alejandra from Alejandra.TV.
And in this video, I'm going to show you how

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.530
to organize all your food storage rack like
your foil and your plastic and your bags and

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.719
stuff.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.000
So before we get started, if you are looking
to begin getting organized, you can check

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.570
out my free organizing video series on my
website, Alejandra.TV. The link is below.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.760
OK. So I'm in my kitchen right now and I had
this really narrow, deep cabinet next to my

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.410
sink that's kind of like -- it looks like
dead space. Like when you open it, it's really

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.489
deep. There's a big electrical outlet in the
way and it's like, "What do you do with the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.680
space? While at the same time, I had my foil,
my plastic wrap, my bags and I was trying

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.809
to figure out a way to organize it inside
here. And I'm excited to show you what I've

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:42.839
done here.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:48.619
So opening up the cabinet, so what I've done
here is I went to Home Depot to get -- like

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:54.150
I was trying to like build my own organizer
because nothing like this exists. So what

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:00.600
I did was I found this fence posting just
like this in like the fencing department at

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.400
Home Depot. And I got it cut to 12 inches
long and I've just put them in here. I've

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.450
stacked them and I've kind of puttied them
together so they don't move. And then I've

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.660
used a binder clip to kind of clip it together.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.580
But now, I'm using them as organizers to organize
all the foil and plastic and stuff. And it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
like -- I feel like it's my favourite cabinet
in the kitchen now besides like the tea bag

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.850
organizer drawer. But everything has its own
compartment. You just come here, you grab

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.000
something and you put it back. There's no
like jamming it inside of a drawer. There's

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.210
no stacking, trying to get to the bottom one.
Everything has its own organizer. And then

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.060
I use binder clips to kind of clip them together
and then I just label them with what is what

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.280
so like freezer bags, Saran Wrap, foil, Saran
Wrap wax paper and then wax paper down there.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.479
And then on the side of the organizer, I just
have all my freezer bags. So I talked about

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.190
this in another video. I always reuse freezer
bags because they're expensive. I just wash

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.420
them out and then I put them in here. Like
if they're on the side of the drawer, I know

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.940
they've been used and it's time to reuse them.
If they're still like in here, they're obviously

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.849
brand new. But I try and use the old ones
first and then if not, use the brand new one.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.500
And then once the bag gets like really old
then I bring it upstairs to my home office

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.700
and I use it in there for like papers or for
craft materials.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.260
So yeah, so that's how I organize all of my
food storage bags and stuff. If there's a

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.330
way you organize it to make it easy to access
and like no frustration, leave a comment below
