Hello heroes, I’m Irina, your Community Developer!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Welcome to the advanced strategy tutorial!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
After you watch the video you’ll be able to crash every enemy you encounter and clash of heroes will always end in your favor!

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
When you are in the multiplayer part, you have a choice of different heroes.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Each of them is quite strong and has its own advantage, but today let’s focus on what strategy can be applied to Varkas.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Here we go!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
To recruit your army, you can select from faction-specific basic and more advanced troops.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
To start, let’s choose 1 Swordsman, 2 Archers and 1 Angel.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It is good to know that if you pick only 1 Champion creature, you’ll get it on your battleground more often.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That is good for our strategy because we want to get a whole lot of angels!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
“Blessed Wing” will let the Angels heal all charging attack formations back to full power instead of incrementally.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Our strategy is to activate as many Angels as possible at the same time.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
More often you can activate two of them and that’s what we are going to do.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Basically, Angels can heal all the formations that are about to charge.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The artifact provides an ability enabling angels to heal at the maximum on each turn.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Angels can be weakened by enemy attacks, however, as an angle can’t heal itself, we need 2 angels activated at the same time as they will heal each other on each turn.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And here we go to attack at the maximum all along!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now Use Varkas’ special ability to boost your charging attacks.
And yahoo victory!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For the 2nd strategy we’ll use 3 spearmen, 1 Knight, 1 Sword Master and an artifact Golden Spear.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The idea is to destroy enemy walls and attack as strongly as possible.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
To be efficient, you need to create small attacks all around the battleground (reinforce it by tying and merging attacks).

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.000
You’ll notice that if your spearman’s attack is stronger than walls in front of him, he’ll break it without losing any of his power and will attack the enemy at the maximum of his strength.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
In the second time you need to activate a Sword Master.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
He’ll help you break enemy walls.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This way your enemy won’t be able to protect himself and you’ll attack him more efficiently and so when your Sword Master finally attacks, it will be a deadly attack!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This tactic is a lot of fun by the way.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Choose one of each basic creatures and 1 Priestess.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This way we will get a lot of Priestesses on the battleground and so our strategy will be more efficient.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Pick up the “Staff of Elrath” artifact, this way while charging the Priestess will hurt the enemy rather than heal the Hero.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
While your enemy is trying to understand what’s going on, he’ll lose a LOT of life.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Interested? Yeah, right, that’s what I’m talking about!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:06.000
At the beginning activate as many Priestesses as possible: they will take enemy lives all along their charging time.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The more Priestesses you activate, the more you’ll hurt your enemy all along the charging time.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The enemy has not started his attacks yet and he is already losing his life points, isn’t it great?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now you are ready to start your winning and very unique strategy. There are so many choices! It is up to you!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
