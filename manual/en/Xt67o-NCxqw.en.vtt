Hey I’m Sean Martin the lead janitor for
Donek Snowboards I’m up here at A Basin

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.330
on May 15th we’re doing some board testing
and I’m on the lift here with Mike Krass

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.130
the two of us are actually testing some stuff
inspired by my recent trip to Soelden for

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.840
Carving Masters these things are fun rides
a lot like water skiing so edge to edge ride

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.420
free neutral on it it’s a lot of fun once
you figure out where to stand kind of be rolls

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.539
down the mountain pretty nicely. Alright so
Finn when was the last time you were on a

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.819
really skinny snowboard the last time I was
with a really skinny girlfriend so a long

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:57.929
time ago what did you think I you know the
first run was interesting and challenging

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:04.520
but in uncomfortable I’m gonna say but in
a good way so you’re comfortable I haven’t

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.350
ridden a board like this is in eighteen years
will adapt to it but once I got to the third

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.970
run and we we all when up to the top that
was fun and fantastic I got it so what we

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.710
do for the skinny boards is just run what’s
called the BP lower it’s the real minimalistic

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.040
lower that we generally run with the boiler
plate but it works great as a skinny board

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.660
lower this is a 15 wide waist 15 yeah and
we still got you can go to 14 on that I could

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.110
go to fourteen with it without BP lower it’s
the same thing canted it’s got a knee ring

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.020
center disk its all the same functionality
super lightweight I mean with this boards

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.230
light bindings are light it’s a nice set
up I had a blast on these little skinny boards

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.610
I think it’s gonna be a permanent part of
my favorite something I ride a a lot couple

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.660
really really neat things for me is I’ve
had this ankle injury for the last few years

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.870
that sort of required that I ride with a plate
I was totally able to ride without a plate

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.259
absorb everything with my knees with forward
facing stance a lot less effort too seemed

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.569
to be much much easier to ride I could ride
or standup I didn’t have to push on the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.640
board all the time and work to make it do
its think so much I can totally see why the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.971
Europeans are into it and you can bet you’re
gonna see some of them in our product line

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:24.980
for next year
