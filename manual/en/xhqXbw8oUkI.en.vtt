 (drum music)

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:07.707
- [Damien] Name's Damien Lemon.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.308 size:88% position:44%
 I'm originally from
 Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:12.078 size:84% position:42%
  I started comedy
  in New York City.

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.347 size:88% position:44%
  I currently reside
  in New York City,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.050 align:start position:0%
  and that's why I played
  the New York City circuit.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.518
 It's very redundant.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.686
New York City, New York
City, New York City.

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:24.157 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Well, I started in
 2005, the end of 2005.

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:27.126 align:start position:0%
  Been doing it, I guess
  what, close to nine years.

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:29.095
 It'll be nine at the
 end of this year.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.196 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Charisma going
 pretty good, I think.

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.799 size:88% position:44%
 About three, four years in,

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:37.303 size:88% position:44%
  I got Russell Simmons: The
  Ruckus on Comedy Central.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:40.807
 That was the first I've ever
 did comedy on television,

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.741 size:88% position:44%
 and if you watch that tape,

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:45.545
 I'm visibly nervous,
 you know what I mean?

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.713
 You can see my hands
 shaking a little bit.

00:00:47.746 --> 00:00:50.316
Lotta entertainers dyin' young.

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.187 size:88% position:44%
 I can't afford that
 luxury, you know?

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.321 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.123
 My fan base isn't big enough.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.458 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.059 size:88% position:44%
 Never mind dying too young,

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.395 size:88% position:44%
  what about dying
  too unestablished?

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:04.030 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.232
 I'm tapin' my half hour today.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.433 size:88% position:44%
  (cheering)

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:08.301 size:84% position:42%
  You know.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:11.170 size:84% position:42%
  My goal for this
  evening is to get

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:14.040 size:88% position:44%
  the word fledglin'
  out my obituary.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.476 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.445
There was a string from
like maybe 10th grade

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:22.148
to, through college, I got fired

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.550
from every job I'd ever been in.

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:25.618 size:84% position:42%
  I was working at Wendy's.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.053 size:88% position:44%
 I was on the grill.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:30.156 size:88% position:44%
 I remember my boss,
 she spazzed on me,

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.091 size:88% position:44%
 and like she kind
 of tried to diss me

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:34.327 align:start size:88% position:13%
 in front of what I
 thought was millions.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.561 size:88% position:44%
 You know when you're a kid,

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:36.729 size:88% position:44%
 you've got the most
 fragile ego ever.

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.164
 It was just me and my friends

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.465 size:88% position:44%
 from high schools
 and some customers,

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and she was like
 you need to shut up.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.469
 And then I was like,
 your breath is hotter

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.638
 than these burgers or
 somethin' like that.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.806 size:84% position:42%
  So they fired me.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:49.575 align:start size:88% position:13%
 My sister, who was
 kinda like, you know,

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.077
 kinda like a guardian of mine,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.678 align:start size:88% position:13%
 you know, she
 called, she was like,

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:53.779
 how's the Wendy's job goin'?

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:55.248 size:88% position:44%
  I was like, they fired me.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:57.217
 So she calls Wendy's.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.019 size:88% position:44%
  Says, yo, what's goin' on?

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:01.787 align:start size:88% position:13%
 My manager told my
 sister what happened.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.090
My sister calls me back,
tells me I have to call

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.092 size:88% position:44%
  the manager and apologize,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.727
 so then I had to call
 her back up like hey,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.629
 listen, I apologize for what
 I said about your breath.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:10.796
 She was like, I know, hang up.

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.666
 Hung up on me, still
 no job at Wendy's.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.802
Personally, I wanna put
my dick in an air blade.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.305 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.708 align:start position:0%
  A lotta ya'll might not
  know what an air blade is.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.545
For those of ya that don't know,

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.147 align:start size:88% position:13%
that's, you know, that's
the new advancement

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.715 size:88% position:44%
  in hand-drying technology.

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.717 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.386 size:84% position:42%
  You know, you see
  'em all the time

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.087
 in like these mall bathrooms.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.624 size:88% position:44%
 You put your hands in it,
 there's like this warm air.

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:42.361
 Feels like a warm, you
 know, a wind vagina.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:44.830
And you put your hand in
and it's like (blowing).

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:47.433 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:49.769
 And then your hand is
 bone dry after that.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.571 size:88% position:44%
  (laughter)

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.539
 I wanna put my dick in there.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.074
(laughter and applause)

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:57.276
 And it's waist level anyway.

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:59.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I'm like, damn, this,
you know what I mean?

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:00.713 size:88% position:44%
 I might even caught a semi,

00:03:00.746 --> 00:03:03.115
like this shit is way
better than I expected.

00:03:03.148 --> 00:03:05.051
 This is a way better
 hand drying experience

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.553
 than I ever hoped for.

00:03:07.586 --> 00:03:09.088
 I'm gonna put my dick in this.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.357
 (drum music)
