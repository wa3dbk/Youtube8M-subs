00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.089
I'm Tech Adams welcome to my
laboratories where we explore science through

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.279
technology and technology through
science

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.610
today's topic the symbiotic relationship
between human evolution

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.059
and technology

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.850
 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.570
When we hear the words science and
technology

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.160
it's easy to think about things like
quantum physics and the latest tablet

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.880
computers

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.290
and not the everyday tools that surround
us. But without the fundamentals of

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.129
science technology engineering and
mathematics

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.519
humanity as we know it wouldn't even
exist to build computers

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.140
or talk about things like the Higgs Boson.
So let's turn back the clock a couple

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.960
of million years

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.140
and see why humanity is so intertwined

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.540
with technology.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.760
We can get a pretty good idea about what
life was like eons ago

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.159
by comparing the evidences found in
the archaeological and genetic records

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.880
with what we've observed about other
primates today. One thing that Zoologists

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.780
have noticed in primates such as
chimpanzees monkeys apes and gorillas

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.159
is that they frequently make tools out of sticks and rocks to help them

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.760
accomplish specific tasks

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.670
most often though they don't alter the
tool too much from its original state

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.040
a twig stays a twig and a rock stays rock.
but something changed within the primate

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.240
order between two and two and a half
million years ago

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.130
this is the time that homo habilis and
his tools first appear in the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.330
archaeological record

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.140
A mid-level member the bipedal
hominidae family of the primate order

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.860
homo habilis began modifying the basic
tools that it was using to better suit

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.540
its needs

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.710
by smashing hard rock together with a
soft rock, piece of bone or wood

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.930
the toolmaker was able to chip off
pieces of the softer substance

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.550
and modify it into the desired shape. this
process is called lithic knapping

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.650
That's knapping with a "k", meaning to strike or hit

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.560
I can imagine one or two
of these

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.900
early human ancestors accidently
dropping one rock onto another

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.340
and discovering that the broken pieces
were sharp and useful

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.019
and then the first of all scientists
must have made a prediction

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.519
maybe if I smashed rocks together

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.670
I can make my own sharp edge!

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.129
Suddenly, this first nameless accidental scientist

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.409
invented the first all technologies

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.150
the basic stone hand axe. as primitive is
this technology is it gave the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.469
homo genus an evolutionary advantage
over

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:39.170
all other primates, allowing members to
secure greater sources a food shelter

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.099
and protection

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.719
by modifying the environment around them.
because of this technology the evolution

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:45.769
of the homo genus took a

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.310
drastically different course than all
of the other species on Earth

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.209
suddenly it was not only the fastest or
strongest that survived within a species

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.239
to reproduce

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.719
but also the individuals were best adept
at modifying their environment and

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.319
communicating these methods

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.799
their offspring.  And ever since technology
has been fundamental to our survival

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.879
but for arguments sake let's imagine a
world without technology

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.930
we'd have no computers or phones for sure
but also no

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.370
radio no cars no factories no
manufacturing in therefor nothing that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.209
is manufactured like cars or houses

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.340
even something as simple as a hammer
disappears in a world completely devoid

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.489
technology. What would happen to us
humans in such a world?

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:25.629
we're not faster than most large  predators

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.109
we have no natural protections from the
elements like thick skin, camouflage,

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:29.790
horns or spines

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.359
we don't have claws or talons to
rip or tear our pray. we have no fur or

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.120
feathers for protection from the
elements

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.389
and have no other natural defenses
against things like sharp rocks plant

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:38.739
life, insects

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.200
and the myriad of other ways that
mother nature has to kill us

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.730
in short if we as humans morphologically
identical to what we are today

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.370
were suddenly plopped into a world
completely devoid of Technology

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.790
will either die out completely or we'd create technology

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.769
we'd turn to animal skins for warmth, begin
weaving cloth for clothes

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.620
and  jump right back onto the
technological evolutionary train

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.069
back to where we are today. the invention
and refinement of Technology

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.090
fundamentally alters our perception of
the world and the evolution of society

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.019
in ways that are largely indescribable
and often unpredictable

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.780
and yet by and large we the public know
and understand

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.780
very little about science technology
engineering and mathematics

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.480
that's one of the reasons why STEM
education is such a hot topic

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.139
in education reform today the more that
we as a collective can know and

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:32.310
understand these things

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.480
the more we can shape are own future
evolution

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.729
For Tech Laboratories I'm Tech Adams saying

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.639
