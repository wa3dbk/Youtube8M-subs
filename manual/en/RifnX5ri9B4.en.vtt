So today, I'll show how to play heartbreaker by legs upward

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.709
[ok] broken it down to eight riffs. I'll play drift. I'll show how to play note float using the tabs

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.279
Okay, so here is riff number one

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.580
Okay

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.080
[it's] made a few times

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.789
[I'll] show the shot song start at the end the very first time play the top string third fret bend it you

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.480
Just do that once the beginning

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.180
Okay to fifth string open

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.680
Third fret

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.460
a fourth string open

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.040
first

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200
second

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.310
after the top string 3 fret

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.089
Peanuts riff number one okay riff number two is this

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.939
Okay, so that's at the fifth string second

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.140
coucher fifth

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460
fourth string second

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.610
third

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.870
fourth

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.729
top string [5th] fret [Bend] it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.110
Get back to the 5th string 2nd. Play it four times

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.920
fifth

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860
fourth string second

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.490
Third yeah forth

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.710
[the] top string fifth fret

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:40.779
Okay, and that pattern is play actually different places. I'll show a little bit later. Let's remember that pattern

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.440
Okay, okay, the verse comes in [its] [riff] number three which is this

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.959
Yes, a power cord [tottering] 5th

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.019
[no], if you wanted to run the bass note fifth string third fret

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.420
But if you want to be authentic, you just leave it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.339
to the D chord a chord

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500
Can you do that four times?

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.930
Okay, riff number four is this

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.140
basically that's just a d a

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.220
And you do that three times?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.590
Okay, riff number five

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:14.719
The same as riff number two like I said before, but [just] move where you start from so start at the fifth string third fret

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.570
Now the tabs up above you want to fall along

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.180
[um]

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.959
That's [rough] number five for if number six

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.520
Same thing

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.449
same Pattern but you start at the fifth string fifth fret

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:53.160
Okay, what's more with number seven starting at the fifth string some thread?

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:09.149
Okay, riff number eight follows number seven and it's this

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.610
Okay, so that's a third fret seventh

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.979
Wow fourth string night back to the third string

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.800
You do that three times?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.529
To the search tree nine threat you do that twice

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.849
And stop [stirring] open [two] groups of four

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.749
and then nine times

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.010
nine sets of [fours] you played the

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.000
top string open and the e power chord at the fifth string seventh fret

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.899
so one two three

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:39.249
ETC all the way up to nine nine times and then end it with a power work

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.940
Just like that

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.209
Okay, um yeah, that's a lesson. I hope you found it helpful and thanks for watching
