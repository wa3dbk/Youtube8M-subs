00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.450
In this clip we're going to learn how to draw
a cartoon flea, a little pesky flea. We're

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.009
going to come right up here in this corner
and I'm going to start by drawing a weird

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:24.640
armored shaped football, right in there, this
will end up being the body of the flea. Fleas

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:38.740
are ugly pesky little creatures so I'm going
to make this guy not the nicest looking guy.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.860
We'll draw his little body just like this
and we'll come in here and draw his scaly

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:58.239
little body on the back of him and we'll actually
come up here and we'll add a couple of hairs,

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.350
just to make it look, like I said, fleas are
kind of ugly hairy creatures. We'll draw his

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:17.000
back limbs like this, coming on down, little
legs hanging off his body. The thing about

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.049
insects is, they all have sort of like little
limbs that connect, they don't have really

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.080
one solid arm, they always have little sections
of the arm so that's one thing you're going

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.890
to want to keep in mind while you're drawing
these guys. There's some, looks like he's

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.960
sort of a pesky little scavenger creature.
To make this guy really nasty, we'll draw

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:56.140
a bunch of little teeth, like that, because
fleas are biters, they're not the nicest creatures

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:04.830
out there, I would say, in the insect world,
they're rowdy little scavengers. That's why

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:16.050
we're going to make this guy kind of a ugly
raggedy monstrosity. They're pretty good jumpers

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:24.080
so you've got to give them some big limbs
to do that and just dirty him up a bit. Come

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:35.021
in there and clearly show the edges of his
armored body, like that, and there you go,

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:44.980
an ugly little flea. He looks like a little
monster but that'd be a good start for a flea

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.510
character.
