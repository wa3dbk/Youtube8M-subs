&gt;&gt;Radonna: Hi I am RaDonna.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.080
In this segment we are going to talk a little
about curtains.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.099
When people are searching for curtains some
the styles they will find are: drapery panels,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.469
valances, toppers,
sheers, and many more.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.660
One very important thing to keep in mind when
looking at these treatments what is it you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.230
are trying to
accomplish.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.720
Are you trying to bring personal style to
the room with color or pattern’s?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.660
So that your keeping the
flow of the room continuing from furniture

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.340
to window treatments.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.710
Do you need these treatments to be energy
efficient or functional to give you privacy,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.510
insulation, or room darkening features?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.559
Or maybe you just want to
soften the room.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.579
What is great about all of these options is
that you don’t have to take down or get

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.210
rid of your existing blinds or
shutters, all of the work great together to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.390
compliment your home.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.539
So where do you begin?

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.219
1st thing you would want to do is as mentioned
before figure out what you are want to accomplish

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.219
in the room.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.710
Personal Style, efficiency and functionality,
just soften, or maybe all of the above.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.600
2nd is figure out your budget.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.640
When doing fabric treatments you have different
avenues you can take.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.610
You can
go completely custom, you can semi or almost

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.530
custom and then you can do readymade.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.660
And 3rd Envision your room.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.570
What colors do you see, what styles, are you
going for a theme or a feel you want

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.570
the room to exude?

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.740
I highly recommend looking in magazines tearing
out pictures, do you like the treatments

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.000
at a restaurant, hotel, or your best friend’s
house.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.820
Take pictures of them.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.880
One thing to keep in mind is things
may look one way in a store or magazine but

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.360
completely different in your living room.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.060
Lighting plays a big part
in what how something comes across.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.840
Colors too can appear different, the apple
red in a store or online my

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.730
look stylish but in reality looks burnt orange
next to your favorite bedspread.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.610
Sometimes all of this can seem
overwhelming to do on your own.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.050
