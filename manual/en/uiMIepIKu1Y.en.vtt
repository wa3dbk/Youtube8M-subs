00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.120
When Hyouta found the new box lined with tissue on the floor,

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.260
he was pleased to put himself right in the center soon.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.955
"You yourself look something like a present."

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.860
He adores a new box.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.860
"The new box is nice, isn't it?"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640
"The depth is just right size for you."

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.600
"Shall I make it for yours?"

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.460
"So you like it."

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.200
Then I placed the box next to the current box.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.900
I found him relaxing inside right away.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.720
Soon he will notice my camera.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.140
That made him embarrassed to admit he was.... 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.240
an early adopter of the new box.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.020
So, he pretends he was just visiting to check out the new box.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.920
He forced himself go back to the old box.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.580
But in fact, he craves for being inside the new box!!

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.940
Next day

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.740
At last he was staying in the new box.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.880
An early adopter, Hyouta.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.100
"So you are sleeping in the new box today?"

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.960
"So you like that box better?”

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.960
Soon, we can find his sleepy face.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.600
He looks annoyed.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.440
But he loves being petted.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.260
"Sleepy, aren't you?"

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.060
Since he is sleepy,,,

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.240
FLIP!

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.040
"He slept again."

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.720
"There are many tissues in the box although they are somehow placed inside."

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.480
"Scratchy, scratchy, scratchy....

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.520
FLIP!"

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.934
Scratchy scratchy, scratchy....

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.100
"Will you sleep now?"

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.040
I will!

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.660
"Good night"
