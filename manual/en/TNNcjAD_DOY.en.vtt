00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.719
You can add clairvoyance to the list of Wendell
Berry's many talents.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.629
Eleven years ago, in an essay for "Orion Magazine,"
he wrote, "If we make the world too toxic

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:21.180
for honeybees, some compound brain, Monsanto
perhaps, will invent tiny robots that will

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.880
fly about pollinating flowers and making honey."

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.250
This spring, Harvard University announced
the first successful controlled flight of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.430
a "RoboBee" that could take the place of real
bees and natural pollination.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.970
It would be funny if it were not so sad.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:48.239
This past winter, a third of US honeybee colonies
died or disappeared in a phenomenon scientists

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.530
call Colony Collapse Disorder.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.719
More and more, the culprit is believed to
be certain pesticides, fungicides and herbicides

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.920
that may be killing bees or adversely affecting
brain and nerve functions.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.059
In April, Europe announced a ban across the
continent, the first in the world, to prevent

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.020
the use of a kind of pesticide known as neonicotinoids.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.810
Activists in the United States are suing the
EPA to impose a similar ban.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.830
The world would be a lesser place without
the honeybee.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.150
A quarter of our diet depends on their pollinating
skills, but we also admire their beauty, and

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.150
grace.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.150
Observe.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.360
The environmentalist and writer Bill McKibben
narrates this short film, "Dance of the Honeybee."

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.660
BILL MCKIBBEN:
Let's think about bees in a hive, they go

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.970
out every day when the temperature is high
enough.

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:45.920
There're not like other farm animals, they're
this weird wonderful cross between wild and

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.380
domestic and they head out into the open world
and they come back as it were, with reports

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.979
about that world, you know, what it's like
miles away.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:06.000
So one little bee yard some place is a kind
of hub for understanding whole huge swath

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.720
of territory.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.809
Understanding whether it's been farmed well,
or treated as kind of a monoculture.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:19.859
Whether it's being saturated in pesticides
or whether it's producing a wide beautiful

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:24.079
variety of flowers of all kinds.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:33.349
There're sort of accomplices in figuring how
healthy and together our landscapes really

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.349
are.

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.299
One of the reasons I like being out with bees
is that you do sort of slow down and enter

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.379
their world a little bit.

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.049
I think they're quite beautiful, I like watching
-- I confess -- I like watching in early spring

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:56.499
the first few days of bees coming back with
pollen and just sort of looking at the pollen

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:01.629
in their saddle bags as they return and seeing
what color it is and figuring out where--what

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.920
tree it must of come from whatever.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.019
And there're beautiful and that you get a
sense of indefatigability, I mean, this is

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:17.730
an impossible task to, you know, three grains
at a time produce enough honey at time to

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.120
keep the colony alive over the winter, and
yet they do it and there is something quite

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:47.519
beautiful about that too.

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.140
I think most bee keepers are fascinated by
bees themselves.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:01.420
This perfect example of the idea that humans
could cooperate with another species to both

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:09.389
of their mutual benefit we don't have very
many examples of that in our society but that's

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:22.150
what a bee hive is.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:38.750
I mean honey bees are, like everything else
on our planet, under all kinds of duress.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.110
I mean, the world in which we jointly inhabit
is changing with enormous speed, so none of

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.949
the patterns that any of us are used to exist
in same way anymore.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:57.151
Bees are under treat because landscapes keep
changing, we get better at everything that

00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:02.580
we do and take more cutting of hay, you know,
we leave less time for clover to just sit

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.270
there in the field.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.189
Life is speeding up for them just like it
is for us and really neither us is coping

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.871
very well with the results of that.

00:05:14.871 --> 00:05:20.810
So, I mean, what we could do to help bees
is exactly what we can do to help ourselves,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.889
try to slow down the pace of change in the
world around us.

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.030
Human societies aren't going to be able to
cope with rapid climate change and neither

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.889
can most animal societies, bees included.

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.550
Human societies can't cope, turning everything
into monoculture, neither can bees, they are

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.729
a remarkable reminder for the need for a certain
kind of stability, in terms of things like

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:53.690
climate and the need for a certain kind of
variety, in terms of landscape and what's

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.449
around us.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.229
We need to be making at this point in our
society some wise decisions about the years

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:09.360
ahead and so we need to be using some of that
same focused and determined decision making

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.939
that bees has successfully employed over a
great many millennium.
