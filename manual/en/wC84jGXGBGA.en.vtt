00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.719
(rings)

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:01.532
Hello?

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:02.840
Don't freak out,

00:00:02.841 --> 00:00:06.934
but Mara's latest facebook post totally 
sounds like it's about the both of you.

00:00:06.934 --> 00:00:08.406
Wha--why? What does it say?

00:00:08.406 --> 00:00:09.803
Maybe I'm just reading into it,

00:00:09.803 --> 00:00:11.276
but I think you should read it.

00:00:11.276 --> 00:00:13.976
Oh my god, it totally sounds like a conversation we had.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860
But--but our conversation ended fine!

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.496
Why would she put this on Facebook like 4 weeks later?

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:20.684
Maybe it's a passive-aggressive attack.

00:00:20.684 --> 00:00:23.749
Maybe she's upset, but she doesn't feel 
like she can directly talk to you about it.

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:24.498
Should I call her?

00:00:24.498 --> 00:00:25.745
I should call her.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:26.242
Right?

00:00:26.242 --> 00:00:28.145
Honestly, I don't know. That's up to you.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:29.363
I just wanted to let you know,

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.684
plus if you look at paragraph 4, it says "bananas,"

00:00:31.684 --> 00:00:33.724
which is obviously a reference to you.

00:00:33.724 --> 00:00:34.224
(gasp)

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:36.020
(slow mo, in unison) ANNA. BANANA.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.527
I should call her, right?

00:00:37.527 --> 00:00:38.398
Or maybe I'll text Karen.

00:00:38.398 --> 00:00:38.720
Maybe you--

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.964
I'm texting Karen, hold on. (ding)

00:00:39.964 --> 00:00:40.581
What did she say?

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:42.184
She said she doesn't think Mara's mad at me,

00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:44.777
but if I think the post is about me, then I should call her.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:45.617
Oh my god.

00:00:45.617 --> 00:00:46.872
What if she's lying?

00:00:46.872 --> 00:00:49.464
I mean, they ARE BFFs, they 
would totally cover for each other.

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:50.833
Oh my god, they would!

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.464
I can't believe this..

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:56.646
I mean like, why wouldn't she just say 
something when we're having a conversation?!

00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.650
I am so pissed on your behalf.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:59.496
I'm gonna say something.

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:00.612
No, don't say anything!

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:01.467
Saying something.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:02.054
Thank you.

00:01:02.054 --> 00:01:03.401
Is this about Anna? (ding)

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:04.394
[in unison] (gasp) Oh my god..

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.025
She said it's TOTALLY about you two.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:08.105
I THOUGHT WE WERE FRIENDS!

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:09.580
(ding) Wait, she said she's joking.

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:10.720
Wait, was she joking?

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.745
I don't know, I am so confused.

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:15.119
WHAT ARE THESE MIND GAMES?!

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.995
OH MY GOD I CAN'T EVEN--(phone rings)

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:18.686
Oh my god it's Mara.

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:20.027
Answer it. Be strong.

00:01:20.027 --> 00:01:20.964
I'm here for you.

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:21.811
Hello?

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:22.807
Anna? Oh my god.

00:01:22.807 --> 00:01:24.715
I just want to call and say that the Facebook post

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:26.650
has nothing to do with you.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.897
Like, Brianna made a joke about it, and I joked back,

00:01:28.897 --> 00:01:31.212
but then she like took me seriously, 
so I was like "Oh my god,

00:01:31.212 --> 00:01:32.437
what's happening right now?!"

00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:34.648
So before anything gets crazy or out of hand,

00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:36.807
I just wanted to call and clarify that it has

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:38.744
nothing to do with you.

00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:39.348
Okay?

00:01:39.776 --> 00:01:41.611
No big deal, I..

00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:43.276
I didn't think it was anyway, but..

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:44.334
thank you for calling.

00:01:44.334 --> 00:01:44.898
Phew.

00:01:44.898 --> 00:01:45.931
Okay.

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.188
We still on for lunch tomorrow?

00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:48.245
Yeah, totally.

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:48.872
Awesome.

00:01:48.872 --> 00:01:49.500
Bye.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.498
The sad thing is,

00:01:50.498 --> 00:01:52.461
is that whole thing really happened.

00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:55.939
And if I had just called my friend and asked her about it,

00:01:56.617 --> 00:01:57.780
it would have been fine.

00:01:58.307 --> 00:02:01.399
So my therapist called it an "interpersonal triangle,"

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.525
or I think that's the right term.

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:04.718
Basically, if it's me and you having problems,

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:05.523
we're a line, right?

00:02:05.523 --> 00:02:08.493
Like our relationship is me to you, we're a straight line.

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:12.025
If this gets too stressful or I can't deal with it,

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:15.184
often, people will reach for 
something outside of the line,

00:02:15.184 --> 00:02:16.714
which creates the triangle.

00:02:16.714 --> 00:02:17.964
And so he says,

00:02:17.964 --> 00:02:18.995
"Don't do that."

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:20.588
Because it fuels the drama.

00:02:20.588 --> 00:02:22.529
So I learned a valuable lesson.

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:24.772
About interpersonal communication.

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:26.598
And not jumping to conclusions.

00:02:26.995 --> 00:02:28.628
But I needed a good cry, so it was fine.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:30.438
I'm Anna Akana.

00:02:30.438 --> 00:02:31.469
You stay awesome.
