00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.669
on this human dating website I have made some

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.049
minor alteration to my photograph

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.080
[Upbeat, but not overly optimistic music with a touch of charm and romance continues]

Cassidy: I had bought this dress

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.020
thought I'd take it out for a spin.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.480
[Upbeat, but not overly optimistic music with a touch of charm and romance continues]

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.600

[Upbeat, but not overly optimistic music with a touch of charm and romance continues]

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.330
Cassidy: It was interesting,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.561
he has goals. He's ambitious.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.830

Gary: You will be EX-TER-MIN-ATED!

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.540
Gary: I will no be seeing her again.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.160
Her eyes are slightly off center.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.220
Daleks do not tolerate asymmetry.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.259

Billy: You can wait in here with me.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.660
I'm Cassidy's Dad.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.239
the first man in her life.  Don't forget
that.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.480

Gary: I am an alien.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.340
Billy: I knew it!

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.120
You're probably illegal too.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.300
Oh, ho.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.420
you come over here you take all of our
good jobs then you sign up for welfare and what not

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.260
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.760
Gary: Ashamed?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.600
Billy: I bet you're a Muslim too, aren't ya?

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.620
Oh.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.960
I'd turn you in myself if I wasn't on an illuminati watch list

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.060
For peeing in the reflecting pool at Lincoln Memorial back in eighty four

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.440
Gary: Turn me in and I will EX-TER-MIN-ATE you!

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.120
Billy: You think you got what it takes to kill a man?

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.600
Gary: You would not be the first.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.780
Billy: Yeah?!

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.340
But your girlfriend's old man?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.300
Inside of his own house, just before you go on a date?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.440
You got the stones for that?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.720
I bet you do!

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.900

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.080
I like you kid. You've got guts!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Billy: I like that Kid. He's got guts!

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.240
Gary: Human beings are such preposterous creatures.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.140
I cannot stand those people.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.760
Billy: yeah, ha.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.480
Those people.  I hear ya.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.060
You ever seen how they drive?

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.640
Gary: They are terrible at operating automobiles.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.740
Billy: Yeah, they drive like [BLEEP]

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.060
And how 'bout how they walk?

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.900
Gary: Their ambulatory movements are inefficient and

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.120
poorly planned

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.760
It is obvious that they evolved from primates.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.580
Billy: Ha, ha, yeah

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.920
you got that right.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.140
Gary: Hello Cassidy.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.390
I have been talking to your ancestor.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I need to use your restroom

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.600
and then we can leave for the Bowl-O-Rama

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.160
Billy: That is a good kid.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.840
I like him.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.980
Cassidy: You like him?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.920
Billy: Oh yeah. He's got a fire in his veins.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.400
Not like that last guy you brought around.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.840
Franco, or whatever his name is.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.040
Such [BLEEP].

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.300
Cassidy: He's a foreigner.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.460
I thought you'd hate him.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.740
Billy:  Aaah, oh he's alright.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.220
Plus, I can see that he makes my little Princess happy.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:31.280
Cassidy: Ehh

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.120
Billy: The only books we have in this house, if you look around

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.500
American Authors, American Stories.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.420
You got, Tim Tebow.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:41.400
You got

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.280
That guy from Inked

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.160
Dat tattoo book there and you got the Bible.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.390
Billy: Gary, this is for you.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.420
Get her something really nice.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.610
Okay! You kids have fun!

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.600
[Sound of can brushing against the mantle ]

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.300
Huuu

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:08.880
[Somber, lilting music sprinkled with melancholy]

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.639
Gary: I should probably tell you I have never gone

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.279
bowling before and do not actually know what bowling is.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.380
Cassidy: Listen.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.460
Maybe we should just skip it

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.699
Gary: that is what I am suggesting

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:28.470
let's go throw rocks at peacocks in the park instead

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.110
Cassidy: No! I mean let's not date, let's not do this.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.300
Gary: Why nots?

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.980
Cassidy: Listen, I was only dating you, because I thought it would piss off my Dad.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.139
Gary: How would our romantic entanglement affect his excretion process?

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:44.819
Cassidy: Christ. Look.

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.320
I don't want to date you.  Okay?!

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.860
[Somber, lilting music sprinkled with melancholy continues]

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.040
[forlornly] Gary: Okay

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.000
Cassidy: Let me just...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.560
[Somber, lilting music sprinkled with melancholy continues]

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.300
Bye!

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:07.360
[Somber, lilting music sprinkled with melancholy continues]

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.500
Maria: Cassidy requested that we not show her face in this documentary

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:34.240
[Somber, lilting music sprinkled with melancholy continues]
