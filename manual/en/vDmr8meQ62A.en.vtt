00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:08.690
What's up guys?

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.220
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.610
So if you want to get bigger, you've got to
get stronger, you've probably heard that.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.090
There's a lot of truth to that

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.610
Your body won't necessarily produce the ability
for you to grow if you're not giving it a

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.640
reason to.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.440
But here's the problem, lifting heavy weights
can sometimes be pretty intimidating.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.670
Especially if it's new to you.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.680
And we don't have to talk about heavy as an
absolute.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.740
Heavy is not an absolute.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.279
Heavy is what's relative to you.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.250
And if you're used to lifting even 150 pounds
on our Bench Press.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.050
Heavy could be 180 pounds.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.339
Now obviously that could be light to somebody
else but the key is, you've got to make sure

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.379
that you're exposing yourself to heavier weights
than you're accustomed to,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.199
if you want to start allowing your body to
grow.

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:49.260
Here's what we do.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.550
Watch this video of me here doing a Bulgarian
Split Squat.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.140
If I'm used to using dumbbells in the 60 pound
range,

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.050
I can allow myself to feel the heavier weights
by getting into an Isometric Position.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.930
I'm doing the same thing here now with 90
pound dumbbells, 180 pounds holding an Isometric

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.570
Position here for as long as I possibly can.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.080
Now what this does is allows me to feel what
strong is.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.830
You see if your always used to working out
to what you're comfortable with, you're not

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.650
going to know what strong is.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.550
Feeling what is strong is your first way to
getting strong.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.670
And I can take this now over to a Pull Up.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.510
Here I'm doing a Weighted Pullup, 90 pounds
and I'm just getting into a mid range position

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.520
and holding it.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.350
Again, am I going to be working out with sets
of 90 pounds on a Pull Up?

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.720
Likely not, not now, not at least now.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.110
But I can work my way up there and the only
way I'll get there is if I feel what being

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.110
strong is,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.940
and what feeling what 90 pound pull ups will
feel like,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.360
Once I do that and then I go back to doing
the weights that I'm used to using, even a

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.980
45 pound plate or god forbid bodyweight on
the Pull Ups, I could let my body fly.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.190
Because I've got the confidence in my ability
to lift more what I thought I could and I've

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.780
got the ability to actually feel like I'm
stronger than I was,

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.370
because I'm lifting far less on my subsequent
work sets.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.820
So the most important thing you can do is,
start allowing your body to feel what strong

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.820
is.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.569
Be stronger than what you think you are by
allowing your body to feel how strong you

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.569
really are.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.500
Take a slightly heavier weight, utilize the
Isometric position.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.920
Remember guys, Isometric strength is going
to be greater than your Concentric strength

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
ever will be.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.640
So take advantage of that.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.951
Get strong in your Isometric position, hold
it, you're usually in a safe position if you

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.150
have to bale, if you have to bale,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.850
and then go back and perform your Concentric
sets.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.130
It's going to make a big difference in how
fast that you can start bumping up the weights

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.720
that you're using and therefore start packing
on a lot more size.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.850
