[Music intro]

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.240
[Music intro]

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.390
[Silvia Stoyanova/Goddard TV] Launching a spacecraft successfully takes time and it involves

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.390
hundreds of people. A lot of work has been going on at Cape Canaveral,

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.440
FL in preparation for launch of the GOES-P weather

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.620
satellite. From receiving the satellite from El Segundo,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.660
CA and assembling the launch vehicle to finally hoisting

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.710
the spacecraft on the rocket, the team works 24/7 to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.720
test and prepare the mission for launch. So join us as engineers

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.750
and key mission players take us on a tour of some of the critical facilities

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.810
in preparation for launch, which is only a few days away.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.880
Sound of launch countdown. [Si Song, ULA] We are standing out

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.920
outside of the DOC, which is Delta Operations Center, which has our engineers and

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.970
management team sitting at the consoles during launch countdown

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.010
and this is where we launch the rocket from.  So let’s go and take a look.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.210
[Dramatic music]

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.260
[Dramatic music]

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.310
Hello, my name is Si Song. I am with the spacecraft integration 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.390
group here at the Cape.  We are standing in the Launch Control Center for Delta

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.430
IV. We are getting ready to launch the GOES-P satellite, which is a weather

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.620
satellite. These gentleman are busy getting ready for launch, and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.640
during launch countdown day, we pressurize the launch vehicle and we prep for launch. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.670
[Dramatic music]

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.730
We are standing underneath the second stage of our next mission, which is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.790
There is one exactly like this out of the pad for GOES-P 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.830
mission. Second stage provides additional propulsion to put the spacecraft 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.020
out to the location that we are interested in. [Silvia Stoyanova/Goddard TV] This facility 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.090
here is called the Horizontal Integration Facility or HIF.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.100
This is where they actually assemble the rocket and Si is going to show us the 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.130
different elements of the rocket. Actually, right there you can see 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.400
the launch pad and as you can see it’s close to the HIF so when they 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.480
assemble the rocket, they transport it over to the launch pad, then they

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.230
mount the spacecraft on top of it in preparation for launch so let’s go 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260
mount the spacecraft on top of it in preparation for launch so let’s go 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.450
so let’s go and take a look inside. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.480
[Si Song/ULA] This inner stage that has the empty spot that you see;

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.500
that actually holds the second stage that we just looked at in the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.500
DOC. The grey structure that you see out on the end of the launch vehicle 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.530
is called the LMU; Launch Mount Unit. LMU

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.560
holds the vehicle on the base and that’s how we use it to 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.560
erect it out at the launch pad.  And you can see the working end of the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.570
rocket , which is RS-68 engine. This is going to produce the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.630
thrust to lift the launch vehicle into space and then

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.660
separate to the second stage and then separate the spacecraft once it goes out to the

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.740
orbit. 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.740
[Silvia Stoyanova/Goddard TV] Our final stop is at the Mission Director’s Center here at Hanger 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.760
AE. We are going to talk to some engineers and the NASA Launch Manager 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.770
to get a feel of what happens here on the day of launch. 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.960
[Tracy Evans, Mission Support Manager] This facility back here is where our power hitters sit. 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.960
These are the power users; the engineers that look at the health

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.000
of the vehicle; the health of the spacecraft. [Timothy Clinger] Well launch can slip 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.040
for several reasons.  The main reason would be a 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.080
mechanical or electrical anomaly of the vehicle. We have

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.110
slips due to weather.  If any of the vehicle engineering 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.120
disciplines were not ready to go for a launch, then we would certainly 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.130
not be in a posture to launch the vehicle at that time...[Andre Dress] Ok, copy...

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.180
[Andre Dress/NASA Launch Manager] GOM, this is NLM, Goddard Internal

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.210
[Kathleen McIntyre] This is GOM, go ahead. [Andre] Yes, we just confirmed with the SLDD 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:54.390
that tanking has started. [Kathleen] Copy that, thank you NLM. 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.420
[Andre Dress] Hey, welcome to the Mission Director’s Center. 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.620
In this facility is where the management teams will reside

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.720
and make decisions about the launch. On the screens upfront, we actually

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.760
are monitoring the launch vehicle activities.On these consoles here what you see, 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.790
communicate with different areas either in Suitland 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.840
or the Delta Operation Center or at the Astrotech facility. 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.890
(Andre to Kathleen): Hundreds of people are really 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.920
involved in this process. Every one of them has to say go, right?

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.950
[Kathleen] Absolutely, absolutely. [Andre] At this point we are good to go, right?

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.040
We are good to go, right! [Silvia Stoyanova] I hope you enjoyed this tour and let’s wish 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.210
GOES-P a successful launch! Reporting from Cape Canaveral 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.250
Air Force Station, I am Silvia Stoyanova with NASA Goddard TV.
