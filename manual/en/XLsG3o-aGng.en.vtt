Grass cutter meat is one of the 
 delicacies in Nigeria today, that means it's very proteinous and tasty

00:00:10.153 --> 00:00:16.153
you can cook it in different ways, for suya,pepper soup or stew

00:00:17.586 --> 00:00:25.586
The suya is preferable when you wash and spice 
 it and you are good to go

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:42.337
Actually it's a passion! we have so much interest in farming activities 

00:00:43.132 --> 00:00:48.132
So we embarked on snail and grass cutter farming

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:58.609
Basically one needs to know what grass cutter farming is all 
 about by learning about it from an existing farm

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:07.634
you learn about the methodology and the species 
 one should use, feeding, caring, management e.t.c

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.330
we normally do so for people that come for 
 training from every part of the country

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:23.380
No, they are friendly animals, once you understand them,they won't injure you

00:01:29.618 --> 00:01:35.618
we have up to 100 families, a family 
 is 1 male and 4 females 

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:45.950
so there are up to 500 grass cutters

00:01:48.296 --> 00:01:51.300
they reproduce 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:57.730
to multiply them we need to get a family( 1 male 4 females)

00:01:58.614 --> 00:02:05.610
when the female is 6 months and the male 
 is 7 months you can cross them

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:10.090
once you cross them the male would start 
 running after the females to mate them

00:02:10.921 --> 00:02:15.920
once he mates them, they get pregnant and in 5 months they deliver

00:02:20.086 --> 00:02:26.090
They reproduce from 5 upwards, in this farm 
 we have recorded 8,9, and 10 before

00:02:26.982 --> 00:02:29.980
but surely from 5 upwards

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:37.420
they can grow big and weigh up to 9kg or 10kg

00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:46.740
Hotels, eateries, restaurants, clubhouses, farmers and other rich people

00:02:48.558 --> 00:02:56.560
Its a very profitable venture because most of the 
 items for the feeds are local materials

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:05.350
grasses, maize (which we get locally)

00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:10.220
And there is a high demand for them. one costs N9000

00:03:13.912 --> 00:03:18.910
about 70 percent of them feed on grasses

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.860
we also feed them with some other ingredients 
 in the afternoon,which we call "supplementary feed"

00:03:28.238 --> 00:03:31.240
it includes maize and some other things

00:03:33.993 --> 00:03:44.990
there is not much challenges because the feeding is local 
 and the animals can be sourced locally 

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:47.970
the demand is also local

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.030
they don't require electricity or fueling, so there is not much challenge

00:03:56.586 --> 00:04:01.590
you just need to have adequate knowledge to embark on it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.250
otherwise you would just waste your capital if you don't know 
 anything about it so you need to learn some things

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:17.970
for instance, 2 males should not be kept together,once they are kept 
 together, they will fight,when they fight they fight to death

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.080
so a novice that's coming into the business who doesn't know would 
 just go ahead and buy grass cutter and pack them together

00:04:26.371 --> 00:04:32.370
you can discover that the next day that 
 they fought.
