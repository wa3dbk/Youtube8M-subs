00:00:37.340 --> 00:01:03.870
&gt;&gt;One has to admit that the Renault Duster
looks a lot better in real life than in pictures.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
The muscular fenders, chrome grille and twin
barrel headlamps all give it good road presence.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.729
It’s just about a little bigger than a Skoda
Yeti in size, but looks a lot more menacing.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:25.150
The first thing you notice about the Duster
is its ground clearance at 205 mm.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.080
It tackles bad roads with ease.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.920
The suspension is slightly stiff and there’s
virtually no body roll on twisty roads.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.680
The Duster has very sedan-like handling characteristics,
thanks to its monocoque chassis.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.250
The Duster we are driving is the RXZ 110PS
version, powered by a 1.5 litre diesel engine

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.010
that puts out 108 bhp of power and 248 newton
meters of torque, with a six-speed manual

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.010
transmission.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.060
There is a bit of turbo-lag and one needs
to rev it above 1800 rpm to really feel the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.370
punch of the turbocharger.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:15.360
However, the Duster’s lightweight and front-wheel
drive make it quite a delight to drive.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.910
The steering feel is precise and you know
exactly where your wheels are at all times.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.630
The 16 inch wheels with all-terrain tyres
help in slippery conditions.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.540
The top-end Duster gets a Bluetooth integrated
audio system, with USB and Aux-in that has

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.130
good sound output.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.599
The AC is powerful and chills the cabin well.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.349
Boot space is huge at 475 litres and a parcel
tray is standard.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:03:16.130
It also has two airbags, ABS and parking sensors.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.689
The controls are a bit quirky and take some
getting used to.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:38.129
The power mirror controls for instance, are
under 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.760
the handbrake.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:51.800
The multi-function display shows you average
consumption, range and trip meters.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.519
The door pockets are deep and the glove box
is illuminated.

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.629
Claimed mileage is 19 kilometers to the litre,
but we managed a best figure of only about

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.360
15.9 kilometers per litre.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.870
Overall, with its huge ground clearance, butch
looks and compact dimensions, the Duster is

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.450
a vehicle that will appeal to many sedan buyers
who want a vehicle that can do just that little

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.450
bit extra.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.049
It’s not value for money and has its quirks,
but it will appeal to buyers who want something

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:29.830
unique – a vehicle that you would buy with
your heart, rather than your head.
