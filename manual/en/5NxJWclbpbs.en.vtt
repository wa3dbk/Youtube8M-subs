Hi, my name's Natarsha Belling, and I did
my year 12 exams in 1834.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.120
No, I'm kidding, 1992.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.720
I'm not going to 
reveal exactly what I was doing in year 12,

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.949
I was a very conscientious student, I was
very blessed to have a wonderful education.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.919
I went to a very competitive all-girls' school,
but what I loved most about my education is

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.310
that I had very very passionate teachers,
that taught us the most important thing

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.320
and that is a thirst for knowledge, and a
love of learning.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.640
Of course my life has gone to plan. Not.
I don't think anyone's life goes according

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.989
to plan, but I think my best advice in regards
to that is that you can't plan your life,

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:52.589
you can have a good idea of where you're heading,
but you're most judged about how you handle

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.910
situations, and if you do face challenges,
trust me, it makes you a better person.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.379
The thing I remember most about my year 12
exams is I actually put an extraordinary amount

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.810
of pressure on myself because I realized I had
to get a certain mark or a certain TER to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.610
get into the course that I absolutely wanted
to be a journalist.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.970
I had to get a very very high TER to get into
that course

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.170
So for me, I put an extraordinary amount of
pressure on myself.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.640
In that very moment when you're sitting those
exams, I guess your world view is a bit distorted

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.130
because right then, at that very moment in
your life, it is your everything.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.630
But I can tell you right now, my best piece
of advice, is to do your best, because no

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.360
one can ever ask any more of you.
My message to you wonderful people sitting

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.770
your year 12 exam, is firstly, congratulations
for making it to year 12.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.570
And also remember that this is a very important
moment in your life, but it is not everything.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.480
Just do your absolute best, and I wish you
all the luck in the world.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.600
There is life after year 12 exams, and trust
me, it is wonderful.
