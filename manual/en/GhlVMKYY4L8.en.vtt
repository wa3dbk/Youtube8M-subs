00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:04.066
The smell of a home cooked
meal wafts through the air

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.700
of this bustling room filled

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.500
with new mothers trying out a new recipe.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.166
At the same time they're learning more about how to

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:15.266
incorporate nutritious foods into their family's daily diet.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:18.200
Jennifer Wakegijig is a nutritionist and has been living

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.700
and working in the North for several years.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.000
She says she's noticing a gradual shift in lifestyle.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
People who are used to eating traditional country food and

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.867
used to living on the land, there has been a huge transition

00:00:30.867 --> 00:00:35.600
to people living more in urban places and the whole food supply has changed.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.834
So sometimes people are looking
at the shelves at foods that

00:00:38.834 --> 00:00:41.300
are not very familiar or
they may not have knowledge

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.567
or skills about how to choose
the best nutritious foods and

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:46.033
how to prepare them.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.467
Today these women are cooking
tomato macaroni casserole.

00:00:49.467 --> 00:00:52.800
Their workshop covers everything
from buying to cooking and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.000
finally serving meals to their
families, important life skills

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.934
that will be handed down
through generations.

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:02.533
The reality is that people
eat both store bought and

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:07.433
traditional foods so its really
knowing well how to choose from

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:10.300
the range of choices in the
store and how to bring that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.500
together in a day eating
traditional food

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.834
and store bought food.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:19.967
Nutrition education as part of
Nutrition North Canada aims to:

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:22.433
Increase knowledge of
healthy eating,

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:25.700
improve skills in choosing and
preparing healthy store bought

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.333
and country or traditional
foods.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.667
Nutrition North Canada nutrition
education total funding

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:35.567
is $2.9 million each year
for fully eligible

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:38.233
First Nations and Inuit communities.

00:01:38.233 --> 00:01:41.367
Across the North, classes and
programs like this one are being

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:44.967
supported by Nutrition North Canada-bringing healthy, fresh

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:48.500
and frozen foods to isolated
northern communities.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.600
Because making the food
accessible is one thing...

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.600
but its equally as important to
learn how to be creative with

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.567
the store bought and country
food available and prepare a

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.000
variety of healthy meals
for you and your family.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.200
Nutrition North Canada replaces
the Food Mail Program.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.133
