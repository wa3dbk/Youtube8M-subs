00:00:00.185 --> 00:00:02.517
- So we're at the races.

00:00:02.517 --> 00:00:06.184
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:09.478 --> 00:00:12.311
(engines revving)

00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:22.817
This is Kendra's Uncle Jim.

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:25.234
He's the crew chief out here.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:33.066
What is it you love about racing?

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.980
Why have you been doing this for so long?

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.525
- It's the challenge actually.

00:00:36.525 --> 00:00:39.681
It's tweaking in a car,
taking it out to the track

00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:41.585
and trying to pick up
hundredths of a second.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.126
That's what we deal,
hundredths and thousandths

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:44.062
of a second.

00:00:44.062 --> 00:00:45.606
- After each run he comes
in and he'll be fixing

00:00:45.606 --> 00:00:46.703
and tweaking stuff.

00:00:46.703 --> 00:00:48.690
It's super fun to see him in action.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.636
Thanks for letting us come along.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:00:52.053
- Let's have fun.

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:57.520
(cheering and clapping)

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.833
- This is my Aunt Kay
and she is the hostess

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:01.132
out at the races.

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:03.073
She does awesome with all of that.

00:01:03.073 --> 00:01:04.085
It's so fun to be with her.

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:06.998
We get to hang wit her in the RV.

00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:08.701
- [Lady] You smell good.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.333
- [Jeremy] Laura, can you pet the doggie?

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:12.583
Pet the doggie.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.924
- So you got to meet Kay and Jim,

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:17.226
but I'm actually in right
now with the driver,

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:18.729
Aaron Oliverez.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.228
He's been with Kay and Jim how many years

00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:21.409
have you been with them?

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:22.463
- Oh, 10 years.

00:01:22.463 --> 00:01:23.365
- He's getting ready to go out.

00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:26.166
I mean, in an hour you're going
to be on the track racing.

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:28.476
So we get a chance to just
sit down for a second.

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:29.935
How fast do you actually get going?

00:01:29.935 --> 00:01:33.823
- We average between 275
and 280 miles an hour

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.156
in five seconds.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:38.361
- Essentially there's like a
huge explosion that happens

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:40.956
so you can go 270 miles
an hour in five seconds.

00:01:40.956 --> 00:01:41.789
- Exactly.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.372
What you'll see is
you'll see the burn out.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:49.187
We warm the tires, it
puts heat in the clutch,

00:01:49.187 --> 00:01:51.253
fresh rubber down on the track.

00:01:51.253 --> 00:01:54.467
We back up, you'll see
the crew chief, Jim,

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:56.406
make last minute adjustments.

00:01:56.406 --> 00:01:58.923
And at that point we will stage,

00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:02.566
myself and the competitor
and the tree comes on

00:02:02.566 --> 00:02:06.066
and the first one to the finish line wins.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:15.144
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:02:28.715 --> 00:02:31.870
- This little girl is
doing awesome, she's a pro.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.120
(babbling)

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.764
We're with my cousin, Kyle, who just won.

00:02:38.764 --> 00:02:39.859
(cheering)

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.277
- Well he's been winning all day.

00:02:41.277 --> 00:02:42.289
He hasn't lost yet.

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:43.466
So let's just clarify.

00:02:43.466 --> 00:02:44.521
- I'm continuing the trend.

00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:47.128
- All right, and he has
a lakefront property

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:48.791
right here.

00:02:48.791 --> 00:02:51.258
This is the race where they race jet skis

00:02:51.258 --> 00:02:53.887
and other watery things.

00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:54.720
- [Male] Drag boats.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.198
- Drag boats, that's the word.

00:02:56.198 --> 00:02:57.981
So here it is.

00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:01.229
- Kendra's wanting to try to skip rocks.

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:02.189
- I mean, how can you not want to?

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.439
This is like the perfect set up for it.

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:11.202
- [Jeremy] Nice.

00:03:14.578 --> 00:03:17.007
- [Kyle] So what did you do on vacation?

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:18.465
- [Jeremy] You almost,
you didn't even make it

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:19.642
into the water.

00:03:19.642 --> 00:03:22.725
- All right, you'd better show me up.

00:03:23.682 --> 00:03:26.438
- [Kyle] There, very good.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:28.258
- Okay, so he's explaining
to us what kind of variables

00:03:28.258 --> 00:03:31.944
they look at to determine
how to race the race.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:33.200
- There's like a science to this.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.710
It's not just like push the
pedal as fast as you can go.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.719
It's crazy.

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.474
- You basically have to be a
weatherman to do this, right?

00:03:39.474 --> 00:03:41.701
- Yes, I learned this from Uncle Jeff.

00:03:41.701 --> 00:03:43.767
So here's the weather
station which is hooked up

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:45.547
to our sensors outside the trailer.

00:03:45.547 --> 00:03:47.038
If you look out here you can see it has

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:49.109
all the big information
like barometer, temperature,

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:49.942
humidity.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:51.952
- [Kendra] And why does that matter?

00:03:51.952 --> 00:03:53.651
- Vapor pressure, water grate.

00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:57.978
So as the weather changes
the engines make more

00:03:57.978 --> 00:03:59.271
or less horsepower.

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.060
- Kyle is a master at reaction
time because there is a tree

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.172
with lights and when it
hits the bottom light

00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:05.308
is when you go.

00:04:05.308 --> 00:04:07.374
And it matters that you do it fast enough.

00:04:07.374 --> 00:04:09.357
- Growing up, I remember
Kyle had one of those trees

00:04:09.357 --> 00:04:11.501
in his room and I remember
going and practicing

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:12.636
against him.

00:04:12.636 --> 00:04:16.525
He was so good I was
like, I couldn't do it.

00:04:16.525 --> 00:04:18.063
- Kyle's been racing
since he was a little kid.

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:21.135
He was 12 years old and
winning huge races and stuff.

00:04:21.135 --> 00:04:23.165
I don't know the names of
them, but they were world,

00:04:23.165 --> 00:04:25.361
universe international races.

00:04:25.361 --> 00:04:26.378
- [Kendra] Solar system.

00:04:26.378 --> 00:04:28.651
- I wish I was that cool.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:31.808
- Know nothing about cars
and I've rarely come out

00:04:31.808 --> 00:04:34.399
to the races, but it's so
fun to see what our family's

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.984
involved in and what
they're passionate about.

00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:38.292
What they're life is like
out here and to learn

00:04:38.292 --> 00:04:40.450
about a whole other culture.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.117
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:04:56.898 --> 00:04:58.434
- [Kendra] She's going to town.

00:04:58.434 --> 00:04:59.267
(babbling)

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:01.350
- She's race car driving.

00:05:03.531 --> 00:05:05.850
We're in the RV, Kyle's
RV, and he's actually

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:07.767
racing Ryan over there.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:11.977
- Enemy right now.

00:05:11.977 --> 00:05:12.923
- [Jeremy] The enemy, enemy.

00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:14.949
- Frenemy.
- Frenemy, the frenemy.

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.443
So we'll see who wins.

00:05:16.443 --> 00:05:18.631
- [Announcer] Steven
San and Lisa Stevenson,

00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:19.809
keeping up with that car.

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:21.386
(cheering)

00:05:21.386 --> 00:05:22.438
- All right, so Kyle's up.

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:25.438
He's in the maroon car closer to us.

00:05:30.525 --> 00:05:32.548
- Yo, come on, come on, come on.

00:05:32.548 --> 00:05:35.621
- Come on Kyle, come on Kyle.

00:05:35.621 --> 00:05:36.714
- [Male] Yeah, he won.

00:05:36.714 --> 00:05:38.616
- He won, he won.

00:05:38.616 --> 00:05:42.215
- Did you see it, did you see what he ran?

00:05:42.215 --> 00:05:46.098
He ran 10.33, he ran the exact timing.

00:05:46.098 --> 00:05:47.686
- He ran his exact dialing.

00:05:47.686 --> 00:05:49.151
Kyle won, yeah.

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:50.973
It was really fun for me
to be at the races today.

00:05:50.973 --> 00:05:54.543
I just love that time with the
family and Laura did amazing.

00:05:54.543 --> 00:05:57.341
It was just really fun to get
to talk to my aunt and uncle

00:05:57.341 --> 00:06:01.147
and cousins and see inside
of some of the fun things

00:06:01.147 --> 00:06:04.213
that they're doing,
inside of their passion.

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:05.919
And to see how well they're doing at it

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.057
and all that they're putting into it.

00:06:07.057 --> 00:06:08.438
It was just really fun.

00:06:08.438 --> 00:06:10.016
I love going out and supporting them.

00:06:10.016 --> 00:06:12.524
I'm just grateful that
they invited us to come.

00:06:12.524 --> 00:06:14.629
It was really, really
sad for me to pack up

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:15.720
and say good-bye.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.197
I haven't seen them in a
long time and good-byes

00:06:18.197 --> 00:06:19.777
are hard with family.

00:06:19.777 --> 00:06:21.156
So hopefully we'll see them again soon.

00:06:21.156 --> 00:06:22.332
- Kendra and I had a rare thing today.

00:06:22.332 --> 00:06:24.520
We were together without all of our kids

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.853
from nine a.m. 'til six p.m.

00:06:27.803 --> 00:06:28.655
Then again, we did have Laura.

00:06:28.655 --> 00:06:30.731
- But we only had Laura.

00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:32.878
- And that was all
possible because of my dad

00:06:32.878 --> 00:06:34.782
and my step-mom, Cindy.

00:06:34.782 --> 00:06:36.162
- All right, it was a
fun day at the races.

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.138
Thanks for coming along.

00:06:37.138 --> 00:06:38.438
J House out.

00:06:38.438 --> 00:06:42.105
(lively instrumental music)

00:06:47.488 --> 00:06:49.655
- [Kendra] Those are cows.
