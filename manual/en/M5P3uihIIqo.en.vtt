00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.719
Promoting change and a positive image through
the strategies to

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:08.040
follow is crucial in fostering an improved
image of nursing.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.420
As an individual, you can monitor the media
since it is the most

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.059
influential factor on how people portray the
nursing profession. When you notice

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.830
something that you feel promotes a negative
image of nursing, you can speak out

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.220
against it by signing petitions and writing
complaint letters to editors or other

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.910
people who support this form of media. You
can also recognize positive images of

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.079
nursing in the media, schools, and in the
workplace to continually encourage them.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.300
In nursing education, it is important for
nursing educators to promote the careerist

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.469
image in the classroom and during clinical
practice. It is crucial to have a supportive

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.079
yet challenging learning environment in order
to prepare students for the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.710
work field and encourage professional practice
in the future. To promote change,

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.219
nursing instructors need to give contructive
feedback, and have mutal respect

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.289
towards team members. Also, educators need
to emphasize research awareness.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.910
Before forming judgements, one should do their
research and educate themselves.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.910
With the media currently being the greatest
influential factor on how people

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.320
perceive the nursing profession, it is important
to recognize negative images of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.080
nursing -- such as the "sexy" or "mean" nurse
-- and take a stand against them. This

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.540
can be done through continually monitoring
the media and writing complaint

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.500
letters. It is also important to recognize
positive images of nursing portrayed in the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.350
media -- such as a nurse who is intelligent,
logical, progressive, sophisticated,

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.350
empathetic, assertive, and committed to attaining
a higher standard of health care.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.630
In hospitals and the community, staff participation
should be increased to promote

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.350
collaboration and teamwork. When working together,
the task of fostering an

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.950
improved image of nursing can be easily achieved.
Also, hospital organizations can

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.230
empower nurses with rewards and recognition
to illustrate the honor it is be a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.930
nurse, recognize that nurses are delivering
a vital human service, and that they

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.980
performing to the best of their abilities.
Additionally, public opinion surverys are

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.100
used a strategic tool to view how the public
percieves nurses. These surveys can

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.750
acknowledge what change needs to be implemented

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.470
to improve the image of nursing.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.330
Nurses can also foster a positive image for
themselves. Role modeling professional

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.320
behaviour in practice can influence the public's
perception for the better. Nurses

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.870
can also get involved with the RNAO. In this
organization, nurses have the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.130
opportunity to be collaborative, make polices,
market themselves, and essentially

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.390
get their voice heard. In practice, nurses
must be collaborative and use the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.560
teamwork approach to patient-care. Also, nurses
and hospital organizations can talk

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.780
to the public about the role nurses play in
practice in order for other to have an

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.460
informed impression of nurses.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.060
Promoting a positive image of nursing is crucial,
not only to nurses,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.290
but to patients as well.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.990
Forming therapeutic relationships is an essential
part of nursing practice, showing

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.930
that they really do care for the well-being
and comfort of all of their patients. Not

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.319
only are nurses professional, but they are
also a patient's companions

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.120
throughout life's journey.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.480
The practice of nursing promotes a positive
image all on its own,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.970
but we must take action today to eliminate
the negative

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.130
images that loom just beyond the horizon.
