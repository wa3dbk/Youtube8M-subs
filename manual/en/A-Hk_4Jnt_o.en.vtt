BRANDON SARKIS: My name is Brandon Sarkis
on behalf of Expert Village. Today, I'm going

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.140
to be showing how to use Adobe's Lightroom
software. All right now, we're going to look

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.991
at some of the details of the library window.
The left hand side, you're going to see your

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:18.100
navigator here. You can click on this, or
to expand, or collapse this little preview

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.330
window. A couple of options here, you have
your fit option, your fit view, your fill

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.642
view which is going to fill up the screen
with your image, or if it's going to fit the

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:31.990
image to the screen. And your image is a real
time, one to one, 100% view. You also have

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.070
a three to one over here which is 300%. You
can actually click and change this one to

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.060
make it anything from eight to one, or one
to four, or whatever you want. We're just

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.489
going to go back out to fit, which is where
I usually keep it. Well, the fill is good

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.930
because my picture has the same aspect but
if they weren't, that's how you would do.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.820
Library, if we can go over here, you're going
to click on this. We're going to see all of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.719
the photographs in the library. You can scroll
through your little library list here, last

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.250
import, deleted stuff. This is your finder.
You can click in here. You can search wherever

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.430
you want. You can search by name, or you can
search by whatever you tagged. Then, you can

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.950
search by date range. You can search by all
known dates, today, this week, this month,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.990
this year, last week, whatever. These are
actual folders. These are actually file folders

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.780
in your--on your computer. These aren't just
photo folders to every folders. You could

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.870
actually get photos out of a particular folder
this way, which is kind of interesting. A

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.820
bonus is your collections. I don't have anything
in there. This is basically your albums, or

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.150
collections of photos. Below that, we're going
to have our keyword tags. You can see there's

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.220
some photos in here I tagged, hdr, edited
photos, scene. So click on scenes, there's

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.009
all of my scenery pictures. You click on sky.
It's all my sky photos. We'll close that--or

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.869
all the ones I tagged as such. We can open
up our metadata browser here, and we can go

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.560
through, you know, that's my Rebel XTi camera.
We can go to here to my [INDISCERNIBLE] 40

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.100
and see what pictures I've taken with it.
We can go to the Samsung GX10. It's where

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.470
pictures I've taken with that. We can go through
lens and apertures, shutter speed, ISO, everything

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.909
to sort our photos. On the left hand side--or
the right hand side here, we're going to have

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:18.061
our histogram at the top. That's, basically,
to show you the balance, and the color, and

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:22.459
the picture. Whoa, it went kinda crazy here.
Our metadatas are going to be right here.

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.989
Our quick develop settings are right there.
