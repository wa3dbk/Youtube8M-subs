Hi guys and welcome to today's Beauty Recommended
video, I'm Becky from TalkBeckyTalk. I had

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.650
so much fun creating the hairstyle that I've
got at the moment and I'm going to be showing

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.470
you how to do this plus a couple of my top
vintage makeup tips. So, the first thing that

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.160
you're going to need to do is make sure that
your hair is nice and clean. So I washed my

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.090
hair with this Pantene Pro-V Smooth &amp; Sleek
Shampoo, I have been a fan of Pantene Pro-V

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.960
for a long time, for two reasons. First of
all, it smells amazing, second of all these

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.690
shampoos and conditioners lather up so well
when you use them, so it properly feels like

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.570
my hair is being cleaned. This one, the Smooth
&amp; Sleek one, is going to leave your hair really,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.180
really smooth, no flyaways and even though
I'm using, like, curls, I want it to be really

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.019
smooth and no kind of frizz or anything. And
then my conditioner, I'm using my Clairol

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.659
Colour Seal Conditioner for brilliant blondes.
This is the nice 'n easy one. I have been

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.730
obsessed with these every since I was a teenager
because I actually started using these when

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.479
I was colouring my hair and they are the conditioner
that you get in the box, they make your hair

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.020
feel so, so soft. It just is so good, I leave
it on for 2 minutes. If you've ever used a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.369
box colour hair conditioner you'll know what
I'm talking about. But you can buy them separately.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.219
I know this is going to protect my hair colour
and also just give me that really nice kind

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.310
of soft feel to my hair. So let's go ahead
with the tutorial. So the first thing that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.550
you need to do is brush your hair and make
sure it's completely knot-free, then take

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.510
a section from your parting, not too much
hair, and then you need to backcomb it a little

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.920
bit. Vintage hair is all about the volume,
and next I'm going to take my Wella Silvikrin

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.729
Dual Benefit Hairspray, I love this for two
reasons: first of all it holds really well

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.250
and you need that for vintage hair, second
of all, it feels so soft, it just looks really

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.640
silky when you put it in. Next, that centre
parting bit I'm going to twist around my fingers.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.200
I use three or four fingers to get a little
loop and then just manipulate that loop like

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.420
down your head and then you're going to slowly,
slowly, slowly bring it round to the side.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.250
Having that hair spray on is really going
to help keep this in place at this point because

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.110
you want it to go down the side of your head
just there and then use a little grip to put

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.580
it in place. Play around with the flick until
you're happy and then, you know it, more hairspray

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.790
just to really, really hold that in place.
I'm using my Sebastian Trilliant heat protection

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.600
and my Braun Satin Hair 7 straighteners. I
love these because they leave my hair so silky

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.960
smooth but for this I'm going to show you
a little tip- how you can curl with your straighteners.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.920
So, get your straighteners, clamp a little
bit of hair and then you're going to turn

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.820
it round in a circle with the hair in the
straighteners, do this pretty slowly so you're

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.980
really taking your time to get that curl,
so you're turning those hair straighteners

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.440
360 degrees and voila! you have a curl! You
can do this if you have short or long hair,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.090
you'll see my hair extensions, I've had hair
added but you can do this with shorter hair

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.170
as well. And then hair spray it and leave
the curls quite tight, for me vintage hair

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.490
is all about tighter curls not brushed out.
And then add a cute little hair accessory.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.870
I'm using this beautiful little vintage bow.
And last but not least, vintage makeup for

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.740
me is all about the bright red lip. so I'm
going to use the Max Factor Colour Elixir

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.340
Lipstick in Ruby Tuesday. This colour is stunning,
it's such a nice finish it's not too matte

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.381
and not too glossy, which I absolutely love
because it looks really sophisticated. Not

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:38.200
too glossy at all but stays on so well, it
actually smells amazing too! So this is the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.410
finished look, I had so much fun creating
this, I really hope you enjoyed it. Don't
