Can we know historical truth?  Are there things in history that we can know are true today?

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:14.438
I think what we need to do is define history.

00:00:15.003 --> 00:00:28.967
You know over the last 15-20 years, I’ve asked 264 graduate students of history, to define history, and only six were ever able to define history

00:00:29.139 --> 00:00:33.110
and two of those were from Biola University out in California.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:39.875
But how in the world can you study history without really defining it because it determines how you approach history.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:50.005
This is how I define history.  I define history as a knowledge of the past based upon testimony

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:56.767
Somebody says “I don’t believe that.”  I say, “Well do you believe that Napoleon lived and fought the battle at Waterloo?”  “Yeah.”  

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:59.613
“Well you weren’t there, how do you know? Testimony.”

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:09.147
 Now, a knowledge of the past based upon testimony. You have to understand there’s three types of testimony in historical investigation.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.318
The first is written testimony. That which has been written down about what happened, or what was, or what is.

00:01:16.818 --> 00:01:23.785
The second is oral testimony that is passed on from person to person to person orally.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:31.161
And in the ancient times that’s how they were trained and they were trained to be accurate in the way they related things orally.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:45.805
And then third, there’s physical evidence. It would be like a finger print, a photograph, an authorized document, configuration of the eyes, whatever,

00:01:46.022 --> 00:01:50.853
...is physical testimony.  So a knowledge of the past, based upon testimony.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:57.391
Written testimony, oral testimony and physical testimony or evidence

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:03.933
This is how we must apply historical investigation to Christianity

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:12.100
You see the Christian faith you could say is a knowledge of the past of God’s intervention of history. Christ’s death on the cross, his burial,

00:02:12.413 --> 00:02:21.462
his resurrection, the ascension to the Father and the sending of the Holy Spirit based upon testimony but with a present day experience. 

00:02:22.004 --> 00:02:26.162
The question is…
“Is it true?”
