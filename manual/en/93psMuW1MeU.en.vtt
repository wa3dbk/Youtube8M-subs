00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:03.992
(playful music)

00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:06.691
- Hi, Youtube friends!

00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.363
- Hey Everyone!

00:00:07.363 --> 00:00:08.363
- Merry Christmas!

00:00:08.363 --> 00:00:09.129
- [Justin] Merry Christmas

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.522
- [April] Big hugs to you guys!

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:13.099
Anyhow, thank you for tuning
in to Cook with April.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.072
on Tasty Tuesday.

00:00:15.072 --> 00:00:16.140
Today, we are gonna show you

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.765
how to make a delicious,

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:19.786
peppermint bark cupcake.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:20.994
I'm also gonna show you how to make

00:00:20.994 --> 00:00:22.248
the traditional one,

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:24.082
but this is really, really good.

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:26.543
It is made from yellow cake mix,

00:00:26.543 --> 00:00:28.029
from scratch, of course,

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.724
and then some chocolate and peppermint.

00:00:29.724 --> 00:00:31.371
So, stay tuned.

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:32.657
In a medium sized bowl,

00:00:32.657 --> 00:00:34.492
you are going to place flour,

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:36.884
as well as baking powder and salt,

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:39.113
and mix those dry ingredients together.

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:42.496
(soft music)

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.078
And then, sit that aside,

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:47.238
and in a larger bowl,

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:50.258
you're gonna place
softened butter and sugar.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.323
And then you're gonna cream
those ingredients together

00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.809
with a whisk or a hand mixer.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.449
And cream until fluffy.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.818
Then, you are going to
gradually add your eggs.

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:06.506
And then, mix.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.059
And now you're ready to gradually add

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:14.404
your flour mixture and then, milk,

00:01:14.404 --> 00:01:16.867
and alternately add,
again, the flour mixture

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:20.646
and milk until it is ready.

00:01:20.698 --> 00:01:24.169
Make sure you preheat
your oven to 350 degrees,

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:28.336
and then, add vanilla extract.

00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:31.518
Again, mix with your
hand mixer or a whisk.

00:01:31.518 --> 00:01:34.513
(giggling)
I got that mixed up.

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:41.762
And now, you're ready to place your batter

00:01:41.762 --> 00:01:43.783
into cupcake liners and bake

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:47.747
at 350 degrees for about 40 minutes.

00:01:48.055 --> 00:01:52.160
Now, let's work on the frosting part.

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:56.600
I'm using a double boiler

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.796
to heat and melt chocolate.

00:02:02.242 --> 00:02:03.403
And once it has melted,

00:02:03.403 --> 00:02:05.817
I'm gonna place my baked cupcakes

00:02:05.817 --> 00:02:07.590
inside and dip it, and then add

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.168
crushed candy canes or peppermint candy,

00:02:10.168 --> 00:02:12.838
and that is peppermint bark cupcakes.

00:02:12.838 --> 00:02:14.626
And to make regular peppermint bark,

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:17.482
spread the leftover
chocolate on wax paper,

00:02:17.482 --> 00:02:20.477
then add your crushed
peppermint candy canes,

00:02:20.477 --> 00:02:23.189
and you are good to go.

00:02:25.632 --> 00:02:27.001
These cupcakes are ready.

00:02:27.001 --> 00:02:28.348
Justin's ready to try them.

00:02:28.348 --> 00:02:29.719
- Alright, can you hold the plate?

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:30.577
- Yes, sir.

00:02:30.577 --> 00:02:31.807
- So I can double hand it.

00:02:31.807 --> 00:02:32.969
- Yes

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:34.362
- Alright, this looks delicious.

00:02:34.362 --> 00:02:35.128
Should I take this off?

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:36.173
- Yeah, yeah

00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:37.473
I usually take it off for you.

00:02:37.473 --> 00:02:38.565
I don't know what I was thinking.

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:39.749
- That's alright, that's alright

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:41.118
- I'm forgetting about it.

00:02:41.118 --> 00:02:42.883
- You cooked it, so I think
I can take the thing off.

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:46.941
Alright, here we go.

00:02:47.597 --> 00:02:50.267
- Oh, it looks so soft.

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:52.775
- Do I have chocolate all over me?

00:02:52.775 --> 00:02:54.702
- No. Just a little bit on the side

00:02:54.702 --> 00:02:55.561
but that's ok.

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.885
- Oh my god, it's so good.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:58.487
- Thank you.

00:02:58.487 --> 00:02:59.926
- Oh, my, man.

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:03.247
The cupcake part is so moist,

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:04.919
and, when I first looked at it,

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.310
I was like, "Chocolate
plus the candy cane,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.749
"I don't know."

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:09.725
But it's delicious.

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:11.072
- Thanks. I'm so glad.

00:03:11.072 --> 00:03:13.880
- It's got a great taste of the chocolate

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.670
with the peppermint.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.669
It tastes really great.

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:16.644
And the yellow...

00:03:16.644 --> 00:03:20.103
It's like, I don't know,
it's just so moist.

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:22.495
- Thank you kindly.

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:25.234
Thank you, woah!

00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:26.952
You like it.
(laughing)

00:03:26.952 --> 00:03:29.577
Well friends, thank you
so much for watching.

00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:31.156
Tune in next Tuesday

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:33.246
because I'll have another recipe for you.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.034
We love you, Merry Christmas, and

00:03:35.034 --> 00:03:36.380
- I need milk.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.472
- I'll get you some milk soon.

00:03:37.472 --> 00:03:39.074
Oh, and Charlie is right here.

00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:41.697
Charlie wants to wish you
guys a Merry, merry Christmas.

00:03:41.697 --> 00:03:43.230
- My cupcake, Charlie.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.043
You can't have it.

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:48.717
- Daddy's so selfish with it.
(laughing)

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:50.156
- No.

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:52.247
- No, you get a cupcake, though.

00:03:52.247 --> 00:03:53.617
A kitty cupcake.

00:03:53.617 --> 00:03:55.382
Bye friends, thanks for tuning in.

00:03:55.382 --> 00:03:56.606
- Happy Holidays.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:04:01.129
