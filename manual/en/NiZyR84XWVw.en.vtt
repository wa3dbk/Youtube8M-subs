Alright screwing. When you are doing drywall
the inspectors will come in and they will

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.679
pass your framing, your electrical and then
your plumbing and then they will tell you

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.340
it's o'kay to wrap. When they tell you it's
o'kay to wrap they mean you can go ahead and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.460
drywall and insulate. After you insulate they
usually have an inspection on that too and

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.249
then they check your insulation to make sure
you did a good job and then they will tell

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.130
you to put your drywall on. When they come
back to inspect the drywall they inspect screwing

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.899
and the screwing usually goes 6 on the edge,
12 on the field if you are screwing and 4

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:43.219
on the edge like 8 in the field or 6 in the
field if you are nailing. We are screwing

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:51.200
so it is like 6 on the edge, 12 in the field
and as far as that goes I just usually go

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.359
6 inches all the time. I try to keep the screwing
in 6 inches because nobody complains about

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:01.440
over doing. They only complain about it when
you under do it. So I am going to get busy

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:12.010
here and screw off this drywall.
Also with screwing you have to really make

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.790
sure that you don't break the skin of the
drywall. Everybody makes a mistake every once

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.300
in a while and they go a little bit too deep.
They don't really care about that but they

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.620
want to make sure that overall when you screw
in your screw does not plunge all the way

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.530
in and break the skin of the drywall. The
best screw is a screw that goes and makes

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.380
a little indention in the drywall but does
not break the skin. Now when you go too far

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.470
into the drywall, you break the skin and it
doesn't hold the drywall as well to the wall

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.670
and that is what they are trying to get away
from is a whole bunch of pop marks or a whole

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.340
bunch of screws that really aren't holding
the drywall in but just kind of holding the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.200
drywall against the wall. So when the inspectors
inspect they will look at your screwing and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.450
if they see a whole lot of screws like this,
this right here would be considered wrong

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.920
while this one right here would be considered
right. So if they see a whole lot of these

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.609
then they'll probably ask you to rescrew your
drywall and that's basically it.
