You can wear this high waist-ed and the great
thing about it is quite casual but it gives

Maxi skirts are pioneer and trend of the moment
and are very easy to wear.

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.079
Teaming them with a t-shirt or blouse.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.189
Miranda Kerr doesn't like anything too fitted
this makes a great piece for her wardrobe.

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:13.060
And for footwear we've gone for another pair
of flats ankle boots from New Look at 22.99.

I really feel like I need a boat and I'm feeling
like Miranda Kerr as well.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.700
Wicker hats are really light and airy, again
perfect for the summer and think it finishes

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.790
of the look nicely.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.220
