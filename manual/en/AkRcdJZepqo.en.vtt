00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:00.793
- Hello friends!

00:00:00.793 --> 00:00:01.911
It is that time of the month again

00:00:01.911 --> 00:00:03.603
where we look back on the previous month

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.064
and all of the things that
I've really been enjoying.

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:08.293
So I'm just going to dive
straight on into this video,

00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:09.912
and I hope you enjoy it.

00:00:10.112 --> 00:00:11.660
(jingle)

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.401
As per usual, I'm going to start off

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.816
with my beauty favorites, and
I'm going to start with this.

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:17.372
Now as you guys should know by now,

00:00:17.372 --> 00:00:19.936
I love the scent and the taste of oranges.

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.319
Anything orange, I love it,

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:23.308
though I wouldn't advise eating this.

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:26.972
This is Soap &amp; Glory's Orangeasm
Exfoliating Body Polish

00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:28.928
and oh my god, it's beautiful.

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.896
If you couldn't have guessed
by the name Orangeasm,

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.475
it does indeed smell like oranges,

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:34.542
and it makes your skin so, so soft.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:36.074
It has loads of little beads in there,

00:00:36.074 --> 00:00:40.137
which is made of green tea
jojoba moisture-melt beads.

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:41.623
That's a very big mouthful, but yeah,

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.017
I've really been enjoying this,

00:00:43.017 --> 00:00:45.197
and it's my new favorite
bath time product.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:47.506
Next beauty favorite is this, and this

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.441
is the Liz Earle Cleanse &amp;
Polish Hot Cloth Cleanser.

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:53.180
Now, when I was in Boots, there
was a stand full of these.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.745
I was just browsing, and there
was a very nice lady there

00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:58.096
that gave me a demonstration
on the back of my hand

00:00:58.096 --> 00:01:00.628
to how this works, and I was sold.

00:01:00.628 --> 00:01:03.496
So I bought some, and I've
been really, really impressed.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.550
I've been using this a lot in May,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.002
and I can tell you something.

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:10.601
It has made my skin so much
clearer and so much softer

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:13.711
that I just want to buy all
of their sales products now.

00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:16.396
I really, really like
it a lot and it's going

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:19.232
to be something that I
will be purchasing again.

00:01:19.232 --> 00:01:21.259
Next is something by a
brand that I feel as though

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.183
I don't talk about
often enough considering

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.893
it's one of my favorite
brands, and this is by Tarte.

00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:29.017
This feels and looks
like a purse or a wallet,

00:01:29.017 --> 00:01:31.834
and it's very squidgy
and I enjoy it very much.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.586
This is a palette, and it's
called the Amazon Escape Vol. II

00:01:34.586 --> 00:01:36.118
and it's their Eye &amp; Cheek Palette,

00:01:36.118 --> 00:01:38.231
which I have been enjoying a lot in May,

00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:39.950
mainly because it's so convenient

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.522
to have this many products in one palette.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:46.472
They have a contour, a blush,
and six different eyeshadows,

00:01:46.472 --> 00:01:49.935
and a very, very large
mirror, which I like a lot.

00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.720
This is just great for traveling
on trains and going places

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.065
without juggling a lot of makeup items.

00:01:55.065 --> 00:01:56.969
So I've really been liking this.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.130
All of Tarte's products really impress me.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.088
Which now brings me onto
another Tarte product.

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.150
Even though I do own
quite a lot of blushes,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.277
for some reason I've always
wanted to get my hands

00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:09.182
on one of these little
Tarte Amazonian Clay blushes

00:02:09.182 --> 00:02:11.040
and this is in shade "Fearless."

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.267
Again, the names are awesome as well.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.707
But yeah, again, doesn't disappoint.

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:17.053
It's a really nice shade.

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.572
It has a very nice mirror on it as well,

00:02:19.572 --> 00:02:21.419
and it's just a really good blusher.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:23.439
It's very pigmented and I enjoy it a lot.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.391
It just looks really cool.

00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:25.995
I also really enjoy the patterns

00:02:25.995 --> 00:02:27.678
that are printed onto the blusher.

00:02:27.678 --> 00:02:28.959
I like that a lot.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.542
So I've been enjoying
that, and we now only have

00:02:31.542 --> 00:02:33.991
one more beauty product left to go.

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.086
And this is the POREfessional:
License to Blot.

00:02:37.086 --> 00:02:39.106
This little stick is triangular.

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:42.023
I like the packaging a lot,
but it's just really good.

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:44.424
It basically matte-ifies your skin.

00:02:44.424 --> 00:02:47.482
If you have very oily
skin, now, I'm combination,

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:51.129
but I still see the good things
from this product anyway.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.544
It just makes you really
matte, and I really enjoy it.

00:02:54.544 --> 00:02:56.381
It also makes your pores look smaller,

00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:58.355
so it kind of does what the original

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.816
POREfessional serum does, but it also

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:02.441
matte-ifies your skin at the same time.

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:03.835
So I've really been enjoying this.

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:04.787
I like it a lot.

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:07.828
Let's move on to non-beauty favorites.

00:03:07.828 --> 00:03:09.430
Next we're on to book favorites.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.940
Now this month, I have been on

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.997
a massive Amazon book-buying binge.

00:03:13.997 --> 00:03:15.949
That was some good alliteration.

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.102
But I have bought so, so
many books this month,

00:03:18.102 --> 00:03:20.645
and most of them, in fact
I'm pretty sure all of them,

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:21.899
are by YouTubers.

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:25.243
I have been really enjoying
this book in particular.

00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:26.380
This is Joey Graceffa's

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.120
In Real LIfe: My Journey
to a Pixelated World.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.069
And I wasn't sure what
to expect about this.

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.152
I know that it was going
to be a sort of like

00:03:34.152 --> 00:03:36.279
an autobiography about his life so far,

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:38.178
but I wasn't expecting what I read.

00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:39.862
I'm not going to give any spoilers,

00:03:39.862 --> 00:03:42.868
but it's just such a refreshing read

00:03:42.868 --> 00:03:44.730
to know about someone's life.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.768
Yes, I'm very nosy, so that
part of me enjoyed it a lot.

00:03:47.768 --> 00:03:49.807
But it's just a really, really good read.

00:03:49.807 --> 00:03:53.662
Very, very good, and I'm not
joking, I read a third of it,

00:03:53.662 --> 00:03:57.311
that much, in one sitting,
because I couldn't put it down,

00:03:57.311 --> 00:03:58.997
and I'm dying to read the rest of it.

00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:01.397
So this is my book favorite for May,

00:04:01.397 --> 00:04:03.858
and I definitely recommend
giving it a little read

00:04:03.858 --> 00:04:06.337
if you haven't read it already.

00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:09.013
Yeah, big fan, big fan of this book.

00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:12.806
Next we are on to my movie favorite,

00:04:12.806 --> 00:04:15.055
which might have been my favorite

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.768
another month this year; I can't remember.

00:04:17.768 --> 00:04:20.287
But I now own the physical copy as well.

00:04:20.287 --> 00:04:21.636
This is Big Hero 6.

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:25.245
I've watched this about five times.

00:04:25.245 --> 00:04:27.255
It's a little bit over the top.

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.453
But yeah, I've watched it a lot.

00:04:29.453 --> 00:04:32.917
So much that I decided
to buy the actual DVD.

00:04:32.917 --> 00:04:34.731
But I just love Baymax so much.

00:04:34.731 --> 00:04:37.539
I'll show you some of the
Baymax things that I have.

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:39.933
I have this cuddly Baymax, which--

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:41.860
- On a scale of one to 10,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.392
how would you rate your pain?

00:04:43.392 --> 00:04:44.692
- It talks.

00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:46.457
My brother bought me this for my birthday,

00:04:46.457 --> 00:04:48.035
and I love it a lot.

00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:50.428
Then I bought this from the Disney store,

00:04:50.428 --> 00:04:53.319
which is Baymax and his little cat.

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.559
And I love it because he
can hold his little cat.

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:58.438
Hold the cat, Baymax.

00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:00.551
Yeah, so he can hold his little cat,

00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:02.269
and I love Baymax so much.

00:05:02.269 --> 00:05:05.473
I've also bought a few
Baymax things for my car,

00:05:05.473 --> 00:05:07.795
'cause I'm buying a car
soon, which is exciting.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:10.049
I suppose that's a favorite
I should've mentioned.

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:12.561
I'm getting a red Fiat 500.

00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:14.552
I know, stereotypical girl's car.

00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:17.535
But I bought a little Baymax
bobblehead for my car,

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:20.032
and I've also bought a Baymax keyring

00:05:20.032 --> 00:05:21.448
for when I get my car keys.

00:05:21.448 --> 00:05:24.922
So my life is just full
of Baymaxes right now.

00:05:24.922 --> 00:05:27.090
I have Baymaxes coming out of my ears.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.188
But yeah, I've really,
really been enjoying this.

00:05:30.188 --> 00:05:32.268
I think I've very nearly,
I've cried so many times

00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:33.313
at the end of this film.

00:05:33.313 --> 00:05:35.333
If you've not seen this,
please go watch it,

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:38.886
because it is by far one of
my favorite Disney films,

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:41.277
if not my favorite-ist Disney film.

00:05:41.277 --> 00:05:44.406
So let me know down in the
comments what your favorites are,

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:45.753
because I really would like to know.

00:05:45.753 --> 00:05:48.035
I love recommendations from you guys.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:50.610
I love hearing what you've been enjoying.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.682
But yeah, I will see you very soon.

00:05:52.682 --> 00:05:54.155
I am doing an "Ask Cherry."

00:05:54.155 --> 00:05:56.476
So also, if you would like to be involved

00:05:56.476 --> 00:05:59.628
in my "Ask Cherry" video, then
leave a question down below

00:05:59.628 --> 00:06:02.381
and maybe I'll pick one of
your questions to be in it.

00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:03.841
Thank you guys for watching.

00:06:03.841 --> 00:06:07.048
I hope you all have a
brilliant week slash weekend

00:06:07.048 --> 00:06:08.946
and I will see you next time.

00:06:08.946 --> 00:06:10.289
Bye!
