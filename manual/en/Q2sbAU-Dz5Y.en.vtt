00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.130
Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns (www.AsWoodTurns.com)
Throughout recorded time, people have been

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.410
fascinated by the stars in the heavens.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.990
They’ve charted them, made up stories about
them, made patterns out of them.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.520
I want to make one as a wood turning for this
season.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.660
Anybody can be still fascinated by a star
and appreciate its beauty in the sky and in

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.660
the heavens.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.890
To me it has special significance as the sign
given for Jesus Christ.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.370
But that is me and my beliefs.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.720
Others of other beliefs may believe something
else or have other significance to a star.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.150
My appeal, at this time, is for harmony as
we need peace on earth.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.950
So let’s make a star to symbolize that quest.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.379
To start off, I’m making my own plywood
from some scrap oak veneer.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.850
I could use a solid piece of wood, but I want
it to be very thin.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.150
Rather than risk breakage, I’ll glue up
this veneer which will be much stronger with

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.229
a thin section.

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.790
I have a veneer press from my marquetry days
that still comes in handy.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.080
With glue to dry, I’ll do this first.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.939
With that out of the way, I can start on the
rays that will radiate out from the star’s

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:26.939
middle.

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.000
I’ll use some maple ripped just under 1”
square.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.070
I’ve mounted the wood in my long neck jaws.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.570
I’ve removed the point from the live center
to avoid driving a hole deep in the end of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.570
the wood.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.200
Now to rough a portion round and start on
the first ray.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.210
I will not cut a tenon on one end as this
stock is small and the rays will be short.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.310
For me this is skew work.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.430
As I finish the pointed end, I appreciate
not dealing with the mark from the live center

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.430
point.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.750
Then sand and finish this ray with shellac
friction polish before parting it off.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.060
Now for the second ray.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.910
I’ll use the first ray as my template and
try to match the remaining rays to this one.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.540
At least try to get them close.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.560
An exact match is difficult and far beyond
what I need for this project.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.830
Again, I’ll use my skew to both rough the
wood round and to shape the star’s ray.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:33.480
I need a total of 8 rays but had to make 12
to get my 8 for various reasons well known

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:49.900
to woodturners working with thin spindle work.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.070
Now to clean up the glued up veneer.

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.160
I’m using double stick tape to hold the
wood to a faceplate.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.300
The live center will help secure it to faceplate.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.379
I cut this round with my parting tool.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.830
Then tool the edge a bit more before sanding
and finishing the disk.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.769
Now for the center of the star.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:13.480
A little more double stick tape will secure
this small piece of cross grain maple to the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.480
faceplate.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.430
I need to tool this round with a little cove
on one side.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.170
Once the heavier tooling is finished, I’ll
pull away the tailstock for final touches

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.260
before sanding and finishing.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.840
Now to assemble my star.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.940
I have a paper template with spacing marked
for each ray.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.909
On this, I’ll put the background and glue
on the star’s middle with medium CA glue.

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:50.099
My initial plan was to not use CA accelerator
but after a couple of pieces tipped off, I

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.220
had to use it.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.690
I did not get the rays placed exactly but
they’ll do nicely.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.370
And my star is complete and I can hang it
on my Christmas tree to celebrate the birth

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.150
of Jesus.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.980
After Christmas, I and anyone else seeking
peace and harmony can hang it in a special

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.879
place to remind us to seek harmony wherever
and whenever we can.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.860
We need more harmony between each other to
achieve much needed peace in this world.
