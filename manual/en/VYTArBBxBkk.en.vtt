Hi my name is Donna from naztazia.com

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.450
Did you know you can grow a garden
without a plot of land?

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.800
Did you know you can grow tomatoes,
cucumbers, zucchini,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.420
and other fruits and vegetables in what
most people consider basic flower pot

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.260
containers?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.100
Today I'm going to show you how to do it.
The first thing you need

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.520
is the container. You can use something
that looks like this

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.010
or get really creative and use garbage
cans, plastic tubs, even half whiskey

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.520
barrels.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.560
Whatever you use just be sure to

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.550
drill holes either on the bottom or
along the sides for drainage.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.190
Next you need to add soil.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.250
For containers you should not use
traditional garden soil.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.239
You need a special mixture called potting mix. It's important to use potting mix

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.290
because you'll have less trouble with
weeds.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.579
Some people also like to add compost.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.590
Finally, you need plants. It's recommended to put

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.180
only one plant in a container this size.
However sometimes you can get away with

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.510
two plants. For some plants cages are
recommended to help the plant grow

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.080
upwards.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.080
To maintain your container gardening

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.479
it's important to constantly check the
level of water in the soil.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.820
To do this - stick your finger in the soil.
If it feels dry

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.420
your plants need water. During the really hot summer, sometimes I've had to water my

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.530
containers up to four times a day.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
Also it's recommended to get a very good

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.939
veggie and fruit fertilizer and feed your
container plants according to the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.720
directions. I hope this video has helped
you.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.140
