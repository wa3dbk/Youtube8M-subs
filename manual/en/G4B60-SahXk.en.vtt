00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:06.569
[Roger Dolle] We were looking at flame lengths
that were 300 feet in the air and the smoke

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.179
plumes were just full of fire and embers.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.990
We figured ...there's no stopping this fire.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.250
[Narration]
Labor Day weekend, 2011, raging wildfire destroyed

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.070
more homes than any other in Texas history,
and it wiped out much of the historic lost

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.920
pines habitat in Bastrop County.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.890
((Fire roars))
[Man] The only way I can describe it, it was

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.980
like Satan was coming out of the ground.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.970
[Narration]
The Bastrop complex fires burned about thirty

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.680
two thousand acres, including 95-percent of
Bastrop State Park.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.480
[Narration]
One year later, with massive support from

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.570
park staff, contractors and volunteers, all
campgrounds and cabins plus more than three-quarters

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.520
of the park trails are back open to the public.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.500
[Dolle] A lot has come back.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.750
It's kind of amazing how Mother Nature has
rejuvenated a lot of this park.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.160
We have a lot of natural regeneration of pine
seedlings out there.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.570
[Narration]
But more help is needed.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.930
[Carter Smith]
Today we are announcing a campaign to restore

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.020
the Lost Pines one tree at a time.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.200
[Narration]
Texas Parks and Wildlife, the Arbor Day Foundation

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.420
and Texas A&amp;M Forest Service are launching
the Lost Pines Forest Recovery Campaign.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.700
The goal is to raise money to buy and plant
trees to restore the burned area both in the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.960
park and on private land over the next five
years.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.360
[Dan Lambe]
Today, as we launch the Lost Pines Forest

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.869
Recovery campaign, we're launching a new website
where the public can go and learn more about

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.790
and engage in this campaign through making
a personal donation or signing up to volunteer

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.790
to plant trees.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.250
[Dolle] As good stewards of the forest, we
don't want to put all of the trees in the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.640
ground in one year and then have the trees
die from an extended drought.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.840
So over the next five years, we're going to
be planting trees every winter and hoping

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.619
that these generations of trees will root
and replace the pine trees.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.310
[Narration]
And loyal visitors can have the Lost Pines

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.460
they love back.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.640
[Dolle] Turns out that one year later, we
got people coming back for all the reasons

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.600
they were coming before the fire.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.330
They're coming out for family reunions, their
gatherings, camping trips, come stay in the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.190
cabins so they're not here because of the
fire, they're here because Bastrop State Park

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.190
is still here.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.100
[Narraion]
For Texas Parks and Wildlife, this is Abe

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.160
Moore.
