00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.800
Hey, in this episode i’ll build a router jig to flatten wood, so if you

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.200
don't have a planer like me

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.500
this can be a great solution! Let's get
started!

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.330
I started by cutting a piece of plywood to 60 by 40 cm to match the size

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.730
of the aluminium tubings.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.480
This 6 mm plexiglass acrylic has 50 cm

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.780
so the maximum width that it can cross side to side over the rails

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.960
is 24.5 centimeters.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.880
I'm marking the holes for some bolts that will attach

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.990
the rails to the plywood base.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.380
The holes were transferred to the plywood, making sure everything was nice and square.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
I recessed the holes for the heads and attached the bolts with washers and nuts.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.490
To prevent the plexiglass from flexing, I attached some aluminium corner.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.000
It was cut to size and the ends were filed to remove the burrs.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780
I put it all together just to check.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.100
The assembly was made with sixteen bolts

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.340
and marked the points to drill.

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.430
I filed the left burrs and gave all the pieces a light sanding to remove scratches

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.970
and give it a nicer smooth and matt finish.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.100
You don’t need to sand, it’s just for the sake of appearence.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.560
The holes were marked in the plexiglass.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:46.920
The drill bit has a smaller diameter than the bolt

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.440
so you can cut threads in the plexiglass.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.330
It is crucial to tap the holes really slowly when using a powered driller.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.870
 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.689
I peeled off the sticky paper from both sides and attached everything carefully

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.829
with a screwdriver to prevent any cracks.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.680
I removed the base plate from my router to transffer the screw holes to the plexiglass.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.080
Marked the front with a white pencil because the holes are not symetrical.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.420
Then I found the middle point of the acrylic by the diagonals

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.920
and checked if all distances were equal.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.240
Reinforced the lines

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.140
and traced the diagonals of the router plate.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.600
Then transferred those four inside points to a piece of paper

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.930
and connected the dots to find the middle of the router plate.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.320
I overlapped the two central points and placed the router plate in alignment

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.620
with those four previous marks. Here’s the right places for the screw holes.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.580
It’s not crucial to get the router absolutely in the middle

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.880
of the top jig but I like to keep things lined up whenever possible.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.740
I drilled and flipped over to countersink so the heads of the screws can sit flush.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.740
I gave it a try and noticed some scratching on the plexiglass,

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.640
so I decided to attach two wood strips with double sided tape to the top of the rails.

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:39.219
Gave it a light sanding with fine grit sandpaper and put some beeswax paste.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.640
I assembled everything and inserted a 2 mm bit to mark the centre of the router

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.380
in the plexiglass, and as you can see everything is lined properly.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.160
This also serves as a pilot for the forstner bit.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.800
You have to drill very slowly and apply some lubricant,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.620
otherwide you may crack the plexiglass.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.040
And now it’s time for testing!

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.080
I had to raise up the base because my router bit wouldn’t go all the way down.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.170
I attached the board with double sided tape and put some paper shims to stabilize it.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:36.590
Don’t forget to use a respirator, glasses and ear plugs when working with power tools and air dust!

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.580
The surface is a bit rough because my bit it’s not in good shape and soft pine

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.360
tends to chip a bit but the board is dead flat!

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.840
Now you can flip over and router the other side.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.710
