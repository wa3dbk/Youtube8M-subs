00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.790
I'm Dante Mena, the author of the Adventure
Hungary travel guide, and here on behalf of

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.470
Expert Village. And we will learn a little
bit more about how to get around in the city

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:17.310
using the public transportation system. Here
we are at the top of the Deli Palyaudvar,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.990
and like I said, coming out of this entrance
if we continue where we are coming from, we

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:30.160
will come out to the plaza level of the shopping
area of the train station. And then above

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.610
that we can go ahead and get our tickets and
continue on to other destinations in Hungary.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.450
As we have come up to the top of the Deli
Palyaudvar with all of its shops, we know

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.630
that we can take a look at the signs, in blue,
that point, first of all to the train station,

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:52.680
but also to where we can find restrooms, and
also, if you will notice, it says "penztarak,"

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.320
and that means where we can get our tickets.
You will also see that good old eye, which

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.620
stands for information, and we can see that
we have to go up the stairs to get our train

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.569
tickets and also to board on the trains. And
as you can see, each of the lines over here

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:17.299
is for a different train, both coming and
going. And you will see, on the sign that

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:25.130
comes up from the Deli, that at the top there
are different line numbers. These different

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.939
line numbers correspond to the tracks, and
if you will look at the tracks you can see

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.950
that there are actually line numbers shown
 - seven, eight, six, five, four, three, two,

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.799
one. And so knowing your line number, which
is usually shown on your ticket, and you can

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.649
always ask also at the ticket counter, you
can know which train it is that is boarding,

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.249
on which line, and you will notice that on
those signs, we're a little bit distant from

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.520
it, but you will notice that on those signs
you will also see the time of arrival or departure

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.679
and the end destination of the train. So you
can always make sure that you're boarding

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.019
on the right line.
