00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.340
Lions.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.900
You may have heard... Lions are the Kings
of the Jungle.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.680
Well actually.. Lions don't live in the Jungle
at all.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.420
Lions roam on grassy plains and woodlands
in Africa and Asia.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.359
They are the second biggest of the Big Cats.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.530
Only Tigers are a slightly larger.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.210
Unlike the other big cats, Lions live in large
social groups called PRIDES.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.550
Females Lions are called Lionesses.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.910
There are lots of Lionesses in a Pride.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.300
Male Lions are very large and easy to spot.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.880
They have a big distinctive hairy mane.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.799
Baby Lions are called Cubs.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.470
Lions are predators.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.909
Which means they hunt and eat other animals.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.920
This makes them carnivores because they eat meat.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.880
Lionesses are much better at hunting than
males lions.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.350
They do most of the hunting for the Pride.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.280
After a successful hunt the Lions sit around
enjoying their meal together.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.770
The Lioness fiercely protects her food.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.600
I hope you have more manners at the dinner table.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.600
After a big meal there is nothing better than
a loud roar.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.580
Can your roar like a lion?

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.780
Wow what a great roar. 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.940
