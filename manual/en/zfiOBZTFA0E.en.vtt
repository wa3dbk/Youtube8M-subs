Why hello there and welcome to the Cheese
Strat Archive, a show dedicated to showing

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.299
you
exactly how to completely ruin the game for

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:07.870
the enemy team.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.730
In this episode I will cover my favorite "adc
shutdown" botlane. Fiddlesticks and Jarvan

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.420
also special thanks to Phy for inspiration

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.970
to do this video. His channel is in the description.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.029
Let's get started, Fiddle and Jarvan botlane
is all about trying to piss off and shutdown

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.999
the opposing teams botlane.

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:25.839
For pulling this off You'll need

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.810
A buddy to lane with. Runes and masteries
as shown on the screen right now

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.289
and a complete and utter lack of empathy for
the enemy botlane

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.930
I start of with a dorans ring and a couple
of healthpots and my friend playing Jarvan

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.519
starts of with a fortpot, a health potion
and a ward. We start of the lane by constantly

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:49.079
harassing them down before going in. Inititally
Jinx survives with a small amount of hp but

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.079
we end up grabbing the kill and getting away.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.339
Both of us also grabbed flash ignite but in
retrospect it might have been better for one
of us to have exhaust

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.720
either way, after dying once to a gank from
zed and having picked up another dorans ring,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.790
Nunu comes to in for a gank. This clip displays
the ridiculous amount of crowd control this

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.229
setup has. We end up grabbing the kill on
thresh

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.229
I max E then Q in this game and I rush a "Seeker's
Armguard" after getting double dorans. I

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.479
then turn the armguard into an hourglass before
going into a standard fiddlesticks build with

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.380
Items like Abyssal Scepter and Spirit of the
Spectral wraith.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.040
Jarvan rushes a dorans blade then a brutalizer
before going for a Ravenous Hydra and Last

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.469
Whisper aswell as upgrading the brutalizer
to a black cleaver, of course you can go with

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.280
whatever build suits you and/or your team.
This is just my recommendation

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.100
The reason this botlane is so good is both
the aforementioned crowd control aswell as

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.960
the amazing kill potential. You can easily
get a kill at level two with Jarvans E-Q combo

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.960
chained with Fiddles fear but once level 6
is acquired. Shit gets ridiculous.

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.420
We absolutely smash the enemy botlane and
end up winning despite our nunu disconnecting

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.970
at level 5. I really recommend trying this
out for a cheap win sometime!

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.440
