00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.820
hey folks I'm Lindsey with home comfort and
i wanna show you this brand new smart

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.559
fire grill

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.350
this thing is packed with features so
let's get inside it and have a look

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.360
now inside the cooking area we've got
temperature sensor

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.550
we have a stainless steel cooking
surface but one of the most unique

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.920
features of this grill

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.290
is this electric searing  grate that gets
over 500 degrees to make sure that your

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.970
meat is seared perfectly to lock in that
flavor

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.309
if you'll notice we've got a very wide
drip tray through here

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.910
this helps channel the heat around the
meat to make sure we have an even

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.880
temperature and no hot spots

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.679
but also drives all the grease down to
the end of the grill for easy cleanup

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.729
underneath the drip tray is the heat
dispersion

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.300
chamber this helps disperse the heat
out removing that you can see the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.820
fire pot this is where all the magic
takes place

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.970
as you can see inside we've got an electronic
ignitor

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.490
to automatically ignite the pellets and a
nice large burn chamber

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.910
several people have asked me what is a
smart fire technology in these grills actually

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.759
do well the smart fire is the brains with
this control board it automatically

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.439
senses the outside temperature

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.740
and the temperature inside your grill to
make sure your food always stays the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.970
temperature that you set it at

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.890
it also automatically adjust the pellets
and the air

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.659
to make sure it's a perfectly consistent
temperature throughout the entire time

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.729
you cook your food

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.430
let's fire this baby up we're going to start by
turning it on

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.520
as this is a brand new grill we're going to
hold the prime button

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:18.520
until the pellets get into the fire pot

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.270
some other great features of the smart
fire board are the temperature display

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.599
with this button you can select to view
the internal temperature

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.840
or your set temperature the mode button

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.760
gives the ability to choose between
cooking mode which your higher

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.580
temperatures

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.050
and a smoking mode for low slow cooking the
temperature adjustment is very easy

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.099
simply push the up or down to set your
desired temperature

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.620
the red switch is the on/off switch

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.380
for the electric searing grate now the
grill is started we're going to set this to

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.400
285

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.230
let's go make some barbecue

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.580
all right let's make some barbecue were
gonna take our drumsticks

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.220
and some others chicken holler Apple chipotle rub and we're going to make

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.790
sure to liberally coat all of our wings

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.780
on both sides of  the wings so we get
all that good apple chipotle  flavor

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.570
once your  wings are coated I like to go
ahead and make sure they're good and

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.810
rubbed and so we've got that flavoring
all across our meat

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.420
and we're going to take these a drumsticks and we're going to throw them on the smoker at

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.420
285 for about three hours

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.090
this chicken's almost done it looks like
my guests are here so we're going to finish

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.630

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:15.130
with some chicken holler barbecue sauce for the last
20 minutes

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.130
