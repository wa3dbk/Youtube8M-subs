00:00:00.225 --> 00:00:02.165
So I have a number written here.

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:04.277
It's a 2, a 3, and a 5.

00:00:04.314 --> 00:00:07.124
And we already have some
experience with numbers like this.

00:00:07.162 --> 00:00:09.212
We can think about
'what does it represent'.

00:00:09.214 --> 00:00:12.644
And to think about that we just have
to look at the actual place values.

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:15.962
So this right-most place right over here.
This is the ones place.

00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:19.988
So this 5 represents five ones, or I guess
you could say that's just going to be 5.

00:00:20.864 --> 00:00:26.502
This 3, this is in the tens place. This is
the tens place, so we have three tens.

00:00:27.035 --> 00:00:29.205
So that's just going to be 30.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:32.934
And the 2 is in the hundreds place.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:37.467
So putting a 2 there means
that we have two hundreds.

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.765
So this number we can view as
two hundred, thirty, five.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:46.470
Or you could view it as
two hundred plus thirty plus five.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.775
Now what I want to do in this video
is think about place values

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.411
to the right of the ones place.
And you might say

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:54.750
'wait, wait, I always thought
that the ones place

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.673
was the place furthest to the right.'

00:00:56.673 --> 00:00:59.200
Well everything that we've done so far,
it has been.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.763
But to show that you can go
even further to the right

00:01:01.763 --> 00:01:06.321
I'm going to put a little dot. I'm going
to put a little dot right over here.

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:08.144
We call that a 'decimal point'.

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:11.681
And that dot means that anything
to the right of this is going to be

00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:15.562
place values that are smaller,
I guess you could say, than the

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:18.378
ones place. So right to the left
you have the ones place

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.338
and the tens place and
the hundreds place,

00:01:20.338 --> 00:01:23.206
and if you were to keep going
you'd go to the thousands place

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:27.186
and the ten thousands place. But then if
you go to the right of the decimal point

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.568
now you're going to divide by 10.
So what am I talking about?

00:01:30.568 --> 00:01:33.365
Well, right to the right of
the decimal point

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:36.276
you are going to have-- find a new color--

00:01:36.276 --> 00:01:41.114
this is going to be the tenths place.

00:01:41.114 --> 00:01:42.778
Well what does that mean?

00:01:42.778 --> 00:01:44.372
Well whatever number I write here

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:48.219
that tells us how many tenths
we're dealing with.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:54.980
So if I were to write the number 4
right over here, now my number is

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.579
2 hundreds plus 3 tens plus 5 ones
plus 4 tenths.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.467
So you could view this a 4 times 1/10.

00:02:06.467 --> 00:02:13.409
Or you could write this as 4 tenths.
Not tens, 4 tenths.

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:19.667
Or 4 tenths is the same thing as this
right over here.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:24.001
So this is a super important idea
in mathematics.

00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:28.777
I can now use our place values
to represent fractions.

00:02:28.777 --> 00:02:32.505
So this right over here, this 'point 4',
this is 4/10.

00:02:32.505 --> 00:02:34.585
So another way to write this number--

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:39.555
I could write it this way, I could write
it as two hundred, thirty--

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:48.834
let me do the thirty in blue-- two hundred
and thirty five and four tenths.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.900
So I could write it like this,
as a mixed number.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.210
So this up here would be a
decimal representation: 235.4

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.864
And this right over here would be

00:02:57.864 --> 00:03:00.804
a mixed number representation:
235 and 4/10

00:03:00.804 --> 00:03:06.334
but they all represent 200
plus 30 plus 5 plus 4/10.

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:09.023
Let's look at a few more examples of this.

00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:11.534
So let's say I were to write the number

00:03:14.674 --> 00:03:21.226
0.7--
and actually let me go one space

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:25.863
even further to the right-- 0.76.

00:03:26.453 --> 00:03:29.265
So what would this be if I were
to write it as a fraction?

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.550
So let's just think about the place value.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.833
We have our decimal point.

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:35.404
To the left of the decimal point
is the ones place,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.696
but I have a zero there,
so this is 0 ones.

00:03:38.871 --> 00:03:43.110
Now I have 7 tenths, so this is
the tenths place.

00:03:44.408 --> 00:03:47.336
And then this is going to be this place
to the right of that.

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:50.664
We're going to divide by 10 again.

00:03:50.664 --> 00:03:52.975
So this is going to be the
hundredths place.

00:03:52.975 --> 00:03:59.081
This space right over here is
going to be the hundredths place.

00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:03.732
So this number right over here is--
we can rewrite it as 0--

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:12.072
let me write it this way-- we could
rewrite it as 0 ones plus 7 tenths--

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.582
plus 7 tenths---

00:04:15.582 --> 00:04:19.721
not tens, tenths-- plus 6 hundredths--

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.280
plus 6 hundredths--

00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:26.611
not hundreds, hundredths.

00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:34.261
Or we could write this as 0 plus 7/10--

00:04:34.825 --> 00:04:37.852
let me write that a little bit neater--
plus 7/10

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:46.076
plus 6/100-- 6 over 100.

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:49.760
So you could write this-- 7/10 plus
6/100 is exactly what this is.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.252
You could say this is 0 ones,
7 tenths, and 6 hundredths.

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:57.397
Now another way we could
write this-- well look, if we wanted

00:04:57.397 --> 00:05:01.074
to write it as a fraction, or talk
about it as a fraction-- I could ignore

00:05:01.074 --> 00:05:04.245
the 0, that's not going to change the
value of the sum but I could

00:05:04.245 --> 00:05:09.965
add the 7/10 to the 6/100. So how could
I write 7/10 in terms of hundredths?

00:05:09.965 --> 00:05:14.863
Well 7 over 10 is the same thing as
70 over 100.

00:05:15.983 --> 00:05:19.803
7/10 is the same thing as 70 over 100.

00:05:19.834 --> 00:05:23.865
One way to thing about it is, if
I multiply the denominator by 10

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:27.754
well, I can multiply the numerator by 10
as well and not change the value of it.

00:05:27.754 --> 00:05:32.813
7/10 is the same thing as 70/100.
And then you could add 6/100 to that--

00:05:33.473 --> 00:05:36.498
6/100 to that.
And what will that give you?

00:05:36.498 --> 00:05:39.409
Well that's going to give you 76/100--

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.409
76/100.

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.218
So this number up here--
a lot of people will call this--

00:05:46.218 --> 00:05:49.395
they might say
'zero point seven six'

00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:54.335
or they might call this
'seventy-six hundredths'.

00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:57.300
This is the hundredths place,
this is the tenths place.

00:05:57.313 --> 00:06:00.398
But each tenth is worth
ten hundredths.

00:06:00.412 --> 00:06:03.865
And you see that-- you could
either view this as 7 tenths.

00:06:03.878 --> 00:06:07.557
or you could view it
as 70 hundredths.

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:10.007
So this is 76 hundredths.

00:06:10.007 --> 00:06:11.892
And you could keep going to the right.

00:06:11.892 --> 00:06:13.708
If you go to the right one more space

00:06:13.708 --> 00:06:15.802
you would get to the thousandths place

00:06:15.802 --> 00:06:17.481
and then the ten thousandths place.

00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.252
So you keep dividing by 10
each place you go to the right.

00:06:20.252 --> 00:06:23.912
And you multiply by 10
each place you go to the left.
