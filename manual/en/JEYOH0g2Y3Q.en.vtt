00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:18.900
Do it for love by Hall &amp; Oates

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.900
I would fly ten thousand miles

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.900
In the pouring rain

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.900
Just to see your face

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.900
I'd bare my soul to a total stranger

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.900
Just to say your name

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.900
And I'm not ashamed

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.900
Just to love you into every morning

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.900
I would change my name

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.900
And run away 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.900
I won't do it for money I won't do it for pride

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900
I won't do it to please somebody else

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.900
If it don't feel right

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.900
But I'll do it for you 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.900
And at least I'll try

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.900
I don't need any other reason

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.900
Than I feel it deep inside

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.900
I'll Do It For Love

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.900
I'll Do It For Love

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.900
I'll Do It For Love

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900
I would write your name across the sky

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
So the world could see

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.900
What you mean to me

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.900
I'd sing my songs at the top of my voice

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.900
Do it empty room

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.900
Just to dance with you

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.900
And to love you into every morning

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.900
I'll leave the world behind 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900
And I'll slow down time

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.900
I won't do it for money

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.900
I won't do it for pride

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.900
I won't do it to please somebody else

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.900
If it don't feel right

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.900
But I'll do it for you

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.900
And at least I'll try

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.900
I don't need any other reason

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.900
Than I feel it deep inside

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.900
I'll Do It For Love

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900
I'll Do It For Love

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.900
I'll Do It For Love

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:37.900
What I do for love can take us anywhere at all

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.900
anywhere anywhere anywhere

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.900
I won't do it for money

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.900
I won't do it for pride

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.900
I won't do it to please somebody else

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.900
If it don't feel right

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.900
But I'll do it for you, at least I try

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.900
I don't need any other reason

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.900
Than I feel it deep inside

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.900
I'll do It for love

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.900
I'll do it for love

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.900
I'll do it for love

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.900
But I'll do it for love

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.900
I won't do it for money

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.900
I won't do it for pride, I'll do it for love

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.900
I won't do it to please somebody else

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.900
If it don't feel right, but I'll do it for you

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.900
And at least I'll try. I don't need someone if I feel

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.900
Than I feel it deep inside, oh no, true love

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.900
Our love, we love

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.900
What I do for love 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.900
One love, true love, we love

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.900
I'll do it for love, what I do, what I do for love
