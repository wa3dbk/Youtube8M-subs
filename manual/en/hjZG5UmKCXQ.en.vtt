00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.019
Today in After Effects, we're going to be
taking a look at creating this kinetic type

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:10.019
effect.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.580
So to get started, I'm going to go up to "Composition"
and create a new composition.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.680
Now I'll be making mine 1920 by 1080 and clicking
"Ok."

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.720
So after that we need to first start by creating
some text or other graphics on the stage to

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.050
start animating.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.519
So I'll go up and grab my text tool and then
create two separate words.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.929
Now I'll make the words "RCG" larger and white,
and then position those on top of the word

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.830
"Tutorials" in an orangish yellow color.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.540
So since we want to be able to animate these
two pieces of text as a whole, we need to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.580
select both of these layers and then go up
to "Layer" and the down to "Pre-compose" all

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.350
the way at the bottom of the menu.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.350
This will then move these two layers into
a larger layer, essentially grouping them.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.720
So now that we have this done, we need to
take and change where the pre-comped layer

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.359
rotates around.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.420
So I will go up and grab my pan behind tool
from my toolbar and then zoom in.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.920
So after that, grab the anchor point of our
layer and then take and move it to the very

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.460
bottom of the text.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.030
This will mean that our text will now rotate
and move around this point.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.100
So after that, we're ready to start animating.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.590
So go ahead and check the 3D layer box for
your pre-comp and press "r" to bring up the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.070
rotation keyframes.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.290
So go ahead and click the stopwatch for the
x rotation to set a keyframe for that property.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.590
So after that, move your playhead out to about
a third of a second and then raise up the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.280
x rotation until the text falls forward and
lays flat on the ground.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.549
So during this animation, we're also going
to want to animate the opacity, so go ahead

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.110
and press "shift t" on your keyboard to bring
up that property.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.260
So then we can take and animate the opacity
so that as the text gets closer to the ground,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.110
we fade it out over a few frames.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.509
So there we go, now we have the first piece
of the animation complete.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.850
Now for the second piece, we can double click
on our pre-comp and then copy the "Tutorials"

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.079
layer and then go back to our main comp and
paste it.

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.350
So I will then change this text to a blue
color and scale it up.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.240
Now I'm also going to be changing what the
text says, and we're going to make it say

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.240
"On."

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.579
So you can move this text around a little
bit, but make sure to keep this text on the

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.150
same x axis so that it rotates around the
same area.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.210
Now feel free to move it horizontally, so
that it lines up with the previous rotation.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.959
So again, make sure and turn this layer into
a 3D layer and then go ahead and move your

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.681
playhead over to where the first layer started
to rotate, and then set an x rotation and

00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:20.450
an opacity keyframe.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.609
So after that, you can go ahead and move the
playhead to where the first layer had faded

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.889
out, and set two more keyframes.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:29.919
So once you've done this, go back to your
first x rotation keyframe and lower the value

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:33.600
so that the text rotates downward to lay on
its back.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.930
Now again, we want the text to fade in, so
go ahead and set your first keyframe to 0

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.329
and then move the second keyframe in so that
the text fades in quickly.

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.070
So now we have the text animating in.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.711
And since we want the text to stay around
for a little bit on this second piece, we

00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:51.510
can take and move the playhead out about another
3/4s of a second and create an x rotation

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.660
keyframe and an opacity keyframe.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.070
So after you are happy with the timing on
that, you can move out another 1/3 of a second

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.720
or so and then create another x rotation keyframe
as well as an opacity keyframe.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.400
So then again, we're going to adjust the value
of the last x rotation keyframe so that the

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.480
text then falls forward.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.660
So then we're also going to take the last
opacity keyframe and make that 0 and adjust

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.130
the opacity keyframe so that the text fades
out as it falls.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.960
So the steps for the third and final piece
are very similar to the beginning of the second piece.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.800
So first, go ahead and copy the text from
the inside of the first pre-comp and paste

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.280
a copy on the stage.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.320
I will then change the text and then go ahead
and duplicate this layer again and then change

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.440
that text.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.120
So after that I can scale up the pieces of
text accordingly and the make the top word

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.820
white and the bottom one red.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.620
So while you're doing this, don't forget to
scrub into where the pieces overlap with the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.760
second piece, in order to make sure that they
are centered up correctly.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.120
So since again, we're using two layers, make
sure and pre-comp these and zoom in to move

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.180
the anchor point to the bottom of the text
with the pan behind tool.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.340
Now after that, it's as easy as turning the
layer into a 3D layer and then animating the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.509
text upward and fading it in.

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:11.060
Now I'm not going to spend a lot of time covering
this key for key as we have discussed a lot

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.260
of these concepts in the other two pieces.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.980
So now when you're finished, you can go ahead
and throw a few finishing touches on by selecting

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.100
all of your x rotation keyframes and then
right clicking on one of them and then selecting

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.150
"Easy Ease" from the "Keyframe Assistant"
menu.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.280
This will give your animation a little bit
more of a realistic feel.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.720
Now you can also spend some time adjusting
the timing and duration of your piece, but

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.460
this should give you the general effect.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.920
