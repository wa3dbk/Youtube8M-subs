Henri: Hi, guys.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.460
This is Henri, and this is Ashle, and we're
going to show a little bit of the bicep technique,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.650
how to do it and apply it and what it is.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.650
Right?

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.650
So let me demonstrate for you.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.770
Basically, it's a type of frame that you can
use to make the lady's body move.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.970
It's a little bit of a dominant but really
strong lead for the ladies, in a respectful

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:27.970
way of course.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.759
So what happens is you wrap your arm around
the lady.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.910
And then the most important thing is your
bicep, your left bicep.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.800
So let me show you how it goes.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.800
Right?

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.800
Basically, we're going a slow step.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.430
It usually goes with the slow dances.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.430
Yes.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.540
You can make the lady's body wave by connecting
with your bicep.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.910
So you always have them in control.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.740
Now let's break it down for you.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.630
All you do is, again you don't want to dance
square.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.280
You don't want to be dancing this way.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.900
It's really hard this way.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.480
It actually is not possible.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.480
It's impossible.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.760
There's no way we can do this.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.760
Right?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.980
We need to always be slightly diagonal.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.990
So in this case, we always step the right
leg in between the lady's right feet.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.950
And the same thing with the ladies.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.040
Ladies, always step between the guy's feet
when it's close dancing.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.000
Now what you do guys is you bring your palm
upward.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.240
So you do it this way, and you bring your
elbow close to your body.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.590
That way it's going to get your bicep.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.670
That way, ladies, you're going to feel how
the guy's slowly holding you in this really

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.690
different position, and you connect.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.860
You get the connection.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.860
Yeah?

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.299
So this prevents the ladies from going forward
on top of you.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:30.299
Right?

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.570
So they're just all the way.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.369
And if they do, you connect this and then,
and go back.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.750
Ashely: Push them away.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.750
Henri: Yes?

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.750
Push them away.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.700
So this is important for the going forward.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.000
For the going back, then you have the forearm
and your elbow and your hand.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.340
And that one is where you create.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.250
It's like you're playing the instrument.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.080
Imagine you're playing like a harp, a guitar,
some kind of flow instrument.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.060
So the that you do with your right arm, the
ladies will follow it, but always keeping

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.890
this arm strong, the left arm.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.280
If you let it go, they won't be able to feel
it, because it's nothing.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.280
Right?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
Ashely: Yeah.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.450
And this technique helps, because it shortens
the girl's arm.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.149
So now she's compact, and you have more control
over what you want her to do.

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.149
Henri: Exactly.

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.159
Ashely: But as soon as you let that go and
you're no longer showing that bicep, now I

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.840
can go wherever I want, and you've lost control.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.019
Henri: So to go back what we've learned before
in the previous videos, you can do a wave

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.019
in this move.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.969
You also can do a sway.

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.439
But also we can do the washing machine that
we talked about before.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.439
Right?

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.689
Or also we can add body waves.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.689
Yes?

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.349
And the body wave, literally, all you do is
you move your arm in and out, like a snake.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.609
You start with the thumb, all the way to the
pinky and repeat, like you're giving the ladies

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:44.609
a massage.

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:45.609
Yes?

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.200
Which they will thank you for.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200
And.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.859
And, yes.

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:59.090
Always keeping that left arm strong so you
can lead them in anything you want.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.319
And that's you're bicep technique.
