00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.875
They say that breakfast
is the most important

00:00:01.875 --> 00:00:04.197
meal of the day, so today
on The Domestic Geek

00:00:04.197 --> 00:00:07.471
I'm gonna show you five
amazing overnight oatmeals

00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:10.466
that will be waiting for you
when you get up in the morning.

00:00:10.466 --> 00:00:13.276
They're totally delicious
and great for you.

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.727
This overnight oatmeal has
become a complete staple

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:16.646
in my house.

00:00:16.646 --> 00:00:18.702
What I love about it is that
it all gets put together

00:00:18.702 --> 00:00:20.397
the night before and in the morning,

00:00:20.397 --> 00:00:22.185
you can either eat it cold or heat it up

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:23.950
and it's just ready to go for you.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.635
The basic recipe couldn't be simpler.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.073
You're working with one
third of a cup of oats

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:29.118
in a mason jar.

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:31.904
To that, you're gonna add
one tablespoon of chia seeds,

00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:34.180
or you can use protein powder instead,

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.246
a quarter cup of the milk of your choice.

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:37.467
I like almond milk.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:40.276
A quarter cup of greek
yogurt and then whatever

00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:41.716
flavorings you decide.

00:00:41.716 --> 00:00:43.388
Let me tell you, the flavor possibilities

00:00:43.388 --> 00:00:44.943
are absolutely endless.

00:00:44.943 --> 00:00:47.730
I'm gonna show you my five
favorite flavors today.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.075
Carrot cake flavored oatmeal.

00:00:50.075 --> 00:00:51.166
So we're starting with our oats.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.966
We're going to add a
tablespoon of chia seeds,

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.752
our almond milk, and
then our greek yogurt.

00:00:56.752 --> 00:00:59.180
Lots of protein happening
in this breakfast.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.130
And then, for our carrot cake flavor,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.568
we're going to top it
with some maple syrup,

00:01:03.568 --> 00:01:06.680
a little bit of cinnamon,
some shredded carrot,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.419
and then, of course,
some pecans for crunch.

00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.115
Nothing says good morning
like blueberry lemon

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.345
overnight oatmeal.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:15.762
So this couldn't be simpler.

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:18.107
We are starting with our oats, of course.

00:01:18.107 --> 00:01:21.706
Our chia seeds, our almond
milk, and our greek yogurt,

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:24.747
and then we are going to top
this with a splash of vanilla

00:01:24.747 --> 00:01:26.665
extract to brighten all the flavors.

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:30.101
Some blueberry jam to add some sweetness,

00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:33.096
a handful of gorgeous organic blueberries,

00:01:33.096 --> 00:01:36.672
and then just a little bit
of lemon rind for a bit

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:38.738
of zesty lemon flavor.

00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:40.085
Few things in the world go better

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:42.755
than strawberries and chocolate.

00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:44.636
Can you imagine waking up in the morning

00:01:44.636 --> 00:01:46.703
to strawberry chocolate overnight oatmeal?

00:01:46.703 --> 00:01:47.704
So we have our oats.

00:01:47.704 --> 00:01:50.676
We're going to add our chia
seeds, our almond milk,

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.302
and some greek yogurt.

00:01:52.302 --> 00:01:54.415
Then for our flavoring,
we're going to use some honey

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:55.808
to add a bit of sweetness.

00:01:55.808 --> 00:01:57.967
You can always omit
the honey if you prefer

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:00.413
a less sweet oatmeal, but I
like a little bit of sugar

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:01.282
in the morning.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:04.385
Then we are going to add
a scoop of cocoa powder,

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:06.498
some beautiful fresh cut strawberries.

00:02:06.498 --> 00:02:09.587
You could also do this with
oranges or cherries even,

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:10.577
would be really delicious.

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:12.552
And then we're going to top
it with just a little bit

00:02:12.552 --> 00:02:15.501
of shaved chocolate for
some added decadence.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.808
Because who doesn't need
a little added decadence

00:02:17.808 --> 00:02:19.405
in the morning to get you going?

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.811
Next up is the banana nut.

00:02:20.811 --> 00:02:22.961
It almost tastes like banana nut bread.

00:02:22.961 --> 00:02:24.424
So, so delicious.

00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:27.163
So, to our standard recipe, we are adding

00:02:27.163 --> 00:02:30.414
a little bit of maple
syrup, some nut butter.

00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:32.457
I'm using peanut butter, but
you could use walnut butter

00:02:32.457 --> 00:02:34.292
or cashew butter if you like.

00:02:34.292 --> 00:02:37.519
Some chopped walnuts and
of course, some fresh

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.052
banana slices.

00:02:39.344 --> 00:02:41.934
This is our Pina Colada flavor.

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.014
To our standard recipe,
we are going to add

00:02:44.014 --> 00:02:47.045
a tablespoon of honey. Just
for a little sweetness.

00:02:47.045 --> 00:02:49.275
Then some slivered almonds,

00:02:49.275 --> 00:02:52.734
some fresh cut pineapple and
we're going to top it all off

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.847
with a little bit of coconut.

00:02:54.847 --> 00:02:56.240
So good.

00:02:57.716 --> 00:03:00.268
