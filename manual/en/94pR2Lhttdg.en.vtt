JEN: Hi there, I’m Jen and I manage SmartPak’s
Retail Store, located in Natick, MA. One of

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.950
the most important purchases you make as a
rider is tall boots. They are essential equipment

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.790
for those who horse-show, and a good pair
can help you solidify your position and ride

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.359
more effectively. They are an investment,
and as such should be treated with care.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.400
When it comes to cleaning your boots, keep
in mind that it’s very different leather

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.369
than you’ll see in your regular tack. Tall
boots are made with very fine leather, and

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.439
field boots especially tend to be made with
a thinner hide, which allows the rider a close

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.390
contact between the leg and the horse’s
side.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.180
With fine leather, it’s important not to
use most tack cleaning soaps or conditioners

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.590
– these are too harsh and could damage boot
leather or strip it of color. After you use

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.370
your boots, use a slightly dampened sponge
or cloth to wipe away dust, sweat and debris

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.510
from the leather. Special attention should
be paid to wrinkles and areas that come in

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.610
contact with the horse’s side.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.140
To help keep your boots looking their best
over time, a good quality boot conditioner

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.910
should be used occasionally. One of my personal
favorites is the Der Dau Boot Conditioner.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.120
Whatever conditioner you choose, use it sparingly
or it may cause your boots to stretch too

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.519
much and lose their beautiful tailored shape.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.909
Effax also has a really great line of boot
care products, and they even package them

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:14.610
together in this handy case for easy storage
and transport. Keeping your boots polished

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.040
helps to protect the leather and adds a water-resistant
layer, which really helps when you’re trying

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.280
to walk through the early morning dew. Plus,
it makes your boots look amazing and adds

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.180
a sparkle to your ride.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.490
Along those same lines, using boot trees,
like this pair from Ariat, will help to maintain

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.799
the shape and prolong the life of your boots.
Keeping them upright protects the zipper,

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.240
as well as preventing bends and folds that could
weaken or damage the leather.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.909
Speaking of the zipper, using Pharmaka Zipper
Saver Spray will help to keep your zippers

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.060
clean and sliding smoothly, reducing the chances
of damage, which can be costly to repair.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.920
Last but not least, a boot bag is a great
way to protect your boots when you’re not

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.420
wearing them. There are bags where both boots
are stored together, as well as individual

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.860
boot bags attached with a strap that are handy
to throw over your shoulder. All bags have

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.890
a soft interior surface that helps to keep
your boots clean and protected from dents

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.360
and dings.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.259
I hope these boot care tips will help to keep
your tall boots in tip-top shape. Thanks so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.810
much for watching and have a great ride!
