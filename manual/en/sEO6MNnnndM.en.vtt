00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:16.818
It is a very cold winter day today so for
lunch we've decided to have some Gamjatang,

00:00:16.818 --> 00:00:17.818
which is a hearty Korean stew.

00:00:17.818 --> 00:00:22.580
In Korea you cut everything with scissors
- forget knives - this is the way it is done.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.780
Eat like the locals.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.010
The same with the kimchi.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.180
Let's chop that up.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.500
It looks nice and fresh.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.902
Here is the delicious stew and these are all
of the different ingredients that we have

00:00:38.902 --> 00:00:39.902
for it.

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.530
We've got some vegetables and lots of potatoes
here on the side.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.969
It is going to be lovely.

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.820
I'd like to know what the white stuff is.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.629
This is the kind of restaurant where you come
to fight off a hangover by eating Haejeongguk.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:06.030
In our case, if you're freezing you come for
a hearty stew like this one.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.400
Bubbling goodness.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.520
What are you eating over there?

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.640
I'm just taking the meat off of the pork spine.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.140
How is the meat?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.850
Is it tasty?

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.150
Oh, yes.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.200
Okay, it is time to dish it up.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.200
It is all cooked.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.930
You can see that the broth is a real thick
and hearty looking with the different sesame

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.180
seeds and all kinds of different paste.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.740
Gamjatang soup basically means that it has
potatoes but there is also lots of other things

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.740
in there.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.381
We have pork spine, there are some rice cakes,
sesame leaves, sesame seeds, mushrooms and

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:06.400
there was a white paste which we haven't really
figured out what it was.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.619
We think it might be a sesame based paste.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.370
How would you describe the broth?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.300
It is a lot spicier than I was expecting but
it is very flavorful.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.290
It is really good.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.830
Let's get a close-up shot.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.630
With the gamjatang you really have to make
sure to stir it around so that it doesn't

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.270
stick to the bottom.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.310
We kind of made that mistake earlier.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.511
I'll just add to the flavor.

00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:45.120
This is the meat after it has been de-boned.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.640
I like to dip it in the mustard sauce - it
is really spicy and it almost reminds me of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.630
wasabi a little but with a mustard-y flavor.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.460
It definitely does have a bite and a little
bit of a tang to it.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.460
Show us how it is done.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.630
Let's grab a little bit.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.040
That looks fatty.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.640
Here is a normal piece - that one.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.270
Here you go.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.020
You can just dip it and swirl it around.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.020
Delicious!

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.550
We're almost finished the meal and what is
left is basically just a thick collection

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.349
of stew, meat and a few random potatoes and
veggies.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.200
As you can see here our feast is complete.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:38.270
The cost of this meal was 25,000 Won - roughly
25 USD - a little bit less.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.849
Overall, our feeling was that although it
was tasty and definitely delicious relatively

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:47.080
compared to what we can get at other Korean
restaurants it was a little bit expensive.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.240
We probably won't try this one again.
