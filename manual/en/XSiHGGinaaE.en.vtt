00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.770
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to rebuild a front

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.740
brake caliper. In this step, we're going to
talk about the proper service procedure for

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.960
re-jacking our vehicle, removing our jack
stand and setting the vehicle back on the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.570
ground. We're going to take our floor jack
and aim for a heavy duty piece of the front

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.140
axle. On this particular vehicle, we're going
to pick up right on one of the front end I-beams.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.800
It's an extremely heavy duty component and
is designed to carry the weight of the vehicle.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:48.580
Go ahead and tighten down my release screw.
Give her a couple pumps. Right there. You're

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:59.400
pretty much going to jack it up in the same
location as you did to get it off the ground.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.870
Once you have the jack, once you have the
vehicle jacked up off of your jack stand,

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.439
it's okay to go ahead and remove it from under
the vehicle, just like so. Once you have the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.450
jack stand out from underneath the vehicle,
it is no longer to work on the vehicle underneath

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.840
it with just the jack holding it up. Once
you have the jack stand out, you're going

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.069
to go ahead and turn your release screw counter
clockwise. We're going to let the vehicle

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.970
slowly settle to the ground in order to avoid
any damage to our jack or ourselves. If you're

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.359
to take and put a great big turn on the release
handle, the vehicles going to come crashing

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:51.170
down extremely fast. Possibly damaging the
vehicle, yourself or your jack. Once we have

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.850
it on the ground, we can go ahead and slip
our floor jack out from underneath it and

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.090
that is the proper service procedure for re-jacking
your vehicle, removing your jack stand and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.029
settling it back to the ground.
