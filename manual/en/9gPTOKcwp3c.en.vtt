00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.433
This is a thangka,

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:14.800
done in central Tibet, about 1500 A.D..

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.667
The central deity, Mahakala, emerges out of this halo of flames,

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.600
a demon from your worst nightmare. Within Buddhism, Mahakala means the “great dark one” or “blackness.”

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.800
You would have been in a dark temple with a candle,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.000
and seen portions of this deity

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.867
emerging from the darkness.

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:43.000
He stands on a corpse baring his fangs,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.667
and holding a knife and a skull full of blood and gore.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.600
Surrounded by this host of demons

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.433
that dance

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.667
brandishing weapons,

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:53.233
while dogs, jackals

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:54.500
and crows

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.433
devour the flesh of dead bodies.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:03.333
I find it shocking that you have this host of respectable monks

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:04.700
sitting on the edges.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
Texts tell us

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.200
that a student who does not respect the Buddha

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.500
is eaten up raw by Mahakala.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.667
He is a protector of the monastery and of Buddhist teaching,

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:20.467
and capable of destroying obstacles that hold them back from attaining enlightenment. The most deeply seated desires

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:24.900
and attachments that bind us to this world: greed, lust,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.734
but more to the point, ego.

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:35.133
And this idea of severing one’s ego is linked to the cutting off of these heads.

00:01:35.133 --> 00:01:38.834
It’s almost life size,

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.834
and would have had great impact simply because of its scale.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:47.133
There’s a very careful under-drawing

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:51.500
that’s proportionally correct;

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.934
if the image was improperly constructed, the meditator would be psychically damaged.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.567
In a sense it’s this idea of giving this realm

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.000
that’s beyond our understanding real form.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.300
It not only grabs my attention and pulls me into this alternate reality,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.199
but it plays very much with issues that I find threatening.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.867
That tension is very sublime.

00:02:13.867 --> 00:02:18.734
You are looking into his eyes,

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.133
and you’re confronted with his aggression

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.600
that triggers all of your anxiety and fear in the world.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.400
And yet at the same time, there is something reassuring

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.334
that a deity as powerful as this is going to be on your side.

00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:34.600
He’s a fierce ally. That sense of dread or that sense of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:43.667
the unknown gives him great gravity and meaning.
