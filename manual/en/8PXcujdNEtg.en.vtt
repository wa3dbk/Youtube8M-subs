Hello all my Swedish friends! Today I am going to cook a very popular french dish - boeuf bourguignon.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:27.224
Here is all my ingredients. I have plenty of ingredients, but I assure you: this will taste fantastic!

00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:36.651
It consists of beef (chuck steak) and it tastes absolutley great, when it's done it'll be very tender and perfect!

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:43.479
Also, for a smokey taste, I will put in smoked salt pork which will be very nice.

00:00:43.738 --> 00:00:54.025
Also: some vegetables. Carrot, leek, mushrooms - I love mushrooms! - some onions, garlic and

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.906
I don't know what this is called in Swedish, but a bay leaf.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:10.027
Also some flour, tomato purée, red wine - which is very nice in this dish - and some chicken stock and parsley.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.083
Now - let's go!

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:23.366
I love this dish because once you've finished all the preperations, you can just sit back, drink some wine and wait for it to be done!

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:24.587
Very nice, in my book.

00:01:36.694 --> 00:01:46.778
Now I have diced up all my ingredients and I'll do the same with the chuck steak, except I don't want it to be in smaller pieces.

00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:54.565
Instead, use a little bit bigger pieces. When it's been cooked, the meat will be softer, more concentrated and taste lovely!

00:01:54.882 --> 00:01:56.280
Down with the chuck steak in the frying pan!

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.179
Look! When you reach this lovely colour, it will taste very good in your boeuf bourguignon.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:14.787
Now, once I'm done with the meat, I will remove the pieces but I'll be sure to save all the juices in the pan. This I will use to fry up the salt pork.

00:02:17.232 --> 00:02:24.410
Now it's time to add all the diced vegetables. The carrot, the onions and the garlic as well.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.164
It smells so lovely now!

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:32.891
The vegetables are now pretty soft, so now it's time for the rest of the ingredients.

00:02:32.991 --> 00:02:41.918
Down with the beef again, the flour, the tomato purée and the red wine as well.

00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:51.594
Once you've decided which wine to use in your boeuf bourguignon, please, please, please use red wine that you'll drink with your dinner as well!

00:02:51.783 --> 00:02:52.964
Very good!

00:03:00.798 --> 00:03:06.285
I've add a bit of flour here, so the sauce will thicken a bit.

00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.854
Now it'll have to boil up.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.320
Mix in the wine, the chicken stock and the bay leaf.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:33.089
Now I have to wait for three hours. A long time, sure, but a perfect amount of time to treat myself to some wine!

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:38.291
I hope that when you try this recipe, you will have some wine for yourself also!

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.682
Time to cover it up and wait the three hours. Good luck!

00:03:53.476 --> 00:04:09.916
Bouef bourgningon! It's perfect! It has reduced a bit, it has a whole lot of flavours, the meat is soft and now it's time to fry up the leek and mushrooms to put them in as well.

00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:14.859
All the leek and mushrooms are diced and ready to go.

00:04:16.141 --> 00:04:26.273
Fry in a frying pan, and when they've reached the perfect colour, put them in your boeuf bourguignon and put the leek on top.

00:04:26.974 --> 00:04:31.840
Let it cook for thirty minutes and it will be absolutley perfect.

00:04:32.507 --> 00:04:49.164
Le bouef bourgningon! It's done! Time to serve it with some mashed potatoes - find the recipe to this and the bouef bourgningon in the description below.

00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:53.095
Have a nice weekend. Bye!
