A way of creating or generating texture is
to do rubbings or as the French say it Frottage.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.660
It's a fancy term but what it basically means
is that you go around everywhere your house

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.550
the garden and everywhere and try to find
objects that have an irregular surface to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.940
them and take the back and see how they work
when you rub over them. This works best you

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.340
need your paper on a hard support. You can't
do this like on your lap with a piece of paper

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.930
and it won't work. It needs a hard surface
beneath it one that won't move anywhere and

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.090
it works best with graphite. That is with
a pencil or graphite is sold in a stick. This

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.020
is a graphite stick and what it does, you
see, is instead of having just the point of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.090
the pencil you have the whole side and what
you need to do with these is actually work

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.250
it out so that you don't end up with, you
don't want these the sharp edges to get in

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.449
your way. So you're going to have to work
it out the edge of it and then you come back

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:17.720
and you have press fairly hard. But you can
see that I am going to develop a texture.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:25.060
I'll show you can sometimes do this with charcoal.
You have to press fairly hard and this is

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.520
a very small pattern so you're going to basically
loose the pattern in sort of the large the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.400
large size of the charcoal particles. So graphite
sticks pretty much work the best and we can

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.540
try a lot of things. Lace doilies work, the
bottom of your shoe works, you can do coins.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.829
If you want start making a pattern with the
coins in your purse, you can do that. But

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:59.039
that's the basic you know you can make texture
yourself and then use it in your design.
