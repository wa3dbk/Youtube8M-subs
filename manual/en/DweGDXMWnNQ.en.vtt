Go Darren!

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.520
Ooooh!

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.000
That's waking me up now!

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.180
Vibratto...

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.900
He's very smart.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.460
Beautiful voice...

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.080

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.440
Bamboo!

00:01:07.494 --> 00:01:08.494
It's close...

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.020
You and me...

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.740
I'm not quite ready yet.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.040
Let's check!

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.880
Ooh baby baby!

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.100
Ooh baby baby!

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
Wow!

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.700
Hello :)

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.680
Ooh baby baby!

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.360
Your voice is so high!

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.200
How old are you?

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.260
I'm 12 years old.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.080
12 years old... What's your name?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.120
I am Darren Espanto.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.180
You're really, really good in singing and really, really good moving on stage.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.920
Oooh!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.060
Oh, that I didn't see!

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.840
Yes! It was obvious that he was just enjoying his performance and was singing effortlessly.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.680
So effortless...

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.080
I heard... I heard something on your voice. Sorry, but where are you from?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.880
I'm from Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.220
That's why... that's why you have a...

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.480
I'm 100% Filipino and I travelled back here in the Philippines just to audition to The Voice Kids.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.380
Wooow!

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.180
Yes!

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.380
Alright!

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.260
I'm just gonna watch here...

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:48.580
Darren, I'm impressed in your singing, your delivery, your timing... It sounds to me that you've been doing this for a while. It's like you're used to this. 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.060
It's like you've been playing around Canada. Gigs? Because gigs are different from contests.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.340
I've done front acts in Calgary...

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.780
For whom?

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.440
Uh, yours (Bamboo).

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.320
Oh, thank you. Thank you for being a part of... yeah, one of mine, man.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.760
Thank you.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.240
Thank you, Darren. It's a pleasure.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.400
You know what, since she said (Sarah) that you're good in dancing... 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.800
(To Sarah) You should dance with him.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.260
You should both dance!

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.240
Oh, that was much better.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.880
It's like we're a perfect match!

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.820
You know, I really, really, really need you in my team because you're sooo good!

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.960
You have the dance moves, you're a handsome kid and you can sing very well!

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.200
That's what I can do. Dance? You've seen me on stage.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:53.400
Okay, Darren. Both of them are pleading that you join their team.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.500
Sarah was dancing.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.820
Bamboo here, was pretending to dance.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.320
Darren, oh my, we'll just be enjoying things, because you're already so good. :)

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.140
Darren, what I like was when the chair turned around...

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.700
I enjoyed it.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:05.040
He knows how to perform. He was full of energy. You can see the confidence in the kid and he was really good in singing. His voice was clean.
