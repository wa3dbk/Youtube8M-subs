00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:14.040
Howcast, what's up?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.580
K-Glide here, about to take you on these levels.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.270
Time to go on levels with these freezes.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.070
Gonna go from the turtle to the elbow.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.460
You ready?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.690
We're going to do this.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.760
We got this.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.949
Check it out.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.470
Once again we're going to go right into the
turtle.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.140
Remember, it's very important that you got
this center ready to go.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.150
What we're going to do from here, we're going
to go right into our forearm.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.920
How we're going to do that, we're going to
lift our hips, remember this core, you have

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.610
to work this out.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.290
We're going to lift our hips over our head.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.600
Your butt over your head, that's what you're
thinking the whole time.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.200
While you're pushing up, you're going to use
these biceps right here, you're going to push

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.990
and shift your hips over and keep your upper
body straight.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.990
So we're here.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.990
Turtle.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.100
My hips are going to go over my head and right
at the same time I'm going to slide like that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.189
onto my forearm.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:22.340
Here we are, hips over the head, forearm,
bam.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:31.549
Once again, this is very important, this can
help you learn how to push up like this.

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:58.519
Come back down.
