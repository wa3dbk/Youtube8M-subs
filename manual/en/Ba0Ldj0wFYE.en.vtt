Hi, I’m Constance Hall and this is Jessica
Rose and we’re here for Expert Village.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.059
Now we’re going to show you how to do some
dark eye shadow and eyeliner for a really

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.330
Goth look. So here I have my palette of colors.
So first, I’m going to start off light,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:32.119
and brush it all over the entire eyelid to
give you sort of a base to work off of.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.280
This dark eye shadow, the color theme that
I’m going to be going with today is going

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.780
to be dark browns and reds to bring out the
color of her eyes. So we go with the next

00:00:42.780 --> 00:01:18.370
darker color, it's going to be very smoky
and well-blended. Blending is the key here.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.710
I work from lightest to darkest colors. I
use the darker colors to sort of shape the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:02:11.591
eye in the way I want it, and today it's going
to be a very dramatic cat sort of eye. And

00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.870
next, for my final color we’ll do black
to really darken it and make it very dramatic.
