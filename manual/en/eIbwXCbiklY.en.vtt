00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:06.133
The President:
At his trial in 1964,

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:11.533
Nelson Mandela closed his
statement from the dock saying,

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.066
"I have fought against
white domination,

00:00:14.066 --> 00:00:17.467
and I have fought
against black domination.

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:22.700
I have cherished the ideal of
a democratic and free society

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.867
in which all persons 
live together in harmony

00:00:25.867 --> 00:00:28.567
and with equal opportunities.

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:33.600
It is an ideal which I hope
to live for and to achieve.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.934
But if needs be, it is an ideal
for which I am prepared to die."

00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:44.166
And Nelson Mandela
lived for that ideal,

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:46.667
and he made it real.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.800
He achieved more than could
be expected of any man.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Today, he has gone home.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
And we have lost one of the
most influential, courageous,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.934
and profoundly good human beings

00:00:59.934 --> 00:01:04.367
that any of us will share
time with on this Earth.

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.667
He no longer belongs to us --

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.633
he belongs to the ages.

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.667
Through his fierce
dignity and unbending will

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.266
to sacrifice his own freedom
for the freedom of others,

00:01:16.266 --> 00:01:18.467
Madiba transformed
South Africa --

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:21.800
and moved all of us.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.133
His journey from a prisoner to
a President embodied the promise

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.900
that human beings --
and countries --

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900
can change for the better.

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:35.500
His commitment to
transfer power

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.300
and reconcile with
those who jailed him

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.467
set an example that all
humanity should aspire to,

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.133
whether in the lives of nations
or our own personal lives.

00:01:45.133 --> 00:01:50.200
And the fact that he did it
all with grace and good humor,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.600
and an ability to acknowledge
his own imperfections,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.467
only makes the man that
much more remarkable.

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:01.000
As he once said,
"I am not a saint,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.900
unless you think of a saint as
a sinner who keeps on trying."

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:10.133
I am one of the countless
millions who drew inspiration

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.166
from Nelson Mandela's life.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:18.800
My very first political action,
the first thing I ever did

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.567
that involved an issue
or a policy or politics,

00:02:23.567 --> 00:02:25.033
was a protest against apartheid.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:31.633
I studied his words
and his writings.

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:35.467
The day that he was released
from prison gave me a sense

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.600
of what human beings can do
when they're guided

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.900
by their hopes and
not by their fears.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.467
And like so many
around the globe,

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:44.433
I cannot fully
imagine my own life

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:48.834
without the example
that Nelson Mandela set,

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.667
and so long as I live
I will do what I can

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:55.100
to learn from him.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.500
To GraÃ§a Machel and his family,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.166
Michelle and I extend our 
deepest sympathy and gratitude

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:07.633
for sharing this
extraordinary man with us.

00:03:07.633 --> 00:03:09.700
His life's work
meant long days

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.934
away from those
who loved him the most.

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:14.934
And I only hope that
the time spent with him

00:03:14.934 --> 00:03:16.433
these last few weeks

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:20.300
brought peace and
comfort to his family.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.400
To the people of South Africa,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.133
we draw strength from
the example of renewal,

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:26.834
and reconciliation,

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:30.734
and resilience
that you made real.

00:03:30.734 --> 00:03:35.233
A free South Africa
at peace with itself --

00:03:35.233 --> 00:03:37.467
that's an example to the world,

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.934
and that's Madiba's legacy
to the nation he loved.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.633
We will not likely see the
likes of Nelson Mandela again.

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:51.367
So it falls to us
as best we can

00:03:51.367 --> 00:03:55.600
to forward the
example that he set:

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.066
to make decisions guided
not by hate, but by love;

00:03:58.066 --> 00:04:04.066
to never discount the difference
that one person can make;

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:08.567
to strive for a future that
is worthy of his sacrifice.

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:12.500
For now, let us pause and
give thanks for the fact

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.900
that Nelson Mandela lived --

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.800
a man who took
history in his hands,

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:24.433
and bent the arc of the moral
universe toward justice.

00:04:24.433 --> 00:04:28.133
May God Bless his memory
and keep him in peace.
