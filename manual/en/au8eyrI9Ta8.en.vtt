00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:09.476 line:0%
The Mediterranean
diet is the oldest

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:13.112 line:0%
diet that is still
practiced today.

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.814
You don't see people
going around saying,

00:00:14.814 --> 00:00:16.616
"hey, you need to eat like the
Inuits, it's really good".

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:17.750
( audience laughter )

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.886
You have people...
because it's something

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:20.986
you can still
practice nowadays

00:00:20.986 --> 00:00:22.288
it's very ancient.

00:00:22.288 --> 00:00:23.389
<i> So, I went to Crete</i>

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.658
<i> and I did not go
 to one specific area.</i>

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.393
<i> I went all around Crete.</i>

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.729 line:0%
<i> But I ended up spending quite
 a lot of time in Central Crete</i>

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.932 line:0%
<i> where the word
 "Kriti" is written.</i>

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:35.368 line:0%
<i> There's about 600,000
 people living in Crete.</i>

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:37.170 line:0%
<i> This is breakfast,
 the first day.</i>

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.305
<i> And people adapt
 to anything.</i>

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.174
<i> All these areas I visited</i>

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.376
traditionally if they
eat only traditional food

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.810
they are all fit as hell.

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.146
<i> I was lucky, I was
 there exactly a year ago.</i>

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.315
<i> And it was time of "Horta".</i>

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.817
<i> Horta means herbs,
 mean the wild herbs.</i>

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.919
<i> And so I see this old woman
 on the second or third day</i>

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.154
<i> walking around, you know.</i>

00:00:55.154 --> 00:00:57.022
<i> And I follow her and she's
 got this super sharp knife</i>

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:58.591
<i> - and I'm like, "whoa, easy".</i>
- ( audience laughter )

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.226
<i> And what is she doing?</i>

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.829
<i> She just laid down under
 the olive tree and</i>

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.330
<i> she started to
 gather all this</i>

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.800
<i> various wild chicory,
 wild fennels</i>

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.869
<i> All is... just goodness.
 It's just,</i>

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.038
<i> it was a really
 beautiful scene.</i>

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:14.807
And so I followed her, you know
she didn't have enough space...

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:17.776
into her apron, so she started
to take off her stuff

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:20.046
and rolled all the
wild herbs in it,

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:22.415
<i> it was a very
 beautiful moment.</i>

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:25.017
Vangelio her name is,
80-something year old woman.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.554
<i> And then she goes back
 and her daughters are there</i>

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:30.289
<i> and they start to go
 through all the hortas.</i>

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.725
<i> You know clean them, separate
 the different kinds.</i>

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.693
Any average Cretan
woman would give you

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:37.163
about 20-25 names
of wild herbs and

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.631
go in the field
and find them.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.032
And be able to
know that

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:41.367
this is still part of
their knowledge.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:43.469
I was really blown
away by this.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.671
<i> Then they mix
 it with eggs</i>

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:49.008
<i> they make this Dolma with
 stuffed grape leaves.</i>

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:51.177
<i> And then they pulled
 out this dish,</i>

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:53.846
<i> geranium leaves
 fried in olive oil.</i>

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:56.182
Even the French fries are
always fried in olive oil

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.984
there is no other
oil than olive.

00:01:57.984 --> 00:02:00.820
<i> This is tuna
 plant, I was told.</i>

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.422
<i> It's beetroot, it
 tastes like earth,</i>

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.691
<i> beautiful, with oranges
 they mix that.</i>

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.193
<i> Driving around Crete
 we passed vineyards.</i>

00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:10.930
<i> Wine comes around
 4,000-5,000 years ago</i>

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.132
<i> from that part of the world.
 It has olive groves.</i>

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.967
<i> Olive oil is like, you know,</i>

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.568
<i> the quintessential
 stuff you think of</i>

00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:18.571
<i> when you think of
 Mediterranean diet.</i>

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.273
<i> And people in April are
 trimming the olive trees</i>

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:23.376
<i> to boost productivity
 when it comes,</i>

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:25.044
<i> you know, around
 September-October</i>

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.579
<i> when they
 harvest olives.</i>

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.481
<i> And we pass this man who
 is, you know, trimming</i>

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:32.017
<i> and you can see between the
 olive trees they till the soil</i>

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:33.586
<i> and they are going
 to grow fava beans.</i>

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.756
Fava beans has a lot of
nitrogen, nitrogen fixer

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:40.325
and it will help, you
know, the soil to be...

00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:42.728
So it's permaculture
but to,

00:02:42.728 --> 00:02:45.698
you know, very old ways
of permaculture.

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.968
<i> They harvest parsley,
 which is a very ancient plant</i>

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.436
<i> from that part of
 the world too.</i>

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.603
They practice polyculture

00:02:51.603 --> 00:02:53.672
there's not going to
be massive monoculture

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:55.642
it's always mixed around there.

00:02:55.642 --> 00:02:57.376
It helps because you don't
need to use much fertilizer

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.444
when you do that.

00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.680
<i> And I meet a lot of
people that are self-sufficient</i>

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.481
<i> like this guy, Nikolas</i>

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:05.451
<i> who was living off his
 vegetable garden more or less.</i>

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.620
<i> We stop in Caf√©
 Neon, they are</i>

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.388
<i> the coffee places,
 coffee shops.</i>

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:11.390
<i> There's this Orthodox
 priest and, you know,</i>

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.359
<i> he's just having, you
 know, his breakfast.</i>

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.527
<i> These are peanuts.</i>

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:16.528
<i> They roll a lot of
 cigarettes, this crisis</i>

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:18.197
<i> they don't buy cigarettes,
they roll all their cigarettes.</i>

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:20.466
<i> Oranges, a little
 glass of grappa.</i>

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.801
Ten o'clock in the
morning, "It's okay,

00:03:21.801 --> 00:03:23.035
don't worry about it".

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.770
( audience laughter )

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.773
They live happy,
these people are...

00:03:26.773 --> 00:03:28.207
I mean, in Crete
what I experience

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.342
was a very
happy bunch.

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.212
<i> And, we drive around,
 there is this guy</i>

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.081
<i> you know, in the field there
 is a fridge, you know, I stop,</i>

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:39.185
<i> I get out, you know, I get
fed by very healthy looking man.</i>

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.920
( audience laughter )

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.592
<i> It was cool, I'm
 always game for that.</i>

00:03:46.592 --> 00:03:47.893
I love it.

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:50.196
- I love to be fed anything.
- ( audience laughter )

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:52.197
And we ended up
in Central Crete,

00:03:52.197 --> 00:03:53.733
<i> in this village
 called Meronas.</i>

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.935
<i> And you head out
 to the church.</i>

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.737
<i> And there's this grandma,
 "yeah, what do you want?"</i>

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.971
<i> I say, "hey...</i>

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.274
<i> you know, show me the way to
 the stomach, to the food."</i>

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:04.310
I need to see stuff
you know, "food, food, food."

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.011
She said, "okay,
go over there."

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.581
( speaking in Greek )

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:12.285
Matthieu:<i> Ah, these guys.</i>

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:17.490
( speaking in Greek )

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:21.461
All are like,
"he's taking a picture."

00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:22.728
"No, I think he's
doing a video."

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:23.896
"No, I don't
know, man."

00:04:23.896 --> 00:04:26.833
( audience laughter )

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:30.736
You know,
this is Saturday afternoon

00:04:30.736 --> 00:04:32.438
at the Moschonas,
in this little village.

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.872
And they just eat, man.

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:35.641
There is wine
everywhere and drinking.

00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:37.276
They're coming back from the
field, people are going

00:04:37.276 --> 00:04:38.377
There is so much noise.

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:39.444
Could be in Italy!

00:04:39.444 --> 00:04:40.779
You know, in my mind I was like

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.515
"Wow, my God, the
noise level in here!"

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.651
<i> And, so they are
 having chicken from the farm.</i>

00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:47.953
<i>They are having lots of snails,
 all the time, all year round.</i>

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:51.824
<i> They have wild asparagus,
they have fava beans, sardines.</i>

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:53.492
<i> You know, wine,
 wine, wine!</i>

00:04:53.492 --> 00:04:55.828
<i> And they eat a lot of snail
 there, all the time.</i>

00:04:55.828 --> 00:04:57.563
<i> And when you
 think about it</i>

00:04:57.563 --> 00:04:59.198
<i> when you think about
 the evolution of food</i>

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:02.868
<i> seashells, snails, you don't
 need much hunting skills.</i>

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:04.770
You don't even need
bow and arrow.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.439
You just walk there
and eat them.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.541
So, when you think of some of
the oldest food we have...

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.876
we must have been eating

00:05:09.876 --> 00:05:11.844
I am thinking it's there.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:13.612
It's full of Omega-3,
there's no fat in it.

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:15.447
It's super good for you.

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:17.650
<i> So, very joyous atmosphere,
 very nice</i>

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.351
<i> and the wine spills over</i>

00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:21.387
<i> and I'm like, "ah, great, you
 know, Crete, I love you!"</i>

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.423
<i> (</i> audience laughter<i> )</i>
