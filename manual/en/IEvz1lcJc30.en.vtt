Erik: How did blending your studies of social
sciences and the arts at the University of

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.940
Virginia impact your career development?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.510
Hammans: I was pretty spoiled in that I was
allowed to be in a program that at UVA where

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.920
we didn’t have any area requirements and
so I’d spent the first two years really

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.220
knocking out the economics and that allowed
me to really explore and move into a much

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.660
more an interdisciplinary academic approach,
more so than I think most people are able

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.980
to do, we didn’t have any area requirements
so I came in, was able to take graduate classes

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.110
pretty quickly and work in labs, in psychology
and – and for whatever reason, the – this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.190
contrast of economics and psychology really
was this – this kind of an annoying bug.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.170
They had so many assumptions about people
and behavior and how things work that are

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.379
in contrast that drove me nuts for years and
so I kind of in a lot of ways, there’s this

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.799
–that has actually kind of come through
with me throughout all of my – all of my

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.950
jobs since.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.740
I spent time in – in business, thinking
about how poorly understood people are.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:22.950
I spent time a little bit now in the creative
world where there isn’t a really sharp understanding

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.289
of how market mechanisms work and why businesses
are sort of strange in a way that people are

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.289
too.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.729
Organizations are made of people and they
have their own kind of strange psychology

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:44.479
and so I think that early experience in academics
really prepared me for studying in my later

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.280
career across functional areas and so I’ve
been much more of a generalist than I have

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.359
been a specialist.

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.960
You know I’ve – maybe it taught me the
value of it and as well it gave me something

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.719
to always kind of be struggling with in terms
of like reconciling things and it’s that

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.280
letting your subconscious kind of reconcile
things and being able to live and sleep with

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.090
that – you know that –that stress that
I think you’re able to come out with interesting

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.510
solutions that wouldn’t have been possible
otherwise if you just so deeply believed any

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.730
one thing.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.890
So, I think that’s kind of, I love more
than anything bringing kind of an interdisciplinary

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.959
approach and seeing how all these different
areas, different people, and different perspectives

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.180
in their own contexts see this elephant differently
and I think that’s kind of a neat future

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.810
is you know reconciling all these things and
see kind of at the intersection, what do you

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:43.010
learn.
