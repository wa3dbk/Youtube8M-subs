00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.260
British hero Nelson went to Napoli like that.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.740
He met this woman called Emma and they fell in love.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.760
But the problem was this Emma was well-known in Napoli.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.180
Nelson was famous too so the rumor spread fast.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.400
Since Hamilton was from Britain too, he pretended that he didn’t know.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.820
Oh this is heart-breaking.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.040
Since Hamilton loved Emma so much too

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.180
Three of them ended up living together.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.180
(Shocking)

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.480
It is shocking that they lived together.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.960
And they were all very famous at that time.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.600
Something like this was not allowed in a conservative society back then

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.220
So there was no word to describe a situation like this

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.640
But because of Emma, the word ‘Menage a trois’ was created.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.000
We now use the word for a different purpose

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.780
But the word meant ‘living together’ back then because three of them lived together.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.880
It was a very conservative society but since it was Nelson

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.920
Nobody could say a word.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.840
Because he was a national hero.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.140
A national hero who was allowed to have a love triangle

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.560
A scandal between man and man from Germany

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.150
Oh a different scale.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.100
Interested

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.260
It is the greatest scandal in German Empire

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.360
Of Wilhelm the Second, the last empire of German Empire and his scandal with men

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.980
There were 2 men very close to him.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.040
Moltke and Eulenburg

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.740
And there was a rumor that they were in an inappropriate relationship.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.900
A journalist called Harden wrote about this.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.260
And since they were very close to Wilhelm the Second

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.140
They were powerful people.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.760
So the case was taken to the court but Wilhelm didn’t want to do anything with it.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.860
And there were problems caused by witnesses.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.005
Eulenburg had a wife

00:02:14.005 --> 00:02:16.000
And she said at the court that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.360
Her husband slept with her only on the first and second night of their marriage.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.620
Twice only?

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.502
Yes and this stirred up the issue

00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:31.571
But the case was closed without further investigation.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.220
And a few years ago, letters among these 3 men were discovered

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.460
And Wilhelm the Second was in fact with those 2 other men!
