Hi Everyone, It's Ryan from CILS here.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.710
CILS is an organization funded by the Ministry
of Advanced Education in British Columbia,

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.509
and we provide perceptually disabled college
students with the learning materials they

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.740
need to succeed at their course work. Some
of the materials that CILS provides to students

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.440
include word processor files, ebook files,
PDFS, and increasingly students that I work

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.340
with want to use these files on their iOS
devices such as their iPhone or their iPad.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.120
The problem is it's not always clear how to
get this sort of material onto your device,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.620
so today I'm goint to show you one way to
get a PDF onto your iPad.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.239
So, the first thing you're going to need is
the file you want to add to your iPad. When

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.190
CILS sends you a file, typically we'll send
it as an email attachment, or perhaps on a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.440
CD or a DVD, but the file I've selected here
today is a chapter from a clinical nursing

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.170
textbook, and we're going to sync that. So
first you need to get the file onto your computer,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.530
and you need to note the location where you've
saved that file. So here's the location where

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.020
I've saved that file. I'm just going to make
sure I know what that is and then I'm going

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:22.659
to open up iTunes here. So in iTunes under
my iTunes library I've selected "books," and

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.870
I can see there's nothing there because I
have no books added to my iTunes library right

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:35.900
now. So to add the book that I just showed
you, I'm going to go up here on the top, left-hand

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:45.230
drop-down menu and select "file," and then
select "add file to library." I select that,

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.950
and then it's going to bring up this dialog
box that will allow you to browse through

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.720
to the location where you saved your file.
Once you've found that file--here's my file--I'm

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.810
going to click "open"... and select the file.
Click "open"--here we go. And then that's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.550
going to import that file into iTunes. So,
here we see now under "books" in my iTunes

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.150
library it's added this file. So, we're halfway
done. Now if we go down to iPad under devices

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.410
list, and we look at "books," it's not there
yet. That's because we have to do one more

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.290
step which is tell iTunes to add that file
to your device, in this case the iPad. So

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.840
under the devices list here on the left I'm
just going to click the main iPad icon and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.620
this will bring up the main information screen
for my iPad. On this screen at the top--this

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.099
top menu--I'm going to select "books," and
now you can tell it sync books by clicking

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.020
"sync books" up here. You can tell it to sync
a selected books or all books. If you click

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.800
selected make sure you sync the one you want
to add or the ones you want to add, and then

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.740
down here at the bottom right we click apply
which is going to apply that change to the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.670
iPad.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.110
Now, after that is finished, once we go to
books, here, we will see that is added in

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:27.000
our books. So now if I disconnect the iPad
here [pause] we can see the iBooks icon, which

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.640
is now installed by default on your, uh, on
your iPad. Click that iBooks icon: it's going

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.970
to bring up our bookshelf. Sometimes it's
not going to be there, as just happened, which

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.750
means I need to change a setting here, so
I'm going to click "collections" at the top,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.140
I'm going to tell it to select PDFs because
it's a PDF I had sync, and we can see the

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:01.379
icon now. That's the book. SO double tap that
and it's going to open the book for us. There

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:12.110
we go. You can scroll through. Use that however
you want, perhaps enlarge it to read the fine

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.159
print. There we go.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:21.150
