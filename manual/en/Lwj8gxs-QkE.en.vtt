00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.660
Don't tighten the tie that much. 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.419
Turn this end over. 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.080
There it goes...OK. 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.000
Put it into the loop. 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.100
The 7 grader's first tie is going to be knotted in a couple of minutes.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.140
On the tie one can see the marks of Saint Basil Gymnasium.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.120
That is where Matvey is hurrying. The festivity begins within 30 minutes. 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.279
First and foremost the school is the school of life. It is much more than maths and biology. 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.320
It's about socializing children.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.960
Spiritual education is the school of life, it is about shaping people's life stances.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.920
For the first 3 years Matvey studied at a traditional school. 4 years ago he changed the school.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840
So he does have something to compare with.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.200
Orthodox education in the Gymnasium is primarily about like-minded group of people.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.760
All the guys are orthodox, they are nice. 

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:01.059
I like having new subjects such as Scripture knowledge.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.519
I like having new subjects such as Scripture knowledge. 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.239
Trusting in God is believing in salvation. 

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.239
I don't know what my life would be like if God wasn't there.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.399
At a traditional school the 1st of September starts with a celebratory assembly.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.920
In Saint Basil Gymnasium they do a prayer service outside. 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.280
God's grace!

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.240
Very soon the Gymnasium will have their own cathedral in the name of the patron Saint Basil.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.439
It is being build already, and the consecration is set on January, 14, on Saint Basil Day.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.579
And the bells first rang here back then, in August.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.340
I might say that Gymnasium's leavers are orthodox and patriots.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.340
I think if they are taught to be patriots, if they trust in God,

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:12.599
they will make much more for the future of Russia

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:20.000
as opposed to the children whose only goal is just good exam results.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.039
Character building is much more important than education

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:25.039
and this is what our school is all about.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.680
The guests during the celebratory assembly said

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.360
Gymnasium really wanted to resurrect the customs of the Tsarskoe Selo Lyceum

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.860
from which Pushkin, Saltykov-Schedrin and Gorchakov graduated.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.340
Saint Basil Gymnasium may be one of few schools who have very ambitious tasks.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.620
I mean shaping future elites

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:55.879
Last year we talked about national symbols of Russia. 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.039
Which symbol do you see on the blackboard?

00:02:59.039 --> 00:03:01.459
The Russian Flag!

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.860
Creating a Gymnasium, nowadays and at all times, is a spiritual and intellectual heroic deed. 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:17.680
There is nothing more important than educating and character building, if they go hand in hand.

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.439
Thank goodness, this Gymnasium are aware of this concept and

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:23.879
this understanding is their core.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.659
Eight years ago I was at death's door, dying of cancer.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.400
Before the surgical operation I went to a cathedral, shrove and took communion.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.980
The operation went well

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:46.139
and my doctor said I was his fourth patient who had survived, over 25 years of his career.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.400
I realized God wanted me to live to make this Gymnasium happen.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.680
That is why, the last seven years the Gymnasium has been my everything, 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.280
it is the most important thing in my life. 

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.699
The Gymnasium gives us hope for resurrection of Russia.
