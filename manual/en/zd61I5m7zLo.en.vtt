00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.490
the biggest news story of today is
actually comes from the d_c_ yes

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.110
college football's decided

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.669
there will be a playoffs

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.069
thanks scott

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.509
finally yes

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:13.929
okay

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.419
i think is a story that's interesting
outside of the contents of sports

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:18.570
because it's m

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.689
me sick

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.100
how long it'll take people to realize

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.990
the most

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.220
obviously

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.140
envelope all

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.130
now is not because they're stupid

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.659
is because once you've got people making
money in a certain way

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.600
they're gonna fight change

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.670
with every fiber of their b

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.410
so in a gun in thirty five million
dollars from the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.010
uh... bowl system

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.150
so

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.050
then you don't

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.690
motorists to me and i'm less if you
don't know this is the name of everybody

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.440
knows

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.489
if you had a playoffs and football more
people were watch

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.840
and ultimately it make more money

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.740
the whole system would make more money

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.679
with the fiesta bowl make more money
maybe maybe not

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.260
would university brass can make more
money maybe maybe not

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.030
you know the same colleges in the same
system make as much money maybe not

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.990
so although the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.630
are like my my argument

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.369
so finally they were convinced they
might think twice as much money

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.860
the video playoff system

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.310
so will start in the year twenty forty

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.280
thanks god

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.380
finally some

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.850
degree of logic in in college football

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.850
antarctica also less poor than also says
it's a relinquished the relinquishing

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.730
some control because there was someone
else who was a sock would go into the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.730
talking about how he still doesn't like
this roses in because

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.090
uh... you know we stopped at this
playoff system and the people who would

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.579
bold in his long with us to do that's
computer

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.329
but vote in the teens and force a play
they're like i have the power to do

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.490
whatever we wana

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.670
doing really was the power or the money

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.289
sonar that's the plan dot and the
captions

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.050
of these two teams are like seeing on
you

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.670
says that the witness

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.009
yet and they make compromises to have
those fourteen serpent

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.330
so they're suddenly give preferences to
the big conferences in this live in a

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.039
polled the pull and make sure that
nobody's feelings are hurt

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.520
much more poorly there wasn't hurt and
then

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.550
you're finally any of those forty years
of my guess is because they don't have

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.870
power eva boise state is like twenty
eight in our somehow they'll be team

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.940
number five

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.660
and won't make the playoffs for the
first three years you know how that goes

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.459
right

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.190
and eventually it'll

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.299
pixel self got a job but

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:27.699
uh... overall look if you're a sports
fan easier by college football

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.239
here's what i would say about uh...
playoffs incomparable

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.569
can't wait

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.609
i mean i don't even care that much about
college football you put a plastic

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:38.099
character that is wrong

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.989
here's a_b_c_'s they have only fourteen

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.480
sixteen teams maybe one day they'll make
more money to get there

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.129
webpage previously marked

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.279
eighties

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:49.649
pay teams is berle's don't

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:56.649
basse-bolle gets it but like plates big
gains in college football there'd be

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:58.719
nobody left to live

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.899
advocate it needs is fine

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:01.769
that's ok gotta go to
