00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.710
Welcome to Illuminati Silver – we tell you
the truth about silver.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:31.369
Today is Wednesday 29th July 2015 and we have
produced this video to ask our loyal listeners

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.670
if they would like us to reveal whom we believe
to be the Silver and Gold ‘pumpers’ and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.019
what it is that they have said previously
– in effect creating an ‘info-war’ on

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:52.650
the pumpers of precious metals?
Now when we began this channel, it was for

00:00:52.650 --> 00:01:00.370
the sole purpose of discussing issues surrounding
precious metals, with an emphasis on Silver.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.280
One of our recent videos mildly criticised
the actions of Mike Maloney, and such has

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.200
been the vicious backlash and vitriol from
a small number of people, it has led us to

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:24.760
believe that we may be on to something and
our suspicions have been aroused. After all,

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:34.470
whilst no-one likes criticism, ours was very
mild – so why the energetic attacking response

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:44.159
adopted? Well this has led us to research
further and this is what we have found.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.170
If you look on You Tube, around 90% of the
Precious Metal videos are produced in favour

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:59.160
of buying gold and silver almost regardless
of the current price. Within that, there are

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.440
perhaps a dozen channels that interview the
same people between them – who constantly

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:13.710
‘pump up’ the need to buy gold and silver.
The message from these people is almost the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.939
same. Only on a very rare occasion have we
found an interviewee slightly arguing with

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:26.980
the premise put forward by that channel. Then
we discover that in the majority of cases,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.610
the interviewees either trade in precious
metals, write newsletters for the industry,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:40.840
or work for bullion dealers. Further a number
of the channels are sponsored by, or actually

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.990
owned by Precious Metal Companies.
So we wondered, whether there is an appetite

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:57.300
amongst our listeners for us to comment upon
whom we think are guilty of the ‘pumping

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.980
charge’.
Rest assured, our intention is not to offend

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.390
nor is it to create a negative environment.
However, such a series of videos, may at least

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:16.180
address this 90% ‘pumping balance’ and
perhaps alert new listeners and people considering

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:24.450
buying precious metals as to the ‘propaganda’
that belies this most noble of ‘collecting’

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.190
activities.
This will entail a lot of work on our part,

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.730
and we only wish to undertake it, if there
is a desire for it. So please comment and

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.340
let us know. We will then make a judgement
based on the responses we receive.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.940
Whether the answer is a ‘yes or no’ a
thumb up would still be appreciated.
