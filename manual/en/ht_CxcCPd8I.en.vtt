00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.180
&gt;&gt;Bulik: So here's another huge myth--that
eating disorders are a choice.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.590
I think this is perhaps the most damaging
one that our patients have had to deal with.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.160
We still see this when patients go to the
emergency room and they get triaged really

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.050
far down the priority list because the physician
thinks that somehow they chose to have a ruptured

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.470
esophagus or they chose to have electrolyte
imbalance.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.230
We're going to bust it now.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.280
One of the reasons that I think this myth
has really stuck with anorexia nervosa, perhaps

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.670
more than other psychiatric disorders, is
what I call the tyranny of face validity.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.910
People see this all the time in People magazine.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.550
They see the Calvin Klein ads, they see Twiggy
back in the sixties, or they see the models,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.890
and they may make an association between the
cultural thin ideal and what they imagine

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.979
to be anorexia nervosa.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
What they don't see is the difference between
these two pictures.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.690
This would never be on the front of People
magazine because that has nothing to do with

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.030
the cultural thin ideal.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.500
If you ask our patients if something like
People magazine or models was what put them

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.270
on the path to develop anorexia nervosa, the
vast majority of them say no.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.640
There might have been a role in the very beginning
that made them think “I'm going to go on

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.920
that first diet.”

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.080
But the minute they go on that first diet,
their anomalous biology kicks in and anorexia

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.490
nervosa just sends them down a path that they
have no control over.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.910
So eating disorders are illnesses not choices.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.410
