ANITA TRENWITH: I love keeping students
guessing.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.920
They expect one result
and get something completely different

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.280
and then seeing them actually work out
why they got that different result -

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.400
that's something
that I find really rewarding.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.040
I've always had
an innate desire to teach.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.960
Even as a child, if I learnt something,
I would teach it to someone else.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.600
I've always loved science

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.640
but I couldn't see myself working
in a laboratory environment

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.960
and so it was a logical progression
to combine my passion for science

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.520
with my desire to teach.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.320
Salisbury High School
is a Northern Suburbs school.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.880
We have just under 1,000 students.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.800
My classrooms are usually noisy

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000
because I encourage students
to talk to each other.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.920
Sometimes they might be a bit worried
about asking me a question

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920
in front of everybody but
they'll quite happily ask their peers.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.880
I like my classrooms to be active
and having students out of their chairs

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.840
and getting involved with science.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.400
We have approximately 50 students
in the Special Education Unit

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.400
and they have a mixture of disabilities

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.280
such as intellectual disabilities,
physical disabilities.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.920
We have autistic students,
students with Down syndrome.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.200
So we've got a real mixture
within that group.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.560
I think they need to be given
the same opportunities

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.000
as mainstream students,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.080
so that they can learn about
the wonders of science.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.920
Agriculture came about as a subject

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.360
that was driven by
a student desire to be outdoors.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
We work with horses,
we learn about cropping.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.600
We also look at some studies
on sheep and cattle

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.480
and some farming livestock.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.600
Last year, Agriculture was a trial class
and it was so successful,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.680
this year when we ran it,
we had 86% of the students

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.720
choosing Agriculture
as their first choice.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:59.080
My ideal future for the Agriculture
subject is to actually see some students

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.000
getting their skills in fencing
and in tractor-driving

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.120
and their skills in managing crops
and understanding that to a point

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.960
where they can actually get
seasonal work and employment

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.000
as jillaroos, jackaroos,
working on farms.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.200
We have students
who've been running science shows.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.840
We've also had students presenting

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.240
at a number
of school holiday care sessions.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.200
So, science has evolved from being
just within our own classroom

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.400
to actually being out in the community
a lot more in Special Education.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.560
I love teaching.
I'll always want to be in a classroom.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.360
But one of the things
I'm very passionate about, personally,

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.160
is working with Early Career teachers
to ensure that Science teachers

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
have the opportunity to develop
their skills to make their science

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.200
as interesting as possible
in their own classroom.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.480
We need to understand
a little bit of science

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.800
to make educated decisions about things
that are happening in our lives.
