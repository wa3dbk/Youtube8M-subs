00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.480
Oh God! We nearly have them!

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
Mr. Dukes, you know what to do.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.180
Aye Aye! Sir!

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.540
Oh yeah....

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.240
Oh yeah!

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.260
Oh yeah!!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.900
Uuuuh!!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.400
Oh!

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.900
Oooh uuuh

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.400
Oh!

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.900
Uh!

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.160
Afix Oars!

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:49.440
Cap'n!

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.040
The fanboys are upset.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.600
They've stopped shovelling money into the console.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.740
I'm sick of this shit!

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.120
My mom's not made of money you know.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.800
God!

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.400
Shit!

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.900
Fuck!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.400
Dammit!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.040
Give 'em Destiny 2!

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.080
Give 'em anything!

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.080
Give 'em another Halo game!

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.180
Who gives a shit!?

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.180
But captain it's not ready...

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.670
They can't tell the difference!

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.700
No...

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.200
No!

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.720
Ah!

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.600
Let me stay!

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.340
I only taste 720p.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.900
it's okay, but...

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.840
Oh Gosh! This needs a patch if I've ever tasted one!

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.100
When did our fanboys become so cynical?

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.100
And hard to please?

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.620
(Cheering)

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.829
We'll  have fresh, less cunty fanboys soon
enough cap'n

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.780
Engage the slanted bastards!

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.240
Standby for Titanfall.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.520
(Fanboys screaming)

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.640
Deploy net!

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.700
(Sounds of violence)

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.760
Sir... they're...

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.840
killing each other...

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.620
It's okay Mr. Dukes.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.880
The strong shovel money faster.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.240
Let nature take its course.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.700
Just wait until I get my hands on them!

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.730
Row faster! Row faster you filthy slut!

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.200
You're fuckin' Bowser and probably fuck that monkey too!

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.560
(Screeching)

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.600
Uh... Dude...

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.650
Mobile gaming! Run away man!

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.480
Ruuuuuun!

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.160
Mr. Dukes!

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.580
Get the men in order!

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.480
Every Xbox for themselves!

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.940
And that's how the consoles died...

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.140
What!?

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.980
But mobile gaming's fucking gay!

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.580
I know, I know.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.480
Muffin' tops. Heh.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.660
Mmmm...

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.340
Uuuuh...

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.380
Had the consoles united...

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.660
perhaps things would've been different.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.780
But ultimately...

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.460
(Sexual groans)

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.400
Well, what happened on the other ship?

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:13.140
Well...

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.920
Click on my penis to find out!

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.579
Go ahead... give it a nice hard click.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.520
That's right, I tell ya, it's full of content!
