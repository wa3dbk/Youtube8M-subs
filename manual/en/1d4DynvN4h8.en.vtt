(natural sound)

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.400
We were working with Nourish International

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.620
which is a student group here on campus. And we went to Peru for six weeks

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.720
to build a clean water system. So, basically throughout the year we

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.930
raised money through various ventures. All the money we raised went 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.110
toward building materials for the actual pipeline and for the resevoir itself.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.270
Peru has a lot of geographic variability and we were in an area

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.320
right above the sugar cane valleys and it was in the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.410
rocky mountains, like the beginnings of the Andes. It was a really beautiful area.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.500
M.O.C.H.E is the non-profit organization that we

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.660
worked with and M.O.C.H.E. is an archealogical organization.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.820
Founder Brian Billman figured that most

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.010
archealogical sites are in areas where people are impoverished

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.210
and don't have some of the basic needs. So he started doing these sustainability

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.260
projects and helping out the cities down there. In return they've been very

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.350
open with helping him out with the archealogical stuff.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.450
(water) I talked to one of the locals and he told me

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.550
it's been a twenty-five year battle trying to get some type of water access

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.690
available to the town of Cerro Blanco. These people need

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.820
water because a lot of them will go to the canals to get water

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.010
No one should be drinking that water and I don't want to see anyone drinking that water.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.210
(music) The first thing we needed to do was make the clearing

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.300
where the resevoir was going to be. So we had to, literally,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.380
dig into the mountain and that took about two

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.470
to three weeks. We had to use pick axes and shovels.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.580
After we did that the next step was laying the cement.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.720
The last two weeks were spent putting the rebar together

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.840
and laying the foundation. And we got to the point where we finished

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.020
the foundation of the resevoir. Just being able to see

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.210
how happy some of the older men in the community were

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.300
to actually be able to work on the project and seeing it finally go through

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.340
was amazing. I'm an anthropology major

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.420
and I have always loved learning about other cultures

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.510
and I've always wanted to go see how other people live. So this was a wonderful

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.680
experience for me. On the weekends sometimes we went to see archealogical sites.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.850
There are little forts in the mountains near Cerro Blanco.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.060
You could see clearly walls and crumbling ruins

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.250
of old Moche forts. Some of the place we went were Huaca de la Luna

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.280
Huaca del Sol. Obviously we saw Machu Picchu

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.370
but the was at the end of the trip. That was the big climax.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.450
It's an amzing place to go as an anthropologist because

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.540
there's so much history there. And there's also alot of problems

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.670
with archealogy that I got to see.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.820
The class I'm in right now, we

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.010
talk about these issues and we even talk about Peru and how looting

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.140
and all these issues effect how archealogists have to interact with local

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.310
populations and it was really awesome to see what I learned in the classroom

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.330
being implemented. (natural sound)

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.500
I'm an environmental policy

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.590
and management major. Access to clean water is something my professors

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.680
had always talked about. It wasn't something I had actually seen first hand.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.810
I didn't really have much experience with the issue. I really didn't know how

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.960
it was going to impact me until about half way through, until I came back

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.130
But I can say that it has now. I've taken more interest in international service

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.300
and issues effecting developing countries and

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.340
this summer I'm actually going to return to Peru.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.370
I really believe in the mission of

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.440
Nourish International. We work with communities in order to find something that's

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.520
going to be sustainable and work for them. Something that they thought of, something that

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.580
we can help them with. Something that they believe, have their own intution and hard work,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.660
is going to work. At Ohio State there's tons of organizations.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.730
I think it's close to a thousand student organizations. And that's one of the great things about Ohio 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.820
State is that there's so many people here, with fifty thousand staudents

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.920
here you can find a few people to have your interests. And with

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.070
a mission as great as Nourish International; sustainability projects, international

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.250
service, helping people. You're going to find tons of people who want

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.440
to help out, not only here, but also abroad. So, it was very easy for us to

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.729
find a bunch of members and now our group is going really strong.
