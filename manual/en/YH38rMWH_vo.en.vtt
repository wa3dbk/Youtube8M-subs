00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.172
It is important for the man of God to be filled 
with the Holy Spirit

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:11.770
and he gets filled with the Holy Spirit when he prays in tongues

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.248
That is why it is important for us to pray in tongues

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:21.855
The Holy Spirit of God that He has given into the
 Spirit filled believer

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:28.328
gives utterances to that person, to pray unto God,
mysteries

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:36.803
things that he does not understand, but the Spirit of God
prays in and through us, according to the will of God

00:00:36.803 --> 00:00:45.545
We read in 1 Corinthians 14:2, Paul writes:

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:57.900
For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but
to God; for no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks
 mysteries.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:01:01.928
he does not understand what he is speaking, because
God gives him utterance

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:09.302
his mind is unfruitful, he does not rightly know what to pray
so he is not praying with his mind

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:18.244
he is praying with his spirit, he is uttering that which the 
Spirit of God gives inside of him, to pray through His Spirit

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:28.311
Paul writes in verse 1 Cor.14:15: "What is the outcome then? 
I shall pray with the spirit and I shall pray with the mind also; "

00:01:28.355 --> 00:01:36.296
When we pray with the Spirit of God, then His Spirit prays 
through us, according to the will of God

00:01:36.296 --> 00:01:44.838
We do not know what the will of God is, but when we allow 
the Spirit of God to give us utterance

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:51.578
then we come in unison with the Spirit of God and we 
pray according to the will of God

00:01:51.578 --> 00:02:04.924
We read in Romans 8:26, Paul writes: "In the same way the
Spirit also helps our weakness; for we do not know how
 to pray as we should, 

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:13.333
but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings
too deep for words;

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:24.611
and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of
the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according 
to the will of God."

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:32.719
The Holy Spirit that lives inside of the Spirit filled believer
KNOWS what the will of God is

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:43.329
and because we pray together with the Spirit of God,
His Spirit in us prays according to the will of God

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:49.936
Now, we do not know what the mind of God is
unless it is revealed to us

00:02:49.936 --> 00:03:01.348
so, when we pray in the Spirit, then the Holy Spirit imparts, 
reveals unto us the will of God

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:13.460
He inspires us to do the will of God and that is how Holy men,
men of God are MOVED by the Spirit of God
to do the will of God

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:19.366
Jesus said: "Without Me you can do nothing"
Our mind cannot please God

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.680
we don't know what the plan of God is

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.209
but when we pray in the Spirit
and our spirit becomes one with the Spirit of God

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.470
He imparts unto us the mind of Christ

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.816
and we can do the works of Christ

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.686
without Jesus we can do nothing

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.322
we must be led by the Spirit of God

00:03:42.322 --> 00:03:45.658
and that is why you must pray in tongues

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:51.164
it is so that your spirit can come into unison with the 
Spirit of God

00:03:51.164 --> 00:03:57.671
and He can inpart to you the unction of 
the Spirit

00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.730
and you can be led by the Spirit

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.545
Those who are led by the Spirit of God, they are
the sons of God

00:04:05.545 --> 00:04:11.510
You cannot do the will of God unless
you have received revelation from Him.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.820
That is why you have got to pray IN THE SPIRIT

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:19.250
that is why you need the Holy Spirit
that's why you need to pray in tongues

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.496
so that He can impart to you, His will

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:27.534
you are edified and built up WITH the mind of Christ

00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:31.738
so that you can be mobilized
to do the will of God

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:35.875
That is why it is important to pray in tongues

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.345
May Jesus bless you
