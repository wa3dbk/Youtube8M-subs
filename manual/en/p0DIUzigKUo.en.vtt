00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.400
I've had a totally
sleepless night.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.350
I didn't sleep a wink.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.700
You can't believe what a noise
those frogs make.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.300
What could such a little
froggy do, you might think.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.150
But there's …

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.100
… tons of them!

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.150
And they croak all night.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.000
So you can't sleep.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.900
I tried to count sheep,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.100
you know, to …

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.650
But even sheep started to croak!

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.500
It drives you mad,
I tell you.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.150
From when?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.000
Since those on the pyramid
have begun to strike.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.350
No, no, no.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.650
Ah, they don't demand
a wage rise.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.950
They want to go!

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.350
Back home!

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.700
That God commanded
them so.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.950
Even seasonal workers aren't
what they used to be sometimes.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.400
And those two spokesmen
of them.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.250
I don't know, are they of
labour union, or what?

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.800
They always come
with staffs and poles,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.950
so that I'm even
a little afraid of them.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.600
M … Moses and …

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.850
A … ar …

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.050
A … Aaron?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.750
What do I know?!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.550
But, no, I'm not going
to release them.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.800
I'm not crazy.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.550
They are not so cheap.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.000
But I'm all bitten.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.350
From mosquitoes.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.100
So it itches.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.300
And I'm allergic.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.550
No, it doesn't just itch.
It burns like hell.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.400
And I'm thirsty.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.000
I'd like water.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.250
I would give half of the firm
for a glass of water.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.700
I've been drinking Bloody Mary
for the whole week.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.050
Yes, Bloody Mary.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.300
It was great at the beginning,
but when you've been drunk

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.400
for three days,
you have a little headache.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.400
I'd like water.
Just water.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.250
Non-carbonated.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.400
And now flies?

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.250
That's unreal!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.600
Plague on you!!!
