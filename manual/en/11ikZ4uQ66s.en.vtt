00:00:04.897 --> 00:00:05.730
Stanford University.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.040
You have ahead of you the most
exciting part of your lives.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.820
You're about to leave
this place and take

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.300
a leap into the unknown.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.130
This is the time in
your lives to gamble.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.660
This is the time to make a big
bet and see if it pays off.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.650
An inspired guess can
be far more valuable

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.310
than years of toil.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.457
All of you have to decide what
your adventure is going to be.

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:40.100
You have to figure out
where the train of history

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.750
is heading next, and
where you can get on it.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.660
And if you can do
that-- if you can

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.790
guess the train's
next station-- I

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.060
guarantee you will
be successful.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.310
The journalists here
will know where to go.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.100
The entrepreneurs will
know where to invest.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.850
The artists will know
what to comment on.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.700
The scientists will
know what to invent.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.620
So truly, go somewhere
quiet and think

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.340
about these big questions.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.980
And then, when you've decided
where the train is heading,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.030
get moving and get on board.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.820
Technology is wonderful
and powerful and efficient.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.800
But there's no app
for inspiration.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.900
Don't let a four-inch
screen narrow your vision.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.050
Open your eyes wide enough to
let the entire world come in.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.830
Thank you, Class of 2015.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.890
You have so much
to look forward to.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.070
Today, I hope you leave here
with a deep appreciation

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.400
of your time at Stanford,
and a strong commitment

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.150
to put your education, energy,
and enthusiasm to good use,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.130
to make this a better world
for yourselves and succeeding

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.110
generations.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.470
And I hope that you always
remember that first time you

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.260
walked up Palm Drive, and
will cherish the friends

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.600
and memories you've
made during your years

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.090
at this special place between
the foothills and the bay.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.020
Congratulations,
and best wishes.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.020
