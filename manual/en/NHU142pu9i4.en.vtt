00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.849
This K&amp;N air intake system is designed to
increase vehicle power and acceleration by

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.470

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:30.529
The 77-3023KP air intake system is not legal
for highway use in California or other states

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.230
adopting California emission standards.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.600

Actual results will vary depending on the
condition of the vehicle, mileage, weather

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.900
and other variables.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.259
With the air intake installed, we ran the
vehicle on the dyno to test the sound comparison

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:50.890
verses the stock intake.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.409
The intake kit includes components that have
been designed or matched to the needs of these

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.030
vehicles to produce a safe horsepower increase.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.590
Detailed installation and instructions are
included with this kit.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.079

Loosen the hose clamps at the throttle body
and at the mass air sensor.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.920
Unclip the radiator hose from the intake tube.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.810
Disconnect the stock intake tube from the
mass air sensor and from the throttle body,

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.740
then remove the intake tube.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.530
Pull firmly upwards to remove the air cleaner
assembly.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.550
Loosen the hose clamp on the air cleaner,
then remove the mass air sensor.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.240
Remove the two stock air cleaner support tray
bolts.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.960
Install the rubber mounted studs and tighten
firmly.
