Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today on the 
 show, I am going to show you a really quick

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:10.008
simple salad presentation that will give an extra spin 
 and kick so people won't be like

00:00:05.155 --> 00:00:10.008
simple salad presentation that will give an extra spin 
 and kick so people won't be like

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.164
ah boring salad. They will be like oh this 
 is a cute little salad. Here we go.

00:00:14.164 --> 00:00:19.713
Iceberg Salad Wedge.

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:23.104
When I said this was simple. I really meant that this was really simple.

00:00:19.713 --> 00:00:23.104
When I said this was simple. I really meant that this was really simple.

00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:28.328
You are going to start off with a head of lettuce and 
 if you do not have one of these lettuce cutting knives,

00:00:23.104 --> 00:00:27.817
You are going to start off with a head of lettuce and 
 if you do not have one of these lettuce cutting knives,

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.731
especially if you are just going to cut part and save the rest,

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:36.455
it is really good to avoid having those dead ends 
 and brown or purple markings on your lettuce.

00:00:36.455 --> 00:00:41.958
We are going to use the knife to cut the stomp of the lettuce 
 off, then we are going to turn it to that flat side,

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:45.312
and quarter it. Meaning cut it once down the middle

00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:49.249
and then cut it in the opposite direction so you have four equal parts.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.429
Turn those four equal parts to their flattest side 
 and now we are going to season them.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.773
I am going to leave them all on one tray, but 
 if you want to go ahead and move them 

00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:58.282
to their plates at this point, you can.

00:00:58.282 --> 00:01:02.362
I am going to drizzle them all with a thousand island dressing form organicville,

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.991
it is vegan, but if you want to 
 use a homemade thousand island dressing 

00:01:05.991 --> 00:01:07.709
I have a video for that.

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.588
You can find it in the annotation or down below.

00:01:10.588 --> 00:01:16.509
And along with salad dressing, you can season with 
 salt, pepper, onion, garlic, whatever you want,

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.213
even vegan bacon bits. I have a recipe for that too.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:24.102
But we are just going to keep it 
 simple today with our salad dressing. 

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:25.310
Now let's taste it. 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.141
Now I am not a fan of Iceberg lettuce, almost at all.

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:33.181
But I would eat a cardboard box with Thousand Island Dressing on it. 

00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:38.731
I am a fan of thousand island dressing, italian dressing, balsamic vinegar, creamy ranch,

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.870
I am a fan of all the dressings, as long as they are vegan.

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:46.740
But we have to watch how much dressing we put 
 on things, because you can take a healthy salad

00:01:46.742 --> 00:01:50.020
that taste so boring and plain, like iceberg lettuce.

00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:56.220
And make it as unhealthy as like a 
 double double bacon cheeseburger, twirl and trouble.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:02:01.460
It will be so good, but it will give you 
 a heart attack. So just be careful, 

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.710
I love this salad because of the dressing 
 and the presentation is so so cute.

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:09.960
So everybody will probably love this as long as they don't 
 mind lettuce and they love salad dressing and 

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:14.580
they love cute presentation and I hope that you love it too. 

00:02:14.583 --> 00:02:18.110
In fact, I am going to eat the whole thing, because I don't 
 waste food, and nobody else is going to help me eat salad.

00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:24.170
Vegan Vegetarian Salad.
