00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.034
- [Voiceover] This video's in two parts because, heck,

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:06.800
I pressed the stop button.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.233
I know, I know, I know.

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:10.833
For those of you wondering

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.833
do I get grief for the rambling videos?

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:16.633
I sure do from the professional video association here,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:21.000
and from my boss, AKA the older folks in my family,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.766
since this is a family business.

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.502
They're like, "Really?

00:00:25.502 --> 00:00:27.766
"Can't you edit it just one time?"

00:00:27.766 --> 00:00:30.833
The answer is, "If I want to miss my flight, yes,"

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:35.366
or, "If you find someone to bill, yes, I'll edit it.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.467
"I'll massage it. I'll audio-sweeten it.

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:39.100
"I'll make sure it's all color-corrected, et cetera,"

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.333
but I'm just happy --

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.967
For all the negative comments,

00:00:43.967 --> 00:00:46.000
the one person that says, "You know what?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.366
"I was bangin' my head against the wall,

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:49.200
really wondering what to buy,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.133
"and I saw your video and it helped,"

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.053
that's worth it for me.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.366
Let's see what I have up here.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:04.200
A bunch of videos that I shot a couple of days ago.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.800
By the way, these things are really good here,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.966
the KB covers.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:12.100
I kinda like them, this silicone overlay.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
This particular one is for Premiere Pro.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.500
Anyways, we're trying to see if we're going to get

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.002
anything here, on the HDMI connector.

00:01:22.002 --> 00:01:24.133
I hit the one on the,

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:27.332
these control the aux out.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:30.966
We're getting a picture,

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.166
but two things.

00:01:32.166 --> 00:01:35.100
One, it looks like its a negative image

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.440
and two, it looks like my extended screen,

00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.166
if I got that right,

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:43.533
I should see this window move.

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.900
Yep, it's the extended screen.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.567
Let's take this Thunderbolt cable

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:50.458
out of the way, here.

00:01:55.688 --> 00:01:58.001
Well, the source is coming in.

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:04.266
Why it's a negative image, I'm not exactly sure.

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:05.800
Let's play with this for--

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.000
Let's see.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.700
We have a few minutes.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.133
I'm going to go into the system preferences, here.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.266
Let's look at Displays,

00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:19.933
and let's try to figure out what's going on.

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:26.054
Here's the other display that's showing up on the ATEM.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.533
We'll mess with the color.

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:39.511
Display color profile, Color LCD.

00:02:41.835 --> 00:02:46.363
Doesn't appear to be anything strange.

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:55.866
Why we're getting this curious mirror image, here

00:02:55.866 --> 00:03:00.300
or this extended image but negative image,

00:03:02.238 --> 00:03:04.889
I'm not certain.

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:11.117
Let's see. Bars look fine.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.534
Let's see.

00:03:21.766 --> 00:03:24.600
That is one for investigation.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.900
Out of the box, worked great with the Skaarhoj device.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.933
It's switching as it's supposed to.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:36.066
We're getting our aux out as we're supposed to.

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:39.133
But for whatever reason, off of this MacBook Pro,

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:43.933
we're getting a negative color image on the HDMI In,

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:46.633
and that very well may just be a setting.

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:48.366
I have not loaded any drivers.

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:49.467
As I said, I wanted to see,

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:54.000
how do these things work out of the box?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.669
That could simply be some driver

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.933
or something I need to put on my system

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.533
or do a firmware update.

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:01.200
We will see.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.925
Stay tuned.
