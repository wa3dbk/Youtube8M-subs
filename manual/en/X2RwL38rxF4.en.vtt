00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.859
We are now introducing

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.560
12 new umbrellas.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.800
Imagine the possibilities.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.600
It all started back in 1968 when we started our journey.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.800
Since then our vast experience has helped us make

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.989
the best light shaping tools in the world.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.220
We are now introducing 12 new high quality umbrellas

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.800
in four sizes, two different shapes and three different fabrics.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.400
The new line of umbrellas consists of 12 models
divided into two types:

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.600
Deep and Shallow

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.400
Both are available in two sizes.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.400
Umbrella Deep as a deeper, more parabolic shape
than the average umbrella.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.070
A deeper shape gives the photographer
better control of the light spread.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.500
Umbrella Shallow is smaller and less parabolic

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.000
which makes it extremely lightweight and portable.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.150
Much effort was put into making both Umbrella Deep and
Umbrella Shallow as reliable and sturdy as possible. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.800
The fabrics have been selected to provide a superior quality
of light through years of heavy duty use

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.150
and the metallic parts have been surface
treated to prevent rust and discoloration.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.080
All umbrellas are delivered in a high quality bag that

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.090
protects the umbrella while stored and during transport.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.220
The optional diffuser is also worth mentioning,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.100
which is simply pulled over the front of the white
or the silver version

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.000
to turn it into a large softbox.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.810
With quality in every detail and worldwide availability

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.600
for both professionals and photo enthusiasts, 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.020
our umbrellas will take you wherever you want to go.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.100
