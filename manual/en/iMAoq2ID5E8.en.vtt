Hey everybody.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.160
This is Jakesteramma with BroCo Gaming and
today we're going to talk about how to get

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.730
yourself a 3DD1.E or better known as Eddie
Oz Kit.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.170
First up here, we're going to be showing you
how to get to CL4P-L3K route that we take.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.160
I'm going to start out at the Fast Travel
in the Lunar Launching Station and make our

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.640
way all the to him.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.820
Now this is one of the fastest routes that
I've found.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.619
If you have a faster route, please let us
know what it is in the comments down below.

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.449
So let's talk about the 3DD1.E or better know
as Eddie Oz Kit.

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.359
This is a Legendary Oz Kit that is pretty
much hands down one of the best Oz Kits in

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.000
the game.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.900
And one of the best things about it is unlike
many other things, you can actually farm for

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900
this item.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.250
But you have to do something very particular.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:55.449
You have to complete the Eradicate Mission
in a very particular way.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.950
When you get to the end of the Eradicate mission,
you're going to have the choice to either

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.360
destroy CL4P-L3K or secure CL4P-L3K.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.780
And you secure him by hitting the little console
and it's going to secure the doors and lock

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.130
him inside.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:17.090
This is the choice that you have to choose
if you want to farm for the 3DD1.E later on.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.979
If you kill CL4P-L3K, you will not be able
to farm.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.250
He will not respawn again.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.760
Also, you'll notice if you secure him in here,
that one of the even better things, you'll

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.649
get a double farm for your money because when
you come back down here, CL4P-L3K will be

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:40.720
down here and he drops the 3DD1.E and you
can also farm Eghood who drops the Blowfly.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.170
Which by the way, is a pretty frickin nice
gun to come back here with and kill CL4P-L3K

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.450
since it's corrosive.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.520
Now if you want to know a little bit more
about the Eddie Oz Kit, just check out this

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.270
video of ours that we posted before where
Kitch3nWench goes through exactly what the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.790
Eddie Oz Kit does.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.750
Now it's a First Look and there hasn't been
much that has changed since we did that video.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.400
Just note that the only thing that we're off
on is that the red letters of this Oz Kit

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.230
are not a reference to R2D2 like we thought
when we first came across it.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:24.050
It's actually a reference to the ED-E character
in the Far Cry New Vegas, I think, game.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.060
I don't know.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.120
I didn't play it.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.980
So overall, the Eddie Oz Kit is well worth
farming for.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.090
This is something that you're going to want
to keep on you or in your backpack at all

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.370
times pretty much.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.750
