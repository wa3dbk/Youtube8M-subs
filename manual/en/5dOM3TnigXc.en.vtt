00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.940
Good morning.
My name is Dr. Mo and I headed up the healthcare

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.700
team at the National Broadband Plan of the
FCC.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.390
If you remember, in part of the plan, we suggested
that the FCC have a joint workshop with the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.420
FDA to really add some more regulatory transparency
in this convergence of telecommunications

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.180
in medical devices.
Well today, we are having the panel, so as

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.939
you can see around me, the range of vendors
are setting up.

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.450
We've got about 25 very exciting companies
showing their solutions.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.380
We have some very large companies, some start
ups, some classic telecoms companies, we also

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.010
have the classic
healthcare companies.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.960
So there's a real diversity in the types of
things we can see today.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.649
And what's very interesting is that some of
these solutions aim for providers, and some

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.121
of them are aimed at
consumers, so I'm hoping we can have a really

00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:53.960
good idea of what's out there in terms of
innovation.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.350
So, why don't we take a look around and see
what they're showing.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.649
Broadband enables remote diagnostics in healthcare,
that can allow patients in the most isolated

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:14.680
parts of America
to receive care from the very best specialists

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:26.770
thousands of miles away.
Broadband enables remote medical monitoring.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.494
Wireless devices can help diabetes patients
track their glucose levels.

00:01:33.494 --> 00:01:34.494
Or heart disease patients monitor their cardiovascular
data.

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:35.494
Broadband can enable widespread access to
electronic health records, wherever the patient

00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:36.494
may be, and save our
nation more than 500 billion dollars over

00:01:36.494 --> 00:01:37.494
the next 15 years.
When a patient has a change in their heart

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:38.494
rate or rhythm, it automatically triggers
the phone to send the data to

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:40.180
our clinical monitor center.
We've essentially created a virtual hospital.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.370
When there's approximately 400 cardiac technicians
and nurses monitoring patients 24 hours a

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.400
day.
Do you also find better patient compliance

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.520
because this is so much less cumbersome than-?
Absolutely. When you have newer generation

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.640
technology like this, this auto-detects and
auto-sends.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.490
So even if a patient is having a asymptomatic
arythmia, such as a five or six second pause

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.000
in their heart beat,
they won't feel that necessarily all the time.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.610
This device automatically picks that up, it's
based upon an algorithm in the sensor, and

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.400
sends it to us.
The Intel Health Guide, which is our personal

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.690
healthcare device, it's a patient's home now,
it works on a telephone

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.360
line, 3G wireless, or wired broadband.
You can do actual video conferencing with

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.550
patients.
You can see the patients in their home.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.920
We've got a lot of work that went into the
research that went behind developing this,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.720
that was by our ethnographers
so that they could be used easily by patients

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.070
in their homes.
So we've got a lot of different activities

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.700
that go on.
This is through a broadband connection?

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.590
3G wireless and wired are for the video capability.
And patients really love video conferencing.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.270
They like it when you're talking to them,
you know, they put their makeup on and all

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.640
that stuff before you call
them so they look good.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.840
But it actually will hold 30 days worth of
biometric data, also on the device so that

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.360
patients can interact with it.
Which is really good, and what we really want

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.390
to do with all of this is it's not just about
a piece of equipment,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.620
it's really about getting patients to change
the way they function and helping clinicians

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.140
actually change their
model of care so that this type of technology

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.200
fits in with it.
It's the first cellular-enabled glucometer,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.980
also we give back messages to the patient
himself, so a physician

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.070
generated set of messages, so that at point
of care, we're doing what the behavioral scientists

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.590
would say, a
'teaching moment.'

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.590
So we can change the way they behave, tell
them take another unit if it's required, eat

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.600
more if they're blood's too
low...Yeah, well it's more than a teaching

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600
moment.
It's also an intervention moment if needed.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.830
That's right it's also a life-saving moment,
right, right, and an intervention moment,

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.730
exactly.
So we've seen about 25 very interesting companies

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.510
and one of my main frustrations as a physician
is that we

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.780
reactively manage patients once they become
unwell and as you can see many of these technologies

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.310
actually change
that dynamic.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.400
So let's treat them before they even become
unwell.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.950
We're seeing exciting technologies around
diabetes, around heart failure, around a plethora

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.871
of other conditions.
It's been a great start to the day and now

00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.270
we're looking forward to the whole panel sessions,
which are really

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.450
going to delve into the regulatory framework
around this space.
