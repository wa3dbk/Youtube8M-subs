00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:08.460
Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we
are going to finish up the 3rd ring we are

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:19.470
going to take from each side we need 4 more
black beads. I'm going to take 4 more black

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:33.940
beads from the inside. Now we are going to
put it on the 4th bead but we are not goign

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:48.429
to take it out we are going to put it through
the beads till the end. Until it comes and

00:00:48.429 --> 00:01:00.030
from the 4th bead, until the end the ring
on this side. We are going to do the same

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:14.350
thing on the other side, take 4 beads from
the 4th bead, the 4th bead. I'm going to put

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:27.700
it through till the end we are going to go
through the 4th beads on the ring. If you

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.619
can remember we did it the same from the side
that we started from the opposite that we

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:43.560
put the string through the 4 rings. Then it
came out. Now we are putting it from the inside

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:58.659
out, putting it through the last 4 rings.
I'm just going to pull it. Now we have here

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:13.500
4 strings and we are going to pull a little
bit the strings of the black beads that are

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:26.410
around the necklace. We have to do it before
we put the clasp. Once we put it we would

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:47.290
not be able to do it anymore and you are going
to see that it gets around

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:55.110
it. We are almost ready all we have to do
is put the clasp in and close the necklace.
