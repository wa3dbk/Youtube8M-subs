00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.680
From paycheck to paycheck to abundance.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.380
That's going to be the topic for this video
clip.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm very happy to do this for you.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:25.910
If you want to take credit for something,
and it is the credit for making available

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.789
a technology to control karma.

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:38.050
And even transform it, right from the beginning
I have focused on it.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:46.040
Don't get, you know, confused about the concept
of karma, it may belong to some religion.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.850
No, it doesn't belong to any religion.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.840
It is a scientific concept.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.350
It's called the law of causality, like Newton's
laws.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.500
We're talking about reaction.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.330
Karma is simply a reaction to something that
has already taken place.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.600
So, why are many people poor?

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.730
The answer is: It is karma.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.810
So, what is karma, then?

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.130
It's not a metaphysical concept, as I said.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.750
The Buddha himself, who never believed in
God, who never believed in soul,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.909
believed in karma and then, defined karma
very beautifully.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.270
Karma is only a thought process

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.740
that you carry on from one birth to another
birth.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.329
So this paycheck to paycheck is karma that
you have continued from many lifetimes.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.759
And it is a very stubborn karma and it needs
to be changed or transformed.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.670
And you can do that.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.780
So karma is not a philosophy of fatalism.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.990
I don't believe in fatalism at all.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:17.530
Human will is more powerful, even more powerful
than God.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.760
That's how powerful you are.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.540
You can change your life the way you want
to change.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:32.050
But then, as Einstein said, "You cannot find
the solution to a problem

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.500
from the same kind of thinking that created
it."

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.780
It's a very important thing.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.220
I like that saying.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:48.500
So, in order to change your karma you have
to look at different module.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.020
That can allow to change your karma, so you
can think out of the box.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.760
Now you are unable to think out-of-the-box.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.080
Because the moment you think about

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.690
how am I going to make money.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.379
When I'm going to make money, where I'm going
to make money.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.599
All these are very relevant questions.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.410
But the answer is not going to come by asking
these questions of when, where and how.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:25.269
The answers are going to come from by looking
at...again answers for this

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.860
not from the rational mind, but from another
source.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.900
I strongly recommend astrology.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.470
Particularly, vedic astrology.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.319
Because the Western astrology is not sophisticated
enough.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:47.580
That's why the Supreme Court of India, although,
several high courts overthrew the case,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.310
upheld.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.230
The Supreme Court upheld that it is a science.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.379
You should treat on par with biology or computer
science.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:06.569
And give grants to universities and colleges
to open departments of Vedic Astrology.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.349
So, it's a science.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:17.590
So it can tell you when you will have the
money, where you will have it

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.030
and how you will have it.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.530
All these questions will be answered.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.280
That's the reason why I started Astroved.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:34.740
And it's my dream that one day I want to create
a university for Astrology.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.740
There's so much research that needs to be
done.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.780
The literature available is immense.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.280
And they can go on studying it forever.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.790
That's how much literature is there.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.949
So, I want you to take advantage of this.

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:04.680
As a matter of fact, I told my Astroved team
to put together a free on-line program.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.410
So, that anyone can go and find an answer
for this question.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.830
But they said that it would take a few months
for them to write the program.

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.270
But I'm going to stay on top of that to do
this as early as possible.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:35.610
In the meantime, you need to go and seek help
with a live astrologer.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.610
And find out.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:42.639
Otherwise, another way to find out is through
the Nadi astrology.

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.560
It's even better because Nadi astrology is
of divine origin.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:58.539
So once you know what your potentials are,
then, it's easy for you to create.

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.850
It's a matter of knowing.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.300
And that knowingness will give you the strenght,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.910
hope, and direction to go about.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.449
I'll see you next week.
