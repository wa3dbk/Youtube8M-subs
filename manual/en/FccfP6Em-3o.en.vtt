00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.630
INTERVIEWER:
Hi.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.815
Can you tell us your names and
what course you teach?

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:15.168
LERMAN: I'm Steve Lerman.
HARWARD: And I am Judd Harward.

00:00:15.168 --> 00:00:17.142
LERMAN: And we teach course
1.00 which in MIT is

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:20.000
Introduction to computation and
engineering problem solving.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.597
INTERVIEWER:
And can you tell us what are

00:00:22.597 --> 00:00:25.000
the goals of this particular
class?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.954
LERMAN: The course is designed
for students who are not

00:00:27.954 --> 00:00:30.798
majoring in computer science but
need to have a basic

00:00:30.798 --> 00:00:33.533
comprehension of computational
methods and computer

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.722
programming.
So we draw students from all

00:00:35.722 --> 00:00:38.676
the departments of MIT.
Even once in a while a computer

00:00:38.676 --> 00:00:41.739
science major takes the course.
So our goals are to teach

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.420
students about computing,
teach them a programming

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.811
language, and introduce them to
some introductory algorithms in

00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:51.090
several different areas.
INTERVIEWER:

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.000
So what happens on a daily
basis in class?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.613
HARWARD: We used to teach it as
a standard lecture and problem

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:02.227
set course, but we found that
many of the students would delay

00:01:02.227 --> 00:01:05.485
until the night before the
problem set to really come to

00:01:05.485 --> 00:01:08.625
grips with the material,
often in the wee hours of the

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:10.876
morning.
And so, inspired by colleagues

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.838
in physics, we tried to
incorporate active learning

00:01:13.838 --> 00:01:16.682
techniques in the course.
So, in an average week,

00:01:16.682 --> 00:01:20.000
we will have one to two
standard lectures.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.519
But we will also have at least
one session where,

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:27.697
after presenting the material,
we then ask the students to

00:01:27.697 --> 00:01:31.070
work through a problem,
while we are available,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.369
to answer questions.
And the TAs in the course

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.155
circulate, too.
And, in working out the

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:40.454
problem, very often that
involves programming.

00:01:40.454 --> 00:01:45.000
So we have introduced the use
of laptops in class.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.598
INTERVIEWER:
So is a small group type of

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:48.442
structure then?
Or how does the lecture versus

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:50.000
the small group aspect of it
work?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.195
LERMAN: Well,
both those activities take

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.574
place in a lecture style hall
but the students are doing very

00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:57.770
different things.
In lecture, it is very

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.022
traditional.
One of us is in front of the

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:03.231
class for sustained periods of
time teaching the students.

00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.103
In the active learning,
we typically pose a problem.

00:02:06.103 --> 00:02:09.313
And those of you who look at
the Open Courseware site will

00:02:09.313 --> 00:02:11.565
see notes where we switched to
that mode.

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:15.000
And the students are solving
guided problems.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.500
And then Judd and I and our
teaching assistants are

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.300
wandering around the room
looking over people's shoulders

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.750
and helping them get through the
guided exercises.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.349
And then we will talk about
them.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.400
We will reassemble everybody in
more a lecture style to have a

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.750
discussion about what that
assignment was about.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.449
And that might go back and
forth several times within a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.000
course of an active learning
session.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.319
INTERVIEWER:
So how are students assessed in

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.484
this area?
Is it mostly on their coding

00:02:37.484 --> 00:02:38.588
assignments?
Are there also exams and

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:40.000
quizzes?
Or can you say more about that?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.179
HARWARD: There are exams and
quizzes, but nobody programs

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.164
best under pressure.
So the problem sets,

00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:51.641
we feel, are a more reliable
means of assessing the students.

00:02:51.641 --> 00:02:54.925
And, actually,
we think a lot of the learning

00:02:54.925 --> 00:03:00.000
in the course comes from working
through those problem sets.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.921
So, by the end of the course,
we actually combine two problem

00:03:03.921 --> 00:03:07.843
sets over two or three weeks
where we ask the students in the

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:11.372
first problem set to plan a much
more major assignment.

00:03:11.372 --> 00:03:14.509
And we pair them up so they are
working in teams.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:18.431
And then they code their own
design for the final problem set

00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:21.034
of the course.
INTERVIEWER:

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:25.000
And what size teams would they
be working in?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.754
LERMAN: We usually use teams of
two.

00:03:26.754 --> 00:03:29.360
It is always a tradeoff.
Larger teams could do bigger

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.964
projects.
But then the logistics,

00:03:30.964 --> 00:03:33.822
particularly at the end of a
busy semester of the students

00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:36.679
getting together to cooperate,
turn out to be complicated.

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.383
So we have decided on teams of
two.

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:40.438
Occasionally,
we will have a team of three

00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.446
or, in some rare cases someone
will just do the assignment on

00:03:43.446 --> 00:03:46.132
his or her own.
HARWARD: Actually,

00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:49.276
the undergraduates in
management who were taught to

00:03:49.276 --> 00:03:51.981
work in teams,
they sometimes ask to work in

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.000
teams of three because they are
used to it.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.517
INTERVIEWER:
Now, are there any other

00:03:57.517 --> 00:04:01.923
special course elements such as
fieldtrips or guest lecturers or

00:04:01.923 --> 00:04:05.000
anything like that that you
incorporate?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.304
LERMAN: No.
The course is,

00:04:06.304 --> 00:04:08.027
in that sense,
pretty traditional.

00:04:08.027 --> 00:04:10.375
Most of the activities happen
either in class.

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.507
We do have tutorial sessions.
So, in addition to four to five

00:04:13.507 --> 00:04:16.691
hours of in-class time with one
of us, the teaching assistants

00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.196
take small groups,
usually ten to twelve students

00:04:19.196 --> 00:04:22.118
and spend an hour a week in a
much more interactive style

00:04:22.118 --> 00:04:24.728
where they can talk much more
closer to one-on-one.

00:04:24.728 --> 00:04:27.651
And then we all have extensive
office hours where we meet

00:04:27.651 --> 00:04:32.343
individually with students.
HARWARD: If there is a problem

00:04:32.343 --> 00:04:35.625
set that the students
particularly enjoyed,

00:04:35.625 --> 00:04:38.046
sometimes we have a
competition.

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:42.578
We had them program The Game of
Life a couple of years ago,

00:04:42.578 --> 00:04:46.718
and we had a competition to see
who could add the most

00:04:46.718 --> 00:04:50.000
interesting features to the
game.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.523
INTERVIEWER:
Now, is there anything else

00:04:51.523 --> 00:04:53.750
that is sort of unique or
special about the class that you

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.694
haven't talked about so far?
LERMAN: Well,

00:04:55.694 --> 00:04:58.258
we are part of a group of
courses at MIT that are

00:04:58.258 --> 00:05:00.555
experimenting with laptops in
the classroom.

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:03.493
Right now MIT does not have a
laptop requirements so all

00:05:03.493 --> 00:05:06.004
students don't have laptops.
Many do, of course,

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.141
a growing fraction buy them on
their own.

00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.918
So we ask those who have them
to bring them to class.

00:05:10.918 --> 00:05:12.895
We loan students,
who don't have them,

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:14.658
laptops.
And many of the exercises

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:18.023
require using the laptop in the
class, and as well as being used

00:05:18.023 --> 00:05:21.666
outside the class.
INTERVIEWER:

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:25.000
OK.
Any final thoughts?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.228
LERMAN: Well,
one thing to emphasize about

00:05:27.228 --> 00:05:30.597
this course is while right now
we teach it in the Java language

00:05:30.597 --> 00:05:33.152
and the Open Courseware site
reflects the notes,

00:05:33.152 --> 00:05:36.032
we have actually taught it over
time in many different

00:05:36.032 --> 00:05:38.260
languages.
A central element of the course

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.923
is it really isn't about the
programming language.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:44.076
They learn the programming
language, but it is really about

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.304
algorithmic design,
reusable code modules,

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.532
the notion of object-oriented
programming.

00:05:48.532 --> 00:05:51.576
And I personally have taught it
in, I think, four or five

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:55.000
different languages over the
last 25 years.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.839
INTERVIEWER:
OK.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:58.638
Well, thank you very much for
participating in Open

00:05:58.638 --> 00:06:00.654
Courseware.
We really appreciate your

00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:02.053
input.
HARWARD: Thank you.

00:06:02.053 --> 00:06:03.253
LERMAN: Thank you.
