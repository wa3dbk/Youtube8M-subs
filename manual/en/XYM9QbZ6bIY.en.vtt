00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.059
Hello, szevasz everybody!

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.059
This is JÃ³zsef Kitchen.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.620
Today we will make

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.760
pork brain with toast

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.540
For this meal

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.120
we need

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.180
200 gramms of pork brain

00:00:22.986 --> 00:00:24.166
yummie

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.740
original

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.500
It's...

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.584
  194...

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:31.804
95

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.400
gramms

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.580
It's okay.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.300
First of all

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.820
we need

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.820
onions.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.400
 2 units

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.400
We destroy the onions

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.400
 with a sharp knife.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.320
It's dangerous.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.420
Safety.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.060
Don't try this at home.

00:01:13.452 --> 00:01:14.832
We need

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.080
tadaam...

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.040
We need

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.460
mangalica fat.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.380
Original.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.780
One spoon.

00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:47.335
Minimal burn.

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:50.704
We put onion into the fat.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.680
Sounds crazy.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.480
A good onion is like Argentina.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.620
Makes me cry.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.020
Don't forget to turn on the air sucker.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.040
Now

00:02:15.195 --> 00:02:17.195
we cut the brain.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.640
Very nice.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.520
Pork brain, pork brain, what you gonna do,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.080
what you gonna do when I cut you.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.420
Beautiful texture.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.100
Advanced.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.920
The onion is good when it looks glassy.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.300
And now

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.940
we input the brain.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.500
Heat carefully.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.500
Don't stuck on the bottom.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.460
We need

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.880
salt and pepper.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.960
Smells good.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.060
And now

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.060
 we introduce the toaster.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.220
Not easy to find.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.460
The brain is done

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.460
in 7-10 minutes

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.740
It's time for the bread.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.700
Say no

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.700
to the sliced bread!

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.360
And now we toast it.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.100
 More brain!

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.840
Very clever.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.180
Very good.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.780
Goodbye Watchers!
