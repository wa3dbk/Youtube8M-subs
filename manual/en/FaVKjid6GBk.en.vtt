00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:21.940
Well, this is a lovely little island.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.450
Boy, to look at it...you'd never be able to
tell the game that takes place here is a horrific

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.450
bloodbath.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.290
There's palm trees, and turquoise water.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.590
Bodies.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.290
Alright, the bodies kind of put a damper on
things.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.600
Well, let's make the best of it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.780
It's Dead Island: Riptide for the PlayStatiâ€”oh,
sh*t.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.940
Well, no wonder the hotel was so cheap.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.629
I'll tell you what else is cheap.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.970
Games about zombies.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:08.920
They're about a dime a dozen these days, and
what with the economy and...exchange rates.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.990
That's even cheaper than it sounds.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.500
Thing is...Dead Island: Riptide is actually
a bit different.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.500
One, it uses contrast really well...violently
splattering blood and gore all over a tranquil

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.500
island landscape.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:38.810
And two, it somehow manages to make the undead...well,
boring.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.330
Of course, that's not to say this is a bad
game.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.470
Just released for several platforms, Riptide
certainly has its moments.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.420
The game is interesting not only for its design,
which combines a first-person, action RPG

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.220
with a bloody bucketful of survival horror,
but also for its concept.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.630
The zombie apocalypse has finally come, and
you get to spend it...in paradise.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.619
Or at least, what was once thought of as paradise.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:16.470
Turns out, even in death, people like the
beach.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.780
The implication of the premise is actually
pretty disturbing.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.279
You're not lost in some creepy forest or remote
village.

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:28.999
The virus has spread even here, to the furthest
corners of the planet...the last bastion of

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.829
the peace and beauty of old Earth.

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:31.999
It's a cool idea.

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.239
Too bad the game doesn't think so.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.629
Instead, it tells a convoluted story that's
anything but interesting...led by a cast of

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:48.029
stereotypical and wholly unlikable characters.

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:59.080
Fortunately, you can skip the poorly acted
and written cut scenes and jump straight to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080
the gameplay.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.889
Unfortunately, there are problems to report
there, too.

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.409
It's not necessarily the gameplay itself,
though.

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.209
Riptide goes for the "use anything you can"
approach when it comes to combat.

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.569
You can pick up tons of different weapons,
and not only that, you can also upgrade them

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.230
and even modify them.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:23.540
So an old baseball bat can become a...spiked
death ball.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.989
So the core gameplay is really about...scavenging
the island for items and weapons, then using

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.969
them however you can to survive.

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.989
Each character has their own attributes, which
is nice...and you have several skills that

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.229
can be leveled-up, as well.

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.709
And that's awesome stuff.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.609
What's less awesome...is the structure that
gameplay is placed in.

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.400
Which is to say...fetch quest city.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.599
The missions get repetitive real fast, so
unless you're playing co-op, Riptide just

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.749
has a tough time keeping your interest.

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:57.749
I mean, doing favors for strangers just isn't
that much fun...even if it is the zombie apocalypse.

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.320
You know, there's actually a lot to like about
Dead Island.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.769
I love its use of contrast, in setting and
color...and I really love the scavenge-to-survive

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:08.769
design.

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.469
I love fetch quests less, though.

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:17.100
Which means I kind of love Dead Island: Riptide,
but...well, this is one vacation I certainly

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.120
won't be scrapbooking.
