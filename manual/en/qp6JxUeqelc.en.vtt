00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.230
The Appalachian Mountain Club

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.560
operates eight backcountry huts in the White
Mountains open to the public. They're

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.660
located on the Appalachian Trail in
the White Mountain National Forest

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.720
and they are spread one day's hike apart
from each other, starting from Carter

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.270
Notch and going all the way west to Lonesome Lake.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.140
Some huts are more challenging to get
to than others.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.310
Huts like Lonesome Lake and Zealand are

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.950
a little bit shorter

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.910
and easier terrain for familes to get to.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.220
These huts are located in some of the most
beautiful parts of the White Mountains,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.640
ranging from high up in the alpine
zone to down low by waterfalls and lakes.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.100
The hike was so beautiful. There were
wildflowers

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.750
and lots of plants we'd never seen before.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.560
It just felt

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.600
really quite

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.750
magical

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.010
This is a favorite place of mine because you can see right across

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.290
to Franconia Ridge there.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.950
The nice part about the huts is that you don't need to bring a whole lot of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.750
food or pots and pans and a stove for cooking

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.750
because

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.180
meals are offered up at the huts.
Actually we've done the AT from

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.189
Maine down to Fishkill Gap. Maine and New
Hampshire were both fantastic

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.360
but the hut experience made it because

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.130
the meals

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.819
are absolutely sensational. It's something we'll never forget.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.389
A nice bed to sleep in a night. We
backpacked also and this was a lot

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:48.040
easier to prepare for.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.450
We have many educational opportunities

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.210
in the huts.  We have a staff naturalist at each hut.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.210
We have a very popular program called
the Junior Naturalist Program

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.200
which we offer to kids at the huts.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.680
We had to match the

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.460
animal to its habitat.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.970
The croo was great.  The entertainment, the experience

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.970
in itself, you know the the skits they do at night.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.039
AMC huts are all located off the grid.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:28.219
We use solar power and wind power to
meet our electrical needs such as

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:31.129
refrigeration, water pumps, two-way radios.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.599
We also compost food scraps and hike out
trash and recyclables to

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.059
keep as small of an impact as possible.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:45.029
The Appalachian Mountain Club operates
two roadside lodges, Pinkham Notch Visitor Center

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:45.999
and Highland Center

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.439
in Crawford Notch. These lodges
offer meal service,

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.719
private rooms, and hot showers making
them great places to end or begin

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:57.659
your adventures up to the huts.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.409
It's a wonderful time. Take your family

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.819
because it bonds families together. They're having a blast exploring the hut, playing

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.229
in the waterfalls close to the hut.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.939
You meet people from all walks of life and

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.819
from all over the country, and so there's a lot of new friends to meet.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.759
It's an experience you can't do duplicate, and it's even hard to explain

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.489
or comprehend unless you do it.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.200
It's another great way to enjoy life.
