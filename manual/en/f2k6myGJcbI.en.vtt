00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:14.980
Hey there, Drew Canole and I'm grateful you're
watching this video.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.470
To me, habits are everything and they've been
so significant in my life because every single

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.870
thing that I do, every new venture that I
start, every business that I start up, every

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.680
personal regimen that I start in the gym working
out, it all starts with these small habits.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.050
They define our character and who we are so
today, I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.999
habit formation with you and so you can get
some distinctions and build your life around

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.129
these positive habits that you're forming.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.422
Habits are really tough to form, okay?

00:00:48.422 --> 00:00:52.640
And they're tough because our ego wants us
to stay in the place of where we are, it's

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.179
scared, it fights for its survival and as
anytime it sees the self excelling outside

00:00:57.179 --> 00:00:59.949
of who you are, it tries to pull you back.

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.370
So the recognization that it's not you is
huge.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.040
[Inaudible] it is like a roller coaster, right?

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.509
You get on a roller coaster, you start clinking
up, click, click, click, click, click, click,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.310
and it's all easy, but once it starts to get
to that very point your stomach starts to

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.049
grumble like oh, oh, oh here we go, here we
go, and all of the sudden you're at the top,

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:31.729
your stomach drops and then you're going down
the easy free, you're stomach gets used to

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.860
it then you yell and you're like 'Yeah this
is exciting!'

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.990
Same thing with the habit, it can be exciting.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.770
But you have to realize that it takes a little
bit to climb up that coaster.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.500
You know to blast out and [inaudible] with
your rocket, habits take [inaudible] 17-21

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.810
days to form, I figured it out doing a research.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.790
And in the 17-21 day regent, it's always the
hardest time for you.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.170
You come up with the most excuses in why you
don't want to do this.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.689
So in this particular example, let's say the
gym, you don't want to go to the gym today

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.580
because you'd rather sleep in for an extra
half an hour, you [got] some stuff to do with

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.380
the kids and it took your time.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.250
You don't want to eat healthy today because
it takes too much time, and you just get a

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.510
cheeseburger at McDonald's.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.010
Whatever the excuse may be, that's the ego
trying to pull you back from becoming something

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.620
more than you are.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.870
And when you form these positive habits, you
can start to monitor the habit formation by

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.680
simply getting out an excel spreadsheet and
I'm going to give this to you guys as well

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.940
if you haven't [already] received it, but
you can check off every single day and monitor

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.420
your progress in regards to your habits and
when you do this, you start to reward yourself.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.900
Now, let's go ahead like [inaudible], let's
say you miss a day, [inaudible], you stay

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.069
real cognizant of how you feel when you actually
missed that day of checking it off the list,

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.650
you're not probably going to feel real good,
because what you're doing is basically lying

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.459
to yourself about who you are and the commitment
that you've made.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.720
So through time by using this check and balancing
system in this habit formation you're going

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.790
to start to form some lifelong positive habits
that's going to become easier and easier and

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.840
when you see that it's easier and easier and
easier as you go up that coaster then you're

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.909
going to [inaudible] your habits on much larger
things.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.300
You know physical's only one aspect, let's
talk about relationships, emotional, financial,

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.340
spiritual, different habits that you'd like
to form to make an impact not only in your

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.879
life but in the lives of others.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.780
So hopefully this video has been helpful for
you, I know, you know forming habits for myself,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.390

today make you who you are in the future,
