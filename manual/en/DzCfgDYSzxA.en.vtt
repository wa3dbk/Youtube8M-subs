00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.670
So imagine my shock when, at my local used
gaming concern, this showed up.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.040
No particular rhyme or reason, just an import
copy of Pokemon Gold.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.970
Me being me, I couldn’t leave without it.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.760
But as I picked at it over the course of a
couple years, one fact became clear to me:

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.940
If you’re going to import a game... going
with something very familiar and formulaic

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.540
makes things a whole lot easier.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.850
This thing could be in Korean, Croatian, Czech,
or any other language I can’t immediately

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.730
place, and I’d still know, more or less,
which way is up.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
And that’s comforting.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.030
The primary issue between the North American
and Japanese versions of Pokemon has less

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.180
to do with any in-game mechanics, and more
to do with nomenclature.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.220
With only the occasional exception, like Pikachu
or Mew or Celebi, all these pocket monsters

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.750
respond to different names.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.170
Since this is Gold, there’s only 251 Pokemon
to have to deal with, and of those a significant

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.240
number are bilingual.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.640
Things start to get kinda dicey, though, if
you find yourself slogging through a 5th-gen

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.700
title and struggling to remember what a Tekkanin
is, what version it’s from, or what the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.300
bleeding hell you use against it.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.259
Kinda becomes a constant game of “Who’s
That Pokemon.”

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.050
Fortunately, being one of the most popular
franchises in the world comes with benefits,

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.040
as there’s a plethora of information out
there should you brave the wilds of the import

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.069
market.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.370
Being a Game Boy game, you don’t have to
worry about region lockouts and there’s

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:52.320
little to no kanji to have to deal with, making
this a great entry-point into the wider market.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.899
Unfortunately, these earlier versions of the
game tend to be a little bit xenophobic as

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.810
far as international trading is concerned.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.700
While later games would come to celebrate
global exchange of monsters - in fact, creating

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.000
an in-game system for doing so, as well as
a multilingual Pokedex - Generations 1 and

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.459
2 address the data-space of a pokemon differently,
potentially corrupting files or doing damage

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.520
to the cart itself.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.590
And we wouldn’t want that.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.970
Besides, the Masuda Method for breeding shiny
Pokemon from parents of different nationalities

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.340
wasn’t implemented until 4th gen, so aside
from completions sake, you’ve no immediate

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.390
need to do so.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.470
Not like you could get these Pokemon to the
present versions, anyway.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.510
You’d need both a translator AND a time
machine, and a way to read Game Boy games

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.700
on a DS.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.159
Or something like that.
