00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.600
Hello and welcome to the Tuesday Show

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.630
if you're not familiar, my name is Philip DeFranco

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.640
and this show really isn't a show it's just me talking about some

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.650
of the stuff that mattered in the news to me starting with

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.210
marriage has scientifically been proven to suck

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.230
yep, more specifically a new study followed

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.250
10,000 people for 22 years and

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.280
found that woman tend to gain

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.310
a lot of weight after the first two years of marriage

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.350
the Ohio State University study says that it's

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.390
most likely because woman all the sudden get all these

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.460
new responsibilities, like cooking and cleaning

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.500
and sandwich making

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.540
not even considering babies, we're talking about a normal couple

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.550
that's married, doesn't necessarily kid yet

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.570
because you know they want to enjoy their lives

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.590
because no offence to parents who have children

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.600
and love them, you know what's more awesome than that

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.610
jet skis followed by weird

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.640
sex and no one crying in my house

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.660
that's way better, men on the other hand actually get

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.690
a health benefit from marriage, in fact

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.370
men only tend to gain weight after divorce

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.410
main point the only way to guarantee that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.460
you will be forever be pretty is to never get married

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.490
or at least that's what I'm going to tell my girlfriend

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.520
speaking of marriage, we move onto the story of Will Smith

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.550
and Jada Pinkett Smith now getting seperated

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.590
after 13 years of marriage

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.630
and honestly it's kind of shocking, it's one of the biggest

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.060
celebrity split ups since, I don't even know

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.120
many newspapers and bloggers going

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.520
back to old school Will Smith interviews where Will was like: 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.120
or three: that's just some shit you say

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.190
when you're under 10 years of marriage

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270
Pinkett Smith kind of saying the same thing

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.260
in 2009, "understand this there will be no divorce

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.290
I don't care if you're in one bedroom and I'm in another

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.330
but we're going to be under the same roof and we're going to married"

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.380
once again, stupid, why would you do that?

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.380
speaking as a former child of household

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.860
where the two people did like each other

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
worst idea ever, here is a fact about people

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900
and life and relationships, people change

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
whether they go from liking skinny bitches

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.760
to big bitches, going from Christianity to Scientology

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810
or just turning into an asshole, you never know

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.860
how people are going to change if your personality

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.920
will work with them. And obviously if you've ever loved someone

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.980
you want to make it work and I want to kick over

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.050
an old Seinfeld reference and that is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.120
sometimes the only way to knock over a vending machine

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.130
is rock it back and forth a few times

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.140
and from there we move on to an update

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.150
about the late Amy Winehouse

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.160
Amy's family is now saying toxicology reports

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.170
have come back and they are clear

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.190
of all drugs, or rather what they actually said

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.730
was "no illegal substances"

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.760
the tests did indicate that alcohol was in her

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.790
system so that pet theory that her family

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.820
had that she was going through alcohol withdrawl

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870
is null and void, secondly

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.350
it seems that Scotland Yard hasn't even seen these reports

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.360
the information is coming from a family

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.370
that said Amy Winehouse hasn't been on drugs

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.410
in 3 years, and I'm not trying to lessen

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.450
the memory of Amy Winehouse, I believe

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.490
that people should look to drug addicts and go

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.540
"Oh that is a problem that we should handle"

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.580
it's a disgusting thing, it's a terrible thing, but it's something that can

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.620
be stopped, what I'm saying is stop

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.660
lying about it, you can't fix a problem

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.690
unless you address there is a problem

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.710
that is just a fact about life and we move on

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.740
to Libya, yesterday we talked about how Libyan

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.770
rebels had rushed into Tripoli

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.140
tons of people taking to the streets shouting

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.180
"Down with Gaddafi!" then Gaddafi and his regime

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.220
sending out message to the tribes

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.270
requesting help, come back and fight

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.310
for your country, and today there was fighting

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.350
which is to be expected, even if

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.390
10% of the population of Tripoli supports Gaddafi

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.440
Tripoli contains 2,000,000 people

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.000
easy, that's a lot of possible people

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.030
and so Tripoli was filled with gun fire

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.040
and fighting, but then something big happened

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.050
Libyan rebels have now raided

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.110
Gaddafi's compound and there seems to be

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.180
little resistance, but the big thing

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.520
was Gaddafi there? as of yet, no one has comfirmed that he was there

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.530
and if he had any common sense

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.550
or can see anything coming, he wouldn't be there

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.570
and really the big question, how long will the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.570
fighting last if Gaddafi

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.610
was not even standing his ground, does that regime

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.630
have any legs, and it could be on it's way down?

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.670
either way we will keep you updated

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.700
remember the Philip DeFranco Show, Monday to Thurday

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.730
so be sure to check back and we move onto our final story of the day

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.760
and that is the welfare problem in the United States

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.790
a lot of people have recently come out about

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.820
welfare reform, that was about

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.860
15 years too late

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.900
welfare reform of course put through by Bill Clinton

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.520
to boil down what it kind of did

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.560
is the Federal Government took these huge chunks of money

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.010
threw them at the states and said :Hey give your people welfare

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.610
but they're going to be limited to 5 years of welfare

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.620
also if you think that 5 years is too long

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640
you can cut down the amount of time

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.660
that you can help people out on welfare and so many states have

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.680
cutting it down to three years

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.700
Arizona most recently cutting it down to two years

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.720
and I want to preface everything I'm about to say by saying

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.750
I do not have all the answers

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.770
really no one does, welfare is a very complicated situation

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.790
one of the main reasons it is a prolbem

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.810
is 14,000,000 people are currently out of work

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.840
meaning that as of right now, there are 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.860
4 times the amount of people

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.890
that need a job than jobs that are available

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.170
also welfare is thing is that is heavily abused

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.190
the people that do need do not get it enough

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.210
and the people that don't need get it too much, there is a huge

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.240
difference between people that need it and just

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.270
lazy people, problem is there is no real

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.320
way to actually tell the difference

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.360
you have a system, no matter how you change

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:49.870
the numbers, that is going to suck

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.690
my big problems with welfare are

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.710
that I've known families and people from

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.720
those families that have gone out to jobs

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.740
and said in the interviews, "do not hire me"

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.780
I have another two years of my welfare

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
I'm going to run that out, I'm annoyed by people that are 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.840
too proud to have shitty jobs

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.880
when I talked with a lot of you this morning on twitter about

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.920
this a lot of you were like "Yo, my dad

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.960
my grandpa, my mom they worked

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.000
as janitors, they took like the shittiest jobs

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.040
to support us, and that is a real human being

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.100
so the question of the day today to you guys: 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.140
How would you change the welfare system?

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.190
once again, I do not know everything, probably don't even need to say that

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.890
you know that, but I would one: 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.940
make it so that part of the aid or additional aid

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.890
would go to people that want to learn new skills community college

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.600
two: required drug tests for people on welfare

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.650
and then if you wonder "Hey who's going to administer the drug test

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.780
that cost money!" well good hire that person that has no job

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800
to administer drug tests to people that don't have jobs

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.820
if we built roads and monuments to get out of

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.870
World War 2, we would could easily hire

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.910
people to test for drugs now

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.960
that's so sad, but drug test,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.000
if not only just to make sure people have their eye

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.040
on the prize and they're not wasting

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.080
the government's money and a few other things

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.120
but I might save that for a vlog, I'd love to know what you think

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.160
so leave those comments down below

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.270

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.280
but guys that's really everything that mattered to me this Tuesday

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.300

we will give away one the about to be sold out
