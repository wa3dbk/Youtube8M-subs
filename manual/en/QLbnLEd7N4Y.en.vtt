00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.020
This week on Dead Explorer.

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.710
We continue our search for the strange marker
and for the abandoned lookout tower in South

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.850
Austin.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.610
What will I find?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.840
The ghosts of our past.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.510
Forgotten places, people, and history.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.150
Armed with a camera, I am the Dead Explorer.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.340
So this is it.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.640
This is the strange sign like structure that
we saw during our research and it’s really

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.859
hard to describe because it’s a combination
of wooden limbs that are tied together with

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:30.960
barb wire.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.379
Some rod.

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:39.969
Some tin sheets and what looks like an old
old bicycle wheel.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:41.420
I’ll zoom up on that in a second.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.739
God only knows what it is, but it’s definitely
a sign of the settlement that used to live

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.120
here and now I have to think if there was
an abandoned lookout tower near a church in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.489
south Austin, we’re definitely in the right
place.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.049
I just came out from what I believe is the
site of the abandoned lookout tower.

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:00.289
I found some structure.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:02.000
I found some signs of barb wire fence.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.460
I’m going to take the camera in there now
and show you what I found.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.820
This might actually be it.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.640
Let’s check it out.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.790
What you have here.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.460
First, you have a post, like the post we saw
earlier where the farm animals were kept.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.460
It has barb wire.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.660
It’s a post that used to be up, it’s falling
down.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.551
There’s wood with barb wire fallen throughout
this area and then you look up here and you

00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:28.570
have these rocks that look like they used
to be some part of a wall or short rock fence

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.640
and it goes from here, I say about twenty
feet down.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.970
So I don’t know if we actually found our
lookout tower.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.220
We’re running out of park.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.090
We’re running out of light, but this is
a really cool location.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.000
This definitely used to be the wall to something
and we’ll just have to come back some other

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In the meantime, this is Alejandro in Austin.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.710
You can follow me on Twitter @tweetalejandro
and make sure you come back to my channel

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.220
for new videos in the future.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.220
This is Alejandro.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.220
I’ll talk to you later.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.260
Bye.
