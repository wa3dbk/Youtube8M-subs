00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.550
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Hello everyone this is Marjory
Wildcraft,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.740
and today I really have the pleasure of being
with Renee Ainlay.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.740
Renee has an incredible story where she really
has discovered, and lived, and healed herself

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.110
through the basic principle that food is medicine.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.360
Renee you want to tell them a little bit?

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.750
You had, the main thing was kidney stones,
and you have, your kidney does it differently

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.289
from the rest of us.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.050
&gt;&gt; Renee: Right,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.280
in 1992 I was diagnosed with Medullary Sponge
Kidney disease with stones,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.190
and what that means is that when I form my
stones in my kidneys, they would form on the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.280
opposite side as everyone else,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.530
so passing them was very difficult for me.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.870
&gt;&gt; Marjory: So your stones are on the front
of the kidney versus everyone else who produces

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.739
them on the back.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.690
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yeah.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.879
Where you could, you know, for most people,
they'd be big but they'd be able to pass through.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.030
Mine couldn't because there was that tissue
that it had to pass through and it couldn't.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.030
They would had to get broken up by a laser
treatment, what do you call it?

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.570
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Ultrasound?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.530
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yeah, ultrasound.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.260
&gt;&gt; Marjory: And if you hadn't had that ultrasound
treatment eventually your whole kidney would

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.460
have turned to stone?

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.000
&gt;&gt; Renee: Right, yeah.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.360
&gt;&gt; Marjory: And because of the kidney problems
you started getting into the medical system,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.050
and you were on all kinds of medication.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.250
Then you started having other complications,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.250
and you were losing strength, losing physical
ability, getting further, and further, and

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.020
further into a hole of illness.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.220
I mean at one point you were on how many medications?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.250
You were doing liver medications.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.110
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yeah, I was on liver medications,
heart medications, blood pressure medications,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.950
anti-seizure medications, kidney medications.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.490
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Uh huh

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.590
&gt;&gt; Renee: Antibiotics, steroids. Oh my gosh,
so many.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.870
&gt;&gt; Marjory: And then the meningitis.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.120
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yup, then I contracted meningitis
in 2005.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.360
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Wow.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.940
And that was really the point at which you
started to say, look this isn't working.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.520
I've got to find some other alternatives.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.110
I've got to do something different.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.860
You know, clearly the medical system isn't
working for me.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.379
&gt;&gt; Renee: Right.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.920
&gt;&gt; Marjory: And you started, I believe it
was Dr. Mercola and Aajonus and some of these

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.160
other medical health people that have alternatives,
and also promote food as medicine.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.200
&gt;&gt; Renee: Right.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.270
&gt;&gt; Marjory: There was one key thing that really
helped you, and with all the things you had

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.880
going on, but the one thing that really helped
you to dissolve those kidney stones was a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.730
very simple food.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.310
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yup. Coconut cream. (laughs)

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.280
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Coconut cream! I know but we talk
about like ....

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.070
&gt;&gt; Renee: Coconut cream.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.470
&gt;&gt; Marjory: You know.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.090
We usually think of food as medicine as,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.150
"You're going to make me eat something awful
right?"

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.320
And you're like, coconut cream! (laughing)

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.730
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yeah it's wonderful.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.209
&gt;&gt; Marjory: It's wonderful.

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.760
And that, it's really, tell me a little bit
about how that works.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.750
&gt;&gt; Renee: Well, coconut cream is made from
a whole coconuts, and we take the coconut

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.220
meat out and press it, and that's where you
get the coconut cream.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:13.730
And when you eat it, it helps to dissolve
kidney stones. It dissolves calcium, it dissolves

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.660
plaque in arteries.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.270
It does so many wonderful things, but that's
what helped to dissolve my kidney stones.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.380
It makes them really soft, if not dissolve
them completely.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.540
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Wow.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.520
So now you don't have, I mean if they took
an X-ray of you now there'd be no.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.780
&gt;&gt; Renee: No.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.580
&gt;&gt; Marjory: No stones in there.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.580
And you're obviously vibrant and moving around,
and I understand you've lost an incredible

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.319
amount of weight?

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.680
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yes.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.890
Yes, I think about sixty pounds.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:39.360
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Wow.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.830
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yeah.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.130
&gt;&gt; Marjory: From changing your diet, and because
you're moving you're also getting a little

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.090
more exercise.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.020
And Renee has been so passionate about the
healing powers of the coconut cream, and the

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.020
ability of the coconut to really clean the
body as a detoxifier, that it was so obviously

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.120
so beneficial in your life that you've gone
ahead and created a company where,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.060
and this is a very specialized process.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.019
This is not even, it's cooked, it's raw, organic.

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:07.700
&gt;&gt; Renee: Yes.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.430
Yep, raw organic coconut cream.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.950
&gt;&gt; Marjory: And the name of the company is?

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.409
&gt;&gt; Renee: Original Living Coconut.

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.860
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Original Living Coconut.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.980
And your website, if people want to get in
contact with you and talk to you?

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.250
If you have kidney stones, or if you have
somebody in your family who's having problems

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.829
with kidneys.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:28.829
This, Renee is a fantastic source to learn
how one person went through this process and

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.270
managed to reclaim her life through her own
journey.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.100
And your website again is?

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.180
&gt;&gt; Renee: Originallivingcoconut.com

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.030
&gt;&gt; Marjory: And they can contact you there?

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.300
&gt;&gt; Renee: Mm-hmm (affirmative).

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.570
Just contact us.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.210

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.980
I just wanted people to understand that story,
and now of course you grow a lot of your food,

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.630
and you've got chicken and cows for dairy.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.000
And really you, you get it that food is medicine.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.790
You don't need pills and beeping machines
and.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.320
&gt;&gt; Renee: Right. (laughs)

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.610
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Well thanks so much.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:01.449
