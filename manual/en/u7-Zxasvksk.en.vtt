00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.510
Hey guys, it’s Ro!

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.420
Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies!

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.110
Today we are gonna be making something that
I have been getting so many requests for.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.240
I’ve been getting a lot of, hint, Kingdom
Hearts requests for,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.740
Sea Salt Ice Cream Popsicles.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.090
It’s summertime, I thought this was a perfect
fit, so let’s get started!

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.489
The things you will need, will be: 2 cups
of milk, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream,

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.449
1/3 cup of regular sugar, 1 and 1/2 teaspoons
of vanilla extract, 2 eggs,

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.600
some sea salt, you’ll also need 2 food coloring
dyes, ones gonna be royal blue,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.780
and one’s gonna be leaf green. You’ll
also need a mixer, I’m using just a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.449
hand mixer, but you can use a stand mixer,
what ever you’d like.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:01.680
You also need 2 big bowls, oh! Like so, and
some popsicle trays.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.820
Now these trays, you’ll just want a rounded
bottom, anything so it will look

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.549
like the video game. I ordered these ones
online I’ll put a link down below

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.030
so if you want to check ‘em out.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.530
Last but not least, you’ll need some Wooden
popsicle sticks, I found these I think

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.390
at Michaels or something, I’ll try to find
those and put a link too.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.729
OK, let’s put it all together!

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.689
The first thing that you’re gonna do is
we’re gonna take our eggs, and we’re gonna

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.479
separate our egg whites and our egg yolks
into these two bowls.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:34.530
So you’re just gonna take an egg, and put
the egg white into this bowl, let it

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.969
drip out, and then put your egg yolk over
here, boop!

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.939
Now it’s time to mix, the first thing that
we’re gonna mix are our egg whites,

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.310
this will take a few minutes, just wait until
they start to form peaks like a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.189
meringue. And then we’re gonna move over here and we're gonna mix together our sugar and yolks until

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.399
it’s really thick. Once you’ve mixed up
your two egg mixtures, now you’re gonna

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.549
take your 2 cups of milk and we’re gonna
head over to the stove with a

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.109
medium sized saucepan.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.280
Pour your milk into the medium sized saucepan
and slowly bring the milk to a boil,

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.390
on about a medium heat. You’re gonna want
to stir occasionally because milk can burn!

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.300
Remove the milk from the stove and then you’re
gonna pour it into the bowl with

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.380
the sugar and the egg yolks.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.260
Then you’re gonna take your mixer again and mix
it together again until everything is

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.080
evenly combined.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
Now that you’ve mixed this all together,
doo-dew-doo-doo-dew! We are gonna pour

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.800
it back into our medium sized saucepan on
the burner, but this time you’re gonna

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.600
keep it on LOW heat, you do not want it to
boil. You just keep it on the heat,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.460
slowly stirring until it becomes a thick,
like custard.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.860
Once your mixture is like a custard, you’re
gonna take it off of the stove,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.730
and then we’re gonna pour it into our egg
white mixture. Just slowly pour it in.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.030
Then you’re gonna mix it together on a low
speed until everything is combined

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.500
and add some sea salt.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.700
When you’re adding your sea salt, just make
sure it’s a good balance between

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.200
sweet and salty, I do not have an exact measurement
because everybody has a

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.690
different liking, to this, but start small
and then keep adding until it’s that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.190
perfect balance between sweet and salty!

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.220
Do a little taste test, are you salty enough?

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.940
Oh that’s so good!

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:17.620
Oh!

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.520
Uh, a little bit more salt.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.040
Little bit more salt in your game! Salt in
your games!

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.360
OH! Yeah, that’s it! Perfect!

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.600
Now you’re gonna take this mixture and you’re
gonna place it in the refrigerator

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.820
for about 5 minutes to chill, and then we’ll
add our final ingredients!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.260
Once your mixture has cooled from being in the fridge,
we’re gonna add our 1 cup of

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.940
heavy cream… Weeeeeee!!!!

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.640
And some vanilla extract.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.540
Then we’re gonna mix it up one more time
and then add our food coloring.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.850
Now, when you’re adding your food colorings,
what you’re gonna do is

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.320
add 7 drops of blue, 1 drop of green. That’s
the color that I found looks

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.790
closest to the video game.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.320
Now you’re gonna mix it up until your color
is evenly combined, it should

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.100
look like that beautiful blue!

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.210
To make things a little bit easier, I transferred
our popsicle mixture into

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:11.000
this little measuring cup because it has this
little pour spigot.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.850
Then you’re gonna take out your popsicle
molds, and you’re gonna fill them

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.170
up, carefully! Doo-Doo-Dee-Doo-Doo-Doo-Doo!!!

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.880
Leave a little bit of room at the top, because
when we put our sticks in it

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.160
will make the liquid rise a little bit.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.389
Once you’ve filled these molds, you’re
gonna put these in the freezer for 1 hour,

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:32.990
and in 1 hour, this liquid is going to get
a little bit more firm, and that’s

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.409
when we’ll stick in the popsicle sticks.
because they will stay in position.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:41.509
If you put them in before then, they might
lean off to the side, so just put them

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.430
in the freezer for 1 hour, let them get a
little bit more firm, and then

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.699
put in the popsicle sticks!

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.979
Ta-da! Here are the Kingdom Hearts Sea Salt
Ice Cream Popsicles that we made!

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.740
They’re so cute, and perfect for the summertime!

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.700
I couldn’t think of a more perfect treat!

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.879
Yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum-yum!

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.749
Thanks you guys for suggesting it, this was
really fun to make!

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:06.539
I’ll post lots of pictures of these little
creations on Facebook, Tumblr,

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:10.889
Twitter and Instagram, and if you guys make
these, please send me pictures!

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.960
I get a big kick out of seeing your baking
creations, they just make me happy,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.029
they make my day!

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:18.629
Alright, thanks again you guys, bye-bye!

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.720
