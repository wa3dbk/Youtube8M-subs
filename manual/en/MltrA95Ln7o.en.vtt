00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.520
I'm Brian Weatherley, UK jury member
for International Truck of the Year.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.520
For the past 25 years, I've been road
testing heavy trucks, like this Volvo.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.360
I think I'm a fairly good driver
in terms of fuel economy.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.200
But I also know
that you can always be better.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.560
That's why I've come to Volvo
at Warwick to meet Andy Collett:

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.400
Volvo Trucks' driver trainer.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.840
There's no point going out
on the road trying to save fuel,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.920
unless the truck is set up correctly
right at the very start.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.760
Right tyre pressure, right cab gap,

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.400
the cab deflector set right,
and axle and trailer alignment spot on.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.760
What's the first thing we'll do
when we get out on the road?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.080
Your first run,
you'll just drive in position A,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.080
and just do a normal drive
with no instruction.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.600
We'll come back, take the readings.
I'll count the gear changes,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.840
time taken and fuel used.
We'll then repeat the same route.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240
I'll instruct you the second time,
and we'll compare run 1 with run 2.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.360
What's the route going to take in total?

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.800
The route's just over the hour. It's
a good run. It's a 60-kilometre run.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.240
Hopefully, we'll show an improvement
between run 1 and run 2.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.640
What do drivers say
when you show them the figures

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.160
and show the level of improvement?
Are they surprised?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.080
You always get a little bit of:

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.040
'I've been driving for twenty years.
What are you going to teach me?'

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.440
Drivers soon realise that when they
come to Volvo for the driver training,

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.600
they're here to learn
and improve their skills.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.120
Obviously,
you've done some fuel economy driving.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.120
I'm pretty confident we have some new
stuff to show you that will improve you.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.800
You're confident in route 2 I will be
a better, more fuel-efficient driver?

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.200
I'm very confident.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.520
That's the end of round 1.
I don't think I did that badly.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.120
Andy's looking at the fleet data.
He'll tell me just how well I did do.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.760
So, Andy.
End of round 1, how did we do?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.160
We did okay. There are some areas
where we can improve further.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.840
Use of the cruise control. We'll use
the I-Roll function a little bit more.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.320
Maybe a bit of manual intervention,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.120
where we can maybe stop
some unnecessary gear changes,

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.160
and maybe just tickle it up
into the higher gear on the 40 mph area.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.360
Sounds good.
Let's buckle up and get going.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.760
We're going on a slight incline now.
What's my top tip from you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.040
to start saving fuel,
climbing at about 50 mph?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.320
The main thing is, don't use the resume
to accelerate back up to a preset speed.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.960
Modulate your speed
by using the throttle pedal.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.040
As we come up
towards the top of the hill,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.360
we don't want to be powering
over the top. Back the throttle off.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.040
The weight is now
pushing us along quite happily.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.080
I'm still in 11th,
but you'd like me to be in 12th.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.200
I'll go into manual and take it into
top gear. I'll roll along in top gear.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.120
Again, we want to encourage
the vehicle to be in top gear.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.840
We're coming into a traffic island here.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.320
We can see from the road ahead
that there's quite a few cars about.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.240
We want to be arriving
at the give way line with nothing there.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.680
Back your brake off and give
yourself time. The island's clear.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.720
Just blend in with the traffic. Superb.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.440
We've kept the vehicle moving,
we've maintained a good speed.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.440
So, look for that gap in the road ahead,
keep it rolling, and try not to stop?

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.160
That's right.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.000
Andy, put me out of my misery.
Have I done better?

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.480
We were 7.43 percent
better on fuel on run 2.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.880
We were 2.65 percent quicker
on the second run.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.640
And we reduced the gear changes
by 17.4 percent.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.680
What would that 7.4 percent
improvement actually mean?

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.520
If I was, say, a fleet operator
running ten trucks,

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.280
each truck doing 100,000 miles a year,
what would it mean to my bottom line?

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.600
An operator running on 100,000 miles

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.000
with ten trucks,
fuelled at about 6 pounds a gallon...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.080
Based on that 7.43 percent, would save
the operator 67,500 pounds in fuel.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.360
That's about 76,000 euros
at the moment.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.200
I think any operator would be delighted
to have that in their bottom line.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.680
Andy, thanks very much for all
your help. Thank you, teacher.
