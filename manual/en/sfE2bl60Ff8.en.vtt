00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:13.480
It’s the World Cup and David Beckham is
playing brilliantly against Argentina.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.330
In the second half, Beckham was fouled by
midfielder, Digeo Simeone , who rammed him

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.570
in the back and knocked him down.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.660
Beckham, while still lying on the ground,
retaliated in anger with a kick, right in

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.850
front of the referee.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.659
He was kicked out and England was forced to
play with only 10 men the rest of the game.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.219
They ended up losing in a penalty shoot out.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.100
Beckham’s momentary loss of control cost
England its chance to win the most important

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.019
game of the year.

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.660
Being able to maintain control is one of the
most important tools an elite athlete can

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.199
possess and it is one of the secrets to mental
toughness.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.440
It is a secret because most athletes think
the opponent is on the other team…

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.339
The truth is the real opponent is you vs.
you and your mind.

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.820
Any loss of control can disrupt not only your
performance, but your entire teams as well,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.220
as we saw in the Beckham incident.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.050
The great news is that you can be in control
anytime you want if you commit to some simple

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.210
mental practices with the same determination,
you use to develop your physical skills.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.470
Soccer and really any sport, is an emotional
game and players must go into a game prepared

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.380
for cheap shots and trash talking.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.120
Sometimes, it may not even be just your opponents
that trigger a loss of self-control.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.200
Coaches, teammates and even your own thinking
can be just as destructive, if not more.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.120
One mental toughness secret to being in control
is to have a plan in your head for what you

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.300
will do when the inevitable trash talking
or foul happens.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.890
Before you ever step on the field, you must
mentally practice how you want any situation

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.970
to play out that leads you to getting your
best results.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.639
To do this, think about times in the past
when you have lost control and examine why

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.129
it happened.

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:18.129
It does not matter if it happened in practice,
scrimmaging or in a game.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.650
As you think about those times, ask yourself
what really caused you to lose control?

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.720
When you figure that out, then question yourself
about your reaction…

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.870
Was it worth it?

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.170
What did I gain from that?

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.269
Did I really have to lose it like that?

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.269
Could I have done something different?

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.040
Could I have ignored it?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.590
Now here is the important question, “How
could I handle myself differently the next

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.220
time something like this happens?”

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.069
Your plan will start to formulate and I recommend
you actually write it down or journal your

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.519
findings and commit yourself to this new way
of handling yourself.

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.400
You’ve got to make this a high priority
just like you do with your training and conditioning.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.620
Remind yourself of the benefits, not only
to yourself, but your teammates in developing

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.389
this mental toughness secret.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:16.529
Having self-control means not letting your
emotions sidetrack you in competition.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:19.499
It is hard to fight your emotions in the heat
of the battle.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.810
You will most-likely have the ability to keep
your wits, if you follow the plan you developed

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.219
and practiced in your mind.

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.829
There are athletes that are victims of their
thoughts and emotions and then there are the

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.639
elite athletes who master them.

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.440
Which side will you be on?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.040
After the big loss to Argentina, Beckham was
trashed in the British papers.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.769
Soccer fans throughout the country were throwing
darts at his picture and he faced boos everywhere

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.109
he went the next season.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.480
As you know, he exhibited extreme mental toughness
by coming back strong and becoming one of

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.569
the most popular players in the sport.

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.140
The other mental toughness secret is to NEVER
give up…on yourself!
