Hello and welcome to Cupcake Addiction's Mickey
Mouse Cakepop where I'll be showing you how

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.200
to make this great Mickey Mouse cakepop, the
perfect accompaniment to our Minnie Mouse

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.141
cakepop and sure to please the Mickey and
Minnie Mouse fans in your family.

00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:20.220
Tools and equipment that we will be using
today:

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.750
I've got a cakepop ball. Now I've got that
pre-rolled. We do have a great recipe and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.490
tutorial for getting your cakepops to this
consistency ready to decorate on our channel

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.120
so I will leave a link to that in the description
box below. I will also mention, this has been

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.469
refrigerated for at least 15 to 20 minutes
from being made so it's quite firm to touch.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.850
I've got 2 teaspoons.
I've got a toothpick or cocktail stick.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.860
I've got a couple of lollipop sticks and just
a knife.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.879
I've got some melted red candy melts, some
melted black candy melts, a little bit of

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.920
melted white chocolate.
And some mini Oreo cookies.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.071
Let's get started.
The first thing we want to do is we want to

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:05.970
stick those mini Oreo cookies into our Mickey
Mouse head. So I'm going to just slice the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.870
Oreo in half. You can twist it if you like.
I just like to slice it because I get less

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:17.020
breakages that way. And just scrape off any
excess Oreo cream. You can pop that down there

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.690
for later.
And then take your knife and just make a bit

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:29.030
of an operation here. Make a small incision
into Mickey's head on either side so that

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.881
you know where you're going to place your
Oreos. Now we want to take those Oreos. You

00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:40.350
want the very flat side of your Oreo so not
the one with the logo on it. You want the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.040
flat side to be what faces forward. It'll
give you that lovely Mickey ear shape. Press

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.430
it in to the cakepop ball where you've put
those 2 guidelines. And you want them to be

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.800
not quite meeting up in the middle, so almost
meeting up in the middle but with a little

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.090
gap.
Now I' going to take those out again and I'm

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.571
just going to dip them into the black candy
melt, just a little bit of black candy melt

00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:09.660
on the bottom there and slide it back in.
That candy melt is going to attach those lovely

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:16.590
Mickey Mouse ears to our cakepop ball so that
they are nice and firm and they don't fall

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.900
out. Pop those ones into the refrigerator
for a couple of minutes just until that chocolate

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.569
that's holding those ears in is completely
set. And then we'll get back and continue

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.040
decorating.
Back from the fridge and I'm happy that my

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.829
chocolate seal is nice and set. So remembering
that the front of your Mickey Mouse head is

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:34.920
going to be the flat side where your Oreo
cream was.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.510
I want to dip the bottom of the Mickey head
so I'm going to take my candy melts. Give

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.730
them a good stir. Always give them a good
stir just before you dip, even if you're dipping

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.340
multiples because I find candy melts...It's
really quite hard to get them to stay in a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.129
lovely fluid consistency like you can with
white chocolate. I've added quite a lot of

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.770
Copha which is vegetable shortening here.
It's a clear vegetable shortening. You can

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.969
also add Crisco if you're in the US. Otherwise,
just have a look in your supermarket for a

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.849
Copha or vegetable shortening alternative.
And I've added quite a lot there to get it

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.590
to that consistency. I didn't measure it out.
I normally do about 50 grams per 100 grams

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.120
of candy melt. But really it's just to get
it to the consistency that you're happy with.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.450
Alright, now to dip our Mickey Mouse head.
Because those ears are going to be so nicely

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.035
firmly in place, you can actually hold him
by the ear and just dip him in. Give it a

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:30.530
good tap on the bench so that your candy melt
is really leveled because you want to try

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.919
and get a nice leveled dip. So just dip it
in about halfway down and pull him out. Working

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:43.999
quite quickly here, take your lollipop stick,
dip it a centimeter in to the candy melt and

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:57.079
push it up into the middle of your Mickey
cakepop. And just tap off any excess.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.799
Don't tap too hard because we haven't given
that chocolate seal as much time to set as

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.989
we normally would after you've popped the
lollipop stick in. So just tap it quite gently

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.379
and just make sure you get off the bulk of
any excess. We'll sit that aside in our polystyrene

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:16.290
block where it can completely dry before we
move on to black.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.030
Now that that red is completely dry, we're
going to switch over for the black. As I mentioned,

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.479
it's always a great idea to give that a nice
stir. Make sure that it's nice and fluid before

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:34.960
we dip. And take our Mickey Mouse.
And you want to dip him in. You're going to

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:45.360
dip him just to meet just over that red line.
So I'm going to dip his ears and, I guess,

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:56.139
just over halfway. Pull him out. Now I like
to tap that off this way and then to the sides.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.520
So by tapping it this way, you're actually
forcing that chocolate down in between those

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.919
ears and you're really giving them nice definition.
Now I do have the cocktail stick. I did find

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.240
with some of my earlier ones of these, underneath
the ear, just didn't quite get enough of the

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.169
black candy melts on it. So if that happens,
just dip your cocktail stick in a little bit

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.270
of that candy melt. This one's turned out
fine. A little bit of that candy melt and

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.520
just neaten up under the ears before it dries.
And if you do make a bit of a mistake where

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.710
you don't have a really nice neat line there,
you can just drag your finger across the front

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.190
and you'll be able to neaten up that line.
If you've got any, I guess, if it's a little

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.470
bit uneven.
So finally for Mickey Mouse, we're going to

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.479
take that spare lollipop stick and we're just
going to give him the 2 buttons on his overalls.

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:47.530
So giving that white chocolate a little bit
of a stir. And we're just going to make 2

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.400
sort of [long] overly looking white chocolate
dots.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:06:00.729
