00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.730
hi everyone I'm going to show you a
little step that I do with my clay now

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.070
this might not be for everyone but I
wanted to share this with you since I'm

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.420
in the stage of doing this now I have
some Cernit clay here and I have it all

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.739
rolled out and I've already started it
and then I thought well why not make it

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:46.909
a little tutorial on it okay what I do
instead of taking my clay and mixing

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:54.800
white or mixing other colors of polymer
clay in with my flesh I'm doing it with

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.750
the genesis oil paints and I have this
in and this and the white make sure that

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.330
you get the white in because that
eliminates me of having to mix white in

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.840
my clay and it like I always say this
works for me and it might not work for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.229
everyone
so try if you want to try this please

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:25.039
try it on a scrap piece of clay do a
little piece that's like a size of a

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:34.280
dime or a quarter flatten it out cook it
and see if you get any Moonies you might

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200
want to add more white white in it or it
might be the clay that you're using that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.850
that it's not accepting this technique
but this is Cernit I have done it on

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.429
kato and I have done it on Bozzi those
three three clays I do know that they

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.100
work for me now when you do this it's
going to change the texture of your clay

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.100
now everybody's going to like their clay
a certain way I like my clay to not be

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.900
mushy so what I do is I always have to
leech my clay so as I rolled out my

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.850
flesh clay before I put the paint on
there I've leached it then after I get

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.790
the the feel that I want to my clay then
I go ahead and on what I've done is I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.019
found this little
plastic container and as you can see I

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:36.650
have mixed them up and I need to mix up
some more and then I will just take my

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.040
paintbrush and I will just go over it
now I've done this so many times that I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.709
practically know how much paint to put
on there okay then I'm just going to

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:57.129
take this and I'm going to just keep
running it through my pasta machine and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.720
I won't keep doing this because you're
going to have to run it through your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:16.430
pasta machine many many times I don't
know if you can start seeing the color

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:24.190
coming through but I love this technique
the only thing that I can tell you is

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:34.569
it's the texture of the clay that I'd
like see how that's running through and

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:42.139
then sometimes I haven't mixed up enough
clay if you see you're getting low on

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:48.950
clay always keep a piece that hasn't on
that you haven't used and on you can

00:03:48.950 --> 00:04:01.639
match it up to that piece but I've never
really ran into that problem and I love

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:07.579
doing this because I don't have to have
so many blocks of different colors of

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.000
clay

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:20.440
and you really don't use that much paint
in it and it doesn't make your clay

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:33.520
mushy. I don't know it's starting to
really start starting to blend now but I

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.000
wanted to share that technique and that
is what I do and okay we met you guys I

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:50.500
forgot to mention this I just realized
it the white and the this red along with

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.930
a flesh I'm sorry about that these are
the three colors that I use and I mix it

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:09.510
and then I put it on my clay sorry about
that but the flesh is important for me

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.830
but you can get any color that you want

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.940
okay you guys I just wanted to share
that tip and I wanted to show you that

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.400
that is what I've been doing for years
and it has always worked for me and it

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:42.040
eliminates having other color of clays
and it is so much easier to mix but like

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:48.820
I said try it out on a piece of scrap
clay a flat piece and what I you really

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.020
want to make sure is about the Moonies
if you're getting enough white in there

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.550
if you're even going to like it if it's
going to accept it on your own the brand

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.910
of clay that you're using just give it a
try I love it love the texture of the

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.910
clay it really does change it so
everybody I hope that this little

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:16.630
experiment that I've tried and I love it
I hope that you'll give it a try and

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.640
it'll work the same for you so everybody
you have a great day and I'm off to

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:30.970
sculpt the legs for my figure and
getting ready to start that tutorial for

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.920
all of you have a great day
