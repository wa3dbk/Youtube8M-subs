00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.710
There’s certainly a number of factors to
consider when selecting the appropriate backpack

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.520
for your next outing or adventure. That can
include size capacity, pack weight and you

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.209
intended usage of that pack. When it comes
to fit however, the starting point really

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.750
should be taking your torso measurement and
making sure you’ve got a pack with the appropriate

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.439
torso fit range. Taking your torso measurement
is not difficult; in fact it’s pretty easy.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.380
It’s that much easier if you employ a second
set of hands. Standing upright as you would

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.190
as though you just put on your backpack and
are ready to take off, lower your chin towards

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.110
your chest. When you do that a vertebra will
protrude from the top of the shoulders to

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.420
the base of the neck, can’t miss it; Right
here. Using a flexible tape measure, and that’s

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.780
important, follow the spine, the contours
of the spine, right down to a point that is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.119
even with top of the hip bones, the iliac
crest. That’s important; the top of the

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:05.980
hipbones and not further down the leg. As
Liz is doing here, pointing her thumbs inward,

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:12.040
that helps me identify exactly the point I
should be measuring at the bottom of the spine

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.320
and see a 17 ½ inch torso. Keep in mind that
torso sizing can differ in regards to backpacks

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.190
in relation to torso measurement as it might
be spoken of with clothing. Men’s torso

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.780
lengths with backpacks often fall between
17 and 21 inches. Women’s, on average, maybe

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.230
14 inches to 18 inches but that range can
differ dramatically, we’re all different.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:42.390
It’s important to actually take that measurement.
Height feels like it should be a determinant

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.750
and isn’t necessarily so. You could be 6’
6” and be all legs with a short torso; 5’

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.479
2” and have a longer than average torso
measurement. Again, important to actually

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.380
take that measurement.
