00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.300
Winter squash is one
of those seasonal vegetables

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.533
that I really look forward
to cooking with in the fall.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:08.100
You may be familiar with
butternut or buttercup,

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.600
some of those other varieties,
but if you've ever tried delicata,

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.000
this is really one of my favorites.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
Like all other winter squash,
it's a little hard to cut into,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.133
so this recipe calls
for sliced delicata.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:23.300
I'm opting for the cleaned
and cut version here.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.267
The grading system
on our balsamic vinegars

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:27.633
just tells you a little bit about
how long they've been aged.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:29.233
This one is a Two Leaf.

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:30.833
And I'm using
this one for cooking.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.800
They go all the way
up to Four Leaf.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.900
These are more concentrated,
a little bit sweeter,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.833
and you would use them
more as a condiment

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.267
or maybe in salad dressings.

00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:42.967
But this one's perfect for this recipe,
so off to the kitchen.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:45.833
Okay, we're starting out
this super simple recipe

00:00:45.833 --> 00:00:47.933
by combining
some delicata squash

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:51.033
that's already been
cut in half, seeded,

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:53.800
and then cut in these
half moon shapes.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.333
So we've got about
a pound and a half in there,

00:00:56.333 --> 00:01:01.267
along with one medium
onion that's been sliced.

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:03.000
One sweet onion.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.933
And to that, we're adding two
tablespoons of our basting oil,

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:13.400
which has garlic, and herbs,
and lots of good things in here

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.300
to give this wonderful flavor.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.900
That's good.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.433
And about the same amount,
two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:27.500
Little tang there that adds a little
different element to this recipe.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.133
Let's season that with
some salt and pepper.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:36.700
And then we're gonna give it a toss
to combine all of these things.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.067
So just so that the oil coats
all the veggies evenly.

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:43.367
All right, next step.

00:01:43.367 --> 00:01:47.567
Simply move this over
to our baking pan.

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.200
And what
we want here

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.067
is for this to be laid out on the pan
in a single layer, evenly.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.500
It'll cook better that way.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.767
That way it will evenly brown
all around the veggies

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:04.100
without steaming them.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.400
And that's just about--that's exactly
the right amount for this pan.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.567
All right, we're ready
to put this in the oven.

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:14.033
I have my oven preheated
at 450 degrees,

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.867
so I'm gonna stick that in there
for about 25 to 30 minutes.

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.500
Okay, it's been about 30 minutes,
so let's take a look.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.433
Now here's what I'm looking for.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.633
See these pieces are nice
and crisp on the outside

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:29.700
and the flesh
I know is very tender

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.233
because I can easily push
through it with my tongs here.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:34.433
But that's what
I'm looking for

00:02:34.433 --> 00:02:36.967
because we're leaving
the skin on the delicata

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:39.767
and even though
it's very fine and delicious,

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:43.400
you still want to cook it enough
so that the outside skin

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.700
crisps up a little bit.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.233
This is so easy.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.833
What I love about it is that
you can do this, stick it in the oven,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:52.067
and you can spend
a little bit more time

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:55.467
fussing with the other courses
that you have in the meal.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:57.433
So enjoy it and try it.
