00:00:00.971 --> 00:00:03.536
- Welcome to Tomahawk DIY everyone.

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:07.987
Today we're gonna take a look
at a window and some trim.

00:00:07.987 --> 00:00:10.089
You can see here this is starting to

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:12.260
rot out a little bit.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.177
Has wood, some pressed wood, that's

00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:18.508
just rotting away.

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:20.614
So we're gonna take a look at

00:00:20.614 --> 00:00:22.422
how to repair that and make sure

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:26.225
the opening for the window
into the basement here

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.613
stays nice and tight.

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:31.233
Alright, you see how
the wood's coming apart

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.012
it's not sitting really nice.

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:36.929
Pretty easy matter to use a crowbar

00:00:39.243 --> 00:00:41.844
to get this old wood taken away and

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:46.057
start exposing the gaps
that we wanna make sure

00:00:46.057 --> 00:00:48.414
stay nice and tightly sealed.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:52.748
Make sure to clean the
area where you'll be

00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:56.415
applying the new caulk
and trim really good.

00:00:57.537 --> 00:01:00.098
Wire brush, some pliers
maybe to pull out any nails

00:01:00.098 --> 00:01:01.435
that need to be removed.

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:04.744
Alright now to help keep moisture

00:01:04.744 --> 00:01:06.989
and bugs and insects out
we're gonna seal along

00:01:06.989 --> 00:01:09.117
the cracks and crevices.

00:01:09.117 --> 00:01:12.534
I'm using a high quality silicone sealant

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:18.176
specifically for outdoor use.

00:01:18.176 --> 00:01:21.145
Alright now to replace the trim.

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.550
To make sure I don't have problems with

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.594
rotting wood again, this time I'm using

00:01:24.594 --> 00:01:28.618
a PVC product, so it's plastic just like

00:01:28.618 --> 00:01:31.513
maybe underground
sprinklers, lawn sprinklers,

00:01:31.513 --> 00:01:33.346
that kind of material.

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:38.433
Seems to be pretty nice, cuts
very easily just like wood

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.460
and it's finished in a nice
white that you can either

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.360
leave as-is or is also paintable.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.384
I'm going to, because
I've had problems with

00:01:47.384 --> 00:01:49.466
bugs finding their way
in through these windows,

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:52.697
I'm gonna use some backer
rod to fill in the gap

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:55.650
between the window right here and then

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.535
go ahead and put this trim on, secure it,

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:01.700
and we'll be running some caulk along

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.880
the edges again to make sure everything

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.572
stays sealed nice and tight.

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:09.760
Alright, after cutting
your boards to length,

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.550
the next thing you wanna do is just

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.954
get them secured on there.

00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:16.201
I use some exterior
screws that shouldn't rust

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:19.451
or corrode, and just zip the screws in.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:22.995
You could also use some galvanized nails.

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:24.995
And then take your caulk

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:30.070
and seal it up really good along the edges

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.328
anyplace that there could be penetrations

00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:35.585
for water to seep behind the trim piece.

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:39.303
And that is the process we went through

00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:42.001
to go ahead and get this
window fixed and repaired

00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.433
around the trim to help
keep it water tight.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.314
