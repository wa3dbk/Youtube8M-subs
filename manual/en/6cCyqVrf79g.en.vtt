00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Hey guys!

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.080
So firstly, sorry if I make anyone incredibly hungry with my pancake shirt--

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.640
It looks so real!

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.360
I'm surprised I haven't been licked by a stranger in the street yet,

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.220
which links to my exciting news!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.800
I have been through a taste-bud transformation recently

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.580
Remember this?

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.660
Flashback music

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.860
Omm....

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:18.900
(disgusted noises)

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.720
Bleegghhh

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.280
Well, watch this mate!

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.180
Doo doo doo doo doo doooo

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.320
Don't photoshop this

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.160
(bite) Mmmm

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.440
I like bananas now!

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.340
I don't know what happened

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.220
But I woke up one day and thought, "I'm gonna try a banana again!"

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.160
And I like it!

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.960
My mouth has evolved

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:35.840
to like bananas

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.080
(banana): It's a miracle!

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.380
Well not for you, Barry.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.500
I've eaten about three bunches of them this week

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.920
just to try to claim back all the bananas I've missed out on in my life,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.260
but I thought, there must be some science behind this.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.180
Taste-buds regenerate (like the Doctor) every 10 days.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.620
As people become adults, they may start to like things that they previously hated

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.000
as taste-buds and experiences with food mature.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.300
Thanks, Science Phil!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.520
You're welcome, Phil.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.640
So I thought I could test this theory,

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.820
so I got Dan to go out and buy some things that I DEFINITELY didn't like

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.100
a few months ago to see if I like them now.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.100
Dan: Okay, who's ready for a disgusting food haul?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.000
Phil: Not me!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.540
D: I have got quite the selection for you today, Philly.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.640
P: Are you not coming on camera?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.400
D: No, because I am in my pyjamas.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.040
P: Aspirational.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.120
Alright, what's up first?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.740
D: Soda Water.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.900
P: Uuhghh.... I hate sparkling water!

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.780
It tastes disgusting.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.740
D: Hear that fizz. Mmmmm~

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.220
P: (disgusted noise) No, no, still don't like it
D: (giggling)

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.580
D: describe the taste, Phil.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.200
P: Ugh, it tastes like licking a penny;

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.040
It's all metal-y and disgusting

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.480
D: You say that as if you're someone who has much experience licking pennies

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.280
P: As a child, I did savor some pennies in my time...
D: That explains a lot

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.380
P: #1 was a fail,

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.320
I still don't like it.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.060
D: Okay, we're working up slowly,
P:Alright.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.700
D: The next one is... tomato juice!

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.100
P: AHHH I hate this! I know I'm gonna hate this still.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.400
D: I'd probably projectile vomit if I drank that cause I can't do tomatoes.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.620
P: It's like liquid ketchup and I don't even like ketchup that much...

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.980
D: Who doesn't like ketchup??
P: (whisper) I've got problems.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.660
P: "I'm gonna have a big swig,"

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.020
as they say.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.120
D: Where do they say that?

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.240
P: On boats!

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.540
"Have a big swig mate. Of my grog."

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.020
P: Uh.... (chuckles) I don't know what that was
D: What the hell was that-- oh, my God...

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.700
P: Alright, I'm doing it, I'm drinking the juice.
D: Just DRINK THE JUICE.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.640
D: That wasn't a "big swig"!

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.680
D: Big swig, right now--RIGHT NOW-- big swig!
P: iT wAs EnOuGh, Oh--

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.720
P: AGGH (disgusted noise)

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.400
I don't like it, I don't like it!

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.600
D: That, ladies and gentlemen, was peer pressure.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.420
P: (whining)

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.900
D: Describe, to everybody, the ~delicious sensation~ of tomato juice.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.960
P: Aww, it's horrible!

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.540
D: That's another thumbs down...

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.440
P: (rejection noise)

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.180
D: So, this isn't really boding WELL,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.820
P: No.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:34.400
D: for the next round,

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.980
P: No!

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.520
P: I feeling quite sick already.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.020
D: so I'm sorry in advance; your final test, Phil,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.060
the iconic Phil Lester Taste Bud Challenge,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.900
P: (chuckles) I know what's coming!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.940
D: CHEESE.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.840
P: NOOhohoo...

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.180
D: DUNDUNDUNNNN YOUR ARCH NEMESIS

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.320
P: This is like the Tokyo to my Godzilla.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.860
It is--

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.440
I just--

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.140
I HATE CHEESE!

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.060
D: WHAT THE F-- What was that?!

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.140
P: Well, Godzilla destroys...

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.920
D: OOKay.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.820
P: ...Tokyo.
D: Right.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.520
D: What is it about cheese that you don't like?

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.660
P: Ever since I was born: the smell of it, the taste of it, the look of it...

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.280
D: The look of it...?

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.660
P: Argh, I can smell it from here, it's--

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.160
(sniff)

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.740
BLEGH.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.020
D: Oh, you can smell it from "here"?

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.520
no shit...

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.080
--it's on the board right in front of your face.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.060
D: First, we're gonna start with something classic,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.940
THE CHEDDAR.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.140
P: Oh, I don' wanna do it!

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.540
WHY AM I MAKING THIS VIDEO?!

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.240
D: Stick it in your mouth.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.820
P: I'm feeling so much more scared of this than any of the other things

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.840
I've ever done on my channel.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.920
D: (laughs)
P: Honestly.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.580
D: This is the real test.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.420
P: Electrocution; I would rather take that in a second over this.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.580
D: Tell you what you should call this video?

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.140
P: What?

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.860
D: "The Cheese Challenge".

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.320
P: I am NOT calling it "The Cheese Challenge"!

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.340
D: Come on, you HAVE to!

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.160
P: I CAN'T.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.640
D: Oh, go-- Okay, right. It's trash...

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.520
and everyone on the internet knows it,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.300
but you can blame me.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.000
P: FIINE

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.240
D: You can't NOT call the video "The Cheese Challenge".

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.760
P: Alright, this is The Cheese Challenge...

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.960
D: It's a spiritual successor to "The Not-Milk Challenge"!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.700
P: Like this video because I'm eating cheese.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.120
Aww, now that's just Guilt Likes.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.580
P: I'm not putting a lot in my mouth.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.820
D: Just a-- yeah, go on.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.720
D: Like, a little bite.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.220
Go.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.080
More.
P: (laughs)

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080
D: God-- it's Cheddar.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.720
P: I'm scared!

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.360
D: It's cheddar mate.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.260
(heartbeat)

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.860
P: (retches)

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.240
D: (wheezes)

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.840
D: HOW CAN ANYONE (P: I don't know!) HAVE SUCH A STRONG REACTION TO CHEDDAR CHEESE?!

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.180
P: I JUST DON'T LIKE IT!

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.000
D: Describe yo-your emotions, Phil.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.200
P: OHOhohoo I wanna cry...

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.700
P: I just-- it tastes--

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.360
To me, I don't know why, it just tastes disgusting.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.620
D: Right, so this next one, maybe you'll have a bit of affinity with it

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.220
'cause it's actually named after you:

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.880
RED LEICESTER.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.720
P: OHH NOOOOO--

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.760
P: Alright, my mum said that I could go swimming if I ate some Red Leicester when

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.340
I was a child, and I-- it was the worst day of my life.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.560
D: The worst day of your life was when your mum made you eat some cheese??

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.060
P: Yea.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.660
D: WOW, PHIL.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.780
P: Alright, okay. Here we go.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:26.660
D: Go on...

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.420
P: It's so yellow.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.580
D: It's your family; take a bite.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.420
P: (chuckle) Oh, you're making it SO much better...
RIGHT.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.980
D: GO ON.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.480
P: AHH

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.220
D: Bigger than last time.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.000
D: Go. GO. It's nice, I love Red Leicester.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.380
D: Mmmmmm...

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.340
(heartbeat)

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.880
(Phil gags)

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.060
D: DAHAHAHA

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.340
DO YOU NEED A BUCKET OR SOMETHING?!

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.000
P: I think I need a bucket...

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.120
D: WHOOHOHUHUHUU!

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.180
(Dan's whooping laugh continues)

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.320
P: Ohh, I can't handle this...

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.140
P: UGH-- I... I swallowed it.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.640
I swallowed it!

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.620
It's like a Bush Tucker Trial.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.180
D: Well done.

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.680
P: I got it down.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.160
D: You're winning nothiiing

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.280
P: No.
D: Other than... I was gonna say people on the internet gets respect but,

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.840
D: let's be honest, no one's...
P: No one's respecting me for this.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.260
P: I don't think I can handle anymore!

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.360
D: Phil, you can't stop now!

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.380
D: You're so brave!

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.020
P: Oh right--

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.580
D: This is the cheese that most cheese-eaters don't like:

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.120
D: BLUE CHEESE.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.600
P: OHH IT'S GOT MOLD IN IT!!

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.280
Why would anyone eat something with MOLD in it?!

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.340
D: It's got some literal mold in it,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.340
(P: AHHHH) D: It's delicious Roquefort.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.960
P: Right...

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.800
D: Go on, Phil.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.300
P: I--

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.100
D: Have a cheeky nib.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.360
P: Do people e-- Do you eat the mold as well?

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.800
D: Yes, you're supposed to eat--

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.300
HAH!

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.860
D: You don't pick it out, go Phil!

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.360
P: Uh, I'm shaking.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.140
D: Go on. GO ON.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.220
(P: Haha!) GO ON!

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.200

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.220
P: OHH GOHD--

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.820
P: That is DISGUSTING!

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.820
How do people EAT that?!

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:30.700
D: HaHAA!

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.120
Do you not think it has a delicious--

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.740
P: BLEGHGEH

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:34.400
D: --Relaxed taste?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.580
P: I wanted to drink something but there's just tomato juice on the table!

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.340
D: Oh, God-- C'mon, Phil, wash your mouth out!

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.700
Go on, mate-- (wheezes)

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.800
P: That's like heaven compared to what just went in my mouth...

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.180
D: You'll appreciate this one as a little throwback to our last taste test,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.980
I'm carrying a theme forward with some

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.300
GOATS CHEESE.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.940
P: Nooo--

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.520
D: OH YEAH.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.660
P: It's gonna taste like goat!!

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.740
The goat milk tasted like goat, this is gonna be even more goat-y isn't it?!

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:59.880
P: ...Right, here we go.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.080
D: Be one with the goat.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.420
P: This is one small step for Phil.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.220
(D: Be brave.) P: One giant cheese for mankind!

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.720
D: (scoff)

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.500
(slow music)

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.080
P: Eugh!-- (spitting noise)

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.320
(Dan laughing in background loudly)

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.720
P: Oh!!  It's horrible!!

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.700
Ugh, instant goat!

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.260
IT TASTES LIKE A GOAT.

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.760
D: HAAAAHH

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.260

P: IT TASTES LIKE A GOAT HAS POOED IN MY MOUTH!

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.880
D: WH-WHY DID YOU DO THIS?!

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.500
P: (cries)

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.460

D: So, uh, Phil.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:29.340
P: Yea?

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.460
D: In conclusion, have your taste buds evolved

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.060
to like sparkling water,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.560

D: or cheese?

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.380
P: NO, they haven't evolved to like anything but bananas.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.820
P: EXPLAIN THAT, SCIENCE PHIL.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.700

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.820

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.600

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.100
