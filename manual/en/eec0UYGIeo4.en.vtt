00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.069
Hi Alex here. What is sustainability? You
must have heard a lot about

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.370
sustainability and sustainable
development over the last few years.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.710
I know I did. And maybe, just maybe,
sometimes you were not totally clear as

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.420
to what people really meant. So here is a
definition that my workshop participants

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.890
have found very clear and useful over
the years. You may be familiar with the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.730
Brundtland definition which is quite
common. "Sustainable development is

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.630
development that meets the needs of the
present without compromising the ability

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.000
of future generations to meet their own
needs". Although this does not exactly

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.540
tell us what to do on Monday morning,
it's a very easy definition to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.309
understand and to communicate. There's
another one that was created in the late

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.760
1980s that is more of a scientific
definition. It was created by a Swedish

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.520
doctor who found that there was a lack
of common language around sustainability.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.930
So he thought what if we managed to get
a group of scientists together and

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.939
to agree on what sustainability means based on science and thermodynamics. And maybe

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.799
that will lead to understanding what the
root causes of unsustainability are.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.630
So that's what he did. He put together a
group of 50 scientists, mathematicians

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.439
physicists, and chemists, etc. and after 22
draft, they agreed on several things:

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.640
First they agreed on the fact that we
live in the biosphere. The biosphere is

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.189
this very thin layer at the surface of
the earth where life is possible.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.500
Proportionally speaking, it is a thin and
fragile as the skin on an onion. And

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.299
within this biosphere, there are plants
and animals. Plants produce oxygen and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.759
food, which are consumed by the animals. In return, animals produce fertilizer and

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.100
CO2 (carbon dioxide) which are used by the plants and we have a cycle that is well

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.479
balanced. This is a very quick cycle : we
eat every day and we breathe every

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.729
second, and it works well.
Then, they agreed on the fact that this

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.439
system, the biosphere, is open with
respect to energy.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.720
This means that energy from the Sun
comes in and radiations come out. This is

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.430
also known as the first law of
thermodynamics. They also agreed on the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.170
fact that this system is closed with
respect to matter. So maybe you remember

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.330
this very famous phrase from Lavoisier
that says "nothing is created, nothing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.769
disappears, everything is only
transformed". This is also known as the

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.000
law of conservation of matter and it
means that except for a few satellites

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.700
and meteorites, the matter that was on
Earth four billion years ago is still

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.920
here today. It has changed form and the
molecules have reorganized themselves

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.989
but it is still the same matter. The
other thing that comes with this, is that

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.180
everything has a tendency to disperse.
For example, take an iPhone and wait for

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.769
a million years, it's very likely that
you will get a pile of dust. Take a pile

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.600
of dust and wait for a million years, you
will never get an iPhone. It works only

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.400
in one direction. This is also known as
the second law of thermodynamics : the law

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.579
of entropy. So if everything disperses
all the time, how is it possible that we

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:23.010
live here in such a beautiful world with
beautiful nature, cities, people, flowers

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.920
and so on. Well, this is what
photosynthesis does for us.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.910
Photosynthesis pays the bills. Plants
have the capacity to use the energy from

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.690
the Sun in order to produce oxygen and
sugar using carbon dioxide and water.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.150
Photosynthesis reorganizes matter and
creates new structure. The group of

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.950
scientists also agreed on the fact that
there are other cycles, very slow

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.750
geological cycles, that bring matter from
the lithosphere, that we also call the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.269
Earth's crust, to the biosphere and these
cycles are also very well balanced.

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.250
Some matter moves from the Earth's crust to the biosphere through things like

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.540
volcano eruptions and weathering, and
just about the same amount of matter

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.120
goes back from the biosphere to the
Earth's crust, via

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.040
things like mineralization and
sedimentation. And all this is very well

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.360
balanced. This cycles take millions of
years, they are very slow, unlike the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.090
previous ones, and they also work well. So this is what the scientific community

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.610
agreed upon. This is the world we live.
So what is sustainability? Well, it is

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.750
actually the capacity of our human
society to continue indefinitely within

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.070
these natural cycles. And sustainable
development would be a development

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.979
toward this state of sustainability. So
you may be thinking "well this does not

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.510
exactly tell us what to do on Monday
morning either". That's right but it made

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.680
it possible for our group of scientists
to look at the things that we do to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.120
interfere with these natural cycles and
they found four root causes of

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.100
unsustainability. And these are the four
things that we need to stop doing to be

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.180
sustainable. They are all equally
important. They're all necessary and

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.870
sufficient. The first one is that we
extract large flows of materials from

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.470
the Earth's crust, the lithosphere. These materials are

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.200
things like oil, like natural gas, heavy
metals, etc. that are rare in the

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.120
biosphere and that we extract in such
large quantities that they accumulate

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.810
and nature cannot cope. The second one is that we create, in our society, substances

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:43.150
that accumulate in nature. We create
chemical compound that nature takes a

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.680
very long time to break down but we also
create substances that already exist in

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.410
nature, like carbon dioxide for example,
but in such large quantities, that they

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.990
accumulate and nature cannot cope. The
third one is that we physically inhibit

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.789
nature's ability to run the natural
cycles. How do we do that? Well, for example,

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:08.740
by chopping trees at a faster rate that
they can grow, by systematically

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.919
destroying ecosystems and replacing them with parking lots, roads, buildings etc. so

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:18.120
that nature cannot run its cycles
anymore.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.160
These are three ecological root causes.
Once again, there is no priority order.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.350
The fourth one is social and can
actually be the most important of all. We

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:33.090
create in our society barriers to people
meeting their basic human needs

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.919
worldwide. Human needs are very
interesting and you can watch our video

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:42.590
about them if you are interested. There
are things like creativity, identity,

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.600
participation, and so o,n and so forth. So
how do we do that? Well, for example if

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.169
you purchase a product that is
manufactured in a sweatshop in a

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:57.000
developing country, indirectly, you
support the business, and indirectly, you

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.440
contribute to poor working conditions in
this factory, and to the fact that these

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.600
people are unable to meet their basic
human needs. So this is the scientific

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.039
consensus on the four root causes of
unsustainability. I hope it helps you

00:07:11.039 --> 00:07:14.820
understand better what sustainability
means and the fundamental reasons why

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.900
we're not sustainable today. You will
