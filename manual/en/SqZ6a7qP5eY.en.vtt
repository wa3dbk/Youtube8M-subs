Hi, I'm Candi Cane Canncel with Expert Village.
We are really working on a fun appliquÃ©d

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.880
throw pillow. We already attached our appliquÃ©d
and put in our zipper now the last step is

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.100
to actually stitch up the sides of the pillow.
You are just going to go ahead and pin the

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:26.291
remaining three sides of your pillow all the
way across. Making sure that it is really

00:00:26.291 --> 00:00:50.010
flat and what I like to do before I stitch
it is to actually take my pillow insert and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.789
line it up and see. In this case my pillow
ended up being a little bit smaller than my

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.749
fabric of the pillow so what I'm going to
do a bigger seam allowance. In this case I'll

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.989
do about an inch seam allowance all the way
around and then it should work out perfectly.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:02:06.840
Take it to the machine and you are ready to
sew. Then you are ready to stitch your last

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.950
seam.
