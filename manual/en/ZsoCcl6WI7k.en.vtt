00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.100
Can you tell me why you should never eat shrimp
again?

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.890
I was on the receiving end of a massive diatribe
that failed to give me a good reason.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.890
Shrimp is neither kosher nor halal, though
Christians don't have that problem.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.950
They just risk other problems.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.099
Why would eating shrimp be bad for you?

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.520
They are low in fat and calories relative
to other meats.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.980
Shrimp are filter feeders, sifting out debris
and food from the water.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.770
If there is toxic algae in the water, you'll
be eating toxic shrimp.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.660
Shrimp caught for food isnâ€™t toxic.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.520
It depends on where you get them.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.360
And shrimp are a major source of food poisoning,
especially because they are often stored and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.800
served chilled.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.190
The cold temperatures inhibit bacterial growth.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.240
Being in the fridge and then sitting in a
bowl of ice doesn't prevent mold or bacteria

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.829
from growing.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.400
You think twice about room temperature cold
cuts but not room temperature shrimp cocktail.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.690
Shrimp are cooked.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.311
Some shrimp, like those sitting in decorative
party trays you pick up at the store, are

00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.700
cooked along with being shelled and packaged.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.200
Shrimp from the butcher may have only been
flash frozen.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.740
Then I'll cook it.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.200
Most people don't know how to properly cook
shrimp, so they don't do it long enough for

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.369
hot enough.

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.889
OK, so shrimp can give me food poisoning.

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:30.139
So can last week's meatloaf that's been sitting
in the fridge.

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:34.639
Shrimp farms tend to be built in former mangrove
forests along the Pacific.

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:39.609
We end up denuding coastal marshlands to grow
the shrimp for your fancy cocktail.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.560
I hadn't heard of that, though I know about
over-fishing.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.119
Fish farming and shrimp farming should lessen
the stress on wild stocks.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.969
They aren't farming the food for the shrimp.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.799
Fisherman worsen overfishing to get the food
for the shrimp farms, but people don't care

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.310
because it isn't as visible as OMG where are
all the cod.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.759
That might actually be a valid reason not
to eat shrimp again.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.129
You wouldn't be saving the Earth, but saving
the oceans is a good, close second.
