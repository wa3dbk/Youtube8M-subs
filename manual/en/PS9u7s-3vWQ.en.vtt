00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.779
[Crowd noise]

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.299
&gt;&gt; HUGH ROBERTSON: This is an annual event
to celebrate the achievements of the Kick

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.070
It Out campaign. It is partially about celebrating
what has been achieved over the last 15 years

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.090
or so since the organisation has been in operation
and it is also crucially about looking forward

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.929
and making sure that we never ever sit back
and think we've got this cracked, that actually

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.829
we keep on pushing forward and increasing the
number of BME candidates not only involved

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.500
in the governance of the game but also the
management of it.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.620
&gt;&gt; HERMAN OUSELEY: We are a voluntary organisation,
a charity, but we account to the game for

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.660
what we do. We are a resource for the game
at the highest professional level and the

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.750
national level as well as the grassroots.
We work with communities, we work with the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
players, we work with all involved in the
game so we are a resource for the game and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.579
our annual report is a celebration of what
we have done and an indication of how we move

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.000
forward and that is why we are gathered here
today.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.480
&gt;&gt; RIMLA AKHTAR: It has been working on equality
in the footballing arena for a long, long

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.000
time now. I first got involved with Kick It
Out just as someone in the community who was

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
eager to ensure equalities, particularly for
Muslim women but actually for women in general

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
as well which is what we focus on at the Muslim
Women's Sport Foundation. So I have been involved

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
with them for about 10 years now almost, whether
that is as a player or actually within the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.579
administration of the game and helping to
provide that platform for equality.

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.259
&gt;&gt; SEBASTIAN BASSONG: They need loads of support
for this. If loads of personalities and players

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.820
can support them their community will go further
in the future so yeah, I think it is a good cause.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.909
&gt;&gt; PAUL ELLIOT: It is an outstanding resource,
using players as role models, but it is all

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.729
the work it does on the ground. And it is
not just about racism defined by the colour

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.390
of skin. It covers all forms of discrimination,
prejudice and inequalities.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.439
&gt;&gt; BENOIT ASSOU-EKOTTO: I think it is very
important to stop the racism now because if we

00:01:51.439 --> 00:02:01.439
stop the racism now the next generation won't
be trouble and try to do stupid things about

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.880
the colour of the skin or stupid stuff like
that.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.509
&gt;&gt; HUGH ROBERTSON: There is absolutely no
room for complacency at all. Just look at

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.610
the lamentable lack of black or asian or BME
candidates of any sort in management in British

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.750
football. Look at the lamentable number of
BME candidates who are involved in the governance

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.720
of the game, in the management of the game.
Yes an enormous amount has been achieved and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.800
I absolutely pay tribute to the organisation
for everything that it has achieved but there

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.490
is, as everybody here would admit, a great
deal more to do and much to tackle in the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.610
years ahead.
