I'm gonna do something
different,

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:20.153 line:0%
which is I'd like to show you
a body of work that I've never

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:22.621 line:0%
put together and shown
publicly like this.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.056 line:0%
It's a very short video.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:27.827 line:0%
It's on some big cats that we
photographed a while back.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:31.931
(music begins)

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.355
(music continues)

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:45.238
(music continues)

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:06.159
(music ends)

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.460
(applause)

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.264
Musi: If you have a question,
I'd be glad to try and take
a whack at it.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:15.667
Right, there's one
right here in the front.

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:16.836
This...right next to you.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.305
There were all those
really intense pictures.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:20.106
Musi: Mm hm.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.210
How did... did you establish
some kind of relationship
with them?

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:28.014
How did you get them
to look at you so intensely?

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.650
You know we built...
We did those pictures
in thirteen days.

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.586
So we did uh, eight big cats,

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.221
and we built a studio
for each one of them

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:37.823
in the enclosure
that they spend time in.

00:02:37.956 --> 00:02:41.394
So, sometimes it was
literally black paper,
we put a cheetah on.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.229
Otherwise, sometimes it was like

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:45.731
huge sheets of plywood
that we made black.

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:47.433
And then, we would
light it in a way.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:50.937
So, these were spaces
the animal was comfortable in,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.639
and then, uh, it was just
really a matter of time.

00:02:53.772 --> 00:02:55.108
Sometimes it was a
very brief thing,

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.776
'cause we never
stress out an animal, you know.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.079
They, they say what I do
is enrichment.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.814
Musi: And I'm like,
"Well they're screaming at me,

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:03.416
- and they want to kill me.
- (audience laughs)

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.684
And they're like, "No, no,
that's enrichment.
It's good for them."

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:07.153
They always say,
you only get to, like,

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:09.222
put your hand in the
cage but five times.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.890
Each finger... Right?

00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:12.325
(audience laughs)

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.159
So, you know, we built
a studio for each one of them,

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:18.231
and tried to kind of psyche
out each one as a really
distinct personality.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.866
You know?
The, the lion was hard.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.570
<i> You know, the lion
 was in my face.
 We did him twice.</i>

00:03:24.703 --> 00:03:26.873
<i> We had to build a
 thing that pushed him
 back a little bit,</i>

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.240
<i>'cause he got right in my face.</i>

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.343
<i> And he was so big,
 I couldn't photograph him.</i>

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:31.311
<i> He was huge.</i>

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:33.812
<i> And the cheetah,
 you know, cheetahs
 are kinda chill.</i>

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:36.115
<i> So, it wasn't
 a big deal to work with him.</i>

00:03:36.248 --> 00:03:37.383
<i> And then we had
 a snow leopard,</i>

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.952
<i> and man, she was torturing
 me for a couple of days.</i>

00:03:40.085 --> 00:03:42.588
<i> And, and I sang to her.
 I started singing...</i>

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:44.490
So... and that broke
out into tongues.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:46.926
And I started doing
all this like...
(babbling)

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.927
...and everybody was
just staring at me.

00:03:48.927 --> 00:03:51.664
And I, like, collapsed on
the ground, 'cause she
just stopped...

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:52.598
(audience laughs lightly)

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.901
and, like, hold... and she
never went to being mad
at me after that.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:58.837
It was like I hit some note,
and it happens...

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:00.339
I go and I, like,
collapse on the ground,

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:02.141
I'm laying, in cat urine...

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:05.311
And I say, you know,
uh, "What just happened?"

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:06.712
And they're like,
"We're as surprised as you.

00:04:06.912 --> 00:04:09.114
We have no idea."
'Cause it just happened
like that.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.349
So each one is
a little bit different.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.817
It's just patience, honestly.

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:13.152
Woman: The tiger there?

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:15.854
Oh, that tiger.
There, was a big tiger in there.

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:18.558
<i> And, you know, I'm always
 sort of relying on the expert.</i>

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.094
<i> "Tell me if I'm stressing
 him out. Tell me..."</i>

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.829
<i> And the tiger, you know,
 I thought he was
 getting a little...</i>

00:04:23.829 --> 00:04:24.763
<i> His ears were coming out.</i>

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:26.366
<i> I said "Are you sure
 he's not getting mad at me?"</i>

00:04:26.666 --> 00:04:27.600
<i> "No." And I said,
 "Well how will I know?"</i>

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.367
<i> He said, "You'll know."</i>

00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:29.802
<i> (audience laughter)</i>

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:31.270
<i> No, I said,
 "Really, how am I gonna know?"</i>

00:04:31.403 --> 00:04:32.104
He said, "You'll know.

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:35.040
And, and this went on for
a while, and you know,
we photographed him

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.344
for quite a while, and then
at some point, he put out
this roar

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:40.312
that, I mean, shook my core.

00:04:40.445 --> 00:04:41.313
(imitating roar)

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:42.948
It was like, it was
different than anything else.

00:04:43.215 --> 00:04:45.751
And, he said,
"That's what I was
talking about."

00:04:45.884 --> 00:04:47.854
(laughs with audience)
