00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.210
Welcome to MyBinding video.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.509
Let's take a look at the SI 1000, an automatic
folder and inserter by SeCap.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.320
Setting new standards in mail stream productivity,
the SI 1000 is a great unit.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.629
Let's watch it in action.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.320
As a test case, let's do one sheet in one
envelope with see-through windows.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.869
Load your sheet face-down in the A1 tray and
select feeder A1.

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.300
All of your selections and combinations are
made from this one panel on the front of the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.300
machine.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.160
Envelopes are loaded in the first slot on
the top with the windows facing out and you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.160
press “Trial Piece.”

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:38.340
A trial piece must be done first before a
run is made.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.920
And in a matter of seconds, the folded and
inserted project is complete.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.600
If everything is as it should be, hit “Start”
and you can do your entire run.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.300
The machine itself can hold up to 80 sheets
and 60 envelopes, and process up to 900 envelopes

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.900
in an hour, fold and insert.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.620
The SI 1000 will handle both seal and non-seal
envelopes.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.030
Simply make the selection and keep distilled
water in the wetting tray.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.470
Processing bulk mailing flyers is done exactly
the same way, papers face down and envelopes

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.470
facing forward.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.040
This system can also fold two different sheets
into the same envelope.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600
Place your second sheet into the A2 tray.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.960
If you have a two-sheet collated project,
you can place that in A2, make the selection

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.860
on the top, and the machine will take two
pages from A2 and put it into an envelope;

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.480
no need to separate previously collated copies.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.770
With separate sheets, place them both face
down, A1, A2, make your selection of both

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.920
and you're on your way.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.650
The possibilities are certainly endless.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.460
Not only does the SI 1000 insert papers, but
it also will insert return envelopes.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.170
Once you've made your selections, load #10
envelopes into the front slot and #9 envelopes

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.170
in the back.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.049
The system will draw from either one or two
trays and insert the return envelope along

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.870
with it into the main envelope, saving you
many steps and making your work easier.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.140
The SI 1000 can also be used as just a folder.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.880
Simply select “Fold Only” and use either
tray or the manual bypass tray.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.130
And finally, the SeCap system can do not only
letter but also legal size.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.390
Simply change the paper size and everything
else works the same.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.170
That's great productivity with the SeCap SI
1000.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.959
