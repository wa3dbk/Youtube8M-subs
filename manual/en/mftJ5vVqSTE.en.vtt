00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:13.320
When I think about designing a menu -how it
looks on the page, what the colors are, the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.990
size, the paper, the information - I think
I need to go hire a designer.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.490
Because I know what I like when I look at
it, but I have no idea how to come up with

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.920
what would work.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.560
So, you may be someone who has a lot of design
ability, and can at least begin the idea.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.340
Or, you may be like me, and need to hire a
designer to help you create exactly the right

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.730
menu for your restaurant, for your concept.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.080
Some things to consider: size.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:55.980
You don't want the menu to be so big, and
so designed, that it's a pain in the neck.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.180
You don't want it to become the additional
guest at the table.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.250
You don't want it to be something that blocks
my ability to see my friends across the table.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.689
And, on the other hand, you don't want it
to be so small that people who are of a certain

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.530
age can't read the type.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.090
So, it has to be the right size.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.689
It has to be able to hold all the information
you want it to hold in a legible and comfortable

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.689
way.

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:25.630
Then, there are a lot of branding decisions.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.180
Will you have your logo on this menu?

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.789
What colors will be used on the menu?

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.639
What kind of physical format will it have?

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:36.909
Will it be paper?

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.600
A certain texture of paper, or color of paper?

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.990
Will it be in a very deluxe leather folder?

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.299
What will the physical menu feel like to hold,
and what impression will it create as the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.659
guest uses it?

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.009
You also need to think about layout of the
menu.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:05.310
Will there be appetizers, entrees, snacks,
sides, salads, pastas?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.399
What sections of information will there be?

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.470
Will you want to put cocktails on the food
menu?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.569
Will you want to put desserts on the food
menu, or have a separate menu for dessert?

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.450
So, what sections does your menu need to have?

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.459
And also, remembering that your menu is a
very powerful tool for marketing your restaurant.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.640
What information should be on it?

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.620
Should the address, phone number, website
be on the menu, so that when someone prints

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.799
it online, they have all that information
with them?

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.569
In menu design, it's important to remember
that your menu is your principle sales tool.

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:52.150
It's what the guests use to choose what they're
going to buy, so where their eye goes and

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.400
what their eye sees is vitally important.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.010
It's also really important to remember that
you want the lyrics, or the words that are

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.470
used to describe your menu items, to be appealing
and just the right amount of information.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.860
You don't want so much information that their
eyes glaze over as they're reading it.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.120
You don't want so little information that
they have no confidence that they know what

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.120
they're ordering.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.020
So, writing the menu words, which a designer
probably can't help you with, needs to be

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.079
something you think about a great deal.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:32.840
What is going to make people both want to
order the item, but also give them real confidence

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.590
that they're going to get what they thought
they were ordering?
