00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.670
When I was a child I was fascinated by telepathy
in science fiction. In fact, I tried really

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:12.759
hard to read other peoples' minds, to project
my thoughts into other peoples' heads. And

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.670
I came to the conclusion that maybe telepaths
do walk the surface of the earth but I wasn't

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:26.670
one of them. Now I'm a physicist and I realize
that with all the electromagnetic probes that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.050
we have of the human brain we can actually
see thoughts ricocheting across the brain

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.730
itself. We can see the thinking living brain
as it thinks and we can create computer simulations

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.300
of this to understand what people are thinking.
So at the present time telepathy exists. For

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.670
example, look at my colleague Stephen Hawking.
He's lost control of his fingers now so he

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.570
cannot communicate even with a laptop computer.
But look at his right frame of his glasses.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.730
There's an EEG sensor that picks up radio
waves from his brain, decodes that and he's

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.280
allowed to manipulate to some degree a laptop
computer. You can do better by putting a chip

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.720
directly on top of the brain. People who are
totally paralyzed, who are vegetables and

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.540
they're trapped in this shell of a lifeless
body -- these people can now play videogames.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.420
They can read email, write email, do crossword
puzzles. They can operate their wheelchair.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.630
They can control household appliances. They
can control mechanical arms. Next they will

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.420
control mechanical legs and exoskeletons.
In fact, one of the people that pioneers this

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.420
technology for the next World Soccer Cup wants
to have a paralyzed person put on an exoskeleton

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.530
and initiate the soccer games. That's a goal
for one of the scientists that I've interviewed

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.950
for my book.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.390
And so we're way past simply understanding
the way in which the brain radiates radio.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.009
We're at the point now where we can actually
interface the human brain with a computer

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.459
and eventually with an exoskeleton by which
they can become Iron Man. And so Iron Man

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.840
is not simply a question of science fiction.
It's something that we can actually visualize

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.209
in the laboratory.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.989
In addition to putting a chip on top of the
brain you can actually put sensors directly

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.799
into the brain itself that are like hair-like
thin fibers. There's a certain class of people

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:41.799
with depression that have been resistant to
drugs, pharmacology, psychiatry, counseling.

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.499
They are chronically depressed. It turns out
that when you put a brain scan -- put them

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:51.290
in a brain scan you find out that yes indeed
there's a certain part of the brain that seems

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.810
to be associated with this depression. By
putting in probes you can dampen the electrical

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.999
activity of this and all of a sudden they're
cured. On one hand you see somebody who's

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:07.349
chronically depressed, wants to commit suicide,
has been plagued by this. And afterwards they're

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.590
just cured. It's remarkable. But this is just
another of the ways that we can access the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.590
human mind. Another way is through probes
in an operation on epileptics. Epileptics

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.049
have many seizures -- many of them are life
threatening. It's possible to remove part

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.249
of the cranium. These people are fully awake
during this process because the skull has

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.499
no sense organs to sense pain.

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:42.499
You put a bunch of electrodes directly on
the brain itself. These people can type. These

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.959
people can type very quickly simply by thinking
about it. They think about a certain letter,

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.959
a computer recognizes the pattern and a computer
will type in this way. Yet another way of

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:02.139
probing into the brain itself is with an MRI
scan. We can take the living brain, put it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:09.400
in an MRI and get 30,000 dots like a Christmas
tree set of lights that code the amount of

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.229
electrical activity. You take these 30,000
dots, put it into a computer program that

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:24.229
can then decipher it and bingo, what you get
is a picture of what they are thinking. We

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.259
can now visualize what somebody is thinking
about. In fact it's on the web. There's a

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:36.379
picture of Steve Martin, for example, in one
of his movies and then right next to it is

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:42.129
a picture as viewed through the human mind.
This is amazing.

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:46.830
You can clearly recognize the eyes, the ears.
You cannot recognize the fact that it's Steve

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.240
Martin. However, you can also do giraffes.
You can put elephants and clearly you're looking

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.729
at an animal and not a human. And now get
this. We can actually begin the process of

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:05.889
photographing dreams. This was considered
pure science fiction. Look at the movie with

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.229
Leonardo DiCaprio called Inception. It turns
out that the first steps in this direction

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:19.229
have been taken already in Kyoto and at Berkeley.
What you do is you put the patient in an MRI

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.470
scanner and he falls asleep. The brain is
then scanned creating 30,000 dots. A computer

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:32.729
analyzes the 30,000 dots of a sleeping brain
and reconstructs the image of what he's dreaming

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:33.310
about.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.360
Now I've seen these pictures. They're pretty
crude. You see a picture of a human and obviously

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.120
he's thinking about and dreaming about a human.
But one day we may be able to refine this

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.919
technique so that when you wake up in the
morning and you hit the play button of a computer,

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.590
you see the dream that you had last night.
