Hi, I'm Bobby crispy

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.950
This lesson is video number three on how to play nothing else Matters by Metallica

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.770
So in this video. I'll show how to play

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.299
The interlude in the middle plus the little solo that goes with it

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.399
So I'll play it first then I'll show how it's played using the tabs up here

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.700
Kusum like this

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.200
firstly twice, okay this part

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.339
yeah, I'm guessing it because it sounds like he's uh

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.900
using a harmonizer

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.889
Or a pitch bender or something like that to get there was really high notes

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:14.640
so

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.640
I'm guessing at it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.610
Don't shoot me. No don't shoot the messenger, but I'm just trying here. Let's play it like this. This is how I play it

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.858
Now an easier way of playing it is just play it an octave lower

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.950
It sounds lower, but still

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.649
Sounds pretty good. Okay it this way

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.679
That's perfect this

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940
Okay, the rest of it is pretty big this

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.710
Okay, that's played twice keep in mind that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.850
There's two guitars playing that and those are

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.570
When I played we're like the highlights of both the terms the most outstanding sound of the two guitars

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.870
Okay, so now I'll show I don't believe that little solo

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.080
Okay, this is the little solo. Let's play it at the end of the interlude starting at three minutes and 36 seconds

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.850
So I'll play it first

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.359
Then I'll show how it's played note for note using the tabs up here

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.540
Okay, so it goes like this

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.640
It's played like this

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.020
Okay, that's the interlude

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.630
Okay, now you may want to?

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:59.829

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.280
