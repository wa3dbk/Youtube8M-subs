Hi everybody, welcome to episode 8 of dog vlog!

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.280
I guess Stella's vlogging the other way today.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.380
I'm comedian Drew Lynch,

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.180
this is my puppy Stella.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.540
I should probably mention I have a stutter, did I say that?

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.300
I know I said I had a Stella.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920
She is a dog,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.120
and I'm the vlog-

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.380
Why do both words start with st?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.360
So does start, start starts with st.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.480
English, am I right?

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840
That's my hat!

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.480
We went to get sushi, one of my favorite things in the world

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.540
besides working out, comedy and Sunday brunch.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.880
*awesome singing*

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.800
We went to a sushi joint, or as some people may call it

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.960
if you're weird, a japanese pub.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.720
How do you not take a face like that to sushi?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.680
*more awesome singing*

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.060
Don't judge me!

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.720
When we first got there,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.200
the host greeted me with this:

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.200
"What happened?" *mockingly* What happened?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.440
We didn't know that that's how you greet a guest.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.260
Not "how many?" not "what's your name?"

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.020
Not "great biceps."

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.940
Yeah kiss my muscles.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.620
"What happened?" Nothing happened!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.080
Spicy tuna is about to happen in my soul.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.660
Which is also a fish.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.740
End of joke!

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.200
And then I took forever searching for her badge

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.300
I was like guh god how many pockets do you have?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.400
What are these, the Levi's of vests?

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.960
*mockingly* What happened?

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.940
Then we ordered and then I showed her the chopsticks,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.360
which she was just so enthused about

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.420
and when I broke them apart your eyes did a crosseye

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.880
I love japanese people, they are always so polite.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.060
"What happened?"

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.100
Shake.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.600
Bow.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.780
Why is your chair turned around? What are you, self-conscious?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.900

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.540
