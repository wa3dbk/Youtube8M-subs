00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.300
Basic flight maneuvers

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.530
Welcome to the World of Warplanes video tutorial!

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.610
In this video, you will learn simple aerobatic maneuvers such as:

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.750
dive,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.550
aileron roll,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.050
Immelmann,

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.450
Split-S,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.050
and chandelle maneuvers.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:35.700
Normally, these are not used individually in aerial combat, but provide the foundation for more complicated dogfighting maneuvers.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.350
Dive.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400
A dive is a steep downward plunge.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.650
To put the aircraft into a dive, the pilot simply pitches the plane’s nose down.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.250
Before the dive, expert pilots make sure to have enough altitude to pull out safely.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.950
Dives are used to attack ground targets, minimizing exposure to enemy fire before the dive.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:08.400
A dive may also be used as an emergency maneuver; for example, to extinguish an engine fire or to shake an enemy off your tail.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.240
Aileron roll.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:23.000
In an aileron roll, the aircraft rotates 360° around its fuselage, keeping its original altitude and heading at the close of the maneuver.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:32.230
When executed properly, there is no noticeable change in altitude, and the aircraft exits the maneuver at the same heading as it entered.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.670
To execute the aileron roll, the pilot applies full aileron in one direction.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:48.850
For some biplanes, before applying the aileron input, the pilot must begin the maneuver with a dive to trade altitude for airspeed.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.200
This helps achieve enough airspeed to complete the roll without losing control of the aircraft.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.380
Though of little practical use in actual combat, the aileron roll is closely related to many other common maneuvers.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.250
It is also commonly known as the victory roll, performed as a sign of victory or celebration.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.500
Immelmann.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.000
An Immelmann turn, which is also known as a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.850
is an aerobatic maneuver of little practical use in real-life aerial combat.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.880
However, it has become one of the most popular aerobatic maneuvers, being commonly used in airshows all over the world.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.450
It is named after Max Immelmann, the German flying ace of World War I.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.650
The maneuver starts with an ascending half-loop followed by a half-roll

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.000
and results in level flight in the exact opposite direction at a higher altitude.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.350
Note: Make sure you have enough speed to complete this maneuver.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.000
Split-S.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.350
The Split S maneuver is also called a "reverse" or "inverted" Immelmann.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.800
To perform a Split-S, the pilot half-rolls the aircraft inverted and executes a descending half-loop.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.650
The aircraft returns to level flight in the exact opposite direction at a lower altitude.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:28.050
This maneuver is mostly used to disengage from combat or to get on the tail of an enemy moving at a lower altitude in the opposite direction.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.000
Note: Make sure you have enough altitude before starting this maneuver.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
Chandelle.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.850
The chandelle is a combination of a 180° turn and a climb.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.000
The pilot enters a chandelle from level flight.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.800
The maneuver is divided into two parts.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:56.800
During the first half of the maneuver, through 90° of heading change, the bank angle is held constant, while the pitch is slowly increased.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.300
During the second half of the turn, the pitch is held constant and the bank angle is slowly evened out.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.950
The chandelle is a very useful maneuver for low-tier aircraft pilots.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.550
They use it to quickly turn toward a pursuing attacker,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:17.300
or to position themselves to attack an enemy that is turning or flying on another heading.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:24.550
It can be used both aggressively, to position the aircraft for attack, and defensively, to evade an enemy.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.650
Congratulations! Now you know more about these basic aerobatic maneuvers!

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.250
Until next time, stay safe and get airborne!
