00:00:08.196 --> 00:00:16.416
[Music] October 10th,
2010, Xzavier

00:00:16.456 --> 00:00:20.066
and my 13-year-old Ari
were crossing the street,

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:26.186
and a woman blew a stop sign -
hitting Xzavier, dragging him

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:30.676
for twenty feet, paralyzing
him from the diaphragm down.

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:34.186
And we lost the left lung.

00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:37.366
We have partial use
of the hands.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:42.216
I can't imagine how she feels
to know that all she had

00:00:42.216 --> 00:00:45.286
to do was pull over to
the side of the road,

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:46.906
you know, from the texting.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:50.366
At the scene of the accident
itself, her boyfriend showed

00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:52.366
up - fiancÃ©, I don't
know, significant other -

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:56.596
showed up at the site itself
and was yelling and belligerent

00:00:56.596 --> 00:00:59.456
and hollering and screaming
at her, "You were texting!

00:00:59.506 --> 00:01:00.926
I know you were texting!

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.316
It's what you do.

00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:03.686
I told you.

00:01:03.686 --> 00:01:05.096
I've been telling
you for months.

00:01:05.196 --> 00:01:06.516
I know you were texting."

00:01:06.576 --> 00:01:09.416
So much to the fact that the
officer at the site asked him

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:12.696
to stop yelling at her
because the family was

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:14.366
down on the ground
with their baby.

00:01:14.856 --> 00:01:18.606
I've been told the text
was, "I'm on my way."

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:21.706
It wasn't that important.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:25.456
She could have pulled
to the side of the road

00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:27.086
and gotten that out of the way.

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:30.426
Before October 10th of 2010,

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:34.266
Xzavier was just this
totally exuberant kid

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.606
who just didn't sit down from
the moment he put his foot

00:01:37.606 --> 00:01:40.286
on the floor, until it was time

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:42.056
and you wrestled him
every night to go to bed.

00:01:42.326 --> 00:01:47.106
We're still that same mom-son
team - it's just that now

00:01:47.626 --> 00:01:52.216
that part of us, one part of
us, a huge part of us, is gone.

00:01:52.956 --> 00:01:56.946
Anything that had anything to
do with running - "If I can run

00:01:56.946 --> 00:02:00.716
and do it," he'd do it.

00:02:00.716 --> 00:02:03.866
And it was our goal
to be screaming

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:06.796
from some stand somewhere
in this world, "X!

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:12.026
X! X!" He is and always will
be to us, the mighty X-Man.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.736
He's kind of mad at football
right now because he wanted

00:02:14.736 --> 00:02:16.716
to be a football
star, and he realizes

00:02:16.716 --> 00:02:19.226
that he needed his
legs to do that.

00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:21.096
We went to go see
a movie recently.

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:23.306
We couldn't make it
through the whole film

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.416
because the theater was too
dry and it caused him problems

00:02:27.416 --> 00:02:29.186
with suctioning and
so on and so forth.

00:02:29.186 --> 00:02:32.306
So family outings aren't
what they even used to be.

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:37.586
We have pretty much like
16 hours of nursing a day.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.586
Well, we have 12,
but we need 24.

00:02:42.116 --> 00:02:46.046
Literally, he's got
a slew of meds

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:48.256
that could probably
choke a horse,

00:02:48.256 --> 00:02:51.816
and we're taking those
4 and 5 times a day.

00:02:52.226 --> 00:02:55.616
We're coming into the process
of - the grieving process.

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:57.886
We've been doing it
for about four months -

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.236
about three months now,
we've been grieving.

00:03:00.236 --> 00:03:04.446
And the chief sentence is, is
that, "I was doing everything

00:03:04.446 --> 00:03:05.676
that I was supposed to do,

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:07.856
the way you taught me
how to cross the street.

00:03:08.246 --> 00:03:09.366
She was bad.

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:10.206
She was texting.

00:03:10.506 --> 00:03:12.576
She was on her phone."

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.396
Welcome to my life.

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:17.136
This is my message for them:

00:03:17.736 --> 00:03:20.496
Distracted driving is
just like drunk driving.

00:03:20.786 --> 00:03:24.026
You can't take your eyes
off the road at any time.

00:03:24.026 --> 00:03:28.756
If you're gonna drive your car,
you need to drive your car.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:35.646
Someone who thought it
was ok to still text

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:40.966
and drive, watch this story.

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.500
