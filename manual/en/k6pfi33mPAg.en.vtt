00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.510
If you’ve never been to the end of Kansas
State Highway 94 south of Kingsdown, you’re

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.400
missing one of Kansas’ most scenic lake
and camping opportunities. The 300-acre Clark

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.430
State Fishing lake, with about 900 acres of
adjacent hunting and wildlife viewing areas,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.710
is a beautiful and unexpected surprise in
what seems to be flat, arid land. Viewed from

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.910
the rim, the lake is a blue gem that invites
one to serene living and good fishing. The

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.069
200-foot-deep canyon is rugged and picturesque.
And a drive through the open-range country

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:44.320
west of the lake is a peek into the prairie
past. Clark is our largest state fishing lake

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.339
and was constructed in the late 1930s as a
Civilian Conservation Corps project.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:57.190
Well off the beaten path, Clark draws many
visitors simply wanting to relax. Camping

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.889
facilities are good, but rate somewhere between
luxury and “roughing it.” Modern vault

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:09.980
toilets are new and clean, and camping sites
are shady and level with ample room. Hookups,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:16.600
dump stations, and potable water are not available,
but generators may be used to supply power.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.170
Access to the east shore camping area is excellent
via the all-weather K-94.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.340
North side camping, popular with archery deer
hunters near the wildlife area, is accessible

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.450
via a steeper dirt road that can be slick
in wet weather.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.510
Good fishing exists at Clark State Fishing
Lake, both from shoreline and from access

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.310
through four boat ramps. The lake is known
primarily for largemouth bass and catfishing,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.570
though it also holds crappie, white bass and
walleye. Consult posted regulations for detailed

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.710
information.
Birders are often thrilled with the unusual,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.159
rim-view opportunities to watch turkey vultures
soaring at eye level. The area is great for

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:11.980
all kinds of photographic opportunities.
Treat yourself to Clark State Fishing Lake

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.519
for a special Kansas outdoors experience.
You’ll find it clean and scenic – a great

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.090
little hideaway.
