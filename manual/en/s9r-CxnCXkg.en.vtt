What Up food Tubers! Ok, Mr Oliver here. Today we're gonna cook scrambled eggs three ways.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.759
We're gonna go a la English way, a la the French way and the American way. Beautiful

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:22.759
scrambled eggs, so delicious. The chicken egg is the most delicious and

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.840
cheap form of brilliant protein on the planet, fact. They have loads of micro nutrients and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.540
they're so quick to cook. So, English scrambled eggs. We're gonna go onto a medium heat. I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:48.600
am gonna go two eggs per person.  Um, I'm gonna do it for two. So just whisk those eggs up.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.280
Now, one little request - I hate factory eggs, so minimum for me, standard eggs, is barn

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.480
eggs. And of course free range and free range organic is the way to go. So, let's do it.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.430
I'm gonna go in with a nice glob of butter. Straight in, just with a little salt. In we

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.159
go. And for me, the perfect thing to move the eggs around is a little spatula like this.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.880
So I'm just gonna move it around and very quickly you can see it setting around the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.500
base. You can see those little cooked curds and the raw egg. So I'm just gonna leave it.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.979
Every sort of five seconds I'll give it a little move around. You don't want it to catch

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.830
too much. Some people put milk in, some people put cream in. If you cook it right you don't

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.090
need any of that. This is cooked now but you gotta remember that this pan is still warm

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.510
and it's gonna continue to cook. so all I do is, when I get to this stage, I just put

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.140
it to one corner of the pan and that way it's not gonna kinda overcook anymore. I get my

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.700
toast. You can butter your toast but remember we've got a nice knob of butter already on

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.700
our scrambled eggs. So on we go with our lovely, beautiful English style scrambled eggs. You

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.020
can see it's medium curds, still with moisture around. Mmm completely beautiful but also

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.530
still soft in texture. So English eggs done. Soft, gorgeous, delicate. Next, French style.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:25.500
[In a joking French accent] Bonjour, je m'appelle Jamie. J'aime le oeuf. [Pronouncing "Oeuf" in various ways] Oeuf? Oeuf? Oeuf? Anyway, French style eggs.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.200
You lightly season four free-range eggs. We whip it up and see here we've got about an

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.260
inch of boiling water. and we're gonna cook this over a bain-marie, a water bath okay? Now

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.260
here's the thing, eggs cook at a very low temperature and it takes a while.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.550
Ok, so now you can see there are kind of curds beginning to form, you can see them on the end of here

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.750
just about. And now is a good time to put a few knobs of butter in there. So I'm gonna

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.590
go from a whisk now and I'm gonna use a little spatula and you're gonna start to see a more

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.010
gentle, delicate curd coming out. So look, there we go. We're in a good place. On we

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:39.100
go and very, very different to the English. When you eat it, it's very, very fine. It's

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:45.590
very luxurious. So there you go guy's, French style eggs. They are delicious. And finally

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:55.300
Food Tubers we're gonna finish with the American style eggs. Ok, so we're gonna start off the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:00.650
same. Put a little salt into our four eggs. We're gonna use a frying pan. Go in with a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:07.420
knob of butter. Let's get that bubbling away. We're gonna go in with the eggs. You'll see

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:13.230
it starts to set and as it starts to set I'm bringing in these beautiful sheets. And you

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.400
get this kind of rouladey, folded gorgeous diner eggs. See these beautiful sheets happening

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.849
guys. The same rules apply to the French and the English; you want it to be gentle cooking

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:32.990
so it's a joy. So we're looking good guys. Last but not least, there's something quite

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.219
delicate but substantial about this and you can see the shiny parts where it's just cooking,

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:45.409
there's cooked parts that arte delicate and sheety . Look at that. Scrambled, American

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.539
style eggs, so tasty. Now all of these styles; French, English and American, they've all

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.659
had the same eggs, same pinch of salt, same amount of butter but the method that we've

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.860
used to cook them has completely, not only, changed the texture and the look but the taste.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.669
So we've done the English, the French and the American, that's just the tip of the iceberg.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.399
There's hundreds of countries from all around the world so how do you cook your eggs? Let

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:12.099
