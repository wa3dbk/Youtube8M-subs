00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:07.730
I'm going to demonstrate how to make a yarn
over.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.780
There are a couple of things you need to remember
about a yarn over, which is that it is an

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.360
increase, so if you don't want your knitting
to grow, after every increase you're going

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.360
to need a decrease.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.949
So I'll show you what I mean.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.699
In this pattern I'm alternating simple yarn
overs.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.380
First, two stitches in and then six stitches
in.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.370
So now I'm on a two stitches in row, so I'm
going to slip one, knit two and now I'm ready

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.570
to work a yarn over.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.249
I want to insert a hole here, because a yarn
over is just basically a hole.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:46.340
To do that I'm going to bring the yarn in
front of the needles, coming from between

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.809
the tips, and then back over again to the
back.

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.409
When I stick my needle in to knit the next
stitch I'll automatically be bringing that

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.039
yarn over the needle, because in order to
knit a stitch the yarn has to wrap around

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.399
from behind.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:06.190
Now however, before I knit that next stitch,
remember that a yarn over is an increase,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.070
and so I'm going to immediately need to go
into a decrease here.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.800
That doesn't happen in every pattern, but
in this yarn over pattern, it does.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.960
So I've brought yarn to the front, I'm going
to stick my needle through both stitches making

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:28.890
a knit two together decrease and then bring
the yarn around and knit once stitch.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.439
So here you can see on the needles I've got
the yarn floating over the needle here, which

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.100
is going to make a hole, but it's not complete
until I've purled it on the back, because

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.070
these yarn overs are happening on stockinette
sample.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:57.979
So now I'm going to knit six, one, two, three,
four, five, six and insert my next yarn over,

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.479
which should line up directly with that one,
from the last row where I did two and then

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.479
six.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:03.560
There it is.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.259
So yarn comes to the front, between the needle
tips, I'm going to do a knit two together

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.590
and yarn comes over the needle to knit that
stitch.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.180
Here we see it again.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.640
There's the yarn over, there's the decrease.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.379
Let's do it one more time.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:33.519
One, two, three, four, five, six, oh good,
it lines up with the one below, yarn over,

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.590
knit two together and finish the row.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.341
So on the back we're going to be purling every
stitch, because this is stockinette, but we

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.760
also need to purl that yarn over.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.120
It's going to look and feel a little different
than the normal stitches, because I'm doing

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.019
a slip stitch edge, I'm going to slip my first
stitch and I'm going to purl across normally,

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.780
until I get to my first yarn over, and there
it is just sitting there on the needle.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.549
If I take it off, you can see that it's just
a big hole.

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.800
But I don't want to take it off, I want to
purl it.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.299
So it's going to feel a little funky, but
insert the needle as if to purl, just like

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.329
it was a stitch, and there you go.

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.459
Let's do it again.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:30.800
I'm going to purl six, we're going to get
over to our yarn over.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.030
Here's purling on knit two together.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.610
Here we are again at our yarn over.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.959
You can see it's just a yarn draped over a
needle tip, insert as if to purl, bring the

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.450
yarn around, scoop up a new loop from that
really loose hole, and now you've purled your

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.200
yarn over.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.700
So on the front now we should get to see what
our yarn overs actually look like.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.069
Yarn overs don't really show up perfectly
until you've worked the row above a purl.

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.350
If you're making yarn overs in the round,
you would never do the back.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.480
Now I can see the nice little row of holes
that I just made in this sample.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.380
And here is what yarn overs look like in a
lace pattern.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.390
In this shawl that I knit, you can see all
those wonderful stacks of holes which are

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.220
there on purpose and in pattern.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.870
Those are yarn overs in their natural habitat.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.690
And that is how to make a simple yarn over
with a knit two together directly afterwards.
