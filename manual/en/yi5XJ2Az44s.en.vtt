00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.500
SPEAKER 1: '79 to '93 Mustangs
have a firewall-to-hood seal.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.370
This weatherstrip
seals off the seam

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.750
between the hood
and the cowl panel.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.110
Now what this thing
does, it keeps water

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.060
from intruding into
the engine compartment

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.570
as well as keeping in negative
air pressure in the engine

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.120
compartment so air will properly
flow through the radiator.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.370
Don't ask me how that works.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.050
Its way above my pay grade.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.750
This is what I was told
from a Ford engineer.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.950
Now what causes
these things to fail

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.870
is the rubber gets
completely brittle,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.120
breaks, cracks, falls apart,
and no longer performs

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.370
its function.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.590
Now removal is simple.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610
It's held onto the firewall
by just a series of clips

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.385
that you can pull up, and remove
the seal from the firewall.

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:53.060
 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:01:00.096
Once you get all of
your clips disengaged,

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:02.220
you can go ahead and pull
your old weatherstrip out

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.719
of the way.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.700
 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.560
Our new 5.0 Resto Weatherstrip
is an exact replacement

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.000
for the original.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.570
Correct rubber, has
the felt bonding on it,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.050
and all the original
style clips.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.600
Go ahead and slide it into
place around your hood hinges,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:02:00.759
and start engaging all of
your clips, one at a time

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:01.925
And you'll feel them engage.

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:03.600
They'll actually pop into place.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.810
 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.070
And there you go.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.530
Brand new firewall-to-hood seal.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.780
Completely restores
the function.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.490
