Catching everything with my chopsticks,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580
making loud noises with every hit.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.500
Moving unseen; so fast, so quick.

We're dressed in black,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.020
just like emos, except for the fact:

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.100
We don't stab ourselves;

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.180
we stab your back, it's just a way to sneak attack.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.540
We see you coming, cause we have wall hacks

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.400
Don't come near us, or we'll give you a slap.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.320
And no sense in running, cause we set up a trap.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.000
