Hey, fish fans. It's Ashley from Zoo Med! Today I'm going to introduce you to Zoo

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.719
Med's AquaSun® LED high output aquarium light. This light fixture comes in a

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.150
variety of sizes to accommodate several
types of aquariums. Its unique modular

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.210
design allows for replacing and
reconfiguring AquaSun® LED units. AquaSun®

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.640
LEDs include the standard light
module with four one-watt 6500k white

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.719
LEDs and two half-watt 465 nanometer
blue LEDs. The number of modules in each

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.879
AquaSun® LED vary depending on the size of the fixture. Setting up the light is

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.770
easy, simply slide the Mounting Rails to
the appropriate length for your tank and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.140
rest the fixture on the top. You can also
use the included Suspension Kit to hang

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.460
the fixture above your aquarium.
Once your fixture is mounted, attach the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.780
Power Adapter and plug it into an
accessible GFCI protected power source.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.309
The AquaSun® LED can be turned on with
the two switches on the side of the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.799
fixture. One switch controls the one-watt
LEDs, while the other controls the half-

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.030
watt LEDs. Modules can be replaced or
changed in the AquaSun® LED high output

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.979
in order to get the desired effect you
want for your aquarium. To do this, first

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.210
unplug the fixture and carefully remove
one plastic end cover by extending the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.400
mounting rails and unfastening the four
screws using a Philips screwdriver.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.079
Gently pull the end cover away being
careful not to strain the wires inside.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.360
Next, remove the clear plastic Splash
Guard by sliding it out of the groove.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.130
Carefully detach the optical lenses from
the LEDs of the module you're removing.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.329
These will be used for the new module.
Take note of the two different kinds of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.040
optical lenses. Disconnect the orange
wire connectors from both ends of the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.950
LED module and remove the screws holding it in place. After that, the module can

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.320
easily be removed from the fixture
housing. Place the new LED module in the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.120
same location and orientation
as the original module with the text

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.920
facing the same way as before. Begin
screwing the new module into place and

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.060
attach the lenses to the new LEDs.
Reattach the orange wire connectors,

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.900
slide the plastic Splash Guard back into
the grooved slot, and screw the plastic

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.910
end cap back on. Your AquaSun® LED high output aquarium light is now operational.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.900
AquaSun® LED high output modules are
available in the Standard Light Module

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.160
which features blue LEDs that are
perfect for reef tanks or nighttime moon

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.870
lighting, the Daylight Module with extra
white LEDs for increased daytime

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.090
brightness, and the Plant Module with red
LEDs to maximize aquatic plant growth.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.580
That's all for now. See you next time!
