00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:08.407
The 9.5 update brought the second branch of British tank destroyers, Personal Missions, two new maps, and many other changes.

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:11.440
Watch this review to learn more details.

00:00:15.273 --> 00:00:18.473
New light and medium tanks were added to the British Tech Tree.

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:26.007
The light tanks are the M2 and the Stuart I; the medium tanks are the Grant I, the Sherman III, and the Sherman Firefly,

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:31.940
a legendary tank that military history enthusiasts have been asking us to put in the game for a long time.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.240
Perhaps more importantly, the British also get their second branch of tank destroyers.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.607
It begins with the Archer in Tier V.

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:43.873
This TD has a feature in common with a vehicle of a different type — the Crusader SPG.

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:46.540
Its reverse speed is faster than its forward speed.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.007
This is quite unusual, but opens new tactical opportunities.

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:53.273
More dynamic vehicles occupy Tiers VI and VII.

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:57.440
They’re equipped with the 17-pdr gun that is also mounted on the Archer.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.040
Players will play with this gun in three tiers.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.073
However, this shouldn’t be much of a problem.

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:03.707
The gun is quite potent.

00:01:03.807 --> 00:01:09.273
The average damage per shot is low, but a very high rate of fire and good accuracy compensate for that.

00:01:09.373 --> 00:01:11.340
There’s an interesting vehicle in Tier VIII.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.173
The Charioteer is a very maneuverable TD with a rotating turret.

00:01:15.273 --> 00:01:18.240
It carries a powerful gun and can be loaded with HESH rounds.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.407
Unlike standard HE shells, HESH rounds have a high penetration value.

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:24.740
The Conway is a Tier IX vehicle.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.107
Its top speed is lower than that of the Charioteer, but it’s still pretty agile.

00:01:29.207 --> 00:01:33.973
This TD has just appeared in the game, and its gun has already earned a good reputation.

00:01:34.073 --> 00:01:38.140
It’s a 120-mm gun, the same one that’s mounted on the Tortoise.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.907
This gun has the stats to be very effective, but it takes some player skill to get the most out of the Conway.

00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:46.640
Among its disadvantages is its large size.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.407
You’ll have to play it very carefully.

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:51.473
The Tier X vehicle also requires a careful hand.

00:01:51.573 --> 00:01:53.973
This is the FV4005.

00:01:54.073 --> 00:01:59.173
This TD isn’t just big; it’s really massive—comparable to the Maus in height.

00:01:59.273 --> 00:02:01.673
But it has a big gun to match its size.

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:07.840
The gun is the same 183-mm cannon mounted on the FV215b (183).

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.140
The gun characteristics are slightly different.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.107
The FV4005 is more accurate and takes less time to aim.

00:02:14.207 --> 00:02:19.373
But the general concept of this vehicle is the same, dealing a huge amount of damage every time it hits.

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:24.807
The main difference between the two British Tier X tank destroyers is in their dynamics and armor.

00:02:24.907 --> 00:02:29.840
The FV4005 is much faster, but its armor leaves a lot to be desired.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.173
With the introduction of the new British tank destroyers, players have a choice of playing

00:02:34.273 --> 00:02:41.373
either the well- armored but slow vehicles of the first branch or the less well-armored but more maneuverable TDs of the second branch.

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:45.540
Also, a new German Premium tank was added in the new update.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.640
You can learn more details about the Panther 8,8 L71 from our special video.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640
Maps

00:02:55.773 --> 00:02:59.307
The 9.5 update brought two new maps.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.740
The first map, Ghost Town, was designed especially for Team Battles.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.707
 The Severogorsk and Ruinberg on Fire maps were removed, and Winterberg was added.

00:03:14.707 --> 00:03:16.240
Personal Missions

00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:20.007
Personal Missions will appear in the 9.5 update.

00:03:20.307 --> 00:03:26.773
This is a series of tasks that, once completed, will allow players to receive a unique vehicle and a female crew.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.907
Tasks will be given to every vehicle type individually.

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:35.307
We will give you more details in a special video that will come out before the launch of Personal Missions.

00:03:35.407 --> 00:03:37.873
Look for it after the holiday events.

00:03:39.973 --> 00:03:41.140
Other Changes

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.007
The effects of shells hitting a vehicle were reworked.

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:46.340
There’s good news for light tank drivers.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.807
It will be advantageous to get into high-tier battles in the 9.5 update.

00:03:50.907 --> 00:03:58.773
Now, players will receive an additional 10% XP for spotting damage for each tier difference between the player’s vehicle and the spotted target,

00:03:58.873 --> 00:04:01.707
up to a maximum of 30% bonus XP.

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.140
We’ve added several functions to the minimap.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.940
Line of vision, vehicle names, and the last known location of vehicles were added.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.273
Also, arc of fire was added for SPGs.

00:04:12.373 --> 00:04:13.473
That’s all for now.

00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:15.140
Good luck on the battlefield!
