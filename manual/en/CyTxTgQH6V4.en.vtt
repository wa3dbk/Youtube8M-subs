HI, My name is Paul Beel. For twenty years
I closed myself in the studio,painting hundreds

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.400
of striking images while growing steadily
more dissatisfied playing the role of the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.230
traditional,  cloistered artist. In 2002, I
began painting Hans, a man who lived on a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.859
sidewalk in a Florentine Piazza and entertained
me with detailed descriptions of Formula 1

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.460
race cars while quoting Bob Dylan. When I
moved my studio out of the center of town,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.160
I began taking my canvasses to the streets,
thus forging a new approach to serious portraiture

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.160
and creating my own fusion of painting, public
performance, and video animation. 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.809
In 2010, I won the Travel Award from the National Portrait
Gallery in London in the world´s most prestigious

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.430
portrait competition. While theTravel Award
isn´t the competition´s biggest cash prize,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.920
it was called by one blogger, "the coolest
thing that can happen to a portrait artist,"

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.500
and I resolved to make the most of the prize
by taking my concept to a more challenging

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.350
scale. With the travel grant, I crossed the
Ionian sea to a secluded beach in Greece to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.030
paint a 5 meter group-portait, from life,
of 27 nudists. I also shot video and produced

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.689
the entire adventure as the full length documentary
Epic Mirtiotissa. And now, I´m taking on

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.579
a new, equally ambitious project, going even
more public by painting a large group portrait

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:35.470
on an in-service London commuter train, and
I´ll be using oil paint. Now, I know you´re

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.350
probably asking yourself right now, "are they
actually going to let him do that on a train?"

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.350
...and I have to admit I´m pretty surprized
myself, but... here´s the permission form right here.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.479
 Why would I want to paint on a
train? Well, the first thing is, it´s daring

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.920
and risky, and I want the movement of the
train to be seen in the brushwork, inhibiting

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.390
the virtuousity and focusing more on what´s
essential to the portrait. I work on one 65x40

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.390
cm canvas at a time. And when all 6 works
are joined, they make a sweeping, train-like

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:29.370
composition measuring almost 2.5 meters. Working
from one or two models at a time, riding the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.720
train back and forth between its end destinations,
I usually start directly in oil paint. I´ll

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.920
also be shooting video and animation for a
short documentary, but my immediate goal is

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.410
to focus on making my best work yet.
