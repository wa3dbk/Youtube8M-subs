00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to a new episode of ValuetechTV.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.500
Like I pronounced last time, today we have a look on the new HTC Flyer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A tablet PC - so one of the most famous device class today.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500
What is so special about the Flyer?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
First, it's no Apple device ;-)

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Joking aside..

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's a really handy device..

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 only 7" screen size.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Furthermore there's a good display inside.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Good colors and viewing angle.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Naturally it's nothing like an Eizo monitor..

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
..but it's okay for watching videos, fotos and so on.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.500
On the back you'll found a 5 MP Camera.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Not bad I guess.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.500
..Also a headphone jack - everything you need?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Something really special is the HTC Magic Pen.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.500
BTW: The pen is included in each flyer-box.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The HTC Magic Pen allows you to take screenshots

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.500
and edit them, just as pictures and text.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can draw something inside..

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
..or mark some text as well.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
A nice feature - no question about it.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.500
Because it's a great toppic..

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
..we went to an HTC presentation [for the HTC Sensation]..

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.500
..and let us introduce the HTC Flyer Tablet.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Even if there're presentations at the CeBIT as well..

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
..today a nearly final Android and Sense 3.0 version is running at the Flyer.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Having fun and see you next time.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Here we've got the HTC Flyer..

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
a 7 inch tablet PC.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
Equipped with a 3G-Modul, WiFi..

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and 32 GB build in flash memory.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.500
It can be extended with micro-SDHC cards further 32 GB..

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
All in all 64 GB memory.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Something really special is, that the flyer has a convex frame..

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
..so even if you put the flyer onto the display..

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.500
..there will be no scratch ot sth. else.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Additionally we've got 2 pairs of control buttons.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.500
First time here in the vertical orientation..

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.160
[turn around..]

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.500
..and also in the horizontal orientation.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So you can use them wherever you need them.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.500
Here we have a build in 1.3 MP front camera..

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
..and on the back the 5 MP camera..

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.500
..which is able to record HD-Video (720p).

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And we've got the famous Unibody-design.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.500
This mean that the whole frame is milled from a single Aluminium block.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
All techn. components are inserted as well.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.500
And like you can see plastic-covers for the antenna / good reception.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Lets have a quick look at the start screen..

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500
You see HTC Sense 3.0.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The Flyer is going to come with Gingerbread (2.3.x)..

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.500
..and got a 1.5 GHz Qualcomm processor.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
To open the surface, move the ring inside.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
Like allready known from the HTC Sensation..

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
..the Homescreen-carousel.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.500
Something really special is - next to the compact size -

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the HTC Magic Pen.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.500
Working with the HTC Scribe technology.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The pen allows you to take screenshots..

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.500
..in each homescreen..

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
..application.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500
I'll show you..
[Take a screenshot]

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
As you can see, you're able to save,..

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.000
send, print and drop the picture.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.000
Now I can - if I want - write something inside..

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.500
..or draw a heart.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
If I want to take another pen, I go to the right bottom corner..

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.000
to open the Magic Pen menu.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.500
Lets take a ball-pen..

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
..and I want to write in red..

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.500
and a little bit more thick.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So I can draw a little arrow or something else.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.500
Now I'm able to save this picture..

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
..or send it via:

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.500
Now you see different options to choose like..

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
BT, Facebook, Flickr, G-Mail, Mail or Twitter.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.500
May - not this picture.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You can also print or simply safe the picture.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It's also possible to sync all your notes via evernote.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.500
So you can make sure that you have all your data..

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
at your PC, Smartphone and the Flyer.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.500
Thanks for Watching!
