00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.920
Hi! My name is Ken Marcou and I’m going
to talk a little bit about how to recover

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.349
from dropping a drum stick in the middle of
a set in front of people, what do you do?

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.969
What do you do if you drop a drum stick? The
first step is to chill out, you don’t want

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.789
to get freaked out about it, but you do need
to instantly think to yourself okay what is

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.390
the most important part of this? Inevitably
the most important part is keeping the beat

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.720
not missing a beat but if you can compromise
in your beat that you’re playing so that

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.050
you maintain the drive which often times is
supplied by whatever is playing the most repetitive

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.239
note, like if you’re playing chorally notes
on something or if you’re playing 8th notes

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.420
on the hi-hat or the ride cymbal, you want
to try to keep hitting that somehow so that

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.390
it doesn’t sound like there’s a big void
missing. You drop a stick, you play with your

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.180
dominate hand, you know so if you’re right
handed you drop your right stick your left

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.960
stick should go to your right hand, play with
your dominate hand and your other hand wants

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.380
to reach down to a stick bag which sound be
attached to your floor tom or somewhere close

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.030
by so that you can have a second stick, again
right quick. Now it takes a few seconds to

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.520
realize what’s happened and everything so
you just want to stay calm, play with your

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.770
dominate hand, don’t mess any beats but
fill in the gaps that you’re missing from

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.360
only having one hand as best as you can this
takes practice and there’s really no right

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.340
or wrong way to do it but these are the main
things to remember is to stay calm and play

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.400
the most important parts which are your beats.
We’re going to demonstrate a little bit

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.079
here, if I’m playing a drum stick I’m
going to grab another stick, I’m going to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:02:06.780
be playing simple 4/4 beat…now this was
a lot easier than it could have been because

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.270
it’s a very simple beat and if you had your
coordination as up to a certain level of where

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.780
you can easily play this with one hand then
you’re not going to have a problem. The

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.050
only thing that was missing there was the
one hit on my right hand that was being compensated

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.660
for on a snare drum, so it sounds a little
bit less comprehensive but ultimately for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.390
a measure or two it does the trick.
