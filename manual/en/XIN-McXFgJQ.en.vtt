00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:10.270
A group of Budapest cyclists is fed up with bicycle theft.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.194
Using a bait bike equipped with a hidden GPS tracker

00:00:13.194 --> 00:00:15.134
we are setting a trap for the criminals.

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:17.211
Follow us week by week!

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:20.215
This is the web series of the Thiefbusters.

00:00:22.891 --> 00:00:25.287
Episode 3.:
"I did not expropriate a bicycle..."

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.807
Several boring days spent with waiting again.

00:00:31.936 --> 00:00:34.577
Margaret Island, the Gödör, Easter Railway Station.

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:36.873
The bait bicycle stayed where we put it.

00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:40.966
Finally one of us jokingly said we should put it to where the biggest thieves are.

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.667
Headquarters of the Hungarian Socialist Party.

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:45.448
So we did.

00:00:45.527 --> 00:00:47.693
On a Summer afternoon we chained the bait to a pole

00:00:47.728 --> 00:00:50.275
at the corner of Aradi and Jókai streets.

00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:52.651
But to make it more convenient for the thief

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:54.796
we just tied the chain around the saddle

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.345
so it was easy to remove the chain along with it.

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:06.723
At 3 AM the GPS tracker sent an alert from the Western Railway Station.

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.801
We rushed there, with the help of a police car

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.725
which just happened to pass by.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:14.851
Unfortunately we still couldn't catch the train.

00:01:15.227 --> 00:01:19.090
At 04:09 AM the bicycle left with a commuter train towards Szeged.

00:01:19.427 --> 00:01:20.949
And how unfortunate:

00:01:20.984 --> 00:01:24.126
the battery of the GPS has depleted at Kõbánya-Kispest.

00:01:24.226 --> 00:01:28.209
It seemed we've lost our equipment on the first real mission.

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.776
Fortunately railway security was able to help.

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:34.854
They called their colleagues on the train

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:37.898
who soon reported finding the bicycle

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:39.499
along with two young men

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:42.833
who strongly insisted that it's theirs.

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:47.745
They were taken off the train at Monor and handed over to the police.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.561
The Monor police station congratulated us

00:01:50.596 --> 00:01:52.649
as they long knew these two guys.

00:01:52.684 --> 00:01:54.668
And then we spent the next day

00:01:54.703 --> 00:01:57.294
with interrogations and crime scene investigation.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.426
POLICE - CRIMINAL EVIDENCE!

00:02:10.103 --> 00:02:12.840
A day later we drove to Monor to pick up the bicycle.

00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:16.858
We were told that the thieves were already released

00:02:16.893 --> 00:02:20.457
despite earlier they said they will remain in custody.

00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:24.386
So we paid them a visit in their natural environment, in Lake street.

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:28.238
One of them, the 19 years old Attila Vidák was home.

00:02:29.124 --> 00:02:32.029
- So it was like we have boarded the train at Vecsés

00:02:32.064 --> 00:02:34.729
with my friend who lives down here, at the farm

00:02:34.764 --> 00:02:36.659
it's called Trekli Farm.

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:39.480
And it happened that we went to the train

00:02:39.515 --> 00:02:41.576
and there were these guys in yellow vests.

00:02:41.611 --> 00:02:43.067
Train escorts.

00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.517
And I don't know why they picked us

00:02:46.357 --> 00:02:49.587
but they were called that this bicycle was stolen

00:02:49.622 --> 00:02:52.068
and we went to them to ask what is going on

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:53.246
and they said that

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.039
two minorities have stolen this bicycle.

00:02:56.295 --> 00:02:58.869
I didn't even know where this bicycle came from!

00:02:58.904 --> 00:03:00.425
We were framed immediately!

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.500
- So you had a bicycle and they said it's a stolen one?

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:06.224
- No! We didn't have a bicycle. We got on the train without any.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:08.946
We were at a village fair, and we have proof of that.

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:10.763
You can ask anyone where we have been.

00:03:10.798 --> 00:03:12.920
- So the bicycle was on the train, unattended?

00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:15.529
- Yes, yes! It was there. A purple mountain bike.

00:03:16.653 --> 00:03:18.685
- But who puts his bike on the train and leaves it?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.966
- I don't know. The conductor said they even bought a ticket for it.

00:03:22.555 --> 00:03:24.774
And the person who bought the ticket

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:26.993
has jumped off at Vecsés-Kertekalja.

00:03:27.193 --> 00:03:29.963
There is the conductor, you can ask him, really.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:32.844
And we were questioned, and I told everything

00:03:33.226 --> 00:03:35.223
told the truth from my pure heart.

00:03:35.623 --> 00:03:37.097
And so we were released.

00:03:37.197 --> 00:03:39.014
- Have you ever had trouble with the police before?

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.096
- Yes, unfortunately, a long time ago.

00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:44.535
I was a kid. I was 14 back then.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.649
- Were you sentenced?

00:03:45.684 --> 00:03:46.223
- Yes.

00:03:46.472 --> 00:03:47.911
- What was the charge?

00:03:47.946 --> 00:03:49.882
- That was... racketeering.

00:03:51.443 --> 00:03:55.627
I would like to go to work. I don't want to be involved in stupid things.

00:03:56.292 --> 00:03:57.571
- What are you doing now?

00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:00.752
- I am in like, odd jobs, but I am...

00:04:00.787 --> 00:04:04.182
...preparing for the real job, which will be continuous.

00:04:04.936 --> 00:04:06.978
Which will be every day.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:11.125
Please go after this. I was at the village fair at Vecsés.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.920
I was with policemen, there is proof that it weren't us.

00:04:14.955 --> 00:04:18.680
Two days ago, at five o'clock I did not expropriate a bicycle.

00:04:18.715 --> 00:04:20.520
This is all I wanted to tell.

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:24.004
We could not find the other perpetrator

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.156
Róbert Kolompár, aged 17.

00:04:26.388 --> 00:04:28.559
We could only talk to his family

00:04:28.594 --> 00:04:30.482
who were reluctant to speak.

00:04:30.517 --> 00:04:33.414
They said that the police might assault them if they did.

00:04:34.014 --> 00:04:35.838
- We don't want to be on camera.

00:04:35.873 --> 00:04:39.271
- Then the cops come and beat us dead here, unpunished!

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.639
- Do such things happen?

00:04:40.674 --> 00:04:43.690
- Sure, haven't you heard in other villages?

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:46.706
Policemen, detectives come with commandos...

00:04:46.741 --> 00:04:48.917
- We have enough trouble!

00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:52.158
So our fellow citizens, who live in extreme poverty

00:04:52.358 --> 00:04:55.226
are denying ever being in Budapest's 6th district.

00:04:55.674 --> 00:04:58.680
This CCTV camera could supply the necessary proof

00:04:59.028 --> 00:05:01.847
if it weren't just an empty dome.

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:09.203
Ten months after the events the police informed us

00:05:09.203 --> 00:05:11.782
about the suspension of the investigation.

00:05:11.782 --> 00:05:14.739
Attila Vidák and Róbert Kolompár who allegedly

00:05:14.739 --> 00:05:17.149
"didn't want to get into stupid things"

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:19.136
were now in jail in Austria.

00:05:19.423 --> 00:05:21.527
Seems the cameras worked there.

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:23.600
By the way, have you noticed

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.150
the number of wrecked bicycles in the background

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.872
behind Attila Vidák, who claims to have never stolen any?
