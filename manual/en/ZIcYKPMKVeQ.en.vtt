00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:01.734
&gt;&gt;[music]

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:04.333
&gt;&gt;As you come back to the
operator side of the vehicle,

00:00:04.333 --> 00:00:06.000
tell the operator
you are going

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.166
to do a walk-around
of the vehicle

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:10.233
and would like for the
service break to be applied

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:13.100
so air leaks can
be detected.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.400
Start with the driver's
side front wheel,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.066
listening for
obvious air leaks.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:22.033
Look at the fuel tank,
steps, and mounting.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.867
Listen for air leaks
and proceed down

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:27.734
the side of the trailer
to trailer axels.

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:31.266
Check each wheel for lug
nuts, break drum nuts,

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.734
and rim
cracks.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:35.934
Check the tail gate
closing mechanism

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:38.600
and proceed down the
passenger side of the truck,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.800
again checking the
rear tandem tires,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.867
or tread deck,
1/30 second,

00:00:44.867 --> 00:00:47.333
knots, cuts, and
checking wheels

00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:51.667
for lug nuts, axel
nuts, and rim cracks.

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.533
Continue to listen
for air leaks.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.200
As you approach the
cab, check to make sure

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.133
your covers
are intact.

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:02.533
Check your heat shields,
and exhaust system.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.033
Look at the cab mounts and
steps as you climb up

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:07.667
to check the glad
hands on the truck.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.100
Check the red
emergency air line,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.033
then check the blue
service air line.

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:15.200
Also, look at
some accessories.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.300
The tail gate control,
and axel control.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.667
Look at the
light connection

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:22.700
and check the ladder
that they're secure.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.533
Check the pogo
stick, making sure

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.500
all the lines are
free from touching

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.600
any of the drive train
axels or wheels.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.734
As you climb down, check
the windows and hand holes

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:36.100
as you move down the
side of the truck.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.467
Check the tank, door,
the mirrors and windows,

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:43.633
checking the
air tanks,

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:47.900
making sure they're
securely mounted.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.066
Check the passenger front
wheel for tire tread depth,

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.166
2/30 secondth
of an inch.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:54.834
Check the break
drum bolts

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.767
and the wedges of the
wheel bolts and rims.

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.000
Look at the
seating ring

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.867
that there are no
bends or fractures.

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:06.834
&gt;&gt;Tony!

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:07.367
&gt;&gt;Yes.

00:02:07.367 --> 00:02:08.367
You got your
door for me?

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:09.767
&gt;&gt;We're going to
check your, uh,

00:02:09.767 --> 00:02:13.166
low air pressure
warning now.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:15.166
&gt;&gt;Go back up to the
operator's compartment,

00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:17.700
and ask the operator
to turn on the key

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.667
and apply the
service break until

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:22.667
the low air warning
alarm is activated.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:25.867
This should occur at
approximately 55 psi

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:28.767
and below, or one
half of the governor

00:02:28.767 --> 00:02:32.266
cut-out pressure,
whichever is less.

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:35.433
Have the operator continue
to apply the service break

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:39.700
until the maxi sets up on
both tractor and trailer.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.433
Many newer trucks
may activate

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:44.700
at a higher
pressure.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.433
&gt;&gt;Tony, I want to check
the jacket's brake

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.967
on the
truck.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:58.400
&gt;&gt;[engine sounds]

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.567
&gt;&gt;Tony, I'm going to
have you set

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:02.266
your trailer breaks, and
then I'm going go back

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.166
and see if you
have any air

00:03:04.166 --> 00:03:05.700
that's set up to your
tractor breaks.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.100
Just the trailer
breaks only.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.433
I'm checking the tractor
protection valve.

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:11.000
So leave your
trailer set up

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.934
and your tractor's
on, alright?

00:03:12.934 --> 00:03:14.333
&gt;&gt;Alright.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:16.934
&gt;&gt;And I'll be right
back with you.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:22.867
&gt;&gt;[music]

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.767
&gt;&gt;Very
good.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:26.633
&gt;&gt;Ask the operator
to start the truck,

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:29.500
and build the air
pressure back up.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.200
Once the air is built
up, ask the operator

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.834
to apply the
service break.

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:36.934
Then remove
the chocks.

00:03:36.934 --> 00:03:39.533
Ask the operator to
set the trailer break,

00:03:39.533 --> 00:03:42.100
and gently move the
tractor back-and-forth,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.900
so you can
observe the play

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.000
in the fifth wheel,
half-inch maximum.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.200
Stay clear
of the truck

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.200
while checking
for movement.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.133
When inspecting a tandem
truck, the inspection

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:01.200
procedures are the same as
that of a tractor trailer.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.433
The only exception would
be raising the bed

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:06.533
in order to look at the
rails, bed bracing,

00:04:06.533 --> 00:04:09.900
and the point where the bed
attaches to the truck.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.467
If the inspection
is clean,

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:13.367
without any
problems,

00:04:13.367 --> 00:04:16.500
then we'll let the
operator continue to work.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.567
However, if we
find problems,

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:21.100
we'll ask the operator
to step down,

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.233
and we'll point out
each specific problem

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:25.433
we found with
the truck.

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:26.734
&gt;&gt;I'm going to issue
you two citations

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:27.600
on your
truck.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.300
One for the fire
extinguisher,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.834
and the other one
on your front

00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:36.500
passenger side
tandem wheel.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.667
You have a grease
leak inside the wheel.

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:42.233
There's actually grease
on the shoe itself.

00:04:42.233 --> 00:04:46.367
And I'll need you to,
you know, clean that out.

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:47.667
I'm going to issue
you a citation

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.133
but I'm going to let
you run, however,

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:52.433
because you're running
on very small grades.

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:56.066
It's mostly flat traffic,
in-and out loading.

00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:58.567
And I'll give you until
tomorrow to fix things.

00:04:58.567 --> 00:04:59.600
Is that
okay?

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.433
&gt;&gt;Alright.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:01.400
&gt;&gt;Do you have any
questions about

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.266
the citations I'm
going to issue you?

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:04.767
&gt;&gt;No, I
don't.

00:05:04.767 --> 00:05:05.767
&gt;&gt;Well.

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.800
I'll let you
continue your work.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.233
And uh, I'll fix
your citations up.

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:11.734
And then after you
load and head out,

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:13.767
I'll give them to
you on your way out.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:15.867
I'll be out tomorrow
morning to, uh,

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:17.100
check your
trucks,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.333
and see if you've got
everything taken care of.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:19.934
Uh...

00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:22.300
I'll ask you to
get in and fire up.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.100
Let me get my
chocks out of it.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.600
And once I get my chocks
out of the truck,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.066
then you're
free to go.

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:27.734
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:05:27.734 --> 00:05:28.500
&gt;&gt;Thank you very
much sir, buddy.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.533
And have a good
day, okay?

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:32.100
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.567
&gt;&gt;A break function test
should be done each shift

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:37.166
as part of your
pre-operational check.

00:05:37.166 --> 00:05:38.266
The truck
should be empty

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:40.834
while being tested
on an incline.

00:05:40.834 --> 00:05:42.467
&gt;&gt;[music]

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:43.900
&gt;&gt;Once your
truck is loaded,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.066
do a break function
test on level ground

00:05:46.066 --> 00:05:51.066
before doing it
on an incline.

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:53.600
This Best practice card has a
pre-operation inspection

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.367
