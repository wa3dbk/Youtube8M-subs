or less can't be sold within conquered
understand you could drive to the next

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.990
out over and by one this is after a
three-year campaign by local activists

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.980
they want to reduce

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.849
reduce fossil fuel use so on and so
forth according to the e_p_a_ in twenty

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.769
ten the u_s_ generated thirty one
million tons of plastic weight

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.110
so what do you think about this if you
have a plastic bottle

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.950
uh... but he saw one of these bottles

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.320
the first offense is it warning then you
get a twenty five dollar fine and then

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.420
for the third successive violations you
get fifty dollar fines each time

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.420
congress health division staff

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.980
are in charge of enforcing the ban a lot
of people are happy they're saying

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.630
businesses are working around this by
selling larger bottles since the rules

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.560
only focus on smaller ones

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.290
uh... people are some of you know
walking over to the next jalan

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.960
i think that as convenient

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.060
as those single use water bottles are
this is just a small change in attitude

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.240
and you could really reduce waste
significant will bottled water is a huge

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.720
problem

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.900
right i've read and not end and i
remember the natural resource depletion

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.360
that's going on to entire lakes being
about sucked dry

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.530
uh... yet this is a step in the right
direction it's never going to happen at

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.350
the federal level

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.590
uh... so we've individual towns start
doing this and it starts spreading

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.020
i mean just automatically your your
doing what the the feds won't do here's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.100
the problem

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.460
you go to a gas station in concord mass

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.790
you're thirsty

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.560
you have to buy a thirty-five allen's
water bottle because that's what the law

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.120
says

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.330
for much less money

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.130
you get yourself a sixteen allen's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.759
you by the soda next thing you know
obesity rates skyrocket

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.110
what we the vast majority of these uh...

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.640
gas stations

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.959
to your water bottles

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.370
large water bottles

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.409
uh... become in plastic which can still
be sold that's what i'm saying but if

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.679
someone wants eight drink when you
wouldn't buy the two gallon thing a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.200
water gallant and you know you wouldn't
buy the large water if you can get the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.940
best of all soda for cheap and i am just
saying

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.999
it could redirect people to sodas which
are a huge problem

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:23.400
uh... in this case if this is the only
time doing it their i think that's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.199
exactly what will happen

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:29.129
i mean they're trying to set an example
if more can start doing this

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.180
gas stations these companies will start
buying

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.659
drinks from manufactures that use class
and other whatever other things but you

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.089
know that hard

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:40.799
paper cardboard it's you sometimes yeah

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.309
so that's how you that they may change
the broader question of timing is to

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.869
what level

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:46.890
of minutiae

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.549
should the government be involved and
sizes for sodas in new york city size of

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.599
plastic water bottles in concord let's
talk about the slippery slope because it

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.780
probably a a legitimate question here to
what extent should the government even

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.840
involved in this

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.750
well i mean it's hard not to see um...
disability despina bland position

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.459
because of the problem is plastic
bottles

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.819
uh... mate it doesn't make too much
sense to me to be in

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.450
the ones that have the least plastic and
if you allow the ones with the most

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.200
plastic the two leader bottles on the
shelves so

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.760
by understand it's a precedent

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.839
but it's only going to really work

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:26.099
if eventually almost all plastic bottles
are you know abolished in

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.609
parking constable
