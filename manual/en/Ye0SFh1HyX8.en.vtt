The next thing I'm going to show you is, how
to apply eyeliner. I'm going to use a black

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:08.090
eye shadow with an angle brush, and that's
going to give you that really soft look in

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.200
eyeliner. If you want something a little more
dramatic, you can use a liquid eyeliner or

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.830
a pencil, but I really like the way that the,
the eye shadow looks, because it's just softer

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.410
and it also holds up really well throughout
the day. So, I'm going to show you how to

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.269
do that. I'm going to take a piece of tissue
and hold it under her eye so the black dust

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.170
doesn't fall on her face, when I'm doing this.
And then, you want to just dip your angle

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.690
brush in there, and close your eyes, Alex.
And then, you want to just apply right along

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:52.680
the lashes, so just take your angle brush,
and push it right into the lash line, and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.300
that's going to give you a nice fused eyeliner,
and it's going to really frame her eye shape.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.951
And the tissues going to catch any extra dust
that falls. And I'm going to go on with the

00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:24.920
other eye, look up. And just really work it
in to the lash line. Try to stay as close

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.360
to the lash line as possible, so you won't
have any space, and it will give you the illusion

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:40.890
of having a really full, thick, eyelashes.
OK. OK, open, and look up and that way. I

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.740
like to get the inner corners too, because
I like the way that it just makes your eye

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.560
shape, just really pop out. Now, look up in
that way. So, just look up, and to the side,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.090
and take your brush and just go right in there.
And then, I'm going to lightly go back in,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.869
with that purple color, underneath her eyes.
Look up. Against the lashes, and that's going

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:16.260
to give that really pretty, soft liner on
the bottom. So, all I did for that, was I

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.769
took my brush, the same brush, and just wiped
the extra black eye shadow off, and then go

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:32.599
in with your purple, and go right underneath
the lashes.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:39.689
And this brush is going to give it a little
more intense delivery, with the color, because

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:51.230
it's a stiffer brush than the fluffy brush,
so it's going to be a little darker. OK? And

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.279
then, you can always take your tissue and
just kind of clean up the edges if you like.

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.409
And that's how you do the eyeliner.
