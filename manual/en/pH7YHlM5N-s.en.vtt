00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.970
Cars.com auto review

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.150
hi I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars dot com
we're looking at a 2012

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.830
Bentley Continental GT now this is a
2012

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.130
the last time they saw this car was a
2010 that's because they redesigned it

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.930
completely

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.000
this is a car that starts at a hundred
ninety thousand dollars

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.460
as tested our car just .217

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.080
to the casual observer the styling my
not seem that different but there are

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.900
some changes

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.020
the grill is a little bit more up right
hom

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.640
actually a little criticism I still
think it looks a little bit cheap and

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.750
plasticky upset about Jaguar said about
Bentley before

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.239
grills tend to be plastic they don't
have to look that way now they're also

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:44.390
new LED

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.850
daytime running lights here and some
other subtle changes to the headlights

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.330
now the previous generation 19-inch
wheels were standard and twenties are

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.980
optional

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.809
and this one 20-inch wheels are standard
our test car has

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.809
21 you would think that might make a
ride poorly

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.449
actually rights pretty nicely some of the other changes

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.649
include more creases cut lines in the
car itself

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.280
com I think it actually makes a big
difference makes the car look a little

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.149
bit less like

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:15.290
the world's fastest bar of soap

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.390
the interior was updated as well one of
the things we complain most about

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.340
the previous generation was an outdated
navigation and control system with real

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.979
buttons on either side to display

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.830
now it's touchscreen much better but not
perfect show you why

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.509
up there a lot of delays when you head a
button

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.240
the screen comes up then you had another
button on the menu

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.770
wait a second many peeps and then it
goes to what you wanted in the first

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.330
place

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.300
not ideal not usually I enjoy running
off the list

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.729
up extremely expensive options on cars
like this %uh

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.390
this time around our test car has like
an option package that hides everything

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.520
very clever Bentley one thing I can point
out though

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.920
things like contrast stitching here 1800
bucks

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.599
you want more stitching thousands more
the 2012 is also a better driving car

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.990
than the previous generation

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.479
I think it feels lighter and that's for
a few different reasons for one thing

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.480
more power that has a 6 liter to put up
567 horsepower

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.870
that it sends to all four wheels so all
that power gets there

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.489
0-60 comes in about 4.5 seconds a second
reason is the car actually has lost some

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.410
weight about 150 pounds which

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.800
that counts %ah and the third reason is
the all-wheel-drive now sends

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.530
more power to the rear than the front
which really helps to balance the car

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.930
when you power out at the turn

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.700
it just makes car feel much lighter than
it is now with the redesign also comes

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.140
more backs a leg room its

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.670
largely because of a redesign in the
front seat you flip the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.099
back escorted motors on your way
automatically once you're seated

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.469
so nice rocker switch air to move the
seat back I'm six feet tall I have  enough

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.010
headroom

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.299
leg rooms decent enough to give the
person I thought

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.859
some space up the improvement I'll take
it

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:04.340
well unfortunately there's been a slight
decrease in the trunk lie about a half

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.730
cubic foot to 12.6 cubic feet

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.310
calm down you can still fit your golf
clubs in there

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.900

other aspects of the Continental GT
