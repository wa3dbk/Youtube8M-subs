00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:11.410
Okay, so now we need to make some soil mix
to plant our rudbeckia in. I'm going to take

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.930
some of this existing soil, which is sort
of a sandy mix, along with some of my rich

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.710
hummus here, which is a nice dark mix. We
need to add this to help retain moisture and

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:36.900
to put some organic matter in there. It's
one part of hummus, one part of your existing

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.780
soil, and one part peat moss. This is the
nice peat moss that is a little bit more lightweight

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.829
and will help those roots be able to root
in better because it's not so heavy and dense.

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.930
I'm also going to add a little bit of lime.
Lime helps take some of the acidicness out

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.470
of the soil and help sweeten the soil a bit.
I'm also going to add some garden gypsum.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.460
I like gypsum in all my mixes because it helps
loosen up any kind of clay soil that might

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.590
be in the bottom of my hole, and some phosphorus,
about a tablespoon. A little bit of extra

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.600
is not going to hurt. Finally, I'm going to
add some of this terra sorb gel, which helps

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.100
the soil hold moisture better. It's a crystal
powder, and once it gets wet it's going to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.560
expand and hold the moisture. You only need
a tiny little bit for a hole this size. Once

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.619
that gets in there, I'm going to combine it
all together and really mix it well. I'm going

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.659
to get out any lumps that might be in there
and I'm going to stir it up as best as I can

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.259
so it's all evenly combined, hence it being
mixed.
