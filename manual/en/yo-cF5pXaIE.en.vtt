00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.559
When it comes to his patients UK
Healthcare Labor and Delivery Nurse

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.699
Jerry Pang has one goal in mind.

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:15.299
I want to give my patients

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.850
an experience

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.189
they won't get anywhere else.
For the UK College of Nursing

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.809
alum a typical day is work starts in
the locker room

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:30.519
where he prepares for the day ahead by grabbing an
instrument he calls crucial to his job.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.500
I have four useless at home and I keep one 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.680
here

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.030
in the hospital.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.260
It turns out Jerry's hobby comes in
handy while he's on the clock.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.160
Usually before they are in labor I will tell them
tell them

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.100
this is the motivation

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670
if you can deliver the baby while I'm still here 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.850
I'll sing to you and your baby

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.930
so sometimes they might push harder so they can delivery the baby

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.940
while I am still at work.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.370
But if not he'll still make time to fulfill
his promise.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.590
I'll just to back after they have moved

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.590
to the mother baby unit so I can sing to them. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020
As he's doing today for a baby

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.770
Aiden and his family.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.759
"Oh my baby, oh my baby, I'm so happy

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.920
to hold you...

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.420
Music is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.500
a nice way to celebrate.  But Jerry
actually started this tradition as an

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.980
act of comfort for a mother didn't have
a happy ending.  At one time 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.690
I sang to a patient who

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.280
lost her body

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.570
So i went back to check on her and

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.210
I said I will sing to you

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.540
and her family and 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.510
her, they really thought it was a good idea.  

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.900
to make that experience a positive one

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.670
instead of a negative experience.  So I did sing to them 
and they really appreciated

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.359
what I did.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.029
He says most of this performances now
center around the joy of new life.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.640
The most popular one 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.360
is Happy Birthday.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.819
Happy Birthday 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.150
to you

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.339
Happy Birthday to you...

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:30.339
because we just had a baby born. 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.260
Another one is Somewhere Over the Rainbow

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.509
I have different songs 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.819
for Christmas, Valentines Day,

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.779
Easter, so even if I don't have a good voice, 

00:02:54.779 --> 00:02:57.859
I think they, my patients appreciate

00:02:57.859 --> 00:02:59.009
that I am 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.640
willing to take the time of to
come back and

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.590
to sing to them and their babies.  
Though his target audience, a newborn isn't

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.840
usually the most responsive, Jerry likes
knowing that he's helping a new life

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.439
began on a positive note.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.379
I think seeing them holding 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.739
the baby

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.779
in their arms

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:22.229
I know I 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.239
made a difference in someone else's life.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.239
I will always love you...

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:37.450
For UK Now

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.070
I'm Amy Jones.
