00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.519
Science Fiction has lived long and prospered
on film and television for years, but

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.840
in the last few decades video games have been
taking the genre to exciting new

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.199
heights by letting players explore imaginative
worlds for themselves. The Mass Effect Trilogy

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.150
is one of the best examples of this trend,
but you may be surprised to find that it draws

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.859
on past sci-fi franchises in more ways than
you initially realized, which has led to countless

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.760
references you might’ve missed. One such
reference can be stumbled upon if

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.740
Commander Shepard orders a drink on the Citadel
in Mass Effect 2…

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.800
This is... It's green?

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.720
“And guaranteed to knock you on your ass.”

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.190
The phrase “it’s green” is a clever
nod to Star Trek, a franchise that Mass Effect

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
is very familiar with. A variation of that
line appears a few times. First, in the original

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.469
series when Scotty says the line while distracting
an intoxicated alien villain; and then

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.750
again in Star Trek: The Next Generation where
Data says the same thing to a now

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.170
elderly Scotty.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.420
You probably knew that Matriarch Benezia from
the first Mass Effect was voiced by Star Trek’s

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.890
Marina Sirtis, who played Counselor Troi on
The Next Generation. However, you may not

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.660
know that the Salarian who served on the Citadel
Council was voiced by Armin Shimerman, who

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.539
played a certain greedy Ferengi (Fuh-rang
-ee) in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. In fact,

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.560
Mass Effect’s connection to the franchise
runs so deeply that --according to the developers--

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.640
an entire storyline had to be dropped from
the first game because it featured aliens

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.119
who were “exactly like this particular race
in Star Trek". To this day, the details of

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.419
this lost story have never been released.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.979
Bringing things up to the twenty-first century,
there are a few shout-outs to the cult classic

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.709
Firefly to be found in the series. The Blue
Suns mercenary group is thought to be a reference

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:56.229
to the Blue Sun Corporation, a system-wide
company whose dark shadow and strong political

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.099
influence is implied throughout the show.
Although the Blue Sun of Firefly is not a

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.759
mercenary group, both organizations share
a ruthless and mysterious nature. That’s

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.239
not the only thing these series have in common--
both universes also share an event called

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.610
the “Unification War”. In Mass Effect,
the Unification War was a bitter civil war

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.230
that was fought between Turians. In Firefly,
it was a bitter civil war fought between humans.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.099
Another possible Firefly reference is Mass
Effect’s planet named “New Canton”,

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.579
this distant world could be inspired by Canton
from the show, as both are frontier planets

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.140
on the edges of space. Firefly fans may remember
it as the planet where The Man They Call Jayne

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.000
Cobb is worshipped as a hero.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.969
Speaking of Jayne, the actor who portrayed
him, Adam Baldwin, actually appears in Mass

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.290
Effect 2 as Kal Reegar, a marine of the Migrant
Fleet.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.260
BBC’s popular Doctor Who series also gets
a small shout-out in the Mass Effect 3 Collector’s

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.069
Edition, where you can find a robot dog by
the name of Kei-9 [pronounced canine], this

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.269
is thought to be a nod to the Doctor’s companion
K-9, who has appeared on-and-off throughout

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.890
the show since 1977.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.040
Mass Effect is a military sci-fi set hundreds
of years into the future, so we often find

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.959
it mirroring our own world’s proud military
traditions. The Normandy operates as a navy

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.859
vessel would, so it comes as no surprise that
the folks at Bioware took the opportunity

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.799
to reference The Hunt For Red October not
once, but twice. When Joker activates the

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.049
stealth drive on the Normandy he says this…

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.519
“The only way they'll notice us is if everyone
starts singing the Russian national anthem.”

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.620
Joker is referring to a famous scene in the
film where a submarine crew does just that

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.790
and is picked up by American sub sonar. The
other reference also comes courtesy of Joker,

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.780
when he tells us that he sometimes gets the
urge to pull a Crazy Ivan, which is a real

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.040
Navy maneuver that is best known for being
used in The Hunt For Red October.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.489
That’s not the only place it shows up though,
as Joker’s fellow space pilot Wash executes

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:48.810
this maneuver in the first episode of Firefly.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.109
Gritty sci-fi video games are probably not
the first place you would search when looking

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.400
for references to comedies, but the team at
Bioware seemed to love one so much they named

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.730
an entire planet after it. In the Mass Effect
3 Leviathan DLC, you can find a Turian planet

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.840
called “Triginta Petra”. In Latin , “triginta”
means “thirty” and in Greek, the word

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.010
“petra” translates as “rock”. A reference
to Tina Fey’s Emmy winning TV show 30 Rock.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.169
During your downtime on the Citadel, you have
probably found yourself in the Dark Star Lounge

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:21.320
on quite a few occasions. Many believe that
the bar is named after the 1974 John Carpenter

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.220
film “Dark Star”, which follows a spaceship
crew tasked with the unusual job of blowing

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.810
up empty planets.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.590
Lastly, there’s the character of Ashley
Williams, who many fans believe to be a reference

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.940
to The Evil Dead, this is because she shares
her name with Ash Williams, the main character

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.260
of the series. She also refers to her shotgun
as a “boomstick”; which recalls a famous

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.220
line in the third Evil Dead film, Army of
Darkness. In fact, this scene is so beloved

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.260
by the developers, that it got its own game
mechanic. Next time you play Mass Effect 3

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.860
while hooked up to a Kinect try yelling “boomstick”,
you may just find something interesting.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.700
Unless you are like me and saved Kaidan because Ashley is a racist.

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.040
You 
thought you knew Mass Effect, but hopefully
you’ve learned just a thing or two more.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.600

Thanks for watching this episode of Mass Effect

Be sure to follow ShoddyCast on Twitter, find

the pronunciation of your favorite Star Trek
character by finding me on twitter at arhourigan.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:35.980
Now, believe it or not, this damn video needs
calibrating.
