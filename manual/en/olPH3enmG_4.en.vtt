00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:10.270
nonameanca from the Internets asks

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.670
How do Koreans flirt,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.480
and what's appropriate for a girl to do and what's inappropriate?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.810
As for what's inappropriate, that's very easy.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.510
BUBBLE BUBBLE BUBBLE POP 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.420
BUBBLE BUBBLE POP POP

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.360
YOOHOO!

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.880
Meow!  Meow!  Meow!

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.800
AAAAAAARRRRGGGGHHH

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.220
That is inappropriate.  Probably won't help you out

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.400
Unless you find a guy like this

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.740
AAAAAAARRRRGGGGHHH

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.040
Yeah, those were inappropriate, weren't they?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950
Bad ideas.  I don't think anyone would like that in Korea.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.160
Or...in North America

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.550
Maybe in some places in North America

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.980
Simon and Martina ville

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.680
Virginia...and Virginians.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.890
You're scary.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.310
We don't know a single Virginian

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.120
Do you know a Virginian?  I don't know any Virginians!

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.630
So what's weird about this question is that

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.440
it's not that Koreans don't flirt,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.250
It's just that North American style flirting

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.560
is so different than Korean style flirting.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.860
It's difficult to say that it's flirting in the same term.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.700
You don't really have that upfront, cocky, pickup line attitude.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.500
As soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.140
And ask you what yo interests are.  WHO YOU BE WITH

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.760
Things that make you smile...what numbers to dial?

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.840
I love it when you call me Big Oppa!

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.360
Throw your hands in the air, 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.780
and do your homework at the hagwons.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.380
Ahem.  Yes: there aren't pickup lines like that.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.880
Ok so the first thing that we have to say

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880
is that we didn't actually flirt with any Korean people here

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.810
because we're very faithfully married to each other,

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.820
so we had to ask our Korean friends

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.320
who date Korean people for their input.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.660
And we got their input from both our foreign friends who dated Korean people

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.280
and from Korean people dating Korean people.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.790
So say you at the club right,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.420
and you see this real fine honey

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.320
and you want to pick her up:

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.000
instead of giving her a cheesy pickup line,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.300
you gotta talk about what your social status is.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.910
Whoa Whoa Whoa Whoa what just happened to your accent?

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.540
It just faded away gangster

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840
Well I'm gradually civilizing myself.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.340
Ok so for example you might say

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.160
OH YER SO BYUUTIFUL

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.250
You look so nice!

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.980
I'd love to take you out on a date somewhere nice.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.890
#1 Social status important thing: having a car!

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.790
So having a car is really important, 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.890
because a lot of girls will want to be seen in a car

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.610
with a tall, good looking Korean guy,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.330
but, unfortunately, if you're not a tall Korean guy and you have a car,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.530
that might not work anyways.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.730
So what we've been told is that 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.670
this is kind of just for the shallow girls that you see at the club

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.470
not that only shallow girls go to clubs

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.070
but if you're trying to pick up somebody 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.890
for not, like, really a decent relationship

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.910
then you gotta talk about your car and your looks and your money and stuff

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.710
Like your watch and your expensive tie

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.620
You see this bling?  No?  

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.510
I don't have any bling.  I'm married!

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.760
But is that flaunting social status really that different from North America?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.150
I personally don't think so.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.850
Two shallow people will meet each other via shallow means.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.070
And be shallow together

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.190
and be like YEAH WE'VE GOT MONEY.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.790
Let's go do shallow things and we don't really like each other!

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.210
However, what is different, is that Korean people

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.620
tend to give out phone numbers pretty easily.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.430
because the process afterwards, the text messaging process

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.940
is very different than North Americans.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.440
This is really interesting.  This is what our friends told us.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.170
So, in North America, you have the 3 or 4 day call rule.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.870
Like, you know, you get someone's number

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.280
and you don't call them or text them

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.390
after like a couple of days you call them

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.320
Here, it's inverted:

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.220
for the first three days you have to text message as much as possible.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.420
It should be small talk, like, they said things like

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.750
"Oh!  It's pretty hot today.  I hope you're doing ok"

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.580
Or, like "Oh!  What's up tonight?  Are you hanging out with your friends?"

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.790
that kind of, like, small chat.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.010
So if you don't do a lot of text messaging within those three days

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.700
It shows that you're not interested

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.830
And you don't look like a creepy stalker

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.240
because you've been playing the rules of the game accordingly.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.950
Now, stepping away from the club life

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.160
say you're not a clubby person

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.570
Say you want to ask someone out say,

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.080
at like a university or a coffee shop

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.980
So, unless you already know the person,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.580
like, they're a friend of yours or something,

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.610
or unless you're being set up by somebody 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.630
like, on a blind date, it doesn't really happen.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.450
Koreans don't really walk up to strangers

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.950
and interact in hopes of forming a better relationship.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.550
It just doesn't seem to happen.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.860
Yeah, it doesn't seem like you can have a one day thing.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.690
Like, you're at a coffee shop and you see this beautiful guy or girl

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.490
and you kind of go up and start chatting with them

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.520
It just doesn't seem to happen.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.240
It seems like you have to know them 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.240
for an extended amount of time first

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.950
Ok, so say you've hung out with this person for a long time

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.270
And you want to take the relationship to the next level.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.370
That's where the adorable confession comes in.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.180
If you guys read any manga or manhwa

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.210
or any drama fans or anything like that

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.510
And if you guise have ever been to elementary school as well

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.630
Be quiet!  It's adorable

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.250
The confession is actually really real in Korea

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.350
DO YOU LIKE ME!  YES/NO/MAYBE

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.950
It's really cute!  I want to tell you a story from my friend.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.170
So if there's this really cute girl and you like her

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.190
and you've talked a lot with her

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.390
and you're going on a break between university class

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.000
You can get her like a little can of coffee that she might like

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.030
and you can like, write a note to her about liking her

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.330
and then you can stick it on the coffee can

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.460
and leave it at her seat

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.760
so that when she comes back she finds this can of coffee

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.590
with, like, something on it

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.190
That kind of thing is apparently common

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.310
with leaving confession notes in lockers and stuff like that.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.630
So there is another subtle way of flirting

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.230
which I think exists in North America as well

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:47.460
And that's the concept of, like, taking care of the person

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.650
For example, if you're going to class with somebody

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.170
and you're getting a coffee to study

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.380
you might always offer to pay

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.120
or if they look thirsty in class you might always bring them a water

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.820
Kind of like that oppa idea,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.030
showing that you're paying attention to them

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.230
and that you want to take care of them

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.440
So, in other words, you're their Sugar Daddy.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.850
What the?  What if I want sugar free cola?

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.070
Well then you're their Aspartame daddy.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.590
OH YEAH!

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.800
Causing cancer!  Oooh!  Brain rot!

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.490
Oh!  And we forgot to answer the part about girls flirting in Korea

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.210
Right.  Right!  They don't flirt

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.410
They're flirted upon

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.610
But they don't really flirt.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.530
Now, these were only our small window of experiences

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.220
via our friends living in Korea

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.170
so if you have other experiences of flirting in Korea

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.070
we'd love to know about it in the comment section.

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.680
Write a fan fiction WHAT WHO SAID THAT?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.090
So that's it for this week's TLDR

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.290
if there's a question you want us to answer for next TLDR

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.230
leave your question in the Google Moderator page

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.930

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.490
We totally forgot about the most important pickup line.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.570
AYYY GIRL!  CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK!

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.110
Korean men all over Korea do this.  It's very common.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.710
Oh yeah.  Especially in aprons.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.510
I lied.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.360
GONG!

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.960
Sexy intoxicating music.
