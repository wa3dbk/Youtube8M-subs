The Breakfast Effect

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.173
Many people believe that the food served

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:09.510
in the national school meals programs
is not healthy.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.763
But actually school meals,
including school breakfast,

00:00:12.763 --> 00:00:16.266
must meet specific nutritional requirements for calories,

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:19.061
protein, calcium,
and more.

00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:22.314
Dr. Jay Bhattacharya at Stanford University has studied

00:00:22.314 --> 00:00:25.525
how school breakfast affects children's nutrition.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.818
In 2006,

00:00:26.818 --> 00:00:30.197
he published a paper showing that children
who eat school breakfast

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.951
are more likely to consume adequate
amounts of important vitamins,

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.702
fiber,
and potassium.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:37.955
He also found that eating school breakfast

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:41.375
decreased the number of calories from fat
that children consumed.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:42.543
So why,
he wondered,

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.628
have past studies found the opposite,

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:47.547
that eating school breakfast
made children's diets worse?

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.467
There's been some concern in the policy community

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.969
and also in the research community

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.762
that providing School Breakfast

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.098
may actually make things worse.

00:00:56.098 --> 00:01:00.978
In the poor populations that often are eligible
for School Breakfast,

00:01:00.978 --> 00:01:02.813
there is a big obesity problem,

00:01:02.813 --> 00:01:05.148
and people are concerned
that providing extra calories

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.192
could make things worse
in terms of obesity

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:10.028
and some other nutritional outcomes.

00:01:10.028 --> 00:01:13.323
So I was motivated to look at this
to see whether this was true,

00:01:13.323 --> 00:01:16.118
whether if you look at a broad set
of nutritional outcomes,

00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:18.245
are nutritional outcomes really worse?

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.830
Because it seems counter-intuitive;

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.082
you would expect that School Breakfast
would improve outcomes.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.586
And I wanted to see whether there is
statistical evidence to support that.

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:28.463
In general, the problem
with the earlier literature

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:32.968
is that they didn't tease apart
the causal effect of School Breakfast.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:35.721
They intermingled the effect of poverty

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.724
with the effect of School Breakfast,
all together.

00:01:38.724 --> 00:01:40.100
And as a result,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.604
they weren't carefully isolating the effect
of School Breakfast.

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.523
And if you don't do that,
then you can sometimes conclude

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:50.235
that you get a negative effect

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.405
between school meals and nutritional outcomes.

00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:56.575
Dr. Bhattacharya also learned
that the school breakfast program

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:59.536
influences not just the children
who are eating school breakfast,

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.413
but their families
as well.

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:02.956
In fact, his paper concludes

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:05.625
that the School Breakfast Program
is an important tool

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.296
for improving the diets of children and their families.

00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.214
Similarly,
in 2009,

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.551
Mary Kay Crepensik and her team
at Mathematica Policy Research

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:17.471
conducted a study to see
whether eating school breakfast

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:21.016
increased the amount of nutrients
that children were getting in their diets.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.101
What we learned about the relationship

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:25.062
between School Breakfast participation

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:26.980
and children's nutrient intakes

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.816
was that School Breakfast participants

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.527
tended to have higher average intakes

00:02:32.527 --> 00:02:35.781
of several vitamins and minerals.

00:02:35.781 --> 00:02:41.244
They were also more likely
to have adequate intakes

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:46.375
of these vitamins relative to their requirements.

00:02:46.375 --> 00:02:47.501
Her study claims that,

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:49.836
although school breakfast did not contribute

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.923
excessive fat or saturated fat to children's diets,

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:57.427
these meals could be made even healthier
by decreasing the levels of fat,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:59.221
saturated fat,
and sodium.

00:02:59.221 --> 00:03:00.931
And, in fact,
in 2013,

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:03.517
the federal government rolled out new guidelines

00:03:03.517 --> 00:03:07.229
that now require school breakfasts
to be lower in fat and sodium.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:09.606
The guidelines also require school breakfasts

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:11.692
to include more whole grains and fruit,

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:14.111
and meet rigorous calorie limits.

00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:15.779
These results are encouraging,

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.531
but there's still more to learn.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:21.368
How will the new federal nutrition requirements
affect students' diets?

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:23.703
How does participation
in the School Breakfast Program

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:27.249
shape long-term nutrition
and patterns of consumption?

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:30.711
And how can we modify the implementation
of the School Breakfast Program

00:03:30.711 --> 00:03:33.004
to further improve nutrition?

00:03:33.004 --> 00:03:35.048
Regardless of these additional questions,

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.884
this collection of scientific evidence
makes a strong case

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:41.722
for the benefits of the School Breakfast Program
on child nutrition.

00:03:41.722 --> 00:03:44.015
And with the new,
more rigorous nutrition guidelines

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.351
for the school breakfast program
being implemented,

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.605
we may see even more benefits to children
and their families in the future.
