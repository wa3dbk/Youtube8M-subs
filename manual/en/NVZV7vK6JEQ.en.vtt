00:00:29.584 --> 00:00:31.245
Those texts were a mistake!

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.720
W-What I meant to say was

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.577
I wanted to see you SEE you again.

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:36.390
Not SMELL you again...

Heh heh...

00:00:38.045 --> 00:00:39.216

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:40.661
And I suppose

00:00:40.828 --> 00:00:42.132
THIS WORD

00:00:42.132 --> 00:00:44.042
was a mistake TOO?!

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.663

Mr. Moss

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.887
I think what you were TRYING to say

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:04.298
is that you are looking for a JOB.

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:07.497
Yes that too. I - I meannn...

00:01:07.497 --> 00:01:08.620

Very well.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.345
It just so happens

00:01:11.345 --> 00:01:12.616
that our current soccer coach

00:01:12.616 --> 00:01:13.549
is in the hospital with

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.833
injuries to the face.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.579
out of intensive care yet?

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.854
Yeah, is he gonna need

00:01:41.854 --> 00:01:43.672
