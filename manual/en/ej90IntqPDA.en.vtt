00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Sometimes in our lives,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we experience sadness after being overjoyed.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That daughter of yours who haven't done anything good can't live here!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What will you say? That you're pregnant and I'm the father?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes, I'm pregnant.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You've got lots of men and you just chose me, right. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Even if that child is mine, I don't want to have a kid with you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I saw Lazaro.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
That one who got you pregnant?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I want them to pay. I want them to feel how difficult it is for a parent 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
not to be able to give a good life for her child. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Where is our child?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I'm sure you will be able to sell this one for a good price. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Don't let that come closer to me or else that child would go to heaven early. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Just do what you want.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh so you're still alive. You haven't showed up for many years. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm sorry but I just want a favor from you. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'll just leave that with you for now. You'll gonna take care of her.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll raise you as a nice, helpful and a kid who has fear of the Lord. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In celebration of the 60th Year of television, we will relive the soap opera 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that has touched the hearts of the Filipinos.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
She will grow up with a good heart with his recognized father.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Tay (Dad)! Wake up! Tay! Wake up!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Come on, shake it! There, my tatay (father) is so good.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Aleng (Auntie) Martha, come on, I'll help you.
25:
00:01:38 --&gt; 00:01:42
Oh kid, thank you.You are really kind. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You're very good, later when I get home, you'll have something from me. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Tay, I know that already. A MOTHER!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But for his new marriage, 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Your child?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
My children.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Hi Cathy! Hi Arlene! I hope we will be friends. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
will it accompany suffering?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Will you really leave your daughter for Saudi?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If that could make Annaliza's life better. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
You kid, what takes you so long to wash the clothes?!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
How will that dry up now? How?! Tell me how will that dry up?!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Arlene, we shouldn't be fighting. We're family. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Should I just grab your hair?! 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Arlene, it hurts, stop it! I said stop it!
40:
00:02:21 --&gt; 00:02:24
If your father loves you, why did your father leave you? Why did he leave you? Tell me!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You'll go and never come back! So just leave right now!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
She loves with all her heart

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Lord, I will not get tired of loving.I hope that my family would be together and happy. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
If your child is taken from you, part of you is also taken away. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
If you need something, just tell me, okay?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Even from all the hurt that she's been through.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Annaliza, soon on ABS-CBN.
