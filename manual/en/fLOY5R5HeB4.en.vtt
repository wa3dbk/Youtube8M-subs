00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:33.770
football. It comes out on Fridays!

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.990
Part of being a better soccer player is being

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.250
show!

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.180
Dutch international Wesley Sneijder recently
completed his move from Inter Milan to Turkish

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.020
giants Galatasaray. The deal was in the 8.4
million pounds range.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.710
He's a stud, he cost the club a lot of money
and it's important he remain healthy so

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.939
Galatasaray can get a great return on their
investment. But someone forgot to tell the

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.989
fans that!

of Sneijder standing up out of a sun roof

in a single van parade for fans to welcome
him! Welcome him they did! They were jumping

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.939
on top of the van beating him slash hugging
him!

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.670

Towards the end of last week Liverpool's
Luis Suarez publicly came out saying he dived

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.650
in an attempt to win a penalty in an October
game against Stoke. According to the Guardian

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.100
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says Suarez's
behavior was unacceptable.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.900
Do you think it's cool to dive? Not cool?
Would you dive to earn a PK that would help

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.540
your team win the game?

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.529
Post a comment and let me know your thoughts!

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:03.060
Speaking of comments. U-14 Chelsea Youth player
Cole Dasilva had this to say about Brooklyn

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.200
Beckham, yes David Beckham's son, on trial
at Chelsea.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.710
"David Beckham's son Brooklyn is on trial
for my team... David Beckham was watching

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.180
our training session tonight!! Madness!"

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.490
When asked about Brooklyn's ability, Cole
said, "He's decent".

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.040
Chelsea 1st team player Eden Hazard was a
Hazard to a ball boy in Wednesday's 0-0

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.380
draw against Swansea. Hazard received a red
card when he used his feet to get the ball

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.930
from underneath a ball boy laughing on the
ground that wasn't properly giving Hazard

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:33.900
the ball.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.380
That ball boys name was Charlie Morgan and
he also get our tweet of the week.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.320
Prier to the game Charile had a few hundred
followers and he tweeted this.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.320
The king of all ball boys is back making his
final appearance #need #for #timewasting

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.690
Since the Hazard incident guess how many Twitter
followers he has now? 98,000!

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.380
Geeez, Geez, Geeeeeeeeeeeezzzzz, I might have
to take a look at being a ball boy to get

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.030

MLS preseason started this week for most MLS
teams. Preseason usually means lots of quality

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.830
time with your teammates on and off the field.
One of my favorite parts of being on a team

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.650
is the practical jokes you play on each other.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.450
Sniff, sniff. This cupcake smells kinda a
funny. I think it's old. Does this smell

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.710
funny to you Jared?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.710

of your favorite practical jokes!

Not only does the Congo keeper have a cool
haircut. Side note, I'm thinking about doing

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.589
the shaved head with a long ponytail soon
too. But he has a sweet goal celebration!

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:27.420
It's not very often you see a keeper celebrate
goals besides more then a fist pump and maybe

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.040
a jump up and down.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.560
Yaaay we scored!

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.940
[Fist Pumping]

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.310
[Fist Pumping]

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.690
[Fist Pumping]

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.810
I'm thinking the Congo keeper is on to something...
click here to watch the man in action!!

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.800
Reminds me of a dance move my brother does
at the club called the rowboat!
