My name is Shawn Connolly. I live in San Francisco,
California. I'm sponsored, and I teach skateboarding

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.110
to kids, in a program that I created, called
SF Skate Club. Now, what I'm here to show

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.859
you today, is the Frontside Pop Shove-It.
Frontside Pop Shove-It's are a great trick,

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.849
because they don't take much motion, but they
go all the way around in a Shove-It behind

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:25.140
you, and then you land back on them, so they're
a little bit elusive, because you can't really

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.359
see what they're doing, because it's slightly
behind you, as well as under you, so when

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.650
you're ready to learn how to do a Frontside
Pop Shove-It, you want to make sure that you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.130
know how to Ollie very well, and also be able
to regular Backside Pop Shove-Its, a little

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.440
bit too, so I always start with my board backwards,
so I actually do this trick off the nose,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.230
and use that as my tail, so that after it's
done Frontside Pop Shove-Iting, I've landed

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
back on the board, and I'm rolling forward,
and I feel a little more comfortable, when

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.280
I'm rolling on my board regular, to land a
trick, so what you're going to want to do,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.030
is set up with your foot, just like you would
for a regular Ollie. Now, your front foot,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.640
you're going to want to put it nice and even
in the middle of the board. Now, you're going

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.799
to want to let it kind of hang over the front
and back side evenly. You're not going to

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.539
want to have it too toey. The reason for this,
is having a lot of foot on your board, is

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.539
going to stop it from doing any kind of flipping,
because once you pop the Frontside Pop Shove-It,

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:27.049
it has a tendency to kind of head behind you,
and you lose track of what's going on, and

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:32.249
it may go primo on you, or it may just flip
all the way over, so keeping a lot of front

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:40.659
foot on it, will stop it from flipping. Now,
you pop the tail, and simultaneously, shoot

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.740
it behind you, but stay above the board at
the same time. Land back on the board, going

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.490
in the same direction, and roll away,and this
is how you do a Frontside Pop Shove-It. My

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.159

I'm sponsored, and teach skateboarding to

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.320
