It's Friday; this is Andrew for AppSpy.com;
and you can guess the rest - this is the Friday

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.460
News Wrap-Up for the 22nd of June, 2012.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.320
I don't even know how we could have failed
to report this sooner, especially when Zeboyd

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.940
Games, the masterminds behind Cthulu Saves
the World are behind the development of the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.730
third installment of Penny Arcade's On The
Rainslick Precipice of Darkness series.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.680
Somehow we forgot to mention that not only
is the third title making its way to iOS and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.649
Android devices, but is expected to be released
'soon' after the game's initial release on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.420
the 25th of July.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.149
By 'soon' we mean it could be another year
of development, but hey, I'm always up for

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.219
more modern JRPG homages to play on the go.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.350
Dave has already reported on this title, but
I couldn't pass up the opportunity to show

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.239
off the footage here in our Wrap-Up.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.180
For a free title, Darkside is looking drop-dead
gorgeous and with any luck the gameplay will

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.799
live up to the visual hype.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.130
Of course, there will be an IAP, though this
is tentatively priced at $0.99 and will unlock

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.670
two additional gameplay modes (on top of the
free Arcade mode), while also allowing you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.229
to carry smart bombs.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.750
Keep an eye on our site for a review of this
upcoming title.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.000
For those enjoying Pocket Planes, you might
find it interesting to know that the game

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.180
almost went in a completely different direction,
pinning players down to the Earth on rails

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.280
instead of gracefully flying through the air.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.260
Initial design mockups released by on of Nimblebit's
own on the Something Awful forums shows a

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.970
Train-based title, albeit one that never saw
the light of day.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.049
Given the almost zen-like simplicity of the
current iteration, I wonder if there's any

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:46.509
merit in the developer considering something
more robust - maybe a transport tycoon game

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.690
of sorts - planes, trains and automobiles!

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.289
Landing on the App Store next week is a very
different take on the castle/tower defense

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.679
genre as you strap in to a cannon and blast
away poultry out to steal your corn.

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.929
I've said it before and I'll say it again,
but a premise like this reminds me that I'm

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.539
long past the point of worrying about needing
a legitimate story for an Arcade game - it

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.729
has guns, there are things to shoot and explosions
to be had.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.910
I'm sold.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.520
Chicken Doom is being released by BulkyPix
for DogBox Studios and will be available from

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.080
the 28th of June.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.390
Despite my personal belief that Mad Acorn
by APD deserves a much larger review, I can't

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.170
begin to express just how unexpectedly perfect
this title ended up feeling upon first playing

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.360
it, so it's probably best I keep things short.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.530
The game, which is ostensibly a rhythm title,
is the first in the developer's new TapTap

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.580
Comix project, providing interactive artistic
collaborations.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.520
Combining the urban artwork design from South
Korean studio MOSTAPES and an electronic,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.751
hip-hop inspired soundtrack, the game positively
bursts from the seams with raw energy; it

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:56.540
may not be to everyone's liking, but the marriage
of sound and art in Mad Acorn is almost flawless.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.530
Players will tap their way through several
chapters, defeating a big-bad boss at the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.280
end of each, and while this may seem all-too-simple
for some, 'hidden' beats are also available

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.151
for players to find, adding to their score
if they 'go with the flow'.

00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:12.470
For $2.99 it may be a bit pricey, especially
considering its shelf-life, but if you're

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.620
the kind of person that places presentation
over complexity, this is an easy game to recommend.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.480
Despite the addictive release of NimbleBit,
and many others over the last week, I have

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.840
to award this week's Pick to a game that managed
to make me laugh and truly absorbed me from

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.720
the moment I started playing.

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.420
Velocirapture may not be the most complex
or robust of Arcade titles, but from its startlingly

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.950
simple, yet effective controls, to the humorous
concept, PikPok and Adult Swim's latest collaboration

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.390
is another smash hit.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.510
If you only have $0.99 to spare this week,
throw it towards this title; you're guaranteed

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.590
at least a smile, if not a long-lasting game.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.000
Much like the start I'm going to keep the
ending short - I have to sprint out the door

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
once this is wrapped up, but we've got plenty
of news, reviews and features to catch up

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.220
on, so do make sure you're subscribed, and
keep an eye on us via Twitter or Facebook.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.760
Those who like plushy toys may want to keep
an eye on our site over the next week as we

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.230
may be running a competition, but that's the
only spoiler I can give.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.729
Have a great weekend!
