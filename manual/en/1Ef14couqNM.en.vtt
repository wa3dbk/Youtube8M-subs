00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:02.708
Blinky: Pack your bags, Pacman! 

00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:04.083
Inky: Alright! Woohoo! 

00:00:04.458 --> 00:00:05.167
Clyde:Nice one, Blinky! 

00:00:06.042 --> 00:00:08.042
Yeah! Two down and one to go! 

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.333
-Woah!
-What the...

00:00:10.042 --> 00:00:12.792
Flashing, flashing, flashing... 
Solid! hahahaha

00:00:17.292 --> 00:00:19.040
Pinky: Is it just me or there's something different about Pacman? 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.917
Clyde: Oh, that's just your nerves talking.

00:00:20.916 --> 00:00:22.916
Pinky: I don't know, just look at him.

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.127
Ooh, tic tacs!

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.398
Hmm, minty! hahahaha

00:00:28.537 --> 00:00:30.625
Blinky: I don't care what he looks like. He's going down!

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:31.370
Get him!

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.370
Alright, Pacman. You know the drill.

00:00:33.088 --> 00:00:35.666
Pacman? I'm not Pacman! I'm an orange.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.640
Yeah, and I'm a ghost. So why don't you cut-- 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.958
You're not a ghost. You're a police man.

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:41.053
Uhh, no, I'm not a cop.

00:00:41.053 --> 00:00:43.500
Then why are you working undercover? hahahaha

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
I'm a ghost, you moron!

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:46.881
Oh! Then I bet you know my friend Boo.

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:48.669
Boo? Boo Who?

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:51.316
Geez, you don't have to cry about it. hahaha

00:00:51.316 --> 00:00:54.846
Alright, that's it. You're going down! Come back here, 
Orange! You're all--uh oh!

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:57.423
Wow! Officer Boo! Where'd you get the snuggie?

00:00:57.375 --> 00:00:58.333
Leave me alone!

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.250
-I want a snuggy! Come back!
-No! No!!!

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.877
Woah, no wonder he ran away. 
He didn't have any guts. hahahaha

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:06.458
Ooh! More tic tacs!

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.988
Blinky: Darn!

00:01:07.958 --> 00:01:09.613
Inky: Nice one, dude.

00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:11.708
Clyde: I think it's time to make the odds a little less fair!

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.708
All: Yeah! Let's get him. Come on!

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.000
Hey! Hey ghosts! Over here!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.858
There he is, get him! Go!

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:18.167
-Marco! 
-Oh he's over there!

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:19.621
-Polo!
-He just switched sides. Go- hey he's over there!

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.061
-Marco!
-Come over here!

00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:22.872
-Polo!
-Follow me, guys! Follow me!

00:01:22.872 --> 00:01:23.958
I can't catch him.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:27.655
Marco! Polo! hahahaha

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.417
oh, I don't feel very good.

00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:32.167
Get him!

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.129
Woah, talk about an eye full! hahahaha

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:39.498
More tic tacs! hmm

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.750
Urgh, that was disgusting!

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.020
I am not going back out there.

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:47.720
Hey! It's me! I see you, Me! 

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:50.460
You're not me! I'm Me! 
hahahahaha

00:01:51.154 --> 00:01:54.430
Uh! Hate this new guy! 
Whatever happened to Pacman?

00:01:58.417 --> 00:02:02.670
Okay, shut up already! 
You've been making that same noise for three hours. 

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.460
I can't understand what you're saying!

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:08.620
Uh, I give up.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.680
Yo, strawberries in the house. 
What's going on?
