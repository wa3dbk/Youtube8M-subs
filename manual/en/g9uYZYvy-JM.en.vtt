00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.730
Natural harmonics.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.960
The three main positions for natural harmonics
are at the fifth, seventh, and twelfth fret.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:33.660
Every string has a harmonic at the fifth fret,
the seventh fret, and the twelfth fret.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:42.199
You've probably heard these in the intros
to songs by Yes, Metallica, and many others.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.699
There are a lot of possibilities of patterns
that you can play with these.

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.060
One cool thing you can do is alternate strings.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:59.440
So, what if I play the low string at the seventh
fret, skip a string, then move to the twelfth

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.410
fret and play the fourth string.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.410
Alright.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:11.590
You could do the same thing on the next set
of strings.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.080
It creates a very harp-like effect.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.610
If I play those together I get this.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:34.030
If I play that all the way across the neck
I get this.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.080
Sounds pretty cool.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:46.950
It can also go from this note to the next
note seventh fret, the next note fifth fret,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.530
third string.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.940
And those are just the main positions.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.350
You also have these hidden positions.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.390
You have harmonics on the fourth fret.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:12.180
They're a little harder to squeeze out, but
you can get some cool sounds from that.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:22.050
And the third fret.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:36.200
Here's a little pattern using harmonics of
the third fret and fifth fret.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.860
That's from a tune of mine called Path of
Least Resistance.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:47.060
Now, in addition to all these positions that
we've just looked at we can go above the twelfth

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.260
fret, and we have harmonics here at the seventeenth
fret.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.110
A little harder to squeeze out, but they're
there.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.000
And then the nineteenth fret.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.780
Those are the same as the seventh fret.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.510
So, as you can see, harmonics can be found
all over the neck.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.540
Be sure to have some fun with them, and check
out some of the other lessons here that I've

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.709
done on harmonics.
