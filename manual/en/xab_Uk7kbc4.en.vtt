00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.000
Hey, what's up I am Rey.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.010
I am 17. I am going to be a senior in Bell High School

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:12.050
which is this school right here. I live in LA. The south side of LA.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.090
Lately, I been living by myself, because

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.130
one problem that happened at my house. So, my Mom had to leave to Mexico

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.150
for family emergencies, and because I didn't want to stay with my brothers and sisters

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.160
and you know being in their house. I just wanted to live by myself see how

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.180
an actual adult life would be. I live towards that way, ten blocks

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.190
away. It actually takes me a good thirty minutes to get there.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.210
It's straight ahead actually. I used to bitch a lot

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.240
in freshman year, because I was meeting the wrong people.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.260
It actually made me just miss school a lot. Sophomore year

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.290
I started buckling up, you know. Actually doing my work. I am going to be the first one

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.300
in my family to graduate. And I am also going to feel really proud

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.340
of me graduating. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.350
After I made up my mind of living out and telling

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.370
my Mom and Dad I was actually going to move out, I was nervous.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.390
I never lived by myself. I never had my own room, because back then I would be sleeping

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.400
in the living room all of the time, because of my sister and my older brother.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.050
My little brother and my mom would have her own room, so me and my older

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.100
brother would always sleep in the living room. Which even though

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.140
I slept on the floor, and I always wanted a bed, I slept on the floor even though I had my couch to sleep at

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.160
the way I am affording my house, to pay up the rent I've been working. Right now,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.200
I am on vacation, so I have my litle summer job

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.220
as a supervisor at a truck washing business.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.230
My Dad told me when I started school, if I am missing a hundred dollars or

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.240
half of the rent, he would just bring it. Like he would just send it to me.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.260
What my job is to just get a summer job, I mean a weekend job

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.270
and just work every weekend while I am going to school.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.290
Because this senior year, I am going to real have to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.310
stay in school, and no go out as I used to.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.350
This is my house. It has a one room apartment. It has a little entrance.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.350
It might be hot, because it's always hot in here.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.360
This is my room. My couch.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.390
I pretty recentlly got this table for my little TV

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.410
that a good friend of mine gave to me. I have my laptop

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.440
that my Dad sent me for Christmas. I have been here for

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.470
two months already. Oh damn, you really gotta see this.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.500
This is my baby Mary Jane. As you can see

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.530
she's pretty big. I got her since she was a baby. I got her

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.550
when she was a good six months, 3 months when I got her.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.590
She could barely be at my wrist

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.630
and now she goes around my neck. When I moved in

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.660
I was scared for moving in by myself, because

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.690
one of my greatest fears is being by myself. I don't like being by myself.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.710
But, you know I actually

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.760
faced my fear. Going to be by myself.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.790
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my older brother and my sister. They've been really helping

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.810
me out a lot. A lot of my friends have been helping me out a lot. Everyone has been really helpful to me.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.840
Sometimes I'll have no

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:28.880
money and I wouldn't have groceries.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.910
So I wouldn't get my food. Sometimes my brother knew that I wouldn't eat

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.940
all day. So he'd tell me, "Come to my house".

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.980
His wife, she made something to eat and everything. I'll be going over there.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.010
Some people may say that it's cool. It's really cool living by yourself

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.050
and you get to do everything. No, it's not like that. It's actually more responsibility

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.080
to worry about your rent, your own food

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.120
your own clothes. If you don't have a car, and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.130
you have to ride the bus. Ride the bike towards your work

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.140
and yeah, waking up at 6 in the morning just to go to work.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.150
But, it's things that you have to do.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.160
to move up. Because I know if I make it in LA, I can make it anywhere.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.170
For me, graduating is actually a big thing, for many people, and for me

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.210
especially. Because, you know, it's

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.220
just I don't want to be struggling in life. And

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.230
going through a minimum wage, and especially

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.250
the whole society has been going and everything.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.260
I wouldn't want to be the guy that does the labor work

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.690
I want to be the guy that actually sets up the whole work. [The End.]
