The adjustable bucket seat provides added
safety… and the durable tractor wheels can

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.590
lockout, you set the pace.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.810
It comes loaded with all the bells and whistles
including adjustable seats, built in cup holders

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.140
and a spacious cargo bed with working tailgate.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.030
accelerator.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.530

comfy and safe…

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:37.380
And the fully-functional front loader allows
them to scoop, carry and dump loads from 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:51.220
the driver’s seat.
