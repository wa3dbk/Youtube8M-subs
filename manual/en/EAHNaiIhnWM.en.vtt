00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:15.779
The long pips

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.060
if you have a key there

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.330
that means you know

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.740
when the long pips push

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.939
it's no spin

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.150
and you loop, they chop back
it's backspin.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.609
So, okay, we're going to show some.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.340
So when the long pips push this one

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.440
it's no spin.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.510
This one's bottom spin.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.140
This one's no spin.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.090
So you already know it.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.490
Now I try to push you to use your

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.670
your best skill.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.240
For example, forehand or

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.520
backhand kill.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.160
Practice. Keep practicing. So every time

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.850
you're looking for the dead spin ball.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.880
If the deadspin ball is coming in 
you can try to kill the game.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.110
Ok just like this

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.670
so this is no spin

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.570
bottom spin

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.140
so this one.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.380
You're looking for the chopper

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.360
they just push back.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.880
That one is dead spin, right.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.920
So you're looking for this one
to kill the game.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.330
So push, no spin.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.820
Push

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.420
nospin

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.530
kill the game.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.710
And this one no spin

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.350
kill the game.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.580
And also your forehand, same thing
you're looking for

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.780
this one.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.340
So push. This one's no spin. Kill the game.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.860
This one no spin

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.280
kill the game.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.880
So everytime, you're just looking for

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.990
no spin.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.700
So you keep practicing.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.519
When you play the game you can plan it.

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.919
For example, when you serve

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:13.879
you serve bottom spin

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.019
they pushed back this ball is no spin.

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.829
or kind of top spin. So you're 
just looking for this one

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:23.999
then try to attack against

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.099
no spin.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.909
So no spin

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.109
because you know the long pips

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.669
when they push back it's no spin, right.

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:36.819
Same thing backhand

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.980
this one's no spin

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.529
forward.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.489
Now this is bottom spin.
This is no spin.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.969
Ok.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.909
Serve. I'm going to serve bottom spin.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.899
He's going to push back, it's no spin.

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.029
So bottom spin.

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.129
Serve bottom spin

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:09.949
So every time practice like this.
You have to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:11.369
try

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.089
everytime catch

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:15.559
when you catch the no spin 
you can kill the game.

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.389
Then your game going to

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.259
stronger stronger stronger. So

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:22.139
the long pips

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.399
it's easy to control because
they cannot control the spin.

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:29.589
It's all your side. You control the spin.

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.079
So you have to know

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.289
when is 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:36.369
no spin, when is bottom spin.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.299
Bottom spin.

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.579
No spin.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:42.359
Bottom spin.

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.229
Top spin.

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.719
Ok. Go practice try to

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:49.689
find your best skill

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.199
to kill the game.

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.339
Ok thank you.
