00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.640
Hey everybody, welcome to another edition
of The Daily.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.510
It's Wednesday, August 31st here with Jason
Saghini.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.050
I'm Nick Firchau.
Lets start with the US Open Cup semifinals

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.321
from Tuesday night, and the Seattle Sounders,
two-time defending champions, and they're

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.930
headed back to the final.
They get a big win over FC Dallas.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.080
Freddy Montero with a goal.
A great goal.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.630
Came right after he attempted a bicycle kick
that went just wide.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.790
Great game to watch.
It was back and forth.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.439
Both teams had opportunities.
FC Dallas had an opportunity.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.820
Marvin Chavez skied his shot after some sloppy
defending by Seattle, but the Sounders hold

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.120
on and they move on to the final.
The Sounders doing what they do best, which

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.280
is playing at home at the US Open Cup.
At home, that's where they're going to face

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.229
the Chicago Fire, the winners on the other
side of the bracket.

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.799
The Chicago Fire, you talk about 4 US Open
Cup championships.

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.569
This will be their 6th appearance in the final.
A lot of history going into this final when

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.019
you look at these 2 teams.
It was Grazzini and Oduro getting the goals

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.430
for Chicago in what they called a sloppy victory.
They ended up giving up a goal in the 2nd

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.130
half.
Grazzini had to leave early with an injury

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.590
which kind of offset the balance for Chicago
in that 2nd half.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.180
They'll take it.
They move on to the final.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.710
They've been there more than anyone.
They're looking to get an unprecidented 5th

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.119
victory.
Gutsy performance of the Richmond Kickers

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.810
up against the Chicago Fire, but not enough.
That puts the Fire up against the Sounders

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.570
on October 4th.
The US Open final up at Sentry Link Field

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.920
in Seattle.
I'm looking forward to that.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.600
You mentioned a lot of history, and that should
be a good match.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.530
Lets move on to some MLS news.
The latest injury news for a couple of teams

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.950
in the Eastern Conference.
Jason, some playoff spots.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.299
The Houston Dynamo and the New York Red Bulls.
These teams have switched places.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.020
Houston was on the outskirts of the playoffs.
Now they're in the automatic spot.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.640
There's still plenty of games left to go.
Houston looking to get some guys back out

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.130
on the field.
Will Bruin and Danny Cruz wanna help them

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.091
with depth as they get through the stretch
run.

00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:57.409
They have 7 games left in MLS.
They expect both those guys back out on the

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.689
field for reserve league games and friendlies
within the next 2 weeks.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.649
Then you look at the New York Red Bulls.
We've talked about the slide that they've

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.039
had in this season.
They're going to get Luke Rogers and Frank

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.549
Rothe back within the next 2 weeks.
They're not sure if it will be for their September

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.890
10th game or their September 17th, but they
expect them back for the stretch run of the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.750
season.
A lot of teams taking advantage of this week

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.651
off to get some healthy bodies back.
One healthy body that is back is Stuart Holden,

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:26.900
the US international playing with Bolton.
Playing in Tuesday night action with the Bolton

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.900
reserves.
A lot of US fans happy to see Stuart Holden

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.420
back after such a long delay.
He was in 78 minutes.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.310
He got out there and played most of the game.
He came off the field saying, I could have

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.660
kept going.
Some other international news on the transfer

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.489
market, Clint Dempsey reportedly interested,
they're out.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:51.060
Some other teams interested in him, Aston
Villa, and Valencia all after Clint Dempsey.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.690
The arsenal here is one that US fans are interested
in the most.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.080
They want to see him go to a major club.
That said, it's not a club who's in a great

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.500
position right now.
The interesting fact I think that we've noticed

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.860
is that Fulham has actually gone out and brought
in several attacking players.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.209
That kind of maybe clues you into the fact
that they expect him to be gone.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.689
We'll have to stay tuned today to figure out
what happens.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:22.069
A couple of other notes, Mike Orello, the
24 year old American striker, on his way out.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.470
Michael Bradley set to be debut for Chievo
out in Italy on Wednesday.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.030
Should be a nice day to debut for Michael
Bradley.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.150
A new team for him.
One last thing before we go.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.530
The Wednesday Water Cooler is back.
That's at 1:30 pm Eastern.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.849
That's a live chat with the armchair analyst
and the MLS Insider.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.799
You can hear out all your grievances.
Talk about Open Cup, everything.

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.240
All the fans can get on there.
Once again, 1:30pm Eastern.
