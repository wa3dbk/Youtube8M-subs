00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello Pokemon fans, today I have a new video 
 for you.
I'm going to open up this tin.

00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:12.163
Which I just bought by "The Blokker", this was the last one they had!

00:00:12.353 --> 00:00:19.353
I'm sorry for the quality of this video, I'm using a different 
 camera right now. I don't have the other one here.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:29.306
And I want to open this up so badly, can't wait. 
 So I'm going to film it with this one!

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:44.590
It's a Raikou tin, I believe from 2011 or 2012, I'm not sure.
You see an 
 Entei, a Raikou, a Suicune and the three together on the back. 

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:47.595
It was sold for ten euros ( 13 dollar), I thought 
 it was really cheap so I bought it right away!

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.840
So let's look what's inside!

00:00:59.123 --> 00:01:09.123
I have purchased these tins a while ago, so the 
 promo's I get here are up for trade.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.840
The shiny Raikou, focus...
Let's put this in the background.

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:45.770
The card you get in it with explanation what 
 a shiny is and what a normal is.

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:55.570
The promo card, or the shattered Raikou.

00:01:55.902 --> 00:02:09.900
And the packs! Let's see, a Heart Gold Soul Silver, one Undaunted, 
 one Stormfront with Infernape on it, and one Platinum Arceus.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.160
So I will start with Heart Gold Soul Silver.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm going to try to open the packs carefully, so I can keep them.

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:36.800
There are no code cards in this set, so we put these there.

00:02:36.497 --> 00:02:41.500
And it start's off with:

00:02:57.723 --> 00:03:13.720
Woow really? The top of Lugia! Cool! I think I got this one already, I'm looking for 
 the bottom half I think, but I have to look it up to be sure.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.810
But wow! For just ten euros, that's really nice!

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.650
I'm going to put it in a sleeve.

00:03:28.163 --> 00:03:39.160
I think that the legend cards are really pretty, the colours 
 and the art works, they are made so beautiful.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.960
Let's see, the Undaunted. With Houndoom on the front. 
Carfully. 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And a Metagross rare, pretty artwork. 

00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:51.560
Next one, the Stormfront with Infernape.

00:04:56.401 --> 00:05:34.400
They had a few things at the Blokker, a pack of Dark Explorers, and 
 another pack of something and this tin, not so much. So let's see.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I'm quit happy with the legend card, maybe I can trade it for 
 the top half, I mean for the bottom. We shall see!

00:05:53.281 --> 00:06:13.280
The Platinum Arceus pack. Focus..., hey, you are not helping me today? Yeah..

00:06:37.244 --> 00:06:51.240
I believe this is my first Pelipper card, I'm not sure. 
 I believe I didn't pull a Pelipper card before.

00:06:51.402 --> 00:07:06.400
So all together good pulls! Let's see, I'm missing 
 a rare here, oh yeah, this one.

00:07:06.205 --> 00:07:13.200
A legend and three regular rares, I'm happy 
 witch the legend, it compensates the others.

00:07:13.761 --> 00:07:20.760
Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoyed! Byee!
