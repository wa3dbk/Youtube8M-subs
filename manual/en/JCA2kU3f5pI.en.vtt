00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
Hey everyone, it's Lunden and this week we're talking about

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.230
fat loss.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.190
 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.440
Okay, so why did I choose fat loss as a
topic for this week's

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.210
episode? Well, first of all because there are so many myths out

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.880
there

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.250
and it covers all of the magazines that you
see

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.950
when you're in a grocery store or if
you're watching a fitness

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.230
infomercial, it's all about losing fat, losing weight,

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.000
doing it really really really really
quick, well I have news for you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.040
burning fat is not something that you
can do really really really quick

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.559
and anything that promises a quick fix like
that

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.800
it's not going to be able to be maintained
throughout,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.140
which is what you wanna look for,
something that you could

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.420
do healthily and habitually

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.930
forever, something that's not too over
the top and not too extreme.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.410
So these tips for fat loss aren't quick fixes, there are not gonna magically

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.390
burn all your fat tomorrow, but they will
help you get an idea of what you need to

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.050
do

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.060
how to burn fat more efficiently and
kind of change your body a little bit.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.979
Okay, so the first one that I wanna talk about
is strength training.

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.789
Now I have news for all of you that sit on a treadmill or on an elliptical machine

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.939
for a sustained period of time, with that same
heart rate level

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.100
that's not gonna do anything for fat-burning,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.829
what it's gonna do, it's just gonna burn
calories while you're on the machine,

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:28.520
it's gonna waste the muscle that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.249
hopefully you've worked to build and it's just
just gonna do something for you while you're on the machine.

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:37.329
Strength training helps build muscle right?

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.689
And it's also going to help build nice tone
and lean muscle,

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.389
now what muscle does, is it burns fat, so
when you're not at the gym, when you're

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:49.859
at rest, when you're just hanging out, if
you have a nice

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.049
strong, lean muscle built, you're going to
actually burn fat

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.899
while you're at rest, so strength training at higher intensity is for shorter

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:59.619
durations of

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.039
time are going to actually help you burn
more fat by building more muscle

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.679
versus just the numbers going up on the
calories burnt, when you're on the

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.830
elliptical machine going going going going.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.380
It's really not gonna benefit you later
on and it's not gonna change

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.060
your overall body composition in the long run. So

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.920
strength training number one. Make sure you're getting these weights in, even ladies,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.950
it's okay, you don't have to lift an
insane amount of weight, go for a lower weights,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.950
higher repetitions to get that nice tone

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.950
sleek great fat burning muscle that we
all want. Number two:

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.270
Consume more protein

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.400
Now, first of all, protein is the building
block

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.090
of muscles. So of course you're gonna need
protein in your diet in order to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.600
adequately fuel all the muscles that
you're working while strenght training

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.400
right? So for the most part
especially with a lot of my clients,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.550
I realized that they don't consume enough
protein especially

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.370
at breakfast. So if you're not having a good
nutritious, well-rounded breakfast

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.950
you're more likely to choose

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.960
higher starchier carb snacks, maybe make
a poor choice at lunch time cause you're

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.090
just so hungry

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.150
and your lacking proteins, so you're just kinda
want to hold onto to whatever you can get, grab

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.990
that big juicy burger or whatever it is
that you've been craving.

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.170
But if you get a very good well-rounded
nutritious breakfast and that includes a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.430
lean protein

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.650
then you're less likely to make those
mistakes later on, you're less likely to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.780
have those cravings,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.690
you're gonna be on more alert, you're gonna have more energy and you're just not gonna

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.220
think about food as much.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.500
So getting more protein in your diet is
really important. Now where is protein

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.190
found?

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.450
Okay, protein is found in meat, so like
chicken, fish,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.930
turkey, red meat, bison is really good as well,

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.240
but those of you that are vegetarians or vegans, vegetarians can choose

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.970
something like eggs,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.340
greek yogurt, cottage cheese or if you're vegan and staying away from animal

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.680
products entirely,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.990
Quinoa is a great choice and rice
and beans together make a complete

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.640
protein

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.480
as well, so you can get protein from those
sources also.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.870
Third fat-burning tip is getting enough
sleep. Most people think they just have

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.470
work work work work work without any
stopping

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.250
and that's gonna get them where they wanna be. But your body cannot function

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.990
to its fullest potential if it's lacking
sleep, if you're not getting enough sleep

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.220
at night time now that doesn't mean four,
five, six hours

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.690
that means getting the full seven to nine
hours, that, you know just depends on the

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.069
person what they require

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:22.650
each night, when you're not sleeping
enough, when you're not getting

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.170
enough rest at night time, your body
actually gets stressed out. Now whether or

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.389
not you're feeling stressed out or maybe
stress is the reason why you can't go to

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.750
sleep at night, then you're double stressing
out your body.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.750
Stress produces a stress hormone called
cortisol

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.720
and cortisol causes your body to store
fat a lot of times around the midsection

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.020
it's that sticky, stubborn fat around
the midsection that we really wanna get rid

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.660
of and sometimes just getting those

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.880
extra hours of sleep, really focusing
on our recovery, our relaxation

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.000
and getting enough throughout the night, is
really what's going to help

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.480
us take our fat loss to the next level. And
the last tip, number four is just staying

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.350
hydrated,

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.790
make sure that your body is hydrated at
all times, you don't wanna go all day

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:01.880
long and realize

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.990
oh no, I haven't drinken any water today,
that's really not so good, the more

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.030
hydrated that your body stays,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.810
the more fluids that are in your body,
continuously, the less your body is going to

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.190
retain that water, it's gonna use that
water

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.190
to digest your food, increase your
metabolism and of course hydrate your

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.760
whole entire body, hydrate

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.090
all of your cells. So don't forget that
fat loss, weight loss,

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.180
even weight gain, or any type of fitness
goal that you have isn't something

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.590
that's going to happen overnight.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.130
I'm sorry, but all of those magazines with quick fixes and magical pills and magical this

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.669
that's gonna take you to your goals
but the time you blink your eyes is just not

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.990
realistic, it's not something that you're
gonna be able to do forever,

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.250
therefore you probably shouldn't even
start it, so instead of starting

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.830
a fat diet, going into another yo-yo
dieting face,

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.590
just go with what's real, with what's right
and with what your body can

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.060
actually sustain, maintain

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.840
and get into the habit of doing forever
without feeling deprived.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.330
So don't forget to make sure that you're
doing your strength training,

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.750
you're consuming more protein especially
at breakfast to eliminate all of those

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.740
cravings throughout the rest of the day,

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.880
you're getting enough sleep and drinking
enough water.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.570
I know this may sound pretty basic, but
they're very crucial.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.669
So don't forget to leave comments to let
me know what you think or if you have

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:17.139
