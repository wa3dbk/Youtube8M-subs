00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.250
Hey guys, this is Austin and today I’m here
with a review of the Google Nexus

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.080
4 and Android 4.2.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.299
With high end internals, an impressive design
and the

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:10.690
latest tasty Android treat let’s take a
look.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.339
At first glance the Nexus 4 looks
similar to the Galaxy Nexus with a single

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.530
unbroken piece of glass up front
without any branding or physical buttons.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.880
It’s a very clean look that reminds
me of the iPhone and it works.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.790
Flip the phone over and you’ll see an all
glass

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.820
back with a very cool looking pattern of dots
that appear and disappear

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.370
depending on the lighting.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.590
That said, again just like the older iPhones
you’re

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.700
dealing with two sheets of glass front and
back which are easily breakable.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.600
It
feels great in the hand but picking up a case

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.960
or at least a bumper probably
wouldn’t be a bad idea.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.190
At 9.1mm it’s reasonably thin but it does
feel bulkier

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.909
in the hand compared to something like a Galaxy
S3.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.269
Thankfully all the
buttons and ports are in the proper positions

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:48.479
with the power button on the
top right edge, volume rocker and your MicroSIM

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.260
slot on the left side, your
headphone jack up top and a MicroUSB port

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.260
on bottom.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.300
Around back is the 8
megapixel camera and the LED flash and on

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.850
the top right you’ll find the 1.3
megapixel front facing camera.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.309
The screen is a 4.7 inch display with a
resolution of 1280x768.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.940
This is slightly wider than a typical 720p
phone which

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.660
does give you a bit more width to the keyboard
for example but it really

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.470
doesn’t make a huge difference.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.510
As with the Galaxy Nexus instead of physical
buttons the Nexus 4 sports on screen Android

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.970
keys which will rotate with the
phone in landscape mode and disappear altogether

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.850
when watching video for
example.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.831
The screen itself is an IPS panel and it’s
among the best smartphone

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:26.960
screens out there with good viewing angles
and very impressive saturation

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.210
and contrast.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.210
The Nexus 4 is running Android 4.2 Jellybean
which brings

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.440
several improvements from previous versions.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.540
The first thing you’ll notice is
just how quick and responsive the phone is.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.210
No matter how fast you try to go
through the interface it keeps up and easily

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.510
matches the best from iOS and
Windows Phone.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.910
You’ll also find an improved Gesture Keyboard
that works

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.070
similarly to Swype allowing you to trace out
the letters you want to type and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.900
let autocorrect figure out what you mean.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.860
There’s also a new Quick Settings
menu in the notifications that allows you

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.010
to toggle Wi-Fi, brightness and
more at a quick glance.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.320
The lock screen has also been totally redesigned.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.850
You
can swipe to the right to get quick access

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.190
to the camera and you can also add
widgets such as texting, calendar and email

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.659
and third party apps will be able
to use this as well.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:07.580
Another somewhat useful feature is Daydream
which

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.270
works like a screensaver that displays the
time, photos or news from Google

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.900
Currents when the phone is docked.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.890
Google Now has also seen some major
improvements.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.250
It can now check Gmail to see if you have
anything being

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.220
shipped to you, reservations at a hotel or
for a plane and much more.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.350
It also
remains as fast as ever.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.400
What’s the weather going to be like in Los
Angeles

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.350
tomorrow?

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.390
Tomorrow’s forecast for Los Angeles is 70
degrees and mostly

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.580
sunny.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.480
When is the Superbowl?

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.760
The NFL Superbowl is on Sunday, February
3rd, 2013.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.330
The camera app has also been totally redesigned.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.440
Instead of digging
through menus you can just tap and then change

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.040
whatever setting you’re
looking for.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.360
It’s quick and makes every other camera
app out there look

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.360
outdated.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.260
The 8 megapixel stills themselves are good.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.140
Colors are accurate and
it’s quite easy to get a very nice, contrasty

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.140
image.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.430
As you guys can see here
the 1080p video on the Nexus 4 isn’t half

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.430
bad.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.760
Now probably my biggest
complaint is the lack of autofocus.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.270
As you guys can see here I was just up close
on the Android and if I give it a minute,

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.050
yeah there we go it will focus but
there’s no way to tap on the screen to autofocus

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.350
so if I touch, instead it will go
ahead and take a picture which is fine but

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.240
there’s no real way to manually
autofocus which is kind of a big deal.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.680
Once you’ve shot pictures there’s a very
impressive built-in editor.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.810
You can add Instagram like filters which are
decent

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.190
but you can also go more in-depth with contrast,
saturation and even

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.260
adjusting the curves.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.770
There’s also a new Photosphere mode that
allows you to

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.870
take several pictures from a single area and
then it stitches them together to

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.720
give you a result like Google Street View.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.080
The final product is a full 360 degree
panorama that you can swipe through and share

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.739
on Google+ which looks
really impressive although it is a bit low

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:42.830
resolution.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.739
Powering the Nexus 4 is a
quad core Snapdragon S4 Pro processor clocked

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.500
at 1.5GHz paired with 2GB of
RAM and Adreno 320 graphics.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.239
This delivers some outstanding scores right
on

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.210
par with other high end phones like the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 and HTC Droid

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.470
DNA and is easily enough to handle graphically
intense games at a reasonable

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.470
frame rate.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.510
The phone does tend to get warm when under
long periods of

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.300
stress but in normal use it isn’t an issue.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.080
One minor downside is the lack of
expandable storage.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.020
With only 8GB and 16GB varieties to choose
from you’re

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.150
going to be limited on space and having a
MicroSD card slot would have

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.519
helped quite a bit.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.440
Speaking of minor hardware issues, the speaker
on the

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.709
back isn’t particularly loud and the sound
is a bit washed out.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.420
By far the
biggest problem with the Nexus 4 is a lack

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.420
of LTE.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.170
If you live in an area without
LTE this isn’t an a problem but if you have

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.530
it available it really is much faster.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:31.949
Battery life is reasonable.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.670
With continuous light web browsing you’ll
see a bit

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.070
over five hours of use.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.040
It’s on the lower end of most smartphones
but it

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.900
should be enough to get most people through
a full day of use.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.430
The Google
Nexus 4 is easily one of the best smartphones

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.430
period.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.169
Android 4.2 is
extremely smooth and brings some very nice

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.880
improvements, the build quality
and design are top notch and it’s packing

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.370
some of the most powerful specs in
any phone yet.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.860
The lack of LTE is an issue but at only $300
off contract the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.150
Nexus 4 is a spectacular phone.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.310
