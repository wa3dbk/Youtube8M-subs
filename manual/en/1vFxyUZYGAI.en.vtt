00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This couch, I assume?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Okay.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And how long do I have to, how                  long should-

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Is it on?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Yeah it's on, and it has been on.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So you just want something around 10 seconds ideally?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Shall I go first?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'll be short.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Alright. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hi I'm- oh sorry.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Hi my name is Fabiola. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Okay.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Do you want me to start?   Yeah.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Alright cool.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Who's editing this?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hi.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"What's your name?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What's your major?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What's your Beaver face?"

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"Make your best Beaver face/noise"? 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Can you make a beaver face?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I don't know. Can you? Try it.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A best Beaver face?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
"How are you powered by orange?"

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
How are you powered by orange?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That's it?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That's a good question.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Just what I'm involved with basically. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
You guys put so much pressure on me.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And we believe we're powered by orange.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
No- and we ARE powered by orange.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yeah. Because we don't believe we are-

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
we know.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'm a second year in art and biology,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
hoping to add German as well.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm a freshman zoology student.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm an exchange student, so

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I've been at OSU for about six weeks now.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm majoring in political science and history.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I'm originally from just outside London in the U.K. So I would definitely

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
say do the exchange program, it's brilliant.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I'm studying business.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Got one term left.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Doing the victory lap, fifth year.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm a graphic design major.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I'm apparel design major.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I am a psych major here

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
at Oregon State University.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Also a member of the men's soccer team.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm powered by orange because

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
OSU has pretty much been my home

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
for the last, make this, five years now. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I'm a producer over at KBVR-TV

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and I am the PR Director over at KBVR-TV.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I help out at the Pride Center as an OA.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
My hobbies include writing stories,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
internet artwork,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
anything and everything 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
dealing with computers. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I like to build them.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I like to modify them.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Since I've been here, in the six weeks,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I've started writing a column

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in the Barometer Newspaper.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I'm now a member of a sorority as well.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I think getting involved is really important.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Used to work on the OSU campus at KOAC in Covell Hall.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And I'm a sports writer for the Daily Barometer .

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I would say I'm powered by orange.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And I am powered by orange.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
My name is Kyle

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and I am powered by orange.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And we're powered by orange .

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I am powered by orange.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Sweet.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
My favorite place on campus has to be Java Coffee Stop.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And I think I'm about to go there now.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Caffeine and bagels!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Yup. So thank you.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Does that work?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Thank you.
