00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.080
A festive christmas table setting doesn’t
have to be overly done or expensive.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:11.030
In fact, often times we get the best looks
when using simple items that we already have.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.650
This week I'm going to show you how to get
a beautifully dressed tablescape with only

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:32.920
a few simple touches.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.019
The way I’m about to show you isn’t necessarily
for a dinner party, but for staging or decorating

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:41.260
your dining table for the entire Christmas
season.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.620
I only get to use my china and some of my
glassware a few times a year, so it’s nice

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.210
to be able to pull them out and put them on
display every once in a while.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.359
The first thing to do is decide on a theme.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.579
For me, I like a more traditional look so
I’m sticking with red &amp; gold colours.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.960
So we want to start with our table linens.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.070
This year I’ve decided to use a neutral
table runner instead of a table cloth.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.290
Next it’s the centrepiece.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.840
I’m going to start with the greenery.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.600
I’m using a live wreath which will give
off the fresh scent of the season.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.270
Next is the main focal point of the centrepiece.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.890
There are all kinds of things you can use
from hurricane lamps, ornamental filled glass

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.380
vases or a fresh bouquet of flowers.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.770
I’ve decided to use this large black lantern,
which I think adds to the traditional theme.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.210
I’m using a battery operated LED candle
instead of a real candle…for safety reasons

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.609
of course.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:51.020
And now for the placemats, which I'm going
to lay sideways so that I can tuck under the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.149
table runner.

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.610
Now I’m going to arrange my place settings.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:07.030
I’m starting with red chargers, followed
by a simple white dinner plate, then a salad

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.509
plate on top.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.680
You’ll notice these plates have silver edging.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.160
Although I’m going with gold and red colours,
the silver edging will still tie in nicely.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:24.300
Remember, use what you have.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.870
Once the place settings are placed, I can
now embellish the centrepiece.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.270
Here I’m going to add these artificial swags
on either side of the wreath.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.910
And then add a few decorations to dress it
up.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.730
Use whatever you have, just play around with
it until you find the look you’re happy

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.739
with.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:56.140
Now for the wine glasses.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.299
And then the napkins.

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.350
I’m using these gold napkins with these
simple wicker napkin holders that I use year

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.629
round.

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:16.129
To display the napkin, find the centre of
the napkin, and pull through the napkin ring.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.129
Insert a stem of artificial berries and a
sprig of greenery, can be fake or real, right

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.189
into the napkin ring.

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:30.040
Then just lay atop the salad plate.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.319
Lastly, add your place card holders.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.760
Although we’re not using them now, we can
still enjoy how nice they look.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.769
I love seeing a nicely displayed table, even
if it’s not for a dinner party.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.730
It just adds instant flair and sparkle, only
adding to the joy of the season.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.040
So have fun decorating your table and don’t
forget to subscribe if you liked this video.

week.
