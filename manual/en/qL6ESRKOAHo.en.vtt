Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.160
Today’s Friday and I made a simple video of delicious green tea latte.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.170
To make just 1 cup, you will need:

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.540
1 teaspoon green tea powder

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.490
1/3 cup hot water

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.200
1/2 cup simmering milk

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.920
2 teaspoons granulated sugar

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.700
and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.210
First, in a cup, add green tea powder. 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.300
And add hot water, 2 tablespoons. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.500
Whisk carefully until green tea powder is completely dissolved. 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.840
If you pour the water all at once, 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.540
there will be green tea powder lumps, which is the least wanted here.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.840
Then add sugar, 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.540
vanilla extract, 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.660
and remaining water. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.660
And stir until combined.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.160
Now froth the simmering milk.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.580
If you don’t have a frother, you can use a French press as well. 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.170
It doesn’t take much time.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:30.170
Add milk foam into green tea. 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.000
Wake me up with green tea latte anytime.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.380
If you want, dust with green tea powder and serve.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.910
Bon appetit. 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:02:03.080
I love vanilla-flavored green tea latte.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.290
Today it was hot drink, the last video of this week. 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.330
Get my next week’s schedule at Facebook or Instagram this Sunday. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.730
Thank you for watching. Bye for now.
