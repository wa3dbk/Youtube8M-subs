00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:26.259
Versus Indie - Battlefield 4 vs Insurgency

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.470
In this totally subjective and wholly arbitrary
series I'll be comparing two similar games,

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.841
one a AAA release from a major publisher and
the other from an independent developer. Is

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:40.260
the AAA title always preferable to the indie
release, with a greater budget and usually

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.000
with more polished graphics and user interface?
Or do indie games have the edge on their larger

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.300
cousins, with streamlined gameplay and often
more responsive developers?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.670
I should note that the once-black and white
definition of AAA and indie game has changed

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.490
in recent years and there's now a greater
spectrum between the two release models. However,

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.480
for the purposes of this series I'll be using
the traditional definitions of AAA and indie.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.140
The first two games I'll be looking at, Battlefield
4 and Insurgency, are superficially similar:

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.720
both are tactical squad-based first person
shooters set in a contemporary world with

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.430
realistic weapons and gameplay. However, Battlefield
4 is a AAA title from Swedish developer DICE,

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.950
published by EA and with a long franchise
history while Insurgency is a recent release

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.570
from independent developer New World Interactive
and began life as a source mod for Half-Life

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.610
2. The scope and gameplay of the two games
are very different and this difference is

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.090
at the centre of what makes the comparison
so interesting.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.090
Battlefield 4

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.500
Traditionally, Battlefield games were defined
by their sweeping scope, including not only

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.990
tactical infantry combat but also ground and
air vehicle warfare across huge maps and varied

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.900
terrain. Battlefield 4 continues that tradition
and offers a variety of gameplay modes and

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.479
experiences. There's something for all FPS
fans in BF4, whether you prefer close quarters

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.240
infantry combat or fighting for air superiority
in an attack helicopter. Across the four different

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.369
and unique classes, all with their own tactics
and abilities, there are dozens of available

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.210
weapons and hundreds of attachments to unlock.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.280
The range of gameplay modes and loadout options
points at the scale of BF4 and this is both

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.610
a strength and a weakness. While there is
potentially something for everyone in Battlefield

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.790
4, the game itself is massive, growing larger
and more complex with each expansion and threatening

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.419
to succumb to bloating and feature creep.
Basic gameplay issues like hit detection and

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.689
client/server net code are neglected, with
developers seeming to focus on implementing

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.240
new maps and game modes rather than fixing
potentially game-breaking bugs. Granted, the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.029
new features have been welcomed by the majority
of players but the core game is at risk of

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.970
suffering from neglect.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.909
I've played a lot of Battlefield 4 since it
was first released but I haven't been playing

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.989
much recently. For the most part I've moved
onto new games but the main thing that keeps

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.099
me from coming back to BF4 is the gameplay.
I prefer playing on infantry-heavy maps like

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.599
Operation Locker but these maps are rendered
nigh-unplayable by the amount of grenade and

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.809
explosive spam. You can find servers that
ban explosives but even these devolve into

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:08.090
chaos, with choke-points becoming meat grinders.
There's nothing particularly fun or tactical

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.620
about constantly running into certain death
when two teams are fighting over one corridor.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.151
These situations are caused by a confluence
of weapon balance, map design, and player

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:21.409
mentality. Unfortunately, as there are many
moving parts there's no easy solution.

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.840
Insurgency

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.569
Insurgency started off as mod for the popular
and flexible Source engine, responsible for

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.139
classic first person shooters Half-Life 2
and Counter-Strike Source. Developer New World

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:36.650
Interactive recently released a standalone
version of Insurgency, offering squad-based

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.299
military combat with an emphasis on realism
and tactics. Much like Counter-Strike, the

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.939
opposing forces in Insurgency are split into
two groups, here security and insurgents.

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.269
Players choose a class and loadout at the
beginning of the round but unlike Battlefield

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.209
there are no unlocks or character progression.

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.370
Insurgency can't compete with the scale of
Battlefield 4 (there are no vehicles, for

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.169
instance) but makes up for it with a tighter
focus on infantry combat and strategy. The

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.299
Source engine is renowned for having excellent
net code and firefights feel snappy and reactive.

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.199
Teamwork is essential as there are limited
HUD elements and no mini map for spotting

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.900
enemies. One key controversial gameplay element
is the lack of a kill feed; you won't know

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.370
if you've killed your target without seeing
him die. Therefore good communication is key

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.200
if you want your side to be successful. Unfortunately,
the Insurgency player base is still small

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.800
and finding populated servers can be difficult
at times.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.920
New World Interactive initially released Insurgency
as an early access alpha and they were very

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.420
responsive to player feedback, incorporating
a number of suggestions and fixes into the

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:42.070
core game. They've also released an SDK for
custom maps and modding, an area in which

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.070
Battlefield 4 is lacking.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.450
At the moment I'm enjoying Insurgency more
than Battlefield, even though I tend to die

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.150
a lot. The gameplay doesn't feel as random
as in BF4, even when I get suddenly killed

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.180
with no explanation. I especially enjoy being
able to lean, something sorely lacking in

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.250
Battlefield. It's a shame there aren't more
players as Insurgency fits nicely halfway

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.430
between stripped-down Counter-Strike and feature-heavy
Battlefield.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.430
Conclusion

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.570
So, should you play Battlefield 4 or Insurgency?
Well, like I said in the intro, this is an

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.660
arbitrary comparison from my own personal
experience. At the moment I'd say Insurgency

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.070
but I did have a lot of fun with Battlefield
4 in the beginning.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.320
If you like a variety of gameplay modes, vehicles,
and loads of different unlocks (and are willing

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.780
to put up with some frustrating deaths), try
Battlefield 4. The game is still one of the

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.161
best-looking PC games around, with a high
level of polish and attention to detail. This

00:05:31.161 --> 00:05:35.910
polish doesn't come cheap, however, and Battlefield
4 has a AAA price, even before considering

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.930
additional DLC or Premium.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.910
However, if you're looking for something a
bit smaller, more tactical, and with surprisingly

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.000
deep combat gameplay, check out the indie
alternative. At a third of the price of Battlefield

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.570
(even before the inevitable Steam sales),
Insurgency is a lot of fun at a good price.
