00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:12.570
UD is developing the STAR campus across from
its Ag School, athletic facilities and football

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.570
stadium. STAR stands for Science, Technology
and Advanced Research. Today, the Silver Brook

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:27.039
Stream crosses the STAR campus. As outlined
in its Master Plan, this project is a great

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.580
opportunity for UD to have a positive impact
on the environment by restoring ecological

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.290
habitats, improving water quality, and minimizing
energy demand.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.550
However, for several years the City of Newark
and UD have been in collusion with a company

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.550
called The Data Centers LLC. They are proposing
to build a data center, which they claim needs

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.100
a massive 279 MW natural gas power plant on-site.
This power plant can power the entire city

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.870
of Newark 5 times over! A power plant such
as this has nothing to do with science, technology

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.729
and advanced research.
This development would negate any positive

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.209
ecological impacts of the STAR Campus. It
would increase UD's CO2 emissions 7 times.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.190
This makes it impossible to meet UD's Climate
Action Plan target of reducing emissions by

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:32.190
20% from 2008 levels by the year 2020.
The proposed location for the plant is next

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.369
to a residential neighborhood and elementary
schools. The 24/7 noise pollution from the

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:46.369
power plant would be a nuisance for all living
and working nearby. The ten 165 feet tall

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.970
smoke stacks would have a significant negative
visual impact on the beautiful aesthetics

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.830
for which UD is famous. Emissions of particulate
matter and gases like nitrogen oxides would

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.959
negatively affect the health of students and
residents alike, leading to increased cases

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:10.959
of respiratory problems. Why are UD and the
City of Newark subjecting us to this monstrosity

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.510
under the guise of a data center?
Well, the promoters argue that they need the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.920
power plant to ensure a reliable supply of
power to the data center. However, there are

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.090
three high voltage electric lines in the vicinity
that could more reliably supply all the power

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.890
the data center needs.
This project makes no sense for UD or the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.890
local community. It is unequivocally, a bad
idea. For more information on this project,
