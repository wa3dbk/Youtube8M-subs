00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.269
While there are common concepts and practices
to pruning all roses, it does help to know

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.720
what kind of rose you have before you start
pruning.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.640
Whether it's a climber or a classic tea rose
with the big buds we're all familiar with,

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.660
or something more carefree like these knock-out
roses.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.230
You want to have a good idea of what you hope
to accomplish before you start hacking away

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.230
at it.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.320
The classic tea roses and roses in general,
but mostly tea roses are susceptible to black

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.920
spot and that's one of the main reasons that
people prune them is to keep a good open structure

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.369
that allows air circulation so that black
spot's not allowed to form.

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:51.910
So what you want to be looking for in a tea
rose is only three or four canes that open

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.220
up in a vase shape, so that you have an open
air space to the middle that allows air circulation.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.910
What you don't want are any cross canes or
foliage laying up against each other, which

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.170
will hold moisture and then promote the formation
of black spot.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.590
So you'll just want to go in there.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.340
Any of those canes that are in the center
of the rose bush, go in there and prune those

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.280
out down at the base so that you have that
open air space or vase shape in the middle.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.991
Now another reason that you'll want to be
pruning your roses is to deadhead them, if

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.780
you want to keep them to bloom.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.420
And everybody wants their roses to bloom as
much as possible.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.960
Now the reason for deadheading is that when
a flower or plant or a plant forms a flower

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.170
bud, it acts as a signal to the rest of the
plant.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.930
It sends a hormone or a signal back to the
plant that says, "We're done reproducing and

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.090
we don't need to make any more flowers."

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.280
So if you want your plants to keep flowering,
you need to cut off those seed pods that are

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.880
formed to keep the signal from going back
to your plant that says it's done reproducing.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.060
So in any case when you're deadheading something,
just find a rose hip or a flower bud and just

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.520
go in and snip that off.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.010
It's as easy as that, and just discard it.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.080
It'll rot.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.680
If you want to do a little size control, or
you want to get rid of some branches that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.310
are crossing or in the middle that's inhibiting
air circulation, you'll just go in, reach

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.860
in, go down to where the next branch is that
you want to keep, and just snip it off like

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.860
that.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.260
And then whatever's left, again, you can throw
it in the compost pile or discard it as you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.260
will.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.420
One of the keys to pruning roses is you really
want to make sure you have a good sharp pruners.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.870
Some of these canes can be quite large and
in those cases you may want to use a Japanese

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.140
folding saw.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.140
These are very sharp.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.010
They're very effective so be careful, but
you can just go in and prune out the larger

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.040
canes.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.170
Concerning your pruner as well, you'll want
to have what's called a bypass pruner, which

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.110
acts like a scissors, and the blade moves
past the other blade.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.230
You don't want to use what's called an anvil
pruner, where the blade comes down and strikes

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.360
a piece and does not pass by it like a scissors.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.280
So those are the basics for pruning the various
kind of roses.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.800
If you want to get more information, of course
you can search on the internet, and there's

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.510
loads of information on pruning specific kinds
of rose bushes.
