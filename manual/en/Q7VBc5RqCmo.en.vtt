00:00:02.056 --> 00:00:05.576
&gt;&gt;Tom: The social,
economic, environmental needs

00:00:05.816 --> 00:00:09.416
of this generation, that in and
of itself is important to teach.

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:12.886
From an education perspective,

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:15.186
we are experiencing
increased engagements

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:17.196
across a variety of disciplines.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:21.206
&gt;&gt;You can trim both
of these right there.

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:25.126
You still have, right, the leaf.

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:25.996
This is the leaf,

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:28.376
photochloroplast will
be photosynthesis.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.566
This though is the
shoot and it's going

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:30.866
to keep growing, make sense?

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:30.946
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:00:31.836 --> 00:00:32.696
&gt;&gt;Tom: When I first got up here,

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:34.756
we weren't even using
the term sustainability,

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.396
but we were recycling,
we were composting.

00:00:37.396 --> 00:00:40.866
And then we started tying in a
little more into the classes.

00:00:42.556 --> 00:00:44.346
Then I realized, if
we were to really look

00:00:44.346 --> 00:00:46.536
at all the different
facets of sustainability,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.376
certainly the social and
economic in a biology class,

00:00:49.376 --> 00:00:51.336
we wouldn't get to all the
other things we had to teach.

00:00:51.336 --> 00:00:54.696
So we put out an email
to teachers to see

00:00:54.696 --> 00:00:56.536
who was interested in
having a conversation

00:00:56.616 --> 00:00:59.246
around using the
concept of sustainability

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:01.606
to make cross-disciplinary
connections.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:04.716
About a dozen teachers
came together after school

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.896
on their own time to
start talking about,

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:09.276
what can we do here
on the campus

00:01:09.276 --> 00:01:11.266
to really model sustainability?

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:14.006
The idea of food production
came up pretty quick.

00:01:14.586 --> 00:01:17.546
We use the overarching
theme of sustainability

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:19.986
to provide this context.

00:01:20.106 --> 00:01:23.066
&gt;&gt;Sam: We have greens, and what
eats our greens other than us?

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:23.896
&gt;&gt;Student: Aphids.

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:25.546
&gt;&gt;Sam: Aphids consume
some of that,

00:01:25.546 --> 00:01:28.306
and ladybugs eat the aphids.

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:30.166
&gt;&gt;Tom: We use the food
system as a vehicle

00:01:30.396 --> 00:01:32.966
to generate these
experiential lessons;

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:34.586
they're standards-based.

00:01:37.506 --> 00:01:38.946
So teachers were involved

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.496
from the beginning
on a voluntary level.

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.246
Then we started to find
different ways to tie

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:47.136
in other classes, other
teachers and said, "Hey,

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.816
while we're doing this, you
know, in biology, you're looking

00:01:49.816 --> 00:01:52.716
at maybe these ecological
implications, maybe you can look

00:01:52.716 --> 00:01:55.246
at some of the economic
pieces that are driving it."

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.486
&gt;&gt;Heather: What's cool
about public banks is

00:01:57.576 --> 00:02:00.266
that they're not just a
way to reduce inequality,

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.126
but they're also a way

00:02:01.126 --> 00:02:02.786
to promote sustainability
in our state, so--

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:06.056
&gt;&gt;Sustainability is really
important to me and it's sort

00:02:06.056 --> 00:02:08.466
of surprising to me that it's
not important to all economists

00:02:08.466 --> 00:02:11.346
because economics is the study
of how to use scarce resources

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:13.606
to fulfill infinite
human wants and needs.

00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:15.276
&gt;&gt;A priority of a
public bank would be

00:02:15.416 --> 00:02:18.216
to make low interest
loans to small businesses.

00:02:18.796 --> 00:02:21.466
Imagine that TJ and
Tabitha decide

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:26.166
to start a business
growing and selling wheat.

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:30.036
They could then get a small
loan from the public bank,

00:02:30.296 --> 00:02:31.476
so you get that wealth creation

00:02:31.476 --> 00:02:33.336
but you don't have
the wealth extraction

00:02:33.546 --> 00:02:35.756
because the interest ends
up staying right here.

00:02:40.006 --> 00:02:41.636
&gt;&gt;Tom: We were going to
do this irrigation system,

00:02:41.856 --> 00:02:43.746
so we wanted some type
of alternative energy

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:45.376
to power the pump
that was out there.

00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.386
So I tossed that over to Anne
Watson, the physics teacher,

00:02:48.386 --> 00:02:50.116
and said, "Hey, this is
what we're looking for.

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.796
You want to tie this
into your curriculum?"

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:53.716
&gt;&gt;Anne: And I said, "Well,

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.656
maybe we could make
this a feasibility study

00:02:55.656 --> 00:02:57.006
for my students."

00:02:57.006 --> 00:02:59.456
&gt;&gt;We need to write
a table of the data

00:02:59.456 --> 00:03:00.436
that you're going to collect.

00:03:00.706 --> 00:03:05.456
&gt;&gt;And so we, as a class,
came to some conclusions,

00:03:05.536 --> 00:03:08.206
one of them being that
the school should look

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:10.456
into getting photovoltaics
or solar panels.

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:13.086
&gt;&gt;Tom: They raised the money
for it and ultimately worked

00:03:13.086 --> 00:03:15.716
with the company to
install those panels.

00:03:16.226 --> 00:03:18.346
&gt;&gt;Anne: Now for my physics
classes, we're looking

00:03:18.346 --> 00:03:22.016
at what the production rate is,
and is that space sustainable

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:23.226
in terms of electricity?

00:03:23.386 --> 00:03:26.236
Are we producing enough to
meet the needs of that space?

00:03:31.746 --> 00:03:32.886
&gt;&gt;Sam: So you've
got biomass weight.

00:03:32.886 --> 00:03:34.306
What's the third one?

00:03:34.646 --> 00:03:35.426
&gt;&gt;Student: Respiration?

00:03:35.426 --> 00:03:37.726
&gt;&gt;Sam: Yeah, heat and
respiration, right?

00:03:37.726 --> 00:03:41.286
&gt;&gt;Tom: We introduced students
to the greenhouse in biology,

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.276
focusing on nutrient cycles,

00:03:43.336 --> 00:03:45.986
as well as plant
physiology, anatomy.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.666
&gt;&gt;Sam: Make a flow chart of
that energy that's coming

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:49.596
into the greenhouse.

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:51.886
&gt;&gt;Right now we're doing
a unit on the biosphere

00:03:51.886 --> 00:03:53.486
and we're looking
at energy transfer.

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:55.636
&gt;&gt;We can use something from...?

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.936
&gt;&gt;Student: From the
biomass, from those consumers

00:03:58.936 --> 00:04:00.506
when they die goes
into the ground.

00:04:01.056 --> 00:04:02.476
They can be used
by the producers

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:03.756
and their nutrients
from their body.

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:05.586
&gt;&gt;Sam: Yeah, the key
word there is nutrients.

00:04:05.636 --> 00:04:06.556
Decomposers are really good

00:04:06.556 --> 00:04:08.996
at returning these
things back to the system.

00:04:09.176 --> 00:04:10.506
&gt;&gt;Tom: Over the years,
though, we've worked hard

00:04:10.506 --> 00:04:13.516
to give them a number of
different options of classes

00:04:13.516 --> 00:04:16.246
from AP Spanish to algebra,

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:18.666
in which they would have
a broader experience

00:04:18.666 --> 00:04:20.576
with sustainability
and food production.

00:04:21.316 --> 00:04:23.326
&gt;&gt;Sam: It doesn't matter how
long I stand at the front

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:25.676
of the room and talk
about photosynthesis

00:04:25.676 --> 00:04:28.536
and cellular respiration if
they have no context in which

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:30.016
to think about those things.

00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:31.436
Being able to go out
to the greenhouse

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:34.896
and really see those things
in action makes the learning

00:04:34.896 --> 00:04:37.016
that much more meaningful.

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:41.186
&gt;&gt;Anne: I would encourage
teachers to find those ties

00:04:41.416 --> 00:04:42.366
between what they're doing

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.506
and someone else's
class or curriculum.

00:04:44.926 --> 00:04:46.726
We can create these
opportunities

00:04:46.726 --> 00:04:47.966
for each other as teachers.
