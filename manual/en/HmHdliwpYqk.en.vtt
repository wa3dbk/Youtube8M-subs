00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.480
Have you ever visited a ghost town?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.840
This week, I embark on a daring adventure
for historic ghost towns of the old west.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.370
“It’s just amazing!”

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.849
Hi I’m Alejandro.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.030
I travel to unbelievable places and explorer
our past.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.279
I am, the Dead Explorer.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.990
First we start in Pearce Arizona, an old mining
town just east of tombstone with a current

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.339
population of fifteen people.

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.830
When I first got into Pearce I was a little
disappointed because there wasn’t really

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.830
a lot to see.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.090
There was a couple of building behind an iron
fence.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.780
You really couldn’t get inside them; get
real up close and personal with the ruins

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.930
of this ghost town.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.620
But as I started leaving on the ghost town
trail I found this, which is absolutely beautiful

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.840
on the bottom of this hill.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.940
It’s abandoned, used to be building, that’s
a room right there and there’s a wall of

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.940
this building.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.670
It’s an amazing site and its open!

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.670
You can go inside it.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.810
So what I’m going to do is I’m going to
take the camera and I’m going to take you

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.420
closer to the room and to the wall and of
course we’re going to very very careful

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.990
not to damage anything so future visitors
can enjoy this location.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.640
But, I’m really pumped to have found this
out here in Pearce, AZ.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.260
Part of the ghost town trail just outside
of tombstone.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280
Driving down the ghost town trail is an amazing
experience.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.700
It’s a primitive road and there’s nothing
out here, but desert and cactus and bushes

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.500
and mountains and it’s just absolutely beautiful.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.870
And it’s exciting to go down it, just to
relive some of the history of where we come

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.460
from, especially in this region of Arizona.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130
It’s just absolutely beautiful.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.340
I’m pumped to be out here and checking out
these ghost towns.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.200
I just drove up to another site.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Let’s go inside.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.530
It’s a building on the side of the road.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.760
Little did I know that I was in for an unexpected
surprise.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:47.030
It’s got a little bit of graffiti on it.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.909
Next week, on Dead Explorer, an unexpected
surprise and the adventure continues.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.700
Tune in next Monday for more Dead Explorer.
