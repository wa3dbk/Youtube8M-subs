00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.299
One of the most impressive features of Davinci
Resolve 11 is

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.389
the ability to smooth out skin.

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.930
You can think of it as a form of

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.309
digital makeup.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's take a look at this image here.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.539
I apply the very basic grade to this image,
however, I want to

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.510
smooth out the skin area.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.390
If I come to the Color Match tab here,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.900
there is a new control down which is Midtone
Details.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.900
To

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.720
understand what it does, I'm going to zoom
to this image here.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.480
Notice what happens to the skin.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.660
Usually the skin, in any image,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.080
is in the Midtone area, generally speaking.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.390
So, I can simply

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.530
increase the details in the Midtones, or reduce
details in the

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.290
Midtones, thus, smoothing out the skin.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.410
The problem here is that this effect is being
applied to the entire

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.410
image now.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.940
So, it's affecting her face, his jacket.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
It's just

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.329
removing details from the Midtones in the
entire image, which is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.469
not particularly something that we want to
do.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.940
Let's reset this, and I'm going to add a new
node.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:00.940
And now in

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.610
this node, I'm going to key her face.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.500
So, I'm going to come to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.110
Highlights here, and just click on a sample
of her face color.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.000
And now, I'm going to increase the width of
the Hue Qualifier,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.720
selecting more of her face, and I'm going
to play around with

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.881
the Saturation Qualifier, increase the softness,
denoise, and

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:22.080
increase the blur radius.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.780
And, change the selection of the Luma

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.960
Qualifier here, select more of her skin tone.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.330
I roughly have her skin selected now.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.330
Now, this node is

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.640
controlling her skin.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.189
So, if I come now to the Color Match tab

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.310
again and reduce the details of the Midtone,
I'm actually

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.670
smoothing out the skin.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.950
And, I was able to do that inside

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.100
Davinci Resolve without the help of 3rd party
plug-ins.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.450
I can actually repeat the process by adding
a new node, selecting

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.840
her skin one more time, and apply the same
effect (which is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.310
Midtone Details) in the new node even more.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.600
I'm going to deactivate these two nodes so
you can take a look

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.880
at the original skin before the smoothing,
and back to the smooth

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.880
skin.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.920
This is a very impressive feature.
