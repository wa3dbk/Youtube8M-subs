00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:08.080
Welcome To G-TV!

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.970
Today I will be showing you how to use heat
sink compound.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.160
There are two different types of compounds
I have in front of me.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.340
One type is intended to be used on applications
where the contact surfaces are thermally conductive

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.250
as well as electrically conductive.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.519
The other type of compound is to be used on
contact surfaces that are thermally conductive,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.349
but insulated electrically.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.719
The silicone free heat sink compound, such
as the Tech Spray 1978-DP, is intended for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.890
all electrically isolated base encapsulated
modules.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.170
Primarily these are used with devices such
as bridge rectifiers, IGBT modules, transistor

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
modules, solid state relays and power modules.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.750
I can apply this to the flat metal contact
surfaces that will be mounted to my heat sink.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:06.270
The material can be spread by using your finger,
a flat tool, or even rolled on with the side

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.440
of a screwdriver.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.860
Since the material can be a bit messy, I will
use the side of the screwdriver until the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.790
paste is spread throughout and then I can
apply the item to my heat sink.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.530
The other material I have is electrically
conductive, such as the Burndy Penetrox A-13,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.240
and is for non insulated modules and stud
mounted power semiconductors.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.750
This can include components such as diodes,
SCRs, triacs, and transistors.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.790
It is intended for any device that has an
electrically conductive connection point that

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.570
is being mounted to a metal surface with a
need for heat dissipation.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:54.170
The Penetrox A13 is non petroleum based with
suspended zinc particles and works well with

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.390
aluminum to aluminum and aluminum to copper
applications.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.700
This material is easier to clean and can be
applied with a finger or brush.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.810
For stud mounted devices this should be applied
liberally to the thread and the base of the

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.450
stud before applying to the heat sink.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.860
This can also as a lubricant for the thread
and reduces galling and seizing.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.720
For flatter non insulated devices such as
an SCR, the penetrox should be applied liberally

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.250
enough to cover the area, but not so much
that the compression against the heat sink

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.730
would cause the electrically conductive material
to ooze out.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.510
