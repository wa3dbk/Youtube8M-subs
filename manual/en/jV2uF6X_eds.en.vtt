00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.459
Being at school affects your family in a number of ways.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.700
It can be stressful on one end when your trying to get things done for school

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.180
and you have to pull off to the side and try to take care of them

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.960
and the things they need.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.360
At the same time they also help to push you to continue to do well

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.740
and move forward.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.120
Trying to get past the thought that that's all I would ever be and

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.780
that's all that I would ever be looked as

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.020
was something that I had to overcome and really,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680
along with that, feeling that I'm smart enough

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.740
and capable to get a college education

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.220
was something else I was...

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.440
Upon my release I was taking a recidivism class

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420
and Cathy Lachman, who's currently my boss

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.360
she came to speak to our class

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.600
about the College Gateway Program, which is located

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.460
at Red Rocks Community College,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.400
and I came and signed up for the program

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.100
and I've been here ever since.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.580
Just about eh, the services I've used here at the school

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.360
I've used just about everything here at the school.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.000
I definitely been in the tutoring lab a lot.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.420
Getting a lot of help on my math.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.160
The Writing Center as well.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.520
One of the reasons why I said I am the future is because

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.020
at a point in my life I didn't see myself having a future.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.840
You know, I didn't see myself living past 21

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.600
I didn't see myself accomplishing anything I accomplished

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.820
thus far

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.360
in my life

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.800
in all areas.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.760
I no longer have that outlook you know.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.420
I now have my children, I have my family

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.820
I have the people that, um I'm here at the school for

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.900
that I work to help them realize the same dream.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.160
So, because of that, constantly looking at moving forward.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.780
That's why I feel like I am the future.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.900
I have one now.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.160
And I'm hoping to create one for...
