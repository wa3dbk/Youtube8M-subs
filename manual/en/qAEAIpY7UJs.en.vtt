Hi, this is Toby and he just passed the G1
Exit RT Test at Downsview.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.460
Just wanted him to talk about his experience
with Young Drivers of Canada.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.260
Hi Toby, go ahead.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.529
I love Young Drivers!

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.110
It was a lot of fun, learned a lot of new
things that I think that I will be able to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.070
use when I'm driving in the future.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.530
I have friends doing other courses and they
don't know half the stuff that I know about

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.629
driving.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.720
Young Drivers definitely helped me out over
a lot of other courses.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.720
It's been fun!

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.789
It definitely was great.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:58.510
So you think the emergency maneuvers will
help you maneuvering through traffic.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.439
A lot of emergency maneuvers that I will definitely
be able to apply or hopefully not.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.630
But if I get put in that situation I will
feel pretty confident that I know how to get

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.630
out of it.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.330
OK, you talked about your friends with other
courses.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.929
Are you talking about other schools?

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:23.400
Yes, other driving schools don't give you
the same kind of experience.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.649
You don't learn as much.

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.909
You learn more defensive driving [with Young
Drivers of Canada] rather than just how to

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.250
pass your drivers test.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.530
It's great.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.799
So it's something that you can use for life?

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.960
Yes, I will be able to apply this to definitely
my future in driving.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.340
OK, thanks Toby for talking with us today.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.750
I wish you all the best and I'm extremely
proud of your achievement!
