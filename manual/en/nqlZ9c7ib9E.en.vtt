00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.359
Hi, I'm Italo Bassi
from Enotecca Pinchiorri in Florence

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.689
Alessandro Della Tommasina is here with me.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.550
Today we'll prepare a traditional recipe,
a bit reinterpreted

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.360
we’ll prepare

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.480
Cacio e Pepe “Spagherotto” Broken Spaghetti
This was our idea

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.240
we thought we’d prepare
spaghetti as a risotto

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.620
by using classic spaghetti
and breaking it up this way

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.330
with our hands.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.260
Here are the ingredients:
spaghetti

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.420
black pepper

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.980
shallots

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.380
Pecorino Romano cheese

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.570
butter

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.520
edible flowers and aromatic herbs

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.460
white wine, Tuscan extra virgin olive oil.
Now let's prepare the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.110
Pecorino cheese “whey.”

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.190
Here we have boiling water.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.900
Let's take some
grated Pecorino cheese

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.590
and add it in.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.780
We're letting it dissolve like this, then
Taking it off the heat

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.240
so that the creamy part sinks to the bottom.
Then we strain the whey.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.270
Now we’ll prepare the “Spagherotto.”
Let's take some Tuscan extra virgin

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.640
olive oil. Let's put in

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.400
a pat of butter

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.680
and some

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.830
shallots

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.450
that we had minced.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.270
We're letting the shallots sweat a bit

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.280
with the oil and butter. Let's take our
broken spaghetti and put it

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.680
into the skillet.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.790
Let's toast them, as if we were
cooking risotto.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.520
At this point, when they're toasted

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.140
pour in some dry white wine.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.180
The wine has evaporated

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.650
so let's pour in

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.380
our Pecorino cheese whey

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.799
we previously strained, then let's proceed
as if it were

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.569
a classic risotto.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.719
We'll let it cook for about 12 minutes
then taking it off the heat
we’ll thicken it

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.230
as if it were a risotto, using butter and
some Tuscan extra virgin olive oil.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.879
After 12 minutes,
it is ready to be thickened.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.629
We’ll add butter,
black pepper and

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.649
a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:35.139
Let's thicken our Spagherotto,
then we're ready to plate it.

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.809
We're finishing our dish
by laying our Spagherotto down

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.449
it has to be very creamy,
just as if it were

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.739
Cacio e Pepe spaghetti.
Garnish

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.209
with edible flowers and herbs, to give it
some color,

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.549
freshness and fragrance.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.689
So our dish is also pleasing to the eye.
Let's finish our Spagherotto

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.300
with a little grated Pecorino cheese

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.899
we’ll put it

00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:02.089
on the spoon.

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:18.319
Our Cacio e Pepe risotto-like Spagherotto
is ready!
