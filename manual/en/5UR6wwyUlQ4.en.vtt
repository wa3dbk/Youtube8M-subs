Hi, this is Tom from HTPC-DIY.com

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.800
For my MythTV build I chose the Antec EarthWatts
380D ATX Power Supply. It's a 380 Watt

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.610
ATX12v Power Supply that is 
80+ Bronze certified. 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.680
The 80+ Bronze certification means it 
has  been tested to be at least 82% 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
efficient operating at 20, 50
and 100% of it's rated load.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.170
Normal ATX power supplies are
60 to 75% efficient.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.360
Considering this computer will be on for long
periods of time the extra energy

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.680
efficiency should help pay for the 
additional cost.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.090
There really wasn't much of a price difference.
I bought the Antex EA-380D  for around $45

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.060
Which is only about $15-$20 more than
cheeper power supplies.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.660
I haven't opened the power supply yet
so let's see what's inside the box.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.990
Four mounting screws are included.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.189
The main connector is a 20+4pin
power connector.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.949
The other cables are a 4+4pin ATX/EPS12V connector
for the motherboard,

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:18.300
A 6pin PCI express power connector if you're 
installing a high end graphics card.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.819
4 4pin modular plugs for 
fans and IDE drives.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:27.819
5 SATA connectors
and 1 floppy drive connector.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.829
The power supply feels solid. It's not made
out of thin metal like some cheaper power supplies.

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.989
You should note that a power cable isn't 
included in the box.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.099
You're supposed to reuse your existing
one if you're replacing a power supply.

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:56.499
But if this is for a new computer you
might need to buy one.

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.659
Now let's actually install the 
power supply in the case

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.719
When possible I like to install the power
supply first because it's a bit heavy and it could

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.759
damage something if it 
accidentally drops

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:12.139
This isn't an option on all cases 
but the nMediaPC 6000B

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.589
the power supply mounts on the side.
When installed the power button should be on

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:20.060
the bottom.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.230
There aren't any guides to help you position
the power supply.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.230
You just have to slide it in and align
it with the holes on the back.

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.610
An issue some reviewers had with this case
was the screw holes don't always line up.

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:09.610
I'm having the same problem.

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.259
I start the screws by hand to avoid stripping 
the threads. Afterwards I finish up

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:40.940
with a screwdriver but i don't

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.940
tighten all the way until I've made final adjustments.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.300
I've tried different things to get the 
holes to align

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.020
but in the end I wound up only able
to install 3 of the 4 screws.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.020
That shouldn't be a problem however.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.919
The rest of the video is just me tightening screws 
which I'm sure you can figure out on your own.

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:55.070
