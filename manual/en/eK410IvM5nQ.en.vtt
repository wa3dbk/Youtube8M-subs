I'm Kristin Hitchmeyer with Bobcat
Company. Yeah my name is Rob Gillis I'm a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.179
marketing manager with Bobcat Company
out of Fargo, North Dakota. I'm the one

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.250
that you're going to be talking to here
on Facebook. We're out here today on my

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.560
at my house actually, and I have a few
acres, right around 15 acres of land. He's

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.939
planting trees here today. I have 14
trees that I want to put into the ground

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.420
today. Figured what better way to do it
than to bring out some Bobcat equipment

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.619
to help me out so, we turned it into a
photo shoot. I thought what better way to

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.239
let you guys have kind of a sneak peek
of what goes on at a photo shoot, so

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.190
you're going to see what equipment to
use, what attachments. I have a bunch of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.090
people out here to help me to plant my
trees today so it works up works pretty

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.559
nicely when you can do that. Work with
pleasure. So hopefully you enjoy what you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770
see today.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.810
We're putting 14 trees into the ground,
and to dig them by hand would have been

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.400
it take me all week since we're putting
in pretty good-sized trees. That brought

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.920
out several different pieces of
equipment, because we have several

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.970
different sized trees to plant. Different
equipment and different attachments are

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.360
better suited for different sized trees.
If you're planting really really big

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.050
trees, an excavator's about the only way
to do it, to get a big enough hole. Don't

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.310
be intimidated by this they're really
easy to run, and you don't need one near

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.540
this size to do this type of work. I've
planted a lot of trees out here with the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.860
418 which is a really small compact
excavator that can be pulled behind a

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.630
normal SUV. Most of the rental shops rent
them. It's gonna have a smaller bucket

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.229
and take a little bit longer to dig, but
still way faster than digging it with a

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.610
shovel. If it's a medium-sized tree, you
can you can get a pretty good sized hole

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.360
with a with an auger. Look at the dirt I
end up with at the end, it's nice and

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.720
good back fielder. If
were to shovel it by hand you end up

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.700
with clumps, like every shovel load is a clump and you can't put that back in

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.080
the hole. And then if you just have a
quick plant or even a transplant, the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.940
digger Bobcat digger works really well. A
lot of people probably don't even know

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.810
that we have a digger, and so we needed
footage of that and so we brought that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.070
out today. We're here on site with Bobcat
A770 skid steer loader and an auger

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.870
attachment. Imagine digging these
holes by hand versus digging them with

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.850
an auger. Right. Today we're going to be

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.380
digging four holes for some trees that
our marketing manager, Rob Gillis, wants

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.260
to plant here at his house. Maybe you
could even say, I'm betting that he can

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.500
turn a a four-hour job into less than
five minutes. Imagine you have four holes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.120
to dig at your house. How long would it
take you? 45 minutes per hole, up to four

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.360
hours of work? My challenge to him is
see if he can do it in under five

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.740
minutes. Let's see what he can do.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.560
Who put that stock pile there.
