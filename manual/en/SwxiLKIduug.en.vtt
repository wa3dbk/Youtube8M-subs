00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.640
We've been using vipre for about two years at Liverpool football club

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.839
Stats Sports vipre affects the trade by the way we train based on when we use in real time it allows us to look at

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.009
Key Metrics

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.660
based on certain days of the week and allows us to either reduce the amount of work players will do or

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
increase the amount of work players are doing certain days of the week

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.180
We've newly had the Smart training ground system put in place here at melwood based on the fact that it provides us

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.160
Reliable and accurate data

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.020
it allows us to make real-time decisions as training as occurring as opposed to waiting for the download

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.480
And then analyzing the session once it's completed

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.220
which then obviously doesn't allow us to make real-time decisions and affect the volume

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.900
Intensity and load that were put through players on a daily basis

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.620
the Key metrics that we use post training session

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.860
will vary depending on the day of the week that we are leading into a match

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.060
So if it's a four days away from a game

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.700
We'd look at slightly different metrics to what we would use

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.500
or look at and analyze if we're three days away from the game

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.549
Four days away, we'll probably look at more of a high metabolic load type

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.220
variables of the Method Metabolic

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.479
Variables as opposed to on a three days away from the game

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.500
Probably looking at more of a

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.981
total distance and high intensity distances and meters per minute

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.320
for example in Pre-season

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.720
We'd set Daily Targets

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720
for players as a group

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.759
For their unit as defenders midfielders and attackers

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.559
And as for and for individuals so as that was occurring during training again

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.030
We could prompt players through certain practices to certain make sure they hit certain targets

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.629
And then as I said earlier if they didn't hit those at the end of the session

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.950
We're then able to provide an add-on for them to make sure that it did hit their Daily Target

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.590
During the season it's more about

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.160
yes,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.080
making sure we hit certain physical parameters on certain days of the week

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.756
But then for me, It's also about monitoring fatigue

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.760
and making sure that we maintain freshness for players across a competitive season

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.680
Our relationship with Stats Sport I'd say is very good

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.780
They're pretty much on the phone 24/7 if we need people out or for specific reasons

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.160
Then they're generally out with within that week to solve any problems that we might incur
