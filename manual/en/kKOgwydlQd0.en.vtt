Hi! My name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
expertvillage.com. In this clip we are going

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.180
to talk about one of the steps involved in
a major tune-up or vehicle overhaul. This

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:21.789
step we are talking about is refilling the
engine oil after it has been drained. In this

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.189
clip we are going to talk about one of the
maintenance items involved in a major tune-up

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.939
or vehicle overhaul. Once we’ve drained
the engine oil, we are going to have to refill

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.950
it and what you are looking for there are
various types of engine oil. Now days you

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:43.830
have synthetics, synthetic blends and conventional.
I still prefer conventional oil for the cost

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.260
of better fit ratio. These synthetics are
great; nothing against them but they are still

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.990
too expensive for me to purchase for my dollars
worth. What you are looking for as far as

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.810
a qualified oil to make sure that the quality
is where you want it is this. This symbol

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:12.240
right here stands for American Petroleum Institute
Service and the rating is SL. Anything farther

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.150
down in the alphabet than SJ is appropriate
for any vehicle built after 1989. Before that,

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.600
it is going to be letters decreasing in rank
of the alphabet. You are going to have SA,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.110
SB, and SC and so on. Those are rated for
much older vehicles. So anything rated for

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.190
SL or better is going to good enough for you.
This happens to be the cheap stuff on the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.390
shelf. Locate and remove your oil cap. It’s
a good idea to set it up out of the way so

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.500
you won’t bump it. If it falls down on the
engine department, you are going to have to

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.280
spend some time looking for it. I always do
the final. I’ve done this a million times

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.920
and spilled probably a million drops of oil.
If you use a funnel, you are going to notice

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.940
that you won’t spill any. The oil quart
jug is offset. As you can see, the opening

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.880
is all the way to one side. That is the side
that you want up. That is going to allow air

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.230
to enter the quart as the oil leaves, so it
doesn’t pull a vacuum and dump out of the

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:36.090
quart on you. The amount of oil that your
engine is going to take varies pretty widely.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.349
This particular vehicle, I checked the owner’s
manual and it’s my car, it takes approximately

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.099
4 ½ quarts. Now the appropriate method for
this particular vehicle would be to add 4

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:52.989
quarts. Fire the engine, back it down off
the ramps, wait for the oil pressure to come

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.340
up which is going to indicate that the filter
is primed and then shut the engine off and

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.319
wait approximately 30 seconds for the oil
to drain out of the cylinder head. From there,

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.840
I would remove the dipstick, check the oil
and adjust the level with the additional half

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.940
quart. Now the amount of oil that your particular
vehicle is going to take is going to vary

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.690
pretty widely. You are going to want to refer
to your owner’s manual for the appropriate

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.040
method and quantities. It is going to be in
the section listed under fluid capacities

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.190
or routine maintenance. If you have a diesel
you are going to be talking about gallons

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.620
of oil instead of quarts. Make sure you get
enough oil before you drain it out of your

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.349
engine because you may be stuck if you only
have one car.
