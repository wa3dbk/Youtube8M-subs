00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.330
so we're going to talk about gluing it's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.840
sort of a foundation skill here's our

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.390
PVA which is something that we are very

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.060
fond of especially formulated for paper

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.980
and then this is a methyl cellulose

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.390
which when you buy it there's some white

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.640
powder inside and you think huh is this

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.980
a drug shower or something but it isn't

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.330
it's just good old methyl cell it we use

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.760
it with the PVA it extends the drawing

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.190
time and make it slippier it's easier to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.140
center the paper with it it's also

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.020
reversible if you use it alone which is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.059
for archivists a really nice little

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.180
feature so the first thing you do is you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.820
fill it with hot water and I've got one

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.710
over here brewing I don't know if you

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.239
it's still hot I don't know if you can

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.230
see the steam but it's really hot and

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.810
that is what dissolves the methyl

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.950
cell and then you add an equal amount of

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.610
cold water to chill it down and then it

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.710
thickens to sort of a muck it's very

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.840
gelatinous and so there's that and then

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.540
the PVA I've already transferred one

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.829
into a container and putting it in

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.930
something like this makes gluing really

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.990
easy I will caution you however that the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
mixture once you add this to it becomes

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.710
has a shelf life so you don't want to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.899
make a huge amount keep this separate

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.810
keep this separate and and then mix it

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.299
into here so here's my PVA which is

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.430
sixty percent of my mix and I'm going to

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.049
add forty percent of this it's not

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.119
rocket science so there we go that's

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.180
about right I think it's I think it's a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.890
little bit too much in but we'll see

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.579
you can always fix your measurement by

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.719
if I had too little PVA in I can add

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.760
more if I had too little methyl cell I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.010
can add more of that too so here we go

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.170
the perfect the book binding mixture
