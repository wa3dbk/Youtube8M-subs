Howdy folks hows it going welcome to my virgin
kitchen.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.230
Today i'm showing you how to make homemade
twinkies - oh my god!

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.620
They look amazing right and i've had over
50 requests to make this in the last Year.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.161
When someone first told me about twinkies
I was like twinkies?! that sounds like some

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:22.320
sort of cream for your downstairs department
for when you're ill you know what i'm saying

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.850
- doesn't matter, they taste good and it's
a good fun project too so if you wanna have

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.880
a go at making this hit pause on the video
now write all those ingredients down lets

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.880
do it.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.760
Grab a mixing bowl and pour in your egg whites
now your eggs have been seperated so you'll

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.190
use your yolks in a minute so don't worry
but whip up the whites with an electric whisk

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570
gradually add in your sugar in batches until
it's nice and firm then add your cream of

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.959
tartar and mix that through making a super
stiff egg white my friends stiffer than a

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:54.840
.... get your egg yolks into a seperate bowl
with your sugar and beat it again with an

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.519
electric whisk until nice and pale and thick
and a lemony colour.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.899
Pour meow not like a cat like that or when
you're teaching a dog 'come on' paw... paw

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.250
your egg yolk onto the egg white which makes
it look a little bit like a fried egg but

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.970
very temporarily then your gonna sift on your
flour so you've got plain flour there and

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.320
cake flour which is like the pimp of flour
it's a bit more expensive but it's so super

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.730
fine you know it's gonna make it so super
soft that sponge - definately worth it!

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.970
Now add melted butter, milk, vanilla essence
and fold briefly until well combined so that's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.180
the cake batter done and to make the twinkie
moulds we're using a pepper mill and rolling

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.750
up some foil so just sit it down on a sheet
of cut out foil roll it around get it around

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.740
the edges and just try to shape it around
grip it a little bit and pull out the pepper

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.892
mill you might want to repeat that a few times
just to give it that shape if you're feeling

00:01:42.892 --> 00:01:46.530
a little flash and you can afford it you can
go online and get something called a canoe

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.640
tray and that's designed perfectly for these
twinkies.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.830
Anyhow pour your cake batter in there, whack
it in the oven it only needs about 15 minutes

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.560
in there keep your eye on them then it's time
to fill it.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.140
Make the filling while the twinkies are in
the oven by combining butter, icing sugar,

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.720
vanilla... ice?...

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.409
no, salt, and marshmallow fluff with a little
bit of warm water which will help break it

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:13.940
down and just stir that all in together until
smooth then slap it into your piping instrument

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:14.940
of choice.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.579
With the twinkies cooked and cooled take a
bamboo skewer to the flat side and make 3

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.640
incisions so start with a real small hole
and just gradually work it round making it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.130
larger and what you want to try and do imagine
my finger is a twinkie you wanna put your

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.989
skewer in but when you're in there sort of
work it around at an angle so they're all

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.939
joined up together as one big band of cream.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:42.950
Grab your piping instrument I love that word
insert it into your twinkies holes pump your

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.810
cream in you can see where this is going fill
it with cream and that my friends is your

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.630
twinkie all done when you break into it you
see all that cream in the middle and they

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.140
taste amazing so if you enjoyed this video
