00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.400
Midnight_ 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.240
Not a sound from the pavement

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.810
Has the moon lost her memory?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.980
She is smiling alone

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.940
In the lamplight

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.970
The withered leaves collect at my feet

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:44.350
And the wind begins to moan

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.430
Memory_

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.210
All alone in the moonlight

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.110
I can smile at the old days

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.250
I was beautiful then

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.480
I remember the time

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.950
I knew what happiness was

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:16.440
Let the memory live again

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.560
Every street lamp seems to beat a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.430
Fatalistic warning

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.750
Someone mutters, and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.910
The street lamp flutters

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:47.150
And soon it will be morning

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.120
Daylight_

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.830
I must wait for the sunrise

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.670
I must think of a new life

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.880
And I mustn't give in.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.460
When the dawn comes

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.990
Tonight will be a memory too

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.790
And a new day will begin

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:49.720
&lt;instrumental break&gt;

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.380
Burnt out ends of smoky days

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.690
The stale cold smell of morning

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.460
The street lamp dies

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.490
Another night is over

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.740
Another day is dawning...

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.140
Touch me_

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.230
It's so easy to leave me

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.570
All alone with my memory

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.670
Of my days in the sun...

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.690
If you touch me

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.980
You'll understand what happiness is

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.740
Look,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:04.830
A new day has begun.
