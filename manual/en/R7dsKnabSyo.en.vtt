00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.000
We know all too well about my history with
Marvel Vs. Capcom.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.020
But I’ve never really been that engaged
with the Marvel side of the roster, aside

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.230
from the general pop-culture consciousness.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.120
If only there were a Capcom crossover game
that pulled from my own wheelhouse, one with...

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.900
well, giant robots would be a good start.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.489
Now, what can we find with plenty of giant
robots... wait, what’s this seahorse doing

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.780
here?

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:56.430
Behold, the massive stable of Tatsunoko Production,
the folks behind Speed Racer, Gatchaman (AKA

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.280
Battle of the Planets), Tekkaman Blade, Generator
Gawl, Genesis Climber Mospeada (AKA one-third

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.660
of Robotech), Yatterman, the list goes on.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.130
Point is, it’s colorful characters, along
with the occasional giant robot (‘sup, Gold

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.030
Lightan), and they’d likely mesh well with
an equally absurd mix of Capcom characters.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.590
This isn’t some high-concept piece about
saving the world, or restoring peace to the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.590
universe.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.000
It’s about Casshern throwing down with Frank
West, just ‘cuz.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.259
And that’s fine, so long as the mechanics
are spot on.

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.730
Problem isn’t the mechanics, though.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.520
As far as modern two-on-two fighters go, it’s
pretty standard, and sound in its execution.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.399
The problem is its platform.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.490
Let’s face it, the Wiimote isn’t suited
at all to fighting games, save for maybe the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.250
two-button-centric Smash Bros.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.690
As such, the Wiimote controls are dumbed down
to the point of insult, with one button and

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.130
a waggle for super attacks, or waggle the
other way and you win.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.000
I honestly couldn’t stand it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.790
Fortunately, you can plug in a nearby GameCube
controller and have a little more control

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.619
over the action, though this device is still
less-than-optimal.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:17.060
Your best bet is to dust off your Wii Classic
Controller, if you’ve got one lying around.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.720
But once you’ve figured out how to make
things work, the rest of the game goes fairly

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.720
swimmingly.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.680
This is my favorite kind of game: one that
refuses to take itself seriously, and which

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.329
caters to a broad base.

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.310
Your standard Chun Li and Ken the Eagle and
the like certainly take the forefront, but

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.720
don’t forget that this was the premier outing
for MVC3 combatants Viewtiful Joe and Frank

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.720
West.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.840
In addition, this game represents the acknowledgement
of three different Mega Man series in the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.010
same game, with Roll from the original canon,
Zero from the X series, and Legends-style

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.010
MegaMan Volnutt.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.010
Broad appeal.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.749
It’s a good thing.

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.849
And the final boss?

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.629
Let’s just say it’s a fast throw out of
left field, with a whole lot of kanji around

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:06.549
for whatever reason.

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.290
Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom was never out to shake
up the world like MVC3 did.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.310
Firstly, it’s a Wii-exclusive release, putting
it in the hands of a huge install base that

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.170
excludes the HD-preferring hardcore set.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.841
It focuses too much on balancing the players’
abilities rather than the characters, with

00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:26.709
its multitude of simpler and simpler control
schemes.

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.450
From a technical aspect, it’s a stepping
stone on the way to the ideas and concepts

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.640
we appreciate in the latest and greatest release.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.769
But, if you’re going to be a stepping stone,
why not be as fun as possible?

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.499
And it’s in that frame that this game shines.

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:44.319
It’s not about tournament domination, so
much as it’s about just enjoying some classic

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.209
characters from the past 30 years of video
games, and 40 years of anime.
