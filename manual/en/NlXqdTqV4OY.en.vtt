00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Hi there. In Safety Checks and Skills today,
 we're talking about getting ready 
and getting comfortable in the car 
before you drive.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now Brian, I understand this is 
another check list we need to go through
 before we start driving, 
what's this one all about?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well Jess. This is not just a check list 
for learners it's something every driver 
needs to do every time they get into a 
car that someone else has been driving.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
OK, where do we start?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Jess - the best place to start is with the seat.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
At the moment we need to get your 
legs adjusted correctly. So now move 
your seat forward until that can happen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Once your legs are adjusted correctly you can now check your arm length.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And to do that you put your arms out 
to the steering wheel. The top of the 
steering wheel should cross your wrists.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Let's look at the steering wheel's 
height as well.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
When you adjust the height of the 
steering wheel you should be able to 
look through the top half of the steering wheel itself to see all the gauges on the 
dashboard.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Just by this lever here, pull it up?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This lever here, yes. Push that down and 
lift it up to a point where you can see 
clearly the dashboard and a good 
clear vision of the road ahead.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Okay. And what's next?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Let's look at the headrest. - Okay

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Most cars have adjustable headrests.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Okay, so how's mine?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
How does it feel? - Yeah, it feels good.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Remember it's there to support head 
in the event of a collision and to look 
after your spine and your neck.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Okay. - The next thing we do is put 
your seatbelt on.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Okay. This one's an important one.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is very important.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now the correct position for your 
seatbelt needs to be that the sash 
part of your seatbelt cuts across 
your shoulder.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
A good idea here is to grab the 
seatbelt and give it a short tug to 
make sure that it is firmly fitted. 
So, how does that feel?
0:01:39.000,1193:02:47.295
And the lap part of your seatbelt cuts 
across your hips.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Good, nice and firm.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And comfortable? - That's right.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Terrific. The next thing we do is 
check your mirrors. - Okay

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The center mirror you should see clearly through the back window.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
That's right.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Check your left side mirror and you 
should be able to see the back wing 
of the car and the rest of the mirror 
provides vision of traffic behind you.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That one's good.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I'll shut this door now so you can adjust the right side.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay. Yep, looks right to go.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Good Jess, one other thing to do. We need to locate some more controls.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Can you tell me where your demister switch is? - That would be this one here.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Good. And your temperature control switch? - This one here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And your fan control? Doing well. 
How about your headlights, hi beam and 
low beam?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Perfect. How about your windscreen wipers? - Yep

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And lastly your hazard lights. 
Well done.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Thanks Brian

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That's a wrap.
