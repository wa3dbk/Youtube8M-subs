00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:16.129
I

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.720
all right well here we have a battlefield
that company to

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.580
and now some of you might be upset but I didn't
finish that song

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.940
and I can actually get the either the name
of that analytical put it at the end of this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.050
to you as well

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.460
there's going to be a review of battlefield
that company to and I'm going to go and start

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.450
with the multi-player right now

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.679
%uh night

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:59.189
log in earlier in got all of my keys and everything
put into that way it would help you know with

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:00.110
the video

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.790
you get you get in get you

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.310
you know an idea of what it's like playing
battlefield that company to

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.320
I'm actually going to speed the studio up
a little bit

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.040
a stunning about right now because I have
to have some friends my friends less than

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.670
once they get that done

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.570
go ahead George strait through them

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.490
%uh because they want me to play with them
and this is going to be my first time playing

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.560
on the PC

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.430
I played this was my friend's house and I
was very impressed by and I wanted to buy

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.980
it

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.120
I knew that they had some issues with their
servers but I read on the web site that those

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.460
issues are getting results very quickly

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.640
according to DEA

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.440
all right so I actually have to speed up the
video four times faster to give it all to

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.930
fit into this review

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.219
%uh I know that might sound like a lot

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:43.950
but it's what you see you know

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.729
to know that this is actually four times faster
than what I can do what I'm doing right here's

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.159
changing the graphics make each other on the
lowest setting so that we get the best results

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.949
for the review you know recording with threats
and everything

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:58.270
I'm updating several with here and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.110
looks like were waiting

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.860
for it to go

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.330
they do have my friends of my friends with
now

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.909
well we're all in the process of doing the
same thing

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:13.349
and one of them here in a second is going
to tell me that they got into a server

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.939
so I'm going to go and walk out why did

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.859
and go over to them

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.889
you click on it something happen

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.670
oh it's said a to find it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.119
so here we go

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:30.199
noting the servers this is what I was told
to do with people who have been playing it

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:34.059
so are eight please wait yeah okay buttons
on

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:35.699
keep moving on moving on

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:39.589
%uh another please wait here

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:40.839
and another

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.849
so at this point I'm asking them over to you
speak you know what's the deal and I did bring

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.269
up

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.029
but it's the in thing there

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:50.510
just 'cause I was born I guess

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.229
and they said over to use the to just keep
trying to keep trying it's the pig goes

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.809
and I told them you don't click in a row but
it's not even given the to please wait with

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.939
a there behind it now

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.049
and the senate are able to read several is
so I take it that

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.590
and we sit here for

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.209
I don't know probably get forty or fifty seconds
and nothing happens

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.389
so I get upset with that still not getting
any please wait here

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.589
and they said the lockout what back in

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.649
so here we go on the log out

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.739
well again

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.889
and that been updated much that's what I thought
was recorded because I haven't been able to

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:27.939
play yet

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.159
%uh I know that you can see when I was shaking
a lot

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.169
and that's usually showing a bit of frustration

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.629
but you know it is great game with which actually
get into it here so

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.539
let's let's keep going to keep clicking on
this and we're going to get in this today

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.240
and I will

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.749
I will make this review

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:49.989
still quitting here and

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.049
having a bit of an issue with that

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.199
larry

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.039
something to myself now

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:01.430
should and even like connected

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.309
so on the golan on the drop this year

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.509
what's frightening

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:11.219
and %uh I may go straight into that might
that now looking at least that's your everything's

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.320
a zero because I've been able to play yet
but it brought up

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.799
we need to think I'm on one side of automatic
join game

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:18.989
that didn't work either

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.639
all right i'll make this review

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.490
for single player I know that is as multi-player
review that what you get is something I got

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.729
to give you something

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.719
so here we are

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:31.080
this is it on the gate is a single player
action

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.720
and %uh

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.279
this is this is going to show you

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:35.919
at least

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.370
I know what the game

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.039
looks like

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.209
well I mean the man is really nice right I
mean you know the guy comes towards you and

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.639
he goes back in

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:52.300
that's that's pretty cool fact that yes

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.140
I mean when you're watching this four times
slower that guy doesn't come at you so quickly

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:01.220
so this is getting ridiculous I'm going to
go and also for the game

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.330
and %uh restarted

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.389
and I'm a bring it back up for a a I would
give the PLO's in the intro music that I stole

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.310
from a completely different he a game

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.849
I hope this gives you a good idea of what
it's like playing battlefield that company

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.930
to I mean this has been my experience with
it since I bought it and I'm very pleased

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.619
with this great game

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:21.120
and the goal and one that music that I promised
you in

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.629
let you finish watching the review for yourself

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:30.629
yeah

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:06.349
I
