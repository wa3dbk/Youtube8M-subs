00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.620
Soda Fork Creek is located 20 miles east of
Sweet Home Oregon and is a tributary to the

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.980
South Santiam River. It is part of an important
watershed for salmon and has the potential

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.110
to provide habitat for threatened species
such as Winter Steelhead and Chinook Salmon.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.710
So why don't fish spawn in these waters?
While Soda Fork Creek may appear a healthy,beautiful

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.680
stream to the casual observer, hydrologists
and fish biologists know it is lacking a key component --

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.960
large downed wood.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:48.500
Well, Soda Fork was scoured down to bedrock.
Because of past practices where they came in

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.460
and they logged out the -- they had big
big cedar logs that were in this and it retained

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.900
all the gravel and now it's all gone.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.140
To replace the missing wood that once trapped
the gravel and created spawning beds,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.100
the Forest Service and the South Santiam Watershed Council developed the Soda Fork Creek Restoration Project.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Stream experts carefully selected trees based
on size and location.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.060
They planned each tree's placement
 in order to create a stable and complex log jam.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.060
Trees were not cut, but rather pulled over
in order to keep the root wad attached.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.000
Keeping the root wad intact 
will protect the structure from high flood events,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.200
which would otherwise push the wood downstream.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.100
Experienced contractors were hired to use cables
 and heavy machinery to topple the trees.

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.780
Each structure that we put in of all those
eight structures, or whatever they are, should

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.659
be one that is clear on the bottom, engaging
the stream and then more multiple pieces on top of that

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.000
so the wood will engage the stream at all different flow levels.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.000
In the end, 34 trees were added to the Soda Fork Creek.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.800
The amount of wood placed in the stream was based historical data
 and is intended to replicate natural log jams.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.200
While it may look messy to the human eye, it mimics what
should have been here all along.
(Music fades)

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.560
In this particular case, the logs in the stream
will be able to trap the gravel that the fish

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.560
need to spawn. They also trap leaf litter
that then becomes the base of the food chain,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:50.250
right, the bugs eat the leaves and then the
fish eat the bugs. It restores the stream,

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.420
and so everything that has evolved with the
stream in these conditions has evolved with

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.049
wood in the stream as well. Right, so it's
all part of the whole ecosystem to have wood in

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.390
the streams. And probably there's a lot
of reasons that we don't even understand

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.489
why it's important for it to be that way,
but that's the way it is naturally, so that's

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.500
the way we are trying to make it again.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.189
With the help of a nearby high school, hydrologists
will monitor the creek's changes over the

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:30.769
next several years. The students are measuring
stream width, recording location and number

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.900
of pools and riffles, and using photo points
to track the changes.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.730
We're hoping to see a lot more gravel throughout
this whole reach, and a lot more pools,

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:54.000
and so, spawning gravel areas and pools but we'll
see in five years. Hopefully we'll see hundreds of steelhead spawning.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.500
That'd be cool.
