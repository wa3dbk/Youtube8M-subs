What do we mean by genius and does that category really matter? Do we really

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.140
need to study this kind of way of categorizing one individual or another? So, let me begin with

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.579
Dean you've spent a lot of your career thinking about these kinds of issues.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.930
So just pose the question: you know, who first defined genius? Where does that idea come from? Well,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:42.240
I mean the idea of genius itself dates back to the ancient Romans. It used to be thought that every single person

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.280
was born with a genius and...

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.480
Well at least every single male was born with a genius women had a women had a Juno,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.780
which you probably haven't heard of. And we're not - noticed - we're not talking about junos. We're only talking about geniuses.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.600
But it was something that was special. It looked out for your welfare.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.780
We'd probably call it a guardian angel, and it was a thing that made you kind of unique.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.240
So, it really didn't have the special connotations that it has today.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:14.700
But later on after the Renaissance , when we had these incredible geniuses - people like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci  -

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.960
people started coming with this idea

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.040
of genius as being something really special. And notice, it's very important, because in this new idea

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.800
not everybody had a genius only a few people had a genius.  And

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.480
and one of the major figures to do this is Immanuel Kant in his Critique of

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:41.540
Aesthetics or judgment. And in there, he talked about geniuses as fulfilling two requirements:

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.100
The first is they have to do something original,

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.560
something that stands out, different than the crowd. And the second thing -and this is very important because you got to remember that

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.600
a lot of crazy people can produce original ideas...they do it all the time...

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.860
there's even art museum consisted of nothing but work by mad people -

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.380
you have to produce something that's not just original,

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.680
but also exemplary. It's something that other people would look up to and admire and use as a basis

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.760
for their own creativity. So that was those two things, originality and

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.580
being exemplary, where the primary things. But it's interesting that should add this because we included scientists amongst the genius...

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.880
According to Kant,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.160
only artists could be geniuses.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.080
Scientists didn't have to be geniuses because they had a scientific method.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.820
He even says, Isaac Newton wasn't a genius because he could teach anybody to do what he was doing.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.620
So it's an interesting thing. But let me just add one more thing, and that is - since I'm a psychologist -

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.420
psychologists like to take over the people's fields and other people's ideas, and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.000
in the early part of the 20th century somebody came up with an IQ test

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.680
and decided to find genius in terms of your IQ score, instead of in terms of your "exemplary originality".

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.740
This was actually done at Stanford . And

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.780
this IQ score

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.720
was set arbitrarily and one hundred and forty. And that's ended up in the dictionary.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.820
Just it...it means you're in the top 1% of the population. That's all it means.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.840
And so, if you don't produce something that's original and exemplary, then just get a high IQ score;

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.320
Two ways of doing it. (laughs)

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.540
So with that definition is and was genius typically identified

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.600
early in age with the young, or is it I mean...  I have an example. You know. when I

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:48.720
was going to high school, I had a high school classmate who maybe some of you know, - Mark you may know - Noam Elkies.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.400
You know Noam?  No, yeah you do? So he's the youngest tenured Mathematician at

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.540
Harvard. And

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.940
when I was in high school, you know, we would hang around sometimes talk about Pi, and you know...[laughter]

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.500
... you know, to sort of break the monotony of those math conversations?

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:14.480
I once, you know, said to him that I loved the Brahms Rhapsody in G.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.400
And he said to me,  "Oh do you mean this?" And he proceeded to

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.140
simultaneously whistle and hum two lines of music of that piece.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.209
And I mean, do you know how hard... I mean I... just to learn how to hum whistle at the same...?

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.080
I mean, here i go...

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.580
(trying to hum and whistle at the same time)

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.040
* laugh *

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.480
You laugh? You try it. In this area. Hum and whistle the same time. And to have two separate voices simultaneously...

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.640
It was clear immediately this guy was just off

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.800
scale. Is that the kind of way in which genius has been identified?

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:56.220
Uh well that's kind of genius that people often talk about: The polymath;  the people who have multiple skills. And some people argue that

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.480
general intelligence - they actually call it "G" ...the 'G' factor -

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.940
can be applied a lot of different areas. And so if you have

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.000
tremendous general intelligence, you can learn how to whistle and hum at the same time, and doing a lot of other things as well.

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.280
That's your problem. That's why I'm  not over there, right? If I could, I'd be sitting one of your seats.
