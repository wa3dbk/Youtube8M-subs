Hello Guys this is Praveen for TechEmpty.com.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.430
In this current tutorial I'm going to show
you how to add contacts to WhatsApp on BlueStacks.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.240
Before explaining this process, let me provide
you some basic introduction on how to install

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.320
or download WhatsApp on PC.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.120
We have done a tutorial on the same.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.400
You can click here to know how to download
or install WhatsApp on PC using BlueStacks.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.110
If your PC doesn't have graphics card, then
follow this video on how to install BlueStacks

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.500
without Graphics card.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.679
If you are familiar with the process, just
watch this video to know the method of installing

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.039
WhatsApp on PC.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.859
To run android apps you need to have an emulator
which is here using BlueStacks.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.109
Go to BlueStacks.com and download the split
installer.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.030
Run this particular split installer to download
all the files or package of BlueStacks on

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.859
your PC.

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.799
Assuming that you have downloaded and installed
WhatsApp on PC using BlueStacks, now follow

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.080
carefully to add a contact or bulk contacts
to WhatsApp on BlueStacks.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.880
First to add a contact to WhatsApp on BlueStacks
App Player.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.100
Open BlueStacks and then open up WhatsApp
Messenger.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.520
Move to Menu and from the list of options
select "Contacts".

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.950
Over here select the Cartoon Icon and enter
the details like Name and Mobile Number.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.579
Do note that the number you are adding here
must be a subscriber to WhatsApp.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.340
Otherwise his/her number won't be shown in
contact list.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.670
Now come back to chat dashboard and select
Chat Icon.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.840
The number that you have added before will
be shown here.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.210
Select the number to start the conversation.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.479
Second one is to know how to add bulk contact
to WhatsApp on BlueStacks.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.439
To do this you need to have a supporting application
called Astro File Manager.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.289
Please follow the tutorial carefully from
here.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.250
I would like to explain this part in few steps.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.250
First one.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.190
Go to Playstore or 1MobileMarket on BlueStacks
then search for Astro File Manager.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.030
Agree the license agreement and download the
application on BlueStacks.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.970
So, now you have Astro FileManager on BlueStacks.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.750
Second step is to create vCard File having
.vcf as extension.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.170
This step is for smartphone users.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.440
To do this, follow these steps.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.680
Open up your smartphone then move to contacts
and from the menu select Import/Export.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.000
For the list of options, select Export to
SD card.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.280
It will take few seconds to minutes based
on your contacts list.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.100
Now you have your vCard ready.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.320
Transfer it to your computer in anyway like
connecting the smartphone to PC via USB Cable

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.030
or attaching .vcf file to email account and
download it on your PC.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.150
If you don't have any option to add a contact
manually on BlueStacks or in WhatsApp then

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.350
follow this way.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.320
Skip this step if you have Cartoon Icon to
add a new contact to WhatsApp on BlueStacks

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.940
as I have said in previous step.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.610
So, Open up your MicroSoft Excel Sheet then
list down your contacts maximum of 5.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.500
Because we need to convert this excel sheet
to vCard using software called Excel to vCard

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.590
Converter.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.350
This free version allows you to export only
5 contacts at a time.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.480
You can repeat the process as many times to
create multiple vCards.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:46.320
Don't forget to Save the file as "Excel 97-2003
Workbook" if you are using MSOffice 2007 and

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
more.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.620
So, let's get started.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.250
Visit ExceltovCard.com and download the software
from there.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.400
I have already downloaded and installed it
on my PC.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.430
After opening the software you will get the
screen as shown in this video.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.300
Browse the file, as in my case I have saved
it on the Desktop.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.210
This software will populate all the fields
as shown in this video.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.890
Now hit Next to map the fields.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.570
This is very important because it will tell
the software which attribute is the name and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.720
which one is mobile number.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.540
Do the same thing as I'm showing in this video.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.370
After adding all the attributes, hit Next
then click Convert.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.560
Now you will get a message saying demo version
will convert only 5 contacts.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.120
Hit Ok and select Yes.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.000
Now we have vCards ready.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.710
Now final Step for both Smartphone and Non
smartphone users.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.460
Open my computer and change the settings to
show the hidden files.

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:55.680
Copy the vCard files by going to C drive then
Program Data then BlueStacks then UserData

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.880
then SharedFolder.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.750
Non Smartphone users can copy the 5 vCards
by opening SysTools Folder and here in my

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.680
case I have exported them on my desktop in
the previous step.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.370
Here I'm copying my Smartphone generated vCard
and Manually generated vCard using Excel.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.410
Now come back to BlueStacks then open Astro
FileManager.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.160
Over here in the Locations select BstSharedFolder.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.000
Find all the vCards and open it via Contacts.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.020
Within few seconds you will see all your contacts
on BlueStacks.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.160
Now just move to WhatsApp then select your
contact and start your conversation.

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.480
Note that only the contacts who are using
WhatsApp will be shown in WhatsApp contacts

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.480
list.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.480
That's it.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:43.060
