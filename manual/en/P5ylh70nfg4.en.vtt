00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.980
Now I wanna talk about the backswing.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.949
There is a common myth in tennis that we need to get the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.569
racket back as fast as possible.

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.960
And over the years people taught
that on the court that you move around

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.949
with the racket back and then you swing.

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.690
There are some negatives to that. One, to get the racket up to speed can be tough.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.000
You know to be have a consistent

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.330
starting from a stopped position back here is tough.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.270
Here is what I want you to do!

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.400
Get prepared to hit the ball.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.300
When you let go with your hand,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.140
I want the racket to start moving and never stop all the way through the contact zone and all the way

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.780
through the follow through.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.320
So, this is what I want to see. Let go, Swing, Follow Through.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.100
Just like that!

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.230
OK, let's use Novak Djokovic

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.050
to reinforce this concept of a smooth
transition between

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.440
preparation,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.960
backswing,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.680
swing through contact, and follow through.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.810
OK, notice how he

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.200
prepares to hit the ball. He just turns his shoulders and hips sideways to the net

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.539
He releases the racket

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.539
and the racquet never stops moving all
the way through contact and follow through.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.920
Okay, to reinforce this concept,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.920
I want you to watch it watch two more times.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.030
Okay, we covered the basics of the forehand backswing.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.070
Remember, these are just the basics.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.470
There are various types of backswings based on the shot such as return of serve.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.310
But for now,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.139
This should get you started!
