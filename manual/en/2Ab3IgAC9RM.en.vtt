I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace lawns. How to
keep squirrels out of or off of a bird feeders.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:20.250
Well that's not a very easy thing to accomplish.
There are several things that you can try

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.700
and having experienced those I will tell you
what happened. We put a feeder up and we greased

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.730
the pole thinking that the squirrels couldn't
climb the pole to get to the feeder. They

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:43.640
did. We put tin, took some roofing tin and
wrapped around that pole thinking that squirrels

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.850
could not climb up to that bird feeder. They
still got there. How did they get there? Just

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.100
happened to notice one day that they were
up in the tree and they pushed that branch

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.659
all the way down and jumped off on to the
bird feeder. Immediately went and trimmed

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.350
down that branch thinking that we finally
had solved our problems. The squirrel found

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.969
another tree on the other side of the bird
feeder and did the same thing with the tree

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:23.380
branch. Where upon that tree got trimmed.
I have talked to several people who have used

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.049
these squirrel proof bird feeders that you
can buy at the feed stores, hardware stores,

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:36.209
other places and they have said that they
don't work either because the squirrels get

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.459
on them and even thought they can't get in
them, they shake the feeders and spill the

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:55.380
bird feed. What we've discovered is that the
birds and the squirrels mingle together and

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.439
get along just great. The squirrels are running
up the sunflowers because the seed planted

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:11.670
in the ground. So my solution to that is to
leave them alone, let them come and go because

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.770
the food that they put on the ground the birds
still eat. There is still seeds in the feeder,

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:24.820
the birds will get that, the squirrels are
happy. And if you sit back and enjoy it, you

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.070
will notice what a pleasure it is to see the
squirrels and the birds mingling together

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.440
in the trees and in the ground. And that in
itself is a true enjoyment. So rather then

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.510
try to keep them from getting in the bird
feeder enjoy the benefits that they do by

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.860
getting in there. And that big benefit is
putting food on the ground for the ground

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.180
feeding birds. Morning doves, in this part
of the country are one of the ones that love

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.520
to eat off of the ground. So you can feed
the birds in both places and enjoy the squirrels

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.040
at the same time.
