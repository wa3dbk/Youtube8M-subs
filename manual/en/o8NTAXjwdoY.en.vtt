00:00:04.706 --> 00:00:06.666
- Ladies, what....

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.368
Excuse me, let me get my vocals back.

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:10.427
(laughing)

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:13.249
Ladies, what are we making today?

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.144
- The Baja Blast Cooler.

00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:17.699
- Exactly, you see the
passion in her voice?

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.301
That tells you, this is some good stuff.

00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:20.665
Okay, let's make this drink.

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.867
Coconut Rum, Orange Vodka.

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.534
Together, same time, same amount.

00:00:26.534 --> 00:00:27.657
Action.

00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:29.821
Stop.

00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:31.628
Bobbi, you're late, okay.

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:32.535
You were late to the party.

00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:33.601
- My thing was dripping.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:34.742
- You were late to the party.

00:00:34.742 --> 00:00:39.559
Peach Schnapps, Blue Curacao,
same time, equal amounts.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.318
Action.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:42.788
Stop.

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:45.770
I want it to kind of slide
off the side a little bit.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:46.906
I will just use the ice.

00:00:46.906 --> 00:00:49.337
The ice is my scone.

00:00:49.337 --> 00:00:50.254
- [Blonde Woman] This looks awesome.

00:00:50.254 --> 00:00:51.922
- It does look nice.

00:00:51.922 --> 00:00:52.928
- Right.

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:55.537
- So you get a nice fade to it.

00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:56.382
- Ohhh yeah.

00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:56.903
- [Woman] It's really pretty.

00:00:56.903 --> 00:00:58.423
- [Man] Right, right.

00:00:58.423 --> 00:00:59.740
- Garnish.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.901
There is a slit in there, just get it in.

00:01:02.286 --> 00:01:03.451
- [Bobbi] Wow (laughs).

00:01:03.543 --> 00:01:05.122
- Okay, perfect, perfect.

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:07.866
Alright, and there you have it.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.187
The Baja Blast Cooler.

00:01:10.187 --> 00:01:13.185
Okay, get your lips on that, alright.

00:01:14.155 --> 00:01:15.912
(laughing)

00:01:17.851 --> 00:01:20.517
- Mmmmm, Yum.

00:01:20.517 --> 00:01:21.434
- You like it?

00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:22.330
- Yeah.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.540
- This is a damn pretty drink dude.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.073
That blue is just amazing.

00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:29.390
- I've been chased by a
monkey twice in my life.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.534
- [Man] A monkey in Barbados?

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:33.157
- When I was in Africa I
got chased by a baboon,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.438
and it almost stole my
passport, I swear to God.

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:36.061
- Wow.

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:38.530
- Because I had some bread in
my bag with this passport--

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.116
- He wanted bread.

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:40.851
- And he like ran after
me and baboons are huge

00:01:40.851 --> 00:01:42.533
and they have really big teeth

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.956
and he took my bag and like ran off.

00:01:44.956 --> 00:01:46.842
It was terrifying.

00:01:46.842 --> 00:01:47.907
- Why would you play with a baboon?

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:48.671
- I wasn't playing with it.

00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:50.563
I was walking along and
these baboons just like

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:52.318
came up and were like (snarling).

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:53.236
- And you just stood there?

00:01:53.236 --> 00:01:55.563
- No, I turned around and I ran

00:01:55.563 --> 00:01:56.749
and then I knew he was--

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.157
- Now I know white people,

00:01:58.157 --> 00:01:59.956
You are very, very curious, okay.

00:01:59.956 --> 00:02:01.180
You see 10 baboons.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.583
"Well why are the baboons
hanging out like that?

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:03.491
"Let me go check this shit out."

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:04.101
- No.

00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:06.463
- Black people are like fuck
baboons, fuck this shit.

00:02:06.463 --> 00:02:07.679
- We all turned around and just ran

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.116
and they were running after me.

00:02:09.116 --> 00:02:10.636
- No one tried to get help?

00:02:10.636 --> 00:02:11.403
- From who?

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:13.400
No, my friends all ran off too.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.459
- With 10 baboons chasing her,
who is trying to save her?

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.360
- I was like I am going
to be stuck in Zambia

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.123
for the rest of my life.

00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:18.765
- We love you at Tipsy Bartender,

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:19.499
but I want you to know

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.109
if we are chased by 10
baboons, your ass is screwed.

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.260
- I would have been
sprinkling some Malibu Rum

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.130
in their eyes for you.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.500
(laughing)

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.732
- See, that's what you'e
got to like about Bobbi,

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:29.445
this is a down ass chick.

00:02:29.445 --> 00:02:31.883
She sees baboons coming, she's
fighting her way out, okay.

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:32.998
- I got you.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:33.696
- Yeah, in Barbados,

00:02:33.696 --> 00:02:34.968
there was like just a momma monkey

00:02:34.968 --> 00:02:35.913
because I went up to it

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:37.318
and there was a little
baby and then she like

00:02:37.318 --> 00:02:39.100
grabbed her baby.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.124
- Why would walk up to a monkey?

00:02:40.124 --> 00:02:42.228
I tell you white people
do the craziest things.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.202
- It was a little monkey though.

00:02:43.202 --> 00:02:44.433
- Oh, there's a monkey with a baby.

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:45.873
Let me go take this baby and hold it.

00:02:45.873 --> 00:02:47.173
(laughing)

00:02:48.374 --> 00:02:49.175
- I don't want to break the glass.

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:50.588
- It won't break, you can go higher.

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:51.661
That's a thick glass.

00:02:51.661 --> 00:02:52.217
- Okay.

00:02:52.217 --> 00:02:54.956
- A little bit higher, drop it.

00:02:54.956 --> 00:02:55.962
- So, I took this cup

00:02:55.962 --> 00:02:58.660
and I tried to like pee in my car

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.618
but like I don't have
the tool that you had.

00:03:02.618 --> 00:03:04.306
- (mumbling)

00:03:04.306 --> 00:03:07.759
- So, I had to like kind
of squat up in my car

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.343
like get over it.
