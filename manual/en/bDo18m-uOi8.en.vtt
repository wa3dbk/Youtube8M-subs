00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's out pleasure to be here today with Guido van Rossum, inventor of the Python programming language.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Guido van Rossum, Author, Python Language:] I stayed relatively close the ABC,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and ABC's ideals just sort of naturally lead to a language that is easy to teach.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I was in a situation where my two choice were on one hand Shell,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
which is easy and nice for simple scripts, but sort of limited if you want to do anything complex,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
especially in those days when it was like well before Bash, the original Bourne shell

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that I mostly had to deal with.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then on the other hand, the C language, which you can use to do anything you want,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
including implementing your own programming language,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but it all takes a lot of effort and it's easy to make mistakes

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that only sort of come out much later after you've already implemented a lot of code.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
You'll realize, oh, I should've used a different kind of data structure and start over from scratch.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.000
That original computer programming for everybody idea, in part was just a ploy

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to get funding from certain corners--if I may admit to that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
One of the reasons that in the end note much happened

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
was that the funding turned out to be much harder to obtain than just writing a proposal

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and winning some contests, which we all did successfully,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and then getting the funding turned out to be still an impossible hurdle.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I know plenty of teachers who have been teaching Python to high school students at some level.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I heard recently that somewhere in England there is a national initiative that is at least considering--

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I don't know how much that actually became a definite plan

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to teach Python to all high school students there, which is a great idea--

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a wonderful experiment, and no matter what the outcome,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
a lot will be learned from that experiment.
