[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:07.110
J MAC: Hey, everybody.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.680
I'm J Mac, and I'm
going to show you

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.100
how to remove the door speaker
grill on your '87 and '93

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.370
door panel.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.210
Now these are typically
broken, just like this one is.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.890
A couple of the plastic
tabs are broken,

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.330
and this speaker grill just
flops around on the panel.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.750
Now to get to it, you do have
to remove the door panel.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.375
For more information
on that, check out

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:27.150
our door panel removal video.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.700
Now you want to
lay it face down.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.410
Grab your pair of diagonal
cutters, or something similar.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.290
A couple of these tabs
are already broken,

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.370
and you can just clip
off the remaining ones.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.610
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.650
Then, you can pull the old
speaker grill off the panel,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.910
and out of the way.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.720
Our new speaker grills
are 5.0 Resto brand,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.230
and they're sold in a pair.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.460
They are paint to match.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.960
And for more
information on painting

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.800
your interior plastic
pieces, check out

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.745
our interior panel
painting video.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:03.630
Now you can slide your four tabs
through the corresponding holes

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.980
in the door panel.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.050
And if your door panel's
a little bit warped,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.800
you may have to work
with it a little bit,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.633
to get them through.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:14.242
 

00:01:14.242 --> 00:01:17.820
And especially on these
carpeted lower panels,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.610
sometimes the carpet
gets in the way.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:29.350
 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.420
All right.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.660
And then, included with
that speaker grill pair

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.950
are eight-- four for each door--
little metal push clips that'll

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.640
hold that speaker grill
to the door panel.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.250
And you can just simply slide
those over the plastic tabs,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.800
and push them down with either
a screwdriver or your pliers--

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.090
just anything to engage it
fully on the back of the panel,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.460
and fully engaging
that plastic tab.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.220
 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.845
Work your way
around to all four.

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:09.432
 

00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:13.550
And some of them might give
you a little bit of trouble.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.530
There we go.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:31.210
 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.349
And last one.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:48.540
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.710
All right.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.830
And now you have a newly
attached, and non-floppy,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.090
speaker grill.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.770

restoration videos and tech
