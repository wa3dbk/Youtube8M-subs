00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.940
We'd like to finish up the QiGong with a real
basic sitting and breathing exercise, a meditation

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.639
exercise. And this is, once again, something
that you can do at the end of your QiGong.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.610
So we've showed you the warm up, we've showed
you some QiGong moves, and now we want to

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.090
finish our QiGong with just simply sitting,
breathing and doing a little bit of meditation.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.239
And I'd like to talk about how do we do that?
Some, some of the real basic, simple things

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:43.271
to do. Find yourself a nice comfortable pad
to sit on. Remember to find yourself a quiet

00:00:43.271 --> 00:00:50.539
place to do QiGong. You can turn on some music,
some soothing music, or absolutely have no

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:59.719
music and, and be able to have peace and quietness
though. The key ingredient, you have to have

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.720
peace and quiet because it's, you get more
benefit out of it if you do that. Okay, but

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.870
to close, we want to do a little breathing
meditation. Sit down with your feet, and those

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.190
of you who are extremely un-flexible, you
can sit with just simply crossing your legs,

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:27.270
just like this. Okay, but what I like to do,
is I like to show you what we call a half

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.620
lotus position. And in the half lotus position,
it helps to align your back a little bit more

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.480
in your meditation and it keeps you from slumping
over. Okay, so when we do the half lotus position,

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:48.820
what I'd like to demonstrate for you is, remember,
don't let anybody tell you that, "oh, you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.660
have to do it this way, otherwise it's wrong."
We are all at different skill levels. And

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.930
if I don't do something exactly like someone
who's twenty years younger than me, it's okay.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.129
We're going to benefit from these exercises.
Okay, so don't let anybody tell you, "oh,

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:15.480
don't do it that way, you should force your
legs way over here." Forget about it. Do it

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.819
according to your skill level. So in the half
lotus position, I'm going to sit and I'm going

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.580
to take my leg and I'm going to place one
leg on top of the other. Okay, if you have

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.469
a hard time and you're not as flexible, simply
just place one foot on top of the other foot

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:40.959
down here. Once you get more limber, then
you can bring it all the way up here. Okay,

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.849
so according to your skill level. You want
to be comfortable. You don't want to be in

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.749
pain when you're doing this. So put your feet
one on top of the other, and you'll see that

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.540
it helps you to keep your back straight. The
next thing that I like to do, is I'd like

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.109
for you to take your left hand and take your
right hand, put one hand on top of the other,

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:10.400
put the left hand on top of the right hand,
and touch the fingertips. Okay, the next you're

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.139
going to do, you're going to sit back, right
next to your dantian. Okay, right in your

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:24.090
lap next to your dantian with the fingers
touching. Close the eyes or keep the eyes

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.829
open, or keep them half open. Whatever it
is your choice. Remember, this is about you.

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:37.069
This is not about we have to do it this way,
we have to do it that way. This is about you.

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.810
Eyes open, eyes closed, whatever it is that
you feel is best. Then what I'm going to simply

00:03:42.810 --> 00:04:04.620
do is, I'm going to simply breathe in and
breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. And

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.180
follow the breath. As you breathe in, follow
that breath in. Remember that you're breathing

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.209
to the dantian so that your chest should not
rise, but the belly should rise. Breathe in,

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:34.340
breathe out. Follow the breath out. So to
simply sit and follow the breath in and follow

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:44.620
the breath out. Follow the breath in, follow
the breath out. Just stay focused on the breathing

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.740
of the breath in and the breath out. Okay,
and do that for a few minutes, do that for

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.800
a few minutes, so that you can finish your
exercise and feel completely at peace with

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.210
yourself when you're done.
