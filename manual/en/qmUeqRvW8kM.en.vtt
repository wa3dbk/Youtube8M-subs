00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.659
italy filled with sci-fi inventions
being made universities around the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.759
country we have one from n_y_u_ and they
have built to be real life tractor beam

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.379
not a big one unfortunately it's pretty
tiny yet but in my deal to be scaled up

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.859
in the future sony's in details is
coming from and why you physicist david

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.570
ruffin erin david career

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.409
and what they need to use this something
called update is bezel beans

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:27.129
uh... and will basically does is it
combines to beans either cause light to

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.339
move around in the contract and then
because it's on the opposite side if the

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.760
object is small enough that we're
talking about like

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.730
particles basically like tiny little
things it actually forms a sort of light

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.410
conveyor belt that moves the object back

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.280
towards the source of the beans

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.300
and so hypothetically if the scale but
up you'd be able to move objects toward

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.050
something in a much bigger scale

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.370
now why would this be useful uh... as
you can see it one reason not to show

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.030
you the image there

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.430
this is like a sci-fi shaping the idea
of the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.910
but with that but i think the land being
happy and willing to receive that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.059
so here you see from star trek it's been
star wars as well

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.900
uh... in space we needed to build a move
things

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.110
uh... what if we need to move like dan
asteroid that was on a collision course

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.520
with a space station with the birth or
something like that don't appreciate say

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.670
and ashley kit

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.190
d

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.190
yapping exactly now again capra inside
stories unfortunately it's difficult to

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.810
steal it's not because of the energy
requirements now

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.820
maybe in the future

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.989
energy sources that are much more
powerful

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:39.479
uh... but they say that if you were
still the symptom of something like a

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.890
board cube united energy required

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.700
would actually crossed the object

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.470
and so we don't towards you but it would
be crushed

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.960
so they can train in so many a light our
menu adolph

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.800
for the good

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.910
but but

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:59.260
if there are not excited about tractor
beam the definitive

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.330
using this in my own personal leaving i
think you know uh... however there is a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.970
higher

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.010
new unit

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.310
sisters and stall like this massive
machine in the living room to move the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.079
remote

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.120
uh... you can sleep in on the county

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.819
i love that mike decades after the
original star trek we're still getting

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.850
inventions out of it but i'm worried

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.570
in ten or twenty years what are we doing
that because it has been a star trek

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.309
series in years now

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:28.040
we catch up in surpassed where any
another star trek series right now

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.930
if if if for no other reason that they
should develop yahoo

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.359
uh... somebody different than senior
guys your start record my friend thinks

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.569
that it should be obstetric academy
showing taking place like as their

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.090
training like every five popular in
school

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.750
one from
