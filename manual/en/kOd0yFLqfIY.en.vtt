00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.300
So, after showing you what we had to offer, here are the financial conditions.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.920
Ah.. Well..

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.740
I’m sorry to say it so directly but you’re beyond our budget

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.400
it’s way too expensive.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.920
I understand..

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.680
I understand, it’s an amount that corresponds to an important service,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.060
it’s an investment.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.320
Yeah, yeah it’s..

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.020
I didn’t expect it to be this expensive..

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.060
Especially since we also asked a quote to two other providers,

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.700
which are both cheaper, one of them in important amounts, we’re talking about 30 to 40%,

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.120
so I’m rather surprised by your proposal.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.540
But, did you ask yourself why they were cheaper, in a really significative way,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.260
even though we have the same cost structure?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.920
....

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.040
Do you have the same cost structure?

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.360
Yeah, probably very close..

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.200
No, indeed, we just interviewed them,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:32.920
they gave us a proposal which is technically close to yours but for a really cheaper price

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.920
so I don’t know where they manage to reduce the amount but…

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.400
But what do you prefer in our proposal?

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.060
... In your proposal.. I found it rather complete, rather innovative,

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.140
and I find you very quality oriented,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.760
and I find that really..

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.620
Yeah, in my opinion it’s a real strong point of your proposal, in a technical point of view,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.660
but in a financial point of view on the other hand…

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.180
And what will be, in the end, the added value of this offer? What will all of this bring you?

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.860
Well.. If it brings the expected results…

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.460
it will allow us to reduce our cost structure, and in term of quality, in term of our image in relation to our clients,

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.260
it’s an investment yes,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.380
we thought about it,

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.620
we’re gonna take the plunge, the decision has been taken, we just need to choose the service provider.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.080
Indeed, it’s a big investment, but it’s well thought out, and we really expect a return in investment.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.400
Yeah, I see..

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:48.460
And in the end, from what price are you willing to begin a partnership?

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.040
...

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.040
Would you be ready to.. Yeah, you would be ready to make a financial effort..

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:04.700
In term of quality,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.420
your offer is really more qualitative and innovative than your concurrent’s

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.000
so I won’t ask you to fully align yourself with their price.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.280
However, you could us a 10% discount..

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.100
Well.. 10% is a little too much..

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.440
We’ll try to make an effort, of course, but 10% will be difficult.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.460
10% is too much?

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:43.400
Would a lesser effort still be significant for you?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:55.460
I could go to 6 or 7% but that would be..

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.400
Well, I’m ready to do an effort, indeed your proposal really stands out but..

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.960
I mean, we would be in some kind of partnership,

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.780
so I’m ready yo make an effort, but you have to do one too, so indeed I think 5 to 6% would be enough..

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.900
Well, listen, we’re really motivated to work with you,

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.640
so what I propose to you is, we’re gonna talk about it internally and we’ll recontact you quickly.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.060
Okay, so you’ll contact us back about the effort you’re willing to consent.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.240
Yes, absolutely.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.160
Alright, perfect.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.720
Well, perfect! I’m glad we managed to find a solution,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.000
when do you think we’ll be able to start the missions?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.060
Well, we’re currently in the starting blocks,

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.260
as I already told you we already we already agreed to do it internally, so the earliest would be best.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.020
Well listen, what I suggest you is to..

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.420
to fix it first, then confirm it later

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.940
To fix the first meeting, so it’ll be blocked for everyone. How about monday 8?

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.560
Monday 8, okay.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.840
Monday 8 at 9 hours.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.700
Okay, 9 hours.

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.720
Alright. So, I’ll send it to you during the day.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.220
so we can move forward quickly.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.860
Exactly.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.260
Okay, thank you!

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.020
Thank you too!
