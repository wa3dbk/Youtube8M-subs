00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.230
Today on this 2007 Acura MDX, we are going
to be installing Curt hitch part number C13354.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.440
Before we get started with our hitch installation,
we are going to go ahead and show you a couple

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.930
of the final install dimensions, which will
help choosing your hitch accessories a little

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.250
bit easier.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.750
From the top of the receiver tube opening
to the ground is going to measure 16-1/2 inches

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.180
and from the center of the pin hole to the
clear end of the bumper is going to measure

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.180
approximately 4 inches.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.530
Okay, let us go ahead and move on to our installation.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.351
0:26
The first thing we have done underneath our

00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:29.080
vehicle here is go ahead and lower the spare
tire.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.020
The next step is to go ahead and remove both
mufflers off of their two rear most hangers.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.890
The rear most hanger is actually on the outboard
side of our muffler right closest to the bumper.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.039
And then the forward most hanger is just on
the forward side of the muffler, itself.

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.830
To ease in the removal of the exhaust from
its hanger, we are going to go ahead and use

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.929
a spray lubricant to spray down the stud and
the rubber hanger.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:01.390
Alright, with our exhaust lowered down, we
are actually going to go ahead and remove

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.980
the heat shields from both sides of the vehicle.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.280
Each heat shield has 3 bolts holding it to
the bottom of the frame.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:02:05.359
Two here at the rear, and one here at 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:24.080
the 
forward side.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:33.660
