00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.570
SONYA TAYEH: I think the
talent is unbelievable.

00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:05.130
If this was the first show, I
can't believe what's to come.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.640
I really can't.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.720
Honestly-- and I say this
every year, but--

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.270
they're such a strong group.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.320
And they really do what
they do very well.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.700
And they assimilate
really well.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.040
So I'm just so thrilled.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.150
And for the guys, I mean, come
on, it's like a wolf pack

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.440
being released to the masses.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.410
It was so amazing.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.470
I love the strength of men.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.850
And just having them together,
sweating and fighting with

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.020
each other in a positive way and
breathing with each other,

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.330
I couldn't have asked for
a more amazing night.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.020
CYRUS SPENCER: Our Top 10
boys was with Sonya.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.020
I love her so much.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.300
She wants men to dance like
superheros and women

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850
to dance like men.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.840
And I can see why.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.190
It makes everything
more powerful.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.320
It makes you stand out
from everybody else.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.985
It's great.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:52.660
GEORGE LAWRENCE II:
Sonya Tayeh--

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.330
my favorite.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.090
She's actually my favorite
choreographer.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.210
TIFFANY MAHER: He killed
that number.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.300
He killed that number.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.280
GEORGE LAWRENCE II: I love it.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.750
I love it.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.970
It's amazing.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.890
WILL THOMAS: Oh, gosh, I had to
take my shirt off in front

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.820
of America.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.730
I jiggle.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.855
It was a little embarrassing.

00:01:09.855 --> 00:01:11.280
I'm not going to lie,
you know what.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.060
And then, of course,
Nigel calls me out.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.570
It's fine.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.460
I just put my hand
in the camera.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.280
Fine.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.840
DAREIAN KUJAWA: All the
different styles.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.700
You have to learn how to do
Stacey Tookey, and then you'll

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.000
have to go into Sonya's
and be a beast.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.870
It's crazy trying to blend in to
all those different styles.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.600
MELANIE MOORE: I was one of
Stacey Tookey's assistants, so

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.350
that was amazing.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.310
I got to be in the same room
as I was in when I started

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.790
last year, just on
the other side.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.920
So it's been kind of a crazy
journey, but it's been

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.920
absolutely amazing.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.880
STACEY TOOKEY: They
just nailed it.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910
I couldn't have been more
pleased with their

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.500
performance.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.000
And I was squeezing
Melanie's arm.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.620
I'm like, oh, please!

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.800
Please!

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.360
And she was like, this is more
nerve-wracking being on this

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.020
side of it than on
that side of it.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.130
I know, because you see the
choreographers freaking out.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.396
But every dancer on that
stage tonight--

00:01:56.396 --> 00:01:56.830
unbelievable.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.790
I mean, they blew my mind.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.130
MATTHEW KAZMIERCZAK: Crazy
different mix of

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.800
choreographers.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.018
AUDREY CASE: Yeah, Travis is
so soft and flowy, and

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:06.458
everything has this
meaning to it--

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:07.434
I mean, everything does.

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:09.639
But Sonya's was so--

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.100
she pushes you so much.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.611
And I'm sure you
know that too.

00:02:14.611 --> 00:02:15.810
MATTHEW KAZMIERCZAK: Yeah.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.200
It was awesome.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.500
Everything was so different.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.560
It was a good mix.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.740
CHRIS SCOTT: I had my friend
make the music, Nathan Lanier.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.340
A friend of mine did
the voice over.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.240
So I was putting together all
this stuff behind the scenes.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.980
I came to rehearsal with the
routine made up for them but

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.520
knowing I was going to have
to adjust for them.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.430
And we knocked a whole routine
out in five hours.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.470
I put the whole routine
on them.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.820
It was crazy.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.955
I wouldn't have put them up on
stage doing it, but I think I

00:02:40.955 --> 00:02:43.000
knew at that point, we have
something really special.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
COLE HORIBE: So Christopher
Scott, melding the styles, it

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.840
was so interesting to me.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900
I loved the concept immediately
before we even

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.290
started learning it.

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.310
BRANDON MITCHELL: Chris Scott
can take different elements

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.010
like that and just create
a masterpiece.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.680
That's what he does.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.560
That's what he's amazing at.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.590
And even in rehearsals, watching
him put the stuff

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.530
together, it was just like,
yo, are you serious?

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.440
And it was so great.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.330
It was so refreshing the way
that he was working with us.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.900
He made us all feel
comfortable.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.875
And then he brought all
of our genres out.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:10.450
And we was able to show
our strengths.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.600
CYRUS SPENCER: Oh my goodness,
working with Chris is the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.990
best, honestly, because
he works with you.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.780
And he still allows you to grow,
and he allows you to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.110
reach another peak you
haven't reached.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.550
It's just great.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.210
His creativity, he likes to add
his with yours and with

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.110
everybody, so the whole aura in
the room is just amazing.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.730
It's just really great.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.700
DWIGHT RHODEN: They are actually
very versatile.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.810
We're going to see other
things from them.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.220
They can do other styles.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.392
Their strength is ballet, but
I'm even more interested to

00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:43.400
see what they do outside
of ballet.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.480
ELIANA GIRARD: I had to work
with Desmond and Dwight--

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.100
a complete honor.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.680
I look up to them.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.730
I watch them all the time.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.540
I'm a huge fan.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.980
And they bring stuff out of you
that you never knew was in

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.540
there, and that's
what we want.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.950
We want to be pushed
to the limit.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.120
DANIEL BAKER: Working with all
the choreographers here, for

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.230
me, has just opened my eyes.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.540
I've been craving this
for so long.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.140
I can't really explain it.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.100
It's just been so inspiring in
a different way for me, and

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.560
I'm very grateful.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.044
And every day, I am keeping my
eyes open, my ears open, and

00:04:17.044 --> 00:04:20.102
just enjoying the ride.

00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:21.399
ALEXA ANDERSON: I'm Alexa.

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:22.100
DANIEL BAKER: I'm Daniel.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.350
ALEXA ANDERSON: And you're
watching DanceOn.
