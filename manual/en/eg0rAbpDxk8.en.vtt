00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:33.870
Our editorial Belgrade, got to test,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.062
model Fiat 500 L, which is produced in modernized facilities

00:00:40.062 --> 00:00:44.681
Fiat's partner of many years of "Crvena Zastava",

00:00:44.681 --> 00:00:45.084
his time under the name of the

00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:46.490
new company Fiat Serbia.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.519
Fiat and after many years he has

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.887
renounced numbered 500 with their cars,

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.850
and why should they when the number is marked

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.460
Turin factory history as the most popular little liter car

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.050
that is made happy many fans of motorsports.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.481
In 1956. The Dante Giacosa,

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:08.351
designed the Fiat 600 Multipla,

00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:10.509
and he is in some ways a

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.297
rerunner of today's Fiat 500 L

00:01:15.297 --> 00:01:18.896
Before the designer was a serious task

00:01:18.896 --> 00:01:21.766
to design a car that will be able to meet

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:23.002
the criteria imposed by the global market for motor vehicles.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:26.573
One of the first comments that we have heard,

00:01:26.573 --> 00:01:29.302
we just parked Fiat 500 L,

00:01:29.302 --> 00:01:30.976
was that nature seems much larger

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:34.407
than it is shown in the picture or on the TV.

00:01:34.407 --> 00:01:39.212
Indeed, one could say that as regards the visual mistake.

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:47.965
No, far from it. Fiat 500 L 4147 mm long and 1667 mm high,

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:53.127
which means that this is a serious car category, in segment B.

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:56.450
When it comes to design Fiat has managed

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.040
to produce a car that is particularly

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.351
easy to recognize on the road.

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.142
Adopted the smaller frontal details of Fiat 500,

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:06.671
but there are plenty of beautiful and distinctive details.

00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:10.350
Fiat 500 L has a particularly distinctive body

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.325
because it has more windows than usual for this class of car.

00:02:15.325 --> 00:02:17.292
In fact, it is already the studs,

00:02:17.292 --> 00:02:21.441
because the body forward pilars between the windscreen and doors,

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:24.973
as well as the rear, behind the rear door.

00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:28.960
This solution helps to better visibility and reduce the size

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.157
of so-called blind spots, but it is also a contribution

00:02:33.157 --> 00:02:36.136
to the body safe Why is the Fiat 500 L received

00:02:36.136 --> 00:02:49.086
five stars from Euro NCAP.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:52.235
Fiat, remains true to its panels and has been

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.511
applied in a number of useful solutions.

00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:58.322
Useful means maximum use of interior space

00:02:58.322 --> 00:03:01.770
and comfort to meet the driver and passengers.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.455
First of all, this is what it gives to driver.

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:07.682
But also I look at the driver's seat suggests

00:03:07.682 --> 00:03:10.503
that there are sporty profile, as well as strength.

00:03:10.503 --> 00:03:13.048
We estimate that this is a great seat

00:03:13.048 --> 00:03:14.794
for a number of reasons.

00:03:14.794 --> 00:03:16.513
It's cozy, traditional can be set up,

00:03:16.513 --> 00:03:20.784
especially at altitude, and even lower growth

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:26.482
driver has a chance to take a good position for a solid overview.

00:03:26.482 --> 00:03:28.745
Then, when itâ€™s cold, for a few moments,

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:34.294
trigger switches the seat heaters and driver and front passenger,

00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:36.375
are grateful for this equipment.

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.979
In line with the seat adjustment possibilities

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.499
and is a very flexible system, which is really impressive

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.994
because of all the routes setup, the depth and height.

00:03:45.994 --> 00:03:48.460
A significant addition is the electric power steering

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.832
device can be adjusted for city driving and the road.

00:03:50.832 --> 00:03:55.107
Leather steering wheel, or offer a full grip on it and the

00:03:55.107 --> 00:03:58.265
only controls for the radio and telephone.

00:03:58.265 --> 00:04:01.720
In the same style and shift knob, and parking brake.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.154
The instrument panel and display, mounted on

00:04:04.154 --> 00:04:08.371
the partition wall and made a return to the historical pattern

00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.266
of withholding a portion of the pure metal.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.948
Part of the necessary information can be read on

00:04:14.948 --> 00:04:17.807
a small display nestled between the speedometer and rev counter,

00:04:17.807 --> 00:04:22.561
and depending on the setting of the steering wheel is in the driver's field of vision.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.212
Thanks to the large door, fiat 500 L

00:04:25.212 --> 00:04:28.162
allows comfortable access to all the seats,

00:04:28.162 --> 00:04:34.624
and the rear doors that make it easer use of the boot.

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:38.697
The boot capacity is 400 liters with the split light

00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:41.735
shelf that can be easily removed when needed.

00:04:41.735 --> 00:04:44.291
Split rear seats are bench-type claim,

00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:47.912
but they are comfortable and can be adjusted.

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:55.666
Below mats trunk compressor is located, but not the spare wheel.

00:04:59.646 --> 00:05:02.747
Fiat Serbia is now offering two types of engines,

00:05:02.747 --> 00:05:06.290
and as we learned four new ones arrive.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.360
We drove version with petrol engine displacement 1368 cc

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.460
70 kW/95 hp with 6-speed gearbox.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.952
There is a 1.3 turbo diesel with 62 kW/85 hp.

00:05:20.952 --> 00:05:25.328
Aggregate that we met the famous FIRE

00:05:25.328 --> 00:05:28.395
or fully robotic manufactured, a product that is flawless.

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.391
Yet in city driving, we had a combined  optimum

00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:35.792
consumption of about 8 liters. Curb weight of 1245 kg.

00:05:35.792 --> 00:05:38.862
Its undercarriage is built to its relatively

00:05:38.862 --> 00:05:43.121
high center of gravity does not require special attention in the maneuver.

00:05:43.121 --> 00:05:47.644
Set the wheels of 17 inch to third tolerates bumps in the road,

00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:52.495
however the Michelin winter tires do not condone bad road.

00:05:52.495 --> 00:05:54.711
Disc brakes on all four wheels have the

00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:58.972
expected response to pedal pressure.

00:06:00.816 --> 00:06:03.417
After  all, it is worth paying attention to in the car,

00:06:03.417 --> 00:06:08.455
who was with us in the office entered the shortlist for Car of the Year.

00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:11.889
To test it to us courtesy Fiat Serbia,

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.383
and its price is 13490 EUR.

00:06:15.383 --> 00:06:20.268
Importer and seller for Montenegro KOV-Car company.
