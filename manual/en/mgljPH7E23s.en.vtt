We are in the midst of preparation, the trick to make a good tasty dish

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.800
and the second thing is to use the cream from fresh milk

I know it is a bit 'more expensive, but worth every penny

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.210
I put enough water to boil by placing 10 grams of salt

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.510
per liter! "I throw the pasta" code they say in Italy

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.760

Put enough pepper in the sauce

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.500
Drain the pasta and the sauce that I put in my leave enough

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.309
liquid, because the noodles absorb the sauce very

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:15.380
I mix well

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.859
servant in a dish with a sprinkling of chopped chives over

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.140
