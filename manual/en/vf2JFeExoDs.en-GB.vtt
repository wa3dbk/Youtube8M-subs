GTA 5 Online High Priority Case Mission Guide
GTA 5 Online High Priority Case Mission Guide

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:23.410
i have tried the High priority case mission
on GTA 5 many times and these are the only

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:39.550
ways i have seen it done. Working in a team
made this much much easier.There are a few

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.960
steps you can do to finish this mission

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:51.719
Step 1 Get yourself a Helicopter or something
that flies ( I have looked everywhere n the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:15.280
map and only able to find the one in the video
) now weather thats 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:29.869
because i am above lvl 30 or not i dont know.
everything in GTA is based around lvl hence

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.439
the Titan at Lvl 32

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:48.090
Step 2 A quire a sniper rifle

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.430
Step 3 fly to the tall building next to the
objective it has a heli pad on the roof.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.409
Step 4 Start sniping the enemy's on the top
of the roof

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:10.560
4a Another member of your team should be using
a Jet to take the lower level enemy's out

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.940
at the same time

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:53.110
4b If you have a 3rd climbing up the "yellow"
Crane in the middle of the building is helpful

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:12.299
but will 
often die if to many enemy's alive

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:26.410
Step 5 fly to the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.340
building with the case and collect it whilst
killing the last few

00:03:34.340 --> 00:04:00.220
Step 6 Once you have the case get off 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:18.060
the roof as fast as you can helo or parachute
and then get to the objective. You will be

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.190
chased by enemy helicopter

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:39.230
Thats It Buildings helicopter locations and
