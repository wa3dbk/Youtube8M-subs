00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.090
get right on to the vlog in this vlog is inspired
by question that Rhonda sent me Rhonda sent

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.210
me a question asking me how do I keep my hair
moisturizing box braids she was telling me

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.500
that she had a problem with her already dry
hair and that when she wears her box braids

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.739
and takes them down her hair is even drier
and she hates going through that she hates

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.110
the brittle feeling that at leaves her hair
feeling like so Rhonda I'm going to give you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.200
some tips that is going to keep your hair
moisturizer and keep your hair healthy even

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.130
though your way extensions my very first tip
to keeping your hair moisturized is to simply

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.970
moisturize your hair a lot of women think
that things change the whole game changes

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.420
when they get extensions done they think they
have to care after it differently they can't

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.020
wash their hair they can’t conditioner their
hair or do anything to it and thats totally

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.289
false because you have to do the same types
of things that you do if your hair is not

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.490
in extensions just like you do when it’s
in extensions so I am going to explain this

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.380
a little bit more is that when you're taking
care of your hair just think that you want

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.929
to do the same things but everything is watered-down
say for instance you are wearing box braids

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.420
on his Rhonda is wearing box braids and say
for instance she likes to keep her box braids

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.100
in for three months what she needs to do is
wash her hair as frequently as she has always

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.179
done say fro instance she washes her hair
once a week what you want to do is grab your

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.099
favorite shampoo that you always even though
you got braids in her hair you want to use

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.710
the same things you always use on your hair
to get your favorite shampoo and get some

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.569
type of a bottle that you could use not really
a spray bottle but more of an applicator bottle

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.810
so that solution can come out and you want
to water it down so you can display were portions

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.380
where you can do one part shampoo and two
parts water or one part shampoo with three

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.880
parts water you just want to be liquidy enough
to really help run for your braids and cleanse

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.390
your scalp if it's really goopy shampooed
you're working into your braids and on your

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.500
parts its going to be hard to wash all the
shampoo out and it going to strip your hair

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.390
really bad so water down your shampoo squirt
it on your scalp and use your finger pads

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.330
to massage your parts your roots and your
scalp the cleanse your hair of any bacteria

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.160
or debris that you have and then as you normally
do you condition your hair afterwards you

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.070
do the same thing you use a cup or applicator
bottle whatever you can store a little bit

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.360
of solution in and you put in your conditioner
and water it down with water then you apply

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.350
it onto your braids and onto your scalp you
rub it in gently and you rinse it out you

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.070
that that's how you can do a co wash with
your braids you can even deep condition your

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.500
hair put on your favorite conditioner but
just water it down a little bit and deep condition

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.920
your hair whether you like to do that for
about 20 or 30 minutes have a long the main

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.670
point of this is that you don't have to worry
about doing anything different with your hair

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.960
if you are wearing extensions you just want
to water down your product and go to the same

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.450
motion but because you have braids and you
don't want to be too aggressive just use the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.280
pads of your fingers and gently massage your
scalp gently massage your braids and rinse

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.230
all of the product out of your hair so the
second part to this question the second answer

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.660
portion to this question that she had about
keeping her hair moisturized is that you have

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.250
the seal in the moisture so as I’ve said
you can use the same products you going to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.350
go about the same routine you've always done
you just watering down your products and the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.820
same applies to keeping your hair locked in
with moisture so if you have a favorite moisturizer

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.410
you like to use rub it in your palms first
and then rub your hands over your scalp in

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.819
your braids and then to seal in that moisture
you take your favorite oil that you like to

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.170
use to lock in moisture into your hair you
are going to rub that oil on your hands and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.900
you are just going to rub it down your braids
its just as simple is then you can even take

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.709
the nozzle that’s connected to your oil
if you could squirt it onto your scalp just

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.120
squirt a little bit once your scalp were put
on your fingertips to really massage and moisturize

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.080
your scalp to keep your hair and your scalp
moisturize while you are wearing extensions

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.130
it's super easy it's not as difficult as some
people may make it seem just when you are

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.150
wearing extensions to the same thing they've
always done but water down all of your products

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.289
so you can effectively rinse it out of your
hair so I hope this video help you Rhonda

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.509
the just know they know you your box braids
you can do the same things you've always done

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:57.300
even with your hair free and if any of you
have any additional questions that you would

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.050
