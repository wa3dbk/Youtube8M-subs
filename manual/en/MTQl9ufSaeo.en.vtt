00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.350
Hi it is Binky from Made in Chelsea and welcome
back to my series of Binky's Boutique.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.120
I have been looking at some of your comments
on the Videojug YouTube Beauty Channel.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.250
SuperRasmina has asked to do a tutorial on
the perfect clubbing makeup look, so, this

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.300
week, I am going to do long lasting makeup
that stays on all night.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.290
I am going to be using the Bare Minerals Prime
Time Brightening Foundation Primer.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.290
You can put it all over your face.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.539
A little bit on your hands.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.720
It is really moisturizing and soft so it is
really nice in texture.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.960
Next, I am using the Clarins Ever Matte Foundation.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.220
It gives your face a great coverage and it
is really good for smoothing out uneven skin

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.220
tones.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.240
I will put a little bit on my hand and use
a foundation brush.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.900
What I love about this foundation is that
it has a really lovely matte finish.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.250
Also, I always put a little bit on my neck
so it blends in your face makeup, because

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.010
I hate it when I see people with a really
orange face and then pale neck.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.260
Next up, I am using the Vichy Dermablend Concealer.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.229
Now, you know I love this one guys, because
it is indestructible.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.549
You can put it on any blemishes you may have.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.860
You can just blend it into your nose.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.860
If you have got a cold, if it is a bit red.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.320
I think it is a little bit too thick to use
under the eyes.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.579
And that is not going to come off at all.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:21.320
Next, I am using a Daniel Sandler Eyeshadow
Compact.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.750
And, it is called Beyond Sunset.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.390
I am going to be using this color as the allover
base for my eyeline.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.299
Make sure it is not too dark.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.630
Put it on your hand.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.640
And just put it all the way up to your eyebrow.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.640
Next, I am going to be using a smaller brush
and using this darker color for the upper

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
lash line.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.679
Put it on your hand just to make sure it does
not come out too dark.

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.600
Brush it across.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.380
I am just going to bring this darker color
under the eyes as well, just gently along

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.399
the lashline.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.420
Really sexy.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.439
Smokey.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.439
With the same palette.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.979
I am going to use this coppery gold color.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.420
I use my finger.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.369
Give it a rub and just put it on the ball
of your eyelids.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.270
This will give your eye a bit of sexy shimmer.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.800
Add a bit of sparkle.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.650
We all love a bit of sparkle.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.060
Next, I am using the Clarins Wonder Perfect
Mascara.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.850
This is a really great mascara.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:21.940
It does not budge.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.040
It is waterproof and this goes on really nicely.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.130
It makes every little single lash pop out.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.990
I am going to put some on the underlashes
as well.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.940
Next, I am using the Daniel Sandler Invisible
Veil Powder.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.690
Dab that off a little bit so it does not go
all over your face.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.500
Just going to put it over my T zone.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.700
This is a great setting powder.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.630
It will keep your makeup on all night and
it has a really lovely flawless finish.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.140
Next, I am using a He Shi bronzer.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.440
Just get your brush, give it a little twirl.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440
Put it on your cheekbone.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.310
Do a little smile, so it gets contoured.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.610
Next, I will be using this Bare Minerals lip
stain.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.630
What is great about lip stain is that it will
not move and it will stay on all night.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.450
So you do not have to keep going to the bathroom
and topping yourself up.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.500
I am going to put it on my hand a little bit
because it is really sticky.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.930
But, it is an amazing, amazing color.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.160
It is my favorite.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.460
And, just use your finger.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.550
Just dab it on your lips.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.830
If I were to go on a night out, the only things
I would probably take with me would be my

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.930
foundation, my lip stain, my setting powder
and my bronzer.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.410
Keep these in your bag and they will be great
for all you need to top up through the night.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.410
There you go.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.620
A perfect makeup look that will last all night.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.440
