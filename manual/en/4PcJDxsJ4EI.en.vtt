Hi this is Yolonda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com
and now we are going to learn about how to

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.839
plant Lily-of-the-Valley bulbs which is pretty
easy. So Lily-of-the-Valley are just a set

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.750
of roots and they have little pips so it is
really all about the pips that is going to

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.560
make it grow. So on each side where there
was a stem last year if you peel it away you'll

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.960
see that there is a really little pip and
that is what is going to make the growth for

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.940
next year so that I need to plant about three
inches deep in a shady spot but not too much

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.840
shade. If there is weeds growing or ferns
or hostas growing, Lily-of-the-Valley will

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.831
grow. If you have got nothing in that area
because you never water it or it is just too

00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.329
deep a shade or it is full of moss then you
are not going to get Lily-of-the-Valley to

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.210
grow either. They'll grow in a container or
the ground really easily. They are such a

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.160
tough plant but you never let them dry out.
You can plant them any time of the year just

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.650
keep that ground moist. So I have got my nice
little shade garden area and it is actually,

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.520
I am creating a moon garden as well so I'm
trying to get all white flowers, shade flowers

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.200
in here so Lily-of-the-Valley is going to
be just perfect. So when I plant it I am going

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.220
to dig and kind of loosen up the dirt around
it so that it is not just, it is a hard dirt

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.220
and you want to make sure it is kind of broken
up and I want to plant them about three inches

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.370
deep so I'm going to dig down a little ways.
It doesn't have to be real deep and then I'm

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.940
kind of just, it doesn't have to be exact.
I'm just kind of placing them underneath and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.830
there is not really an up or down because
I have noticed they'll work their way up from

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.619
any direction but once I have a good wad of
roots too. I have found that one by itself

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.170
takes a lot of years to really get going but
three or five or more and they'll do really

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.470
well quicker so then just kind of spread it
back underneath. I'm not taking a measuring

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.619
stick I don't know exactly that it is three
inches deep. I'm just setting them in there,

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.590
another trick is just step them in there just
because I have noticed some time they'll pull

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.700
back easier if I don't step them down and
the ground is pretty wet so I really don't

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.421
need to water right now. I watered well yesterday.
I'll just water them the next time I water

00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:22.010
this area and they'll get right on schedule.
I don't think I'll see anything from them

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.230
until April of next year. They'll come out
and bloom in May and June. So even though

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.280
I have planted them in the Fall or late Summer,
I'm not going to see them until late Spring.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.090
But that's o'kay with me. I know they're there
and they're going to keep multiplying while

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.510
I wait.
