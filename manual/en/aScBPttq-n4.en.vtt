00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.270
- The fighting raged
through jungles,

00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:06.740
across rubber plantations...

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:09.943
- While I was
in nurses' training,

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:17.450
the war in Vietnam was
a very faraway place.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.720
During my training,
we received visits

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:23.289
from several
recruiting officers.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:28.094
They needed to find nurses
to fill the slots in Vietnam,

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.929
in the hospitals in Vietnam,
and I thought,

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.132
"Well, you know how
bad could Vietnam

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:33.500
be for nurses?"

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.302
We worked in a hospital.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:39.539
In 1969, I got a call
and found that

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.441
I had orders for Vietnam.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:43.543
[Rock music playing]

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:49.349
And I remember, you know,
my mother being so upset

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:53.820
about it and my father saying,
"June, what did you expect?

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:57.057
"There's a war
and she's in the military.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.959
What did you expect?"

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:03.697
We landed down near Saigon

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.434
and, um, got ready
to disembark from the plane.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:13.473
Off to the side were all
the guys who were going to get

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.876
on the plane
I just got off of.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.048
They were screaming, crying,

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.152
they were stripping
their clothes off.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:31.324
They were in ecstasy
that they were leaving...

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:37.797
and that was the first
time I became afraid.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:45.238
Surgical intensive care
was a very hectic place.

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.440
There were times they were
coming in so fast nobody was

00:01:47.474 --> 00:01:49.542
really sure what the name
of the patient was.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.344
Emergency rooms here
in this country

00:01:51.378 --> 00:01:54.414
never could have prepared us
for what we saw.

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.149
That never leaves you.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:07.627
You know, in a situation
like war, you have to find

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.431
an outlet for something.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:15.135
You can't live inside those
emotions all the time without

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.503
having some kind of an escape,

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:19.973
so when people partied, they
partied hard.

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:22.676
It was a way of releasing,
you know, a lot of the tension

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.881
and the stress
that we experienced,

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:30.417
and it was a way
of protecting ourselves.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:36.589
I made a lot
of good friends there.

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:40.727
We were sharing life
and death together

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.464
and crying together,

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:48.535
trying to survive together,

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:53.340
and those are emotions
and experiences

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:58.211
that tie you
together for life.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:03:02.482
I was a real good nurse,
and I knew what I was doing,

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.051
and I did a good job,

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:07.787
and I had corpsmen
obviously that served

00:03:07.821 --> 00:03:09.422
with me on the unit.

00:03:09.456 --> 00:03:13.793
We respected each other,
and we had a very good

00:03:13.827 --> 00:03:16.363
working relationship.

00:03:16.396 --> 00:03:19.599
The guys that I served
with were very protective,

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:24.704
but I wasn't real sure of it
when I left my compound

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:28.041
because it's pretty
overwhelming to leave home,

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.844
so to speak,
and go out on the town

00:03:30.877 --> 00:03:32.379
and you're the only woman
and there are

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:34.614
10,000 guys around you.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:39.119
There was a lot
of sexual tension.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:41.021
We were the only
what they used to call

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.724
"round eyes" around.

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:46.659
I look at the time in Vietnam,
and I can't say,

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.695
"Oh, yeah, this day was bad."

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:51.398
They were all bad days.

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.799
Certainly as a nurse
you help people,

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:58.104
but I look back on my life
and I think that whole

00:03:58.138 --> 00:04:01.474
year I'd been in Vietnam
how many lives did

00:04:01.508 --> 00:04:03.777
what I did affect?

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.514
It's a very good feeling to
know that in the end you feel

00:04:07.547 --> 00:04:10.383
like you've given
something of your life.

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:14.087
I can be proud I think.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.589
My children can be proud.

00:04:16.623 --> 00:04:21.027
When I came home was in 1970,

00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:22.862
so I was 23 years old.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:24.631
You lived a life over
there that was totally

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:25.765
different from here.

00:04:25.799 --> 00:04:28.301
I hadn't driven in a year.

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:30.136
I hadn't eaten off plates.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.039
It was just different,
and I spent a lot of time

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:36.910
in my room actually isolated
from the rest of the family.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.650
"You can't know what it's like.

00:04:43.683 --> 00:04:46.152
"You really don't want to
know what it's like.

00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:50.890
"You can never comprehend
what it's like,

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.394
and so why should
I waste my time?"

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:59.499
Done.

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.534
Didn't want to talk
about it anymore.

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:09.075
[Horns honking]

00:05:09.109 --> 00:05:11.678
I had the opportunity, though,
to go back to Vietnam

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.048
twice now since I left,

00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:19.252
and the minute I saw Vietnam,

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:22.489
it was like
everything exploded.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:27.460
It was all in color again,

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:33.400
and the thing that startled me
most was the words that

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:35.035
popped into my head.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:38.438
The first words that floated
through my mind

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:41.941
when I saw that was "I'm home."

00:05:41.975 --> 00:05:46.312
I became an adult there.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:50.917
I became in a lot of ways
who I am today there.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.423
and it was like going home.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.924
Yes, I'd do it again

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:01.027
without doubt,
without question.

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:06.332
It was, in some ways, the most
remarkable year of my life.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.636
When you get down to
the humanity of war,

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:11.838
war is war is war.

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:16.009
It's dirty,
it's painful, it's scary,

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:20.413
there's human lives lost,
there's blood.

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:24.284
To know those things is never
going to change,

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:27.420
and that's one thing
that's shared by anyone

00:06:27.454 --> 00:06:29.989
who's served in the military,

00:06:30.023 --> 00:06:33.326
and when somebody says
they were in a war,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.264
no matter what,
we know we're connected.
