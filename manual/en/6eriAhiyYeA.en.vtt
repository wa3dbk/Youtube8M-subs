00:00:12.677 --> 00:00:19.849
VILLAGE VANGUARDO x HARAJUKU KWAii!! TV presents
Shopping game!!

00:00:20.221 --> 00:00:23.679
we are at VILLAGE VANGUARD in Fujinomiya

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:32.817
This is their largest store in Shizuoka.
-That is awesome! 
 This store is very spacious!
-Yeah it is!

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.197
By the way, behind us, there is...
Ta-da~

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.377
An allocated space for Harajuku Kawaii!! 

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:48.007
They have many HARAJUKU KAWAii!! merchandise. Oh, I found some HARA-chan T-shirts

00:00:51.802 --> 00:00:55.381
So we will explain the rules.
Ta-da

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
•You can spend no more than ￥20000

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:05.699
•The sum of all the numbers of the total amount 
 spent will be your total score
E.g. ￥19,870→1+9+8+7+0=25 points

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:09.265
•You will lose if you spend more than ￥20000

00:01:10.401 --> 00:01:15.152
•The person who gets a higher score within the spend limit will win

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:30.178
The winner can take all the purchased items home, however, for the loser, 
 all her items will be taken away and given to our viewers

00:01:30.514 --> 00:01:39.572
I have a mixed feeling about this
-Me too. It's good that our viewers will 
 get to have them but don't you want to use ￥20000 for yourself?

00:01:40.963 --> 00:01:46.460
Yeah, I agree. Because we like VILLAGE VANGUARD a lot! 
-Yeah we do
-I see

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:51.910
So we can pick anything we want, right?

00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.940
This one

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:02.040
Do you know what this is?

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:14.920
This is a fabric softener. This was produced by a manufacturer 
 which makes these fragrances. They finally produced fragranced fabric softeners.

00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:19.810
This smells so good. I'm using this a lot

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.370
I want to share this product with everyone

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.820
I'll get this!
My first item is this one

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:43.700
I want this!

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:47.170
I love STAR WARS

00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:52.010
R2-D2

00:02:52.676 --> 00:02:58.680
But if I buy it.. Oh I found Misa-Misa

00:03:01.782 --> 00:03:04.780
She's already got some items!
-No I haven't

00:03:10.737 --> 00:03:11.920
We are rivals at the moment

00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:18.630
I wonder what she will buy

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.470
There is a sign saying it's been 5 minutes

00:03:24.841 --> 00:03:26.490
And we can only spend 10 minutes on this?

00:03:27.052 --> 00:03:28.060
That's not good

00:03:29.144 --> 00:03:30.540
Can I run?

00:03:43.368 --> 00:03:45.140
Ok, I'll buy a book!

00:03:48.002 --> 00:03:50.350
Oh a toilet seat cover would be nice too! I'm gonna get one

00:03:52.375 --> 00:03:54.850
Oh wait, what should I do? There is not much time left

00:03:58.197 --> 00:04:00.300
How much do you think you've spent?

00:04:00.735 --> 00:04:02.570
Well..

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:05.810
I think I've only spent about ￥2000

00:04:18.587 --> 00:04:21.490
I've got a sign saying we've only got 1 more minute! So scary!

00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:25.760
I'm scared of the person with the sign. I 
 get scared when he comes closer to me.

00:04:26.323 --> 00:04:28.790
Manga! I'm gonna get serious to pick what I like

00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:30.000
In the last minute

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:33.100
I haven't bought much! I'm gonna buy a super expensive item!

00:04:34.335 --> 00:04:38.270
Oh, I've always wanted to get a camera! Why didn't I come here earlier?

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.700
I'm gonna buy Kakko Kawaii Sengen

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.650
I might get this too. Mustaches 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.580
And I think I've bought enough 

00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:54.030
This!

00:04:58.668 --> 00:04:59.770
Settled!

00:05:02.594 --> 00:05:04.540
I'm gonna take these to a cashier

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:07.440
Here you go

00:05:07.777 --> 00:05:08.940
Thank you very much

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:12.280
How much do you think it will cost?

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:15.920
I'm guessing it will be around ￥18,000

00:05:17.146 --> 00:05:19.850
Oh actually, it might be around ￥18,900

00:05:24.258 --> 00:05:26.490
It's..
-Oh wait, this can't be right!?

00:05:27.261 --> 00:05:29.130
￥11,3..
-Oh wait

00:05:29.837 --> 00:05:31.990
Do you have more stuff?
-Oh well, I don't

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.230
It's ￥11,387
-No way!

00:05:38.865 --> 00:05:40.730
I paid ￥11,387 so

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:46.040
I got 20 points 

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:50.810
Yay~

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:53.120
This is my turn now

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:56.590
I got 20 points.
You will..

00:05:57.138 --> 00:06:00.210
Actually I think it may exceed ￥20000

00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:05.400
But it's hard to tell because each item is not so expensive

00:06:06.943 --> 00:06:08.370
Really?
-Yeah

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:15.700
But the last one here is the bomb. 
 it will all depend on this item.

00:06:16.497 --> 00:06:18.000
Anyway, let's have a look

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:23.180
What is your guess?
-About ￥18,000

00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:25.660
Seems like everyone says that.
-I said that too

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.720
Wow!! 
Great!

00:06:32.366 --> 00:06:35.780
It's ￥19,016

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:37.630
I might have lost

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:40.060
Her total score is..?

00:06:41.971 --> 00:06:45.930
I got 17 points
￥19,016 1+9+0+1+6=17

00:06:46.646 --> 00:06:49.930
Seto won this game!

00:06:51.038 --> 00:06:55.240
Yay~

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.000
But can I say one thing? Don't you agree 
 that I did pretty good?
-Yeah I do!

00:06:59.386 --> 00:07:03.050
Right?
-It's ￥19,016

00:07:04.182 --> 00:07:05.420
So close!

00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:11.170
It's time for us to wrap up this shopping game

00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:16.930
I won so I'll get to take these stuff home
Yay!

00:07:18.328 --> 00:07:25.610
I lost the game so these will be given away to our viewers!

00:07:26.606 --> 00:07:32.560
Thank you very much!
-Thank you so much! We 
 will come back to Fujinomiya!
-Yes we will!

00:07:32.944 --> 00:07:36.360
See you again~

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:38.390
Bit embarrassing

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:45.500
One costs about ￥450.
￥900, ￥900, ￥900...

00:07:45.953 --> 00:07:47.810
When will you do it?
-Right Now!

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:50.540
We didn't have a look around here

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:58.310
HARAJUKU KAWAii!! Stuff.
We went that way, but we couldn't see everything
