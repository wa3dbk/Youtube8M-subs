What is public health?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.181
Because I know I
don't have healthcare

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:17.417
and I know I'm living
kind of rough right now.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:18.451
I know I don't look like it.

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.688
I'm kind of fly right now, but,
you know, I'm living rough.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:23.156
&gt;&gt; Public health, I think

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:26.993
about the general
well being of people.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:32.665
&gt;&gt; I thought public health
was that you don't have to pay

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:37.971
for it and private was
you have to pay for it.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:39.472
As simple as that.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.375
&gt;&gt; What does public
health mean to you?

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.210
&gt;&gt; Free condoms.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.778
&gt;&gt; Free-

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:45.712
&gt;&gt; Just saying.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:54.220
&gt;&gt; I think of agencies
that are kind of out there,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.689
working for the whole public.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.590
&gt;&gt; Confusion.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.926
&gt;&gt; When you think
of personal health,

00:00:59.926 --> 00:01:02.028
making sure that you're
taking care of yourself

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:03.063
and eat well and exercise.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:03.696
&gt;&gt; Don't get sick and die.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.565
&gt;&gt; Public health, it's not
only physical, also mental.

[ Music ]

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.273
&gt;&gt; Public health means a lot
of things to a lot of people.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:16.709
Hi. I'm Howard Frumkin, Dean
of the School of Public Health

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.878
at the University of Washington.

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:22.949
To me, public health means the
sum total of all that we do

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:26.653
to create conditions in which
people can be safe and healthy.

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:31.591
Public health includes studying
conditions from diabetes to HIV,

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.795
from mental illness to injuries,
understanding why they occur,

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.132
how to treat them, and
how to prevent them.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.835
It means studying the way
healthcare assistants work

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:44.437
and devising ways to
make them more effective

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.806
and more cost effective.

00:01:46.806 --> 00:01:48.975
It means creating
environmental conditions

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.846
in which people can be
healthy: clean air, clean water,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:55.448
safe food, walkable
neighborhoods.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:58.751
And it means preparing for
public health emergencies,

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.255
ranging from disease
outbreaks to natural disasters.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.556
I could go on and on.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.258
I probably already have.

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.094
But instead, let me introduce
you to the men and women

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.897
at the University of Washington
School of Public Health

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.233
so that they can tell
you in their own words

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:17.704
about what they do to
protect public health.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:20.039
&gt;&gt; The way my research
that I'm currently working

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.908
on affects public
health is to try

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:28.481
to discover why certain people
get certain tests for cancer,

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.451
why they don't get certain test,
and how that affects the care

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.621
that they get and eventually
their outcome, their quality

00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:37.056
of life, and maybe even
how long they live.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.993
&gt;&gt; I am currently doing
a research looking

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.794
at breast cancer
knowledge, beliefs,

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.297
and personal practices
among female nurses

00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:45.965
and midwives in Ghana.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.001
And in the past couple years,

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.270
breast cancer has
become a huge burden

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.905
in lower/middle income
countries.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.174
And this was not the
case in the past.

00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:56.743
So now we are trying
to develop tools

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:58.978
to help equip the
healthcare workforce

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.947
in these lower/middle
income countries to be able

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:04.284
to improve breast health
outcomes for these women.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:06.819
&gt;&gt; I study the determinants
of diabetes

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.190
in American Indian communities
among 13 reservations

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.392
in North Dakota, South
Dakota, Oklahoma, and Arizona.

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:17.163
I'm particularly interested in
the effect of physical activity

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:20.400
on diabetes development
as well as the effect diet

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.634
on diabetes development.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.536
The American Indian
communities I work

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:27.240
with have extremely high
intakes of spam and we've shown

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.977
that lowering intake of spam
may potentially reduce diabetes

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:32.345
risk significantly.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:33.980
&gt;&gt; So the work in the Department

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.317
of Biostatistics broadly
impacts all of public health,

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.853
lots of studies of our
clinical trials, for example,

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:44.390
or the spread of epidemics
involve the collection of data

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.259
and the interpretation of data.

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.695
So people in the
Department of Biostatistics

00:03:48.695 --> 00:03:50.597
that [inaudible]
develop methodology

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:53.866
and apply those methods
to interpret data.

00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:54.901
&gt;&gt; We're doing two projects

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:57.537
that are really important
for public health.

00:03:57.537 --> 00:04:00.273
One of those is project in
auto body workers to try

00:04:00.273 --> 00:04:01.574
and find the best gloves

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:03.476
and coverall materials
that they wear.

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:06.412
And the other is project to
measure community air pollution

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.581
in Duwamish Valley
and South Tacoma.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.150
&gt;&gt; The center that
I work for focuses

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.489
on strengthening health systems
in countries all over the world.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.294
And I particularly work on a
project in the Caribbean region.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:24.097
We focus on training
and education

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:30.236
of healthcare providers,
mostly in HIV, tuberculosis,

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.739
and we also focus on
providing technical assistance

00:04:32.739 --> 00:04:35.408
to Ministries of
health and universities,

00:04:35.408 --> 00:04:37.510
National AIDS program,
National Tuberculosis Program,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.012
that type of thing.

00:04:39.012 --> 00:04:42.615
&gt;&gt; We are doing the Seattle
Obesity Study, which has to do

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:45.451
with disparities in health

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.588
and body weight among
Seattle communities.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:51.691
So this is a project where
we look at where people live,

00:04:51.691 --> 00:04:55.695
where they shop, what foods
they buy, how much they spend,

00:04:55.695 --> 00:04:59.465
and what their health and
weight are as a result of that.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.935
So it's all about social
disparities and making sure

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:06.239
that everyone in Seattle/King
County does have access

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:09.542
to affordable healthy foods.

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.944
&gt;&gt; You've just had a small
taste of the great work

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.946
in public health being
done by the men and women

00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:17.116
at the University of Washington
School of Public Health.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:19.552
You've learned a few
things about public health.

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:23.890
For one thing, we're science
based and we're values based.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.826
The science base of public
health ranges from epidemiology

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:31.531
to biostatistics, from genetics
to toxicology, from civil

00:05:31.531 --> 00:05:35.201
and environmental engineering
to communication science.

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:38.338
But the values base reflects
the shared commitment

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:40.039
that all people deserve
the right

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.975
to a safe and healthy life.

00:05:42.975 --> 00:05:43.876
You've also learned that we

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:48.047
in public health are
practical and we're idealistic.

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:51.918
The idealism reflects a
commitment that the world ought

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:55.521
to be a better place and that
we can help make it that way.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:59.058
But the practical side of public
health reflects a recognition

00:05:59.058 --> 00:06:00.793
that good intentions
are not enough.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:02.829
We need programs that work.

00:06:02.829 --> 00:06:05.431
That means testing
them, modifying them,

00:06:05.431 --> 00:06:09.135
and collecting metrics until
we know they're effective.

00:06:09.135 --> 00:06:12.972
Public health is local
and it's also global.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:15.541
The local part of public health
reflects the work that we do

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.944
in our own communities to
make them safer and healthier

00:06:17.944 --> 00:06:19.712
for the people who live there.

00:06:19.712 --> 00:06:23.416
But we also know that we have a
commitment to the entire world.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:23.850
[Background Music] And the work

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.353
that we do reaches the
far corners of the globe.

00:06:27.353 --> 00:06:30.890
As we at the University of
Washington prepare to train

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.960
and equip the next generation
of public health leaders,

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.163
we hope you'll join us.

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:37.897
Thanks.
