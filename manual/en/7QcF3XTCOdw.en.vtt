00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:13.680
Driving here is brilliant. The Superb's handling
isn't all that great, but there's a lot of space.

00:00:14.202 --> 00:00:19.460
You may remember the first generation Superb.
It looks like a Passat, but longer.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.749
That was the case. It's longer than the Passat,
stick a Skoda badge on it.

00:00:28.418 --> 00:00:35.022
The second generation Superb is a hatchback.
It was available as a wagon later on.

00:00:35.963 --> 00:00:42.224
It wasn't all that pretty. This one is updated.
There's still a lot of space.

00:00:42.224 --> 00:00:51.138
I can sit behind myself in the rear seat. You
should test if you can drive yourself around.

00:00:51.138 --> 00:00:57.159
This is just fine. The trunk... I wanted to find the
volume for you, but I don't think it's relevant.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:01.017
It's simply enormous. You can store a lot of junk.

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:21.860
The new Superb is built on the VW MQB platform,
just like the Golf, Leon, Audi A3, etc.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:30.689
It lost 165 lb, but it's a big car with its
16.4 feet. I don't think it's lightweight.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.457
I don't have it at the ready. We do
have a Czech registration license.

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:40.059
If I'm not mistaken, this car is 3,307 lb.
You feel this a bit.

00:01:40.059 --> 00:01:45.537
Especially in the engines' performance.
We're driving the base model.

00:01:45.537 --> 00:01:52.318
The 1.6 TDI is great for the Dutch market.
We have the 2.0 TDI. I thought it had 148 hp,

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:56.949
but this is the most powerful 2.0 TDI
with 187 hp and 295 lb ft torque.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.704
To be honest, I don't think it shows.
The car doesn't feel very fast.

00:02:03.704 --> 00:02:16.148
More so, in the wrong gear (let me do this now),
1,200 rpm and full throttle, nothing really happens.

00:02:16.148 --> 00:02:19.550
2,000 rpm and up is where the power returns.

00:02:23.738 --> 00:02:32.857
It's no nasty engine, but when I heard
it has 187 hp, I expected more.

00:02:33.123 --> 00:02:40.164
The performance is fine. 0-62 mph
in 8 seconds, 147 mph top speed.

00:02:40.164 --> 00:02:44.852
Not unimportant: there are a number of
versions with 20% additional tax liability,

00:02:44.852 --> 00:02:55.339
including the 1.6 TDI. I wouldn't drive it, though.
I think one of the two 2.0 TDIs will be better.

00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:16.869
This car has a lot of positive sides. The next
thing can be interpreted as positive as well.

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:23.074
Its suspension is relatively soft.
You feel it rock gently over bumps.

00:03:23.074 --> 00:03:28.255
Not a lot of cars do this anymore.
I think Skoda was smart to do this.

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:33.608
It's not very sporty / suitable for
the Autoblog driving style, though.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:41.609
It does corner, but it feels a bit like a boat.
You turn in and it will go in that general direction.

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:47.043
If you get to the edge of grip and
turn in further, it starts squealing.

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:49.157
It doesn't communicate very well.

00:03:49.872 --> 00:03:55.695
VW has other brands for seducing you.

00:03:59.784 --> 00:04:09.426
It's VW's most modern platform. It has all the safety
features to prevent crashes or rolling on afterwards.

00:04:09.426 --> 00:04:13.883
It's all there. There's also
Apple CarPlay, so we'll test that as well.

00:04:19.624 --> 00:04:24.592
A demonstration of Apple CarPlay.
I'm calling it by a different name every time.

00:04:25.309 --> 00:04:31.104
I don't think it's very convenient.
You can listen to your music, call, 

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:40.343
use Apple Maps (which you don't want),
Spotify, and Messages. This is...

00:04:40.343 --> 00:04:43.872
Who do you want to text?
- Casper Heij.

00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:49.801
OK. What do you want to tell Casper Heij?

00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:57.244
Hey Casper, your sister called. We're meeting soon.
- Your message to Casper Heij says:

00:04:57.244 --> 00:05:01.666
Hey Casper, your sister called and (...).
Can this be send?

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:03.838
Yes, send it.

00:05:06.392 --> 00:05:10.390
I can't find results corresponding with Stuart. 

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:13.270
You have to send it to Casper.

00:05:16.527 --> 00:05:18.365
Great system.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.271
Again.
- Who do you want to text?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.369
Casper Heij.

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:28.152
OK. What do you want to tell Casper Heij?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.982
Hi Casper, your sister called.
Our meeting will be fine.

00:05:32.982 --> 00:05:36.908
Your message to Casper Heij says:
Hi Casper, your sister called.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.032
Can this be send?

00:05:39.032 --> 00:05:40.830
Sure, send it.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.277
OK. I'll send it.

00:05:50.702 --> 00:05:53.293
Well, thank you. I can do it faster myself.

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.600
