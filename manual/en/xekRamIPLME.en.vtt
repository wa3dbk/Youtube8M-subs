00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.080
Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. Millions of people at at McDonald's daily.

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.759
Now did you know most of it can be made at home and far cheaper. 

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:12.879
Everyone knows about the bacon and egg McMuffin but theres also the sausage and egg McMuffin which personally 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.629
tastes even better. So join me today as i make my version of a sausage and egg McMuffin

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.530
To start of with into a bowl we are going to place in half a teaspoon of sage

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.470
Half a teaspoon of thyme

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.490
A quarter teaspoon of pepper

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.450
one teaspoon of onion salt 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.240
one teaspoon of garlic salt

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.370
A quarter teaspoon of marjoram 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.060
And just a pinch of nutmeg

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.390
and stir to combine 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
next we are going to use some mince meat or ground meat

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.720
and make a small hole in the middle

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.160
then grab about a quarter 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.510
teaspoon of our mix

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.740
and put it right in the centre 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.230
and making sure you have clean hands of course

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.230
mix it through

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.920
just until it is well combined through out the whole meat

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.750
once it is mixed through

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.260
place it into a bowl

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.970
make up any more then place them in the fridge for a couple of hours

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.410
just so the herbs can infuse in the meat

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.200
Now i have a fry pan on a medium to high heat

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.820
so to that I'm going to add a couple of egg rings

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.930
and grease with some cooking spray oil

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.450
next grab our patties and place them in the middle

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.720
and flatten them out

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.640
now the reason why I'm using egg rings is it just keeps the over all shape uniform

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.450
Its a presentation tactic 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.510
So you don't have to use egg rings for this

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.120
it just makes it look that much better

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.229
so we are going to cook these on both sides

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.679
and it should take you about two to three minutes on the first side

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.679
and about the same on the second side

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:26.309
next i have two muffins that i have out through the toaster so they are lightly toasted

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:28.569
so with the top part

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.569
just lightly butter that

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.849
Then on the bottom place a slice of cheese

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.209
So once the meat is cooked

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.579
remove the egg ring

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.719
and take them of.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.059
next using the same egg rings 

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:53.059
just crack in our eggs

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.019
Just break up the yolk a little

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.019
and cook these for about one or two minutes then flip them over and cook for another one minute

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.479
And we simply place our cooked egg on top of the sausage.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.869
And its done.

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.999
That was very simple and easy to make and it was also allot cheaper then buying it

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:31.999
from McDonald's. But the big test is, does it taste just like the real one? Lets give it a try.

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:45.139
You know what, if i brought one and made one and tasted them both i honestly don't believe i could tell the difference

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.879
It is exactly

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.629
like a McDonald's 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.189
sausage and egg McMuffin it really really is

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:54.489
But as always there is something better about home made, you know what that is?

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.219
When you make it at home it tastes simply delicious.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.789
So give this a go when you have a chance. Its not something you want to have every day

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:03.979
maybe once a week, once a month is perfectly fine

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:07.889
just make sure you burn it of at the gym. As always a list of ingredients are down below

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:11.999
