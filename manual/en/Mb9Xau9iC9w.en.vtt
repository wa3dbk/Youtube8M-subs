00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.930
Why is it that for a man to hit 
a ball over the net,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.839
that man's skin color must be white?

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.390
It doesn't make sense,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.470
but that's the way it was on the tennis
courts of Virginia in the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.539
1950s and early 60s.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.350
Arthur Ashe didn't understand the
question and he refused to abide 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.350
by the answer.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.710
So time after time, he smacked
that ball over the net,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.180
forcing whoever was on the other side to
scramble to get it.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.970
Sometimes he used power;

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.060
sometimes he used a light touch;

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.910
sometimes he used the right spin.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.870
Hit after hit after hit--
he changed the rules.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.520
He made us realize that it didn't matter
who was on the other side of the net.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.560
If a man can hit the ball, the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.960
man should be allowed to hit the ball.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.819
Australia, London, New York City.

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:06.090
Arthur Ashe stopped becoming
a black tennis player,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.220
and instead

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.220
he became a champion.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.830
Today's media

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.710
has made epic heroes of our athletes.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.750
The athlete who plays the game 
the way it should,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.330
inspires good sportsmanship, and uses 
his notoriety to enrich others

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.860
doesn't always get the media attention
he or she deserves.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.280
Arthur Robert Ashe

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.780
beat back many foes before winning the
most prestigious tennis tournament in

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.600
the world--Wimbledon.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.390
Long before the great moment 
in tennis history,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.460
Arthur Ashe plied his trade in the heat
of segregation.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.540
so often throughout his youth

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.480
Ashe's brilliance on the tennis court did
not win him opportunities to play on the

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.990
country clubs and well-kept public courts
of Richmond.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.270
That was simply the Jim Crow South and just like
to see African-Americans being prevented

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.790
from sharing sidewalk spaces,
not being able to shop in Downtown

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.290
or eat in Downtown.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.150
Jim Crow extended to the sports
facilities across the South, and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.490
in Richmond it extended to 
the tennis courts.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.319
Yet he persevered.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.930
He used his intellect to understand the
game and his athletic skill to apply it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.299
in the competition until he could no longer

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.349
be ignored. Against the greatest 
players in the world,

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.260
on the ground the stages, he could 
not be defeated.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.589
Wimbledon, the U.S. Open,

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:36.009
the Australian Open.
He had to be incredibly strong 
to deal with a lot of

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.759
that and to keep his focus and to not give up,
because I think it would have been

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:41.209
really easy

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.209
for someone to

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.419
run up against that type of resistance
and just say,

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:50.199
"I'm black and I can't do this. They
are telling me no and I can't continue." 

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:54.329
But that's not what we see with Arthur Ashe.
Instead of focusing on living a life

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.749
of luxury with his success,

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.980
Arthur Ashe chose a life of service.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.579
He brought her worldwide attention to
the sins of racial segregation known as

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.309
apartheid in South Africa.

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.999
The fantastic example that Arhtur Ashe

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:11.069
will leave for us is the example of

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.329
an activist athlete. Someone who is not

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.489
only able to excel within

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:19.640
thier particular sport--

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.850
that's fantastic--but then to translate
that celebrity

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.630
and that attention and use it to draw
other people into a battle against some

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.959
great wrong in the world. And that's what
Arthur Ashe will do when he begins to

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.620
target South Africa, target apartheid 
as a system

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.459
that's being wrong,

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.389
and using his celebrity to bring
attention to what was happening in that

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:47.609
area of the world and work for a change. 
Arthur Ashe

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.130
uh... is a true

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.970
American hero.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.710
He continued Carter G. Woodson's grand
tradition of writing the truth of

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.600
African-American history with his
brilliant three-volume history

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.499
of African-American athletes.

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:05.709
I have known since the time of my brain
operation in September 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.069
1988

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.619
that I have AIDS.

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:11.319
A blood transfusion following a
heart attack

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:15.709
sent HIV cells streaming into his
once indomitable body.

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.500
Arthur Ashe transformed his personal
adversity into a platform

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.800
to enlighten Americans about the
realities HIV-AIDS

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.830
and in typical style,
to meet the challenge head-on.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.550
Arthur Ashe stands apart

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.499
a hero of a new age

00:04:31.499 --> 00:04:32.740
and an inspiration

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.259
for the future.
