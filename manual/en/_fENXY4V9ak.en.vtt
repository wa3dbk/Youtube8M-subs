Hi! I'm Josiah Own with Expert Village. Hi
and welcome back. Now weâ€™re going to be

00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:11.749
using our second variation of coleslaw. We're
going to use a small red cabbage, red onions,

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:19.521
horse radish, brown mustard, mayonnaise, garlic
salt, vinegar, apple vinegar actually if you

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:26.140
have it, and some sliced apples. This is a
very fruity variation and it's very good.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.170
Start off by just dumping all the ingredients
in there. You probably want about a cup of

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:39.770
the red onions and cup and half-sliced apples.
Right now we're using Granny Smith. Nice little

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:52.130
kick to it. We start off by making our base.
We're going to have about 2 big spoon fulls

00:00:52.130 --> 00:01:04.629
of our mayonnaise, going to add a tablespoon
of the brown mustard, and about 1/4 cup of

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.450
the vinegar. Like I said, you can use apple
vinegar if you have it. With the horseradish,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.181
about a tablespoon of horseradish. All depends
on how spicy you want it. Add the garlic to

00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:28.042
this and some salt and pepper to season. How
much is completely up to you. You just want

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:34.790
to mix that well. We're going to make this
in a separate bowl so we can actually mix

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.409
this all together before we pour it on top
of the apples, onions, and the cabbage because

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.520
then we just get a giant mess. Now we're going
to combine all the ingredients. Pour that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.409
on top of it, give it a nice mix. You can
actually shred the apples for this if you'd

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.860
like. It's completely up to you. This is a
nice refreshing coleslaw if you don't like

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.580
the typical kind. There you go. You want to
refrigerate it over night and for another

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.260
time at least 2 or 3 hours. Serve chilled
and enjoy.
