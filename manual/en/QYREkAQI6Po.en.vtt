Hi, my name is Dave Andrews, today I'm going
to show you how to troubleshoot an internet

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.019
connection. The very first thing that you
might want to check when you're troubleshooting

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.740
your internet connection is the actual physical
devices that control the connection. To do

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:28.500
so, let's click on the start button here,
this round button, go to control panel, in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:39.390
this classic view for control panel, we're
going to select the network and sharing center.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.859
Over here on the left side select manage network
connections. These are the devices that are

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:51.460
installed in my PC that control my connection
to the internet. As you can see from my local

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.300
area connection, the network cable is unplugged.
If I've been trying to connect through a cable,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.710
this would tell me immediately. The problem
is that my cable's unplugged. I'm connected

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.970
through a wireless connection right now. The
next thing to check is whether or not you

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:14.440
have an IP address. Let's close these two
windows, click on the start button, and go

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:22.939
to the command prompt. At the command prompt
let's type IP config, all one word, space,

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:30.189
and then a slash all, A L L. And press enter.
This pulls up the information for each interface

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:37.049
that you have installed on your computer.
As you can see, our wireless LAN adaptor is

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.509
showing connected because I have an IP version
for address showing. The ethernet adaptor

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:49.040
which had a cable unplugged does not have
that IP address information. This could give

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.729
you an idea if you're not connected to the
internet that you're not pulling an IP address.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:01.990
It's that easy to troubleshoot your connection.
My name is Dave Andrews and I've just showed

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.119
you how to troubleshoot your internet connection.
