Hey Tennis Fans and welcome to the Tennis
Now Gear Guide!

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.330
Today we’re walking you through the four
shoe designs in Nike’s sizzling new “Flame

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.330
Pack.”

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.600
Each model includes striking purple accents
and a unique flame design throughout, playing

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.400
homage to the 20th anniversary of the Nike
Tennis Burning Ball Logo.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.109
First we have the flame-i-fied Zoom Vapor
9 Tour shoes, which will make their debut

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.080
on the regal feet of Roger Federer at the
ATP World Tour finals.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.710
Created by the legendary Nike shoe designer
responsible for the Air Jordan line, the Zoom

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.840
Vapor 9’s were constructed with running
shoes in mind, resulting in a light, stable,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.640
and durable fashion statement for Fed’s
feet.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.680
With flashy shoes as the focal point, Nike
keeps the rest of Roger’s collection simple

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.690
and classy.

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.160
A purple RF Masters polo will compliment the
RF woven short and Federer’s trademark Tennis

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.680
Swoosh Bandana.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.510
And because Nike can’t have the Greatest
of All Time getting chilly, Fed will also

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.640
have the RF Hard Court Woven Jacket in his
London arsenal.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.890
Sadly we won’t be seeing Rafael Nadal at
the year-end showdown, but Nike was prepared

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.210
for his return, just in case.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.930
Rafa would have been wearing the Flame Pack’s
Air Max Courtballistec 4.3 shoes with Nike’s

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.540
“flaming ball” accents throughout the
body of the shoe.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.880
You can even see a hint of electric green
near the laces!

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.840
The extra-tough upper portion of the Courtballistec
4.3 is sure to offer extraordinary durability

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.950
in the most physical of matches.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.189
To prove it, Nike offers a six-month outsole
guarantee.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.170
And for those of you who are hooked on Nike’s
Zoom Breath 2K12’s, you can add the Flame

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.130
Pack edition to your collection.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.979
With Drag-On X technology for improved durability,
you’ll find these shoes reliable as well

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.649
as breathable.

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.969
Last but not least, the old-school design
of the Nike Tennis Classic 12’s are given

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.840
an updated feel with the addition of flame
accents on the tongue.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.049
Purple and red pops of color at the sole make
these shoes perfect for a low-key day off

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.369
the court or a fun club match.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.259
