00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:10.240
Alright again, I have a bead mandrel with
release and I toast it gently in the flame,

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.640
gently. The purpose is to get any moisture
out. So you'll notice too when I dance in

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:20.929
the flame I kind of dance at an angle down
but not sideways to me because the glass,

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:26.419
if it flakes or fractures off its going to
kind of shoot down in a cone straight from

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.429
what would be like visualized as the barrel
of a gun. So I'm holding it in. And once you're

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.750
red then you're not in any danger of thermal
shock. And now we're at the point where we're

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.240
going to start to drape the molten glass on
to the preheated mandrel. So here we go and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:53.060
I rotate the preheated mandrel gradually as
I apply the molten gather of glass from my

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:59.030
feed cane which is in my right hand. And notice
too how I am below the flame with respect

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:06.649
to the mandrel. The steel rod is below the
flame. That is my canvas. The glass in my

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.659
right hand can be thought of as the paint
and I'm doing the applying of the paint or

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.520
the hot glass below the flame. Notice now,
once I have applied all my glass I am in the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.880
flame. I am. And then I'm rotating smoothly
and gradually and I periodically take the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.200
bead out to see what I'm doing, see what's
happened. I'm wearing my didinium lenses.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.880
Don't you ever forget to wear glasses doing
this you guys. You only have one set of eyes

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.299
so protect them at all costs. So now I'm turning
it and the bead color which is gray is going

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:52.729
to gradually return and I have a beautiful
simple round bead. Dance back in the flame

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.569
to reheat it if the bead is too long out of
the flame it will crack. So periodically if

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:03.369
you want to keep working on the bead you need
to flash it in and out of the flame. Not so

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:12.020
much but a low kind of glow and you're rotating.
It's mesmerizing and that's part of the beauty

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.600
of glass making, the fun of seeing the colors
change and the shape come to life right before

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.270
your eyes. So this is a very simple bead.
