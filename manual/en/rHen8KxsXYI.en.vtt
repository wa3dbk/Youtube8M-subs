00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.570
Hi, and welcome to the ValveTime News.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.050
Each week, we'll bring you the biggest talking points regarding Valve Software and the community.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:12.560
Now, the news:

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.320
This time last week, it was Gabe Newell's 50th birthday

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.740
and some members of 4Chan's /v/ board were keen to celebrate.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.810
A huge number of 4Chan members gathered together to create a huge poster,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.720
the final version of which contains at least several hundred messages from fans,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.710
all wishing Gabe well on his birthday.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.390
A group of individuals traveled to Valve to deliver the poster in-person,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.380
along with a wooden crate marked "Mann Co."

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.430
Gabe was then forced--yes, forced--to pay $2.50

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.620
in order to purchase the key for said crate.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.880
The contents were then revealed to be--yes, you guessed it--a hat.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.090
You're all probably sitting at home now, thinking,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.950
"How in the world is this the biggest news story of the week?"

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.570
But wait!

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.060
Stay a while and listen; there's more to this story.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.720
The visit to Valve was recorded by one of the visitors and posted to YouTube earlier this week.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.620
Much of the video is quality isn't great and the video is only the first part of two,

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.340
which total at over an hour long,

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.100
but the most interesting piece of information is located about six minutes in,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.720
when a visitor asks about Ricochet 2 and the development of Source 2,

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.730
Valve's new next-gen engine.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.150
While, in the past, Gabe has always avoided answering such questions,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.530
this time he was strangely open on the subject.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.840
As you've just heard,

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230
Gabe confirmed that Source 2 is a brand new engine

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.240
which has been in development for a while now,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.200
as well that Ricochet 2 has started development.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.180
As we all know, Gabe has used "Ricochet 2" as a disguise for the next Half-Life game in the past,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.960
and this is one of the first times he has openly mentioned or discussed the project.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.660
Even a few details were shared.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.210
As for Source 2,

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.170
this is the first time anyone at Valve have acknowledged the engine's existence and development,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.230
which confirms the leaked information we found in the Source Filmmaker

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.520
shortly after its launch was indeed leftover code from a version of Source 2.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.360
We look forward to seeing how the development of Source 2

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.040
will impact the future of Valve games

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.330
as well as how this brand new engine could potentially innovate or forward

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.430
the gaming scene similarly to how the current Source Engine did back at its reveal in 2003.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.120
Valve definitely have their work cut out for them.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.810
The Steam Linux beta began earlier this week

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.570
and is currently exclusively available for the 1,000 selected applicants

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.150
who signed up for the beta survey.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.540
If you're looking to participate, then don't worry;

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.040
more invites are being sent out sometime in the future, according to Valve.

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.490
Oh, and we really don't think it's a coincidence that the Steam Linux beta

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.060
began about a week or so after the launch of Windows 8.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.130
Just sayin'...

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.320
Nexon, an extremely successful Asian game developer and publisher,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.240
has partnered with Valve once again this week,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.890
this time to allow Nexon to publish Dota 2 in Japan and Korea.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.850
Valve have previously partnered with Nexon to develop

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.770
successful free-to-play variants of existing titles, such as Counter-Strike Online,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.760
which was a major hit in the Eastern market.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.290
The MOBA genre is extremely popular in the Asian gaming scene,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.330
with games such as League of Legends thriving in the free-to-play-centric environment.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.160
This is a big step in the right direction for Valve and Dota 2

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.870
as Doug Lombadi was quoted earlier this year as saying,

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.840
"getting Dota 2 into the Chinese and Asian markets was mandatory for the game's long-term success."

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.510
We're excited to see where this partnership will lead,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.160
especially in terms of Dota 2's worldwide success as a game and as a dominant e-sport.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.520
In other Dota 2 news, the game received an update this week

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.930
which brought several major gameplay fixes as well as new UI additions

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.720
and unreleased cosmetic items.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.230
UI improvements include the ability to check courier animations directly from the backpack;

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.740
sentry and observer wards received a few cosmetic variants,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.510
alongside the inclusion of the first cosmetic player mount, dubbed "bub."

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.590
We feel this marks an important point in Dota 2's development

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.580
as Valve expands the scope and potential for cosmetic items

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.320
beyond basic clothing weapon, or hair modifications.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.750
Also included in the update was a variety of skins, portraits, and textures

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.420
for upcoming heroes Slark, Medusa, and Shredder.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.290
The majority of Slark and Medusa content is now in the game,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.900
including animated portraits and voice line subtitles,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.110
meaning that their introductions are just around the corner.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.860
Keep an eye out for their introduction in the coming weeks.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.560
In merchandise news, Valve released a new Team Fortress 2-themed hoodie this week

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.960
with a Mann Co. theme.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.550
There isn't really much else to say;

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.500
I mean, look at it! The damn thing has an attached mustache!

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.160
But, yeah, it's now available from the Valve Store,

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.440
so check it out in the link in the video description.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.000
That's if I haven't already bought them all by the time this video goes out.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.130
Although...really, I'm quite capable of growing my own mustache,

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.920
thank you, Nick...

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.460
Nope!

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.390
Earlier this year, Valve announced a partnership with Adult Swim.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.030
The first sign of their partnership was shown by the release

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.510
of a Robot Chicken-themed Team Fortress 2 hat--

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.480
Robot Chicken being one of Adult Swim's most popular shows.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.630
The hat release was a move which didn't exactly inspire confidence in the community--

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.060
a point our editor Glenn will most likely agree with

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.160
after having to write about it as a news story a while back.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.000
Ah...poor Glenn.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.020
Anyway, the partnership was highlighted once more recently

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.720
during one of Robot Chicken's episodes in which a Team Fortress-themed short

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.680
was included in the typical Robot Chicken stop-motion style.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.980
A link to a YouTube upload of the short will be available on-screen now,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.440
in case you feel like watching it.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.620
The Saxxy Awards are coming to a close in a few days

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.200
and Machinima creators everywhere have been trying their hardest

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.400
to win themselves one of the elusive golden statues.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.690
Zachariah Scott, co-founder of the Lit Fuse Films group

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.420
and head of the Open Source Filmmaker Steam community group,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.900
uploaded a new Team Fortress-inspired SFM short this week entitled "Bad Medicine."

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.360
Another creator, known as Brett Kennedy, has created "Pyro in Love,"

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.080
a light-hearted short about finding true love.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.410
Both videos are extremely well-animated

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.190
and are great examples of how the SFM can be used to create high-quality work

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.850
in two totally ends of the emotional spectrum.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.510
Now, we hear you cry, "Why?!

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.630
Why make a whole news story about a few fan videos?!

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.830
Why do you waste my time, ValveTime?

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:13.920
I come here for news!"

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.710
Well, Mr. Cynical-No-Fun, go and watch both videos and you'll see.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.090
Don't worry, we'll wait for you here while you watch it.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.880
Waiting...

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:20.320
Waiting...

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.920
Waiting...

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.240
Is he gone?

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.990
Okay, anyway.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.440
Alright, so, let's wrap this episode up

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.760
and we'll get on out of here before he gets back.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.120
Thanks for watching.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.470
Don't forget to subscribe and head on over to our website

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:31.720
to get involved with the community.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.270
Keep an eye out for a new mini-series coming out sometime in the near future,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.600
which I don't even think I know about,

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:41.540
and stay tuned for more ValveTime videos, news, and reviews coming soon.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.770
Bye for now.
