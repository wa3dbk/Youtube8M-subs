00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:24.589
Now let's move on to the apple. We're going
to slice it like so.

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:33.220
Then we'll dice this, same size as the onion.
You want everything to be pretty much uniform.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:45.530
Now
if you cut your apples in advance, you may

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:53.220
want to soak the dice in lemon water. That
will keep the apples from turning brown. However,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.400
we will be cooking this right away, so no
need for that, but you can already see that

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:19.340
it's changing color, just like so.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.469
We have our onions, apples, celery. Again,
we want the size to be the same, everything

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:40.090
uniform.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:02:26.520
Now let's go to the carrot. So peel it. Again,
again, keep the size about the same. It's

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:35.170
good for color, presentation, and you also
want these small pieces because we'll be rolling

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.640
this all through a piping bag. So you don't
want any big chunks. Otherwise, it will clog

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.750
up the pastry bag.
