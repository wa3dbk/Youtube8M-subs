00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.240
Wet Application of a Window Graphic

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.700
Sometimes window graphics are viewed from both sides, which means the adhesive side

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.450
has to look absolutely perfect.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.730
This is the only time we would suggest using
water to ease your application.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.090
First follow the steps outlined in the video
creating a clean zone.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.340
Before beginning a wet application, be sure
the adhesive on your graphic is not water-based

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.860
or air egress.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.130
Air egress films can trap water in their air
channels, which can lead to failures.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.610
If your film is water based or air egress,
follow the steps laid out in our dry window

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.750
application video.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.200
Start by making precise measurements of the
window opening and cut the graphic to this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.120
exact size.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:19.680
Backslide the graphic twice near the center
and across the web, about six inches apart.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:32.490
Then spray some detergent mix on the glass
and the area that you have backslid.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.250
Remove the small piece of liner you have cut
out and float the graphic into place.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.210
When it is exactly where you want it, firmly
squeegee the water out, starting from the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.210
center.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.729
Let the adhesive set up for about twenty minutes.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.869
This will ensure that the adhesive is strong
enough to hold the graphic in place as you

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.869
remove the liner in the next step.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.560
Lightly spray the portion of the glass you
will install on first.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.300
And slowly remove the liner as you apply the
graphic.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.300
Be ensured to squeegee out all of the water.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.459
Repeat these steps on the other half as well.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.599
Let the adhesive on the complete graphic
set up for about twenty minutes before attempting

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.659
to remove the pre-mask.

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:41.859
If you are working in a cool environment and
the adhesive takes too long to set up, causing

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.159
the graphic to come off with the pre-mask,
take a wetted squeegee, soak the edge and

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.980
reapply the entire graphic.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.120
Continue to rewet the squeegee, as it dries
out.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.860
The thin film of water you have applied will
break the surface tension of the paper and

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:03.180
allow the pre-mask to come off with less effort.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.180
Using the wet application technique will make

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.520
your window graphics look great from both sides.
