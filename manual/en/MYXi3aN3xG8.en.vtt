Hi, my name is Mohmed Memon, I'm from
India. My name is Michala, I'm from the Czech Republic.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.430
My name is Ana Maria del Castillo. My name is Alfonso Valderrama.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.750
My name is Tatiana. My name is Dara Sepheri.
My name is Caroline. I'm from Honduras.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:26.900
And I came here to study photography. I went to
college for advertising and graphic design.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.609
And I thought it was time for me to get a
formal education in photography. As a career

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:36.329
path, it's very important to study it, to actually
know what you're doing, how you're doing it,

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
and why you're doing it. The New York Film
Academy was the only one that really provided

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:50.050
intensive courses. And New York of course, New York
was the best.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.690
I thought it would be completely technical. I thought we'd stay in most of
the time and do mostly studio work. It's totally

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.550
the opposite. Since the beginning, like going
to galleries, studying other photographers.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:09.000
We went to many museums all over the city,
just photography exhibitions, art exhibitions,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.690
everything. All the classes in general, it
was very intensive. Classes like Shooting

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.720
Lab, Photo I. We learned about equipment,
lenses, flashes. I learned a lot about light.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.390
It's amazing what you can do with a photo,
how you can transform everything. And at the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.790
same time, a lot of different kind of softwares,
like Lightroom, Photoshop. The imaging classes

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.880
were great. Everyone had something different
to teach me. One of the things that I really

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.880
liked about the New York Film Academy is the
fact that you have people from all over the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.580
world. All of our classmates are from completely
different cultures, completely different countries.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.830
And getting to know them, it just opens your
mind to see what the world is really like.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.310
We had a lot of fun as a group. In all that
experience, everything come together. I definitely

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.690
look at photography in a different way now.
Here I found I love more of the fine art part

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.860
of my and exploring that side. I want to do
more fashion shooting. I really like photojournalism.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.830
I need to be myself. I need to show what I
know. I need to show what I want to say in

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.879
my heart, in my photography. This experience
completely changed my life.
