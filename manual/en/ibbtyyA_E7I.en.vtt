00:00:06.488 --> 00:00:09.155
(playful music)

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:24.648
(snoring)

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.432
- Hey, what's up? I'm Ricky.

00:00:31.432 --> 00:00:33.320
I'll be your hangover this morning.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.019
It's my first day!

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.703
Hey, does this hurt?

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.453
- No, actually it feels soothing.

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:41.842
- Oh, crud.

00:00:42.738 --> 00:00:44.051
- Very sorry sir.

00:00:44.051 --> 00:00:46.043
As you can see, I'm working
with a trainee today.

00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:47.194
- Hey, how'd I do?

00:00:47.194 --> 00:00:48.756
- It was awful. It was
a bunch of nonsense.

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:50.135
What was that?

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:52.094
- Oh, you know that thing
when you're hungover,

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:55.957
and your feet get like super
ticklish, and you hate it.

00:00:55.957 --> 00:00:57.530
I was doing that.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.076
- Have you ever been hungover before?

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:00.776
- Oh no, I'm a Mormon.

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:03.244
- Okie dokie. Maybe we should
start with some basics.

00:01:03.244 --> 00:01:04.811
Now this young man drank
two and a half quarts

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:06.517
of rye whiskey then topped it off

00:01:06.517 --> 00:01:08.325
with a hell of a lot of Jager.

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:10.757
So right now he should be experiencing

00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:12.497
crippling dizzy spells.

00:01:12.497 --> 00:01:16.406
Ricky, how are you gonna give that to him?

00:01:16.406 --> 00:01:18.323
- Stuff him in a dryer!

00:01:19.663 --> 00:01:21.436
- You know what, let's
just simplify a bit.

00:01:21.436 --> 00:01:24.853
You know uh, learn to use what's at hand.

00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:28.529
- Stopping the flow of blood to his brain.

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:30.316
(laughs loudly)

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:31.977
- Yeah, I don't think that's
quite what I was thinking.

00:01:31.977 --> 00:01:33.727
But uh, B for effort.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.214
So what I like to do, is start off slow,

00:01:37.214 --> 00:01:38.773
and then once you get him moving,

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:41.190
you can really pick up speed.

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:48.243
(playful music)

00:01:48.243 --> 00:01:49.076
- Symptom?

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.764
- Uh dry mouth.

00:01:50.764 --> 00:01:53.369
- Dry mouth. Dry mouth.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.536
Ooh! I got it!

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:01.683
(coughing)

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:03.835
- Much better, much better.

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:05.799
Personally, I would have
gone for like a handful

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.381
of cotton balls 'cause I like
to keep my workspace clean,

00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:10.669
but I think you're getting the hang of it.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:11.722
Should we hit some more?

00:02:11.722 --> 00:02:12.555
- Please.

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:16.747
(pans clanging)

00:02:16.747 --> 00:02:19.414
(loud laughing)

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:27.628
- Alright Ricky, ready
to take one on your own?

00:02:27.628 --> 00:02:29.322
- Yeah, I got this.

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:31.698
- Alright, put 'er there buddy.

00:02:31.698 --> 00:02:32.531
Good luck.

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:38.638
- You drank so much
your hair's falling out.

00:02:38.638 --> 00:02:42.055
(electric razor buzzing)

00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:48.064
- What!?

00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:52.164
- Ugh good morning class.

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:54.843
- Actually, it's a quarter past noon.

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:56.059
- What?
- Yeah.

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:57.851
- Okay let's get started.

00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:01.941
Everyone pull out your
books and we'll work-
