00:00:04.373 --> 00:00:09.373
(upbeat music)

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:24.868
- Hello everyone, how's it going?

00:00:24.868 --> 00:00:28.990
Anne here, and I am in front
of my desk again (laughs).

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.891
I'm still trying to get
a feel of my studio space

00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:35.349
and figure things out. I'm
redecorating around here.

00:00:35.349 --> 00:00:37.743
So, today's video, I'm
going to show you guys

00:00:37.743 --> 00:00:40.390
how to do some fun and creative ways

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.434
that you can personalize your notebooks.

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:44.047
I found some solid-color notebooks here,

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:46.427
and I can't wait to
decorate them with you.

00:00:46.427 --> 00:00:48.912
I'm excited to do this. Let's
go ahead and get started.

00:00:48.912 --> 00:00:51.047
This first design, I'm
going to show you how

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:52.963
I made this painting and
how you can make this

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.611
on your own notebook.

00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:55.830
The notebook is a different texture,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.002
therefore I'm going to show
you guys how you can use

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:01.403
acrylic paint and create
that watercolor effect.

00:01:01.403 --> 00:01:03.841
Your first step is to
start with a damp brush

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:06.082
and dab it into a little bit of paint.

00:01:06.082 --> 00:01:09.367
Then, on your notebook,
create a feather-like shape.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:11.491
Just imagine how a
feather would look like,

00:01:11.491 --> 00:01:13.871
and try to create that silhouette.

00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:16.251
Try adding two to three
colors to your feather.

00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:19.215
It will create a really
pretty gradient look

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:20.884
and watercolor effect.

00:01:20.884 --> 00:01:24.065
If your colors aren't mixing
well, add in a little water

00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:27.606
and if it's too watery
then take some paper towel

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:29.347
and blot it.

00:01:29.347 --> 00:01:32.204
Let the paint set for
a good thirty minutes.

00:01:32.204 --> 00:01:34.803
Now it's time to draw
in the intricate design.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:38.309
This can be as detailed as
you guys would like it to be.

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:41.409
I started with a stem,
and I drew a long line

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.508
going in the center of the feather,

00:01:44.508 --> 00:01:45.809
and from the center of the feather,

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:48.085
I drew out short, wispy lines.

00:01:48.085 --> 00:01:51.707
From there, you can draw
different designs or prints,

00:01:51.707 --> 00:01:52.728
whatever you like.

00:01:52.728 --> 00:01:54.748
This is just a fun doodle
project, especially

00:01:54.748 --> 00:01:57.209
when you're in class, you
can work on the prints,

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.766
and I feel like I concentrate better

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:02.341
when I'm doodling in
class, what about you guys?

00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.081
I feel like it really exercises my brain.

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:07.786
For the finishing touch,
you can write words

00:02:07.786 --> 00:02:10.502
under the feathers, so each
feather can represent something.

00:02:10.502 --> 00:02:14.566
For me, I'm writing the words
create, dream, and achieve,

00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.770
and hopefully whenever you look
at it, it will motivate you.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.677
For this next look, we're going to create

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:26.010
a colorful, crackle marble effect.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.970
I'm using a special paint to
create the crackled effect,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.315
however you can still get the marble look

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:33.034
using acrylic paint.

00:02:33.034 --> 00:02:35.576
There's a few techniques you
can use to apply on the paint.

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:37.689
You can use a dropper, a straw,

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.335
just like what I'm doing
here, or just pour it

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:41.927
straight onto the notebook.

00:02:41.927 --> 00:02:43.574
Then with your straw, blow on the paint

00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:46.279
so that way it can
create a splattered look

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.834
and also mix in with the other colors.

00:02:48.834 --> 00:02:51.016
Make sure to do this in a ventilated area,

00:02:51.016 --> 00:02:53.675
and not to inhale any toxic fumes.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:56.345
As you can see, this creates
such a beautiful effect,

00:02:56.345 --> 00:03:00.897
and of course I have to add in
a little bit of gold glitter.

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.654
This next design is a great
way to cover your books

00:03:06.654 --> 00:03:07.792
or your notebooks.

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.533
All you will need are so some fabric.

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:12.774
Make sure to cut some
fabric leaving 4 to 5 inches

00:03:12.774 --> 00:03:17.226
extensions on the sides,
and also 1 to 2 inches

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:20.575
extensions on the top and the bottom.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:23.105
Flip the fabric over, with
the wrong sides facing up,

00:03:23.105 --> 00:03:25.177
and then lay your book on top.

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.689
Fold in your fabric on
the top and the bottom,

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.883
so that way it matches with
the edges on your book.

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:33.322
Do the same thing on the side,

00:03:33.322 --> 00:03:35.539
and add in a little dab
of glue here and there,

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.088
so that way the fabric can hold in place.

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.025
For the pocket part, I'm going
to use the same pair of jeans

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:46.557
that I used in my pencil case tutorial.

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:48.658
For the pocket, you want to
cut enough to wrap around

00:03:48.658 --> 00:03:51.317
your book, or either the
front part of your book.

00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:52.708
You also want to consider

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:55.241
how much you will need to glue in as well.

00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:58.503
For me, I'm leaving
about 1 to 1 1/2 inches

00:03:58.503 --> 00:04:00.720
of extra fabric on the sides.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.904
After determining where you
want your pocket to sit,

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:05.247
fold in the raw edges and glue it in.

00:04:05.247 --> 00:04:07.721
This way, you will have
a nice, seamless line.

00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:10.344
This is such a fun, customizable D-I-Y.

00:04:10.344 --> 00:04:13.885
I just love it, because you
can re-purpose old clothing

00:04:13.885 --> 00:04:18.363
and make it into this lovely
notebook cover or book cover.

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:20.363
I absolutely love this design.

00:04:20.363 --> 00:04:22.221
I put in my watercolor painting kit,

00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:24.066
and my pencils and brushes.

00:04:24.066 --> 00:04:25.599
It's so convenient because I have

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:27.149
everything there for me.

00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:35.654
Alright, guys! Thank you
so much for watching.

00:04:35.654 --> 00:04:37.431

I'd love to hear what
you guys have to say,

00:04:53.173 --> 00:04:54.973
and I do comment back,

00:04:54.973 --> 00:04:58.570
so I might just comment back
on one of your comments.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.951
If you guys haven't seen
my last couple of videos,

00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:04.528
I did a room decor hack, and
also a pencil case holder,

00:05:04.528 --> 00:05:05.851
so don't miss out on it.

00:05:05.851 --> 00:05:08.904
You can click on the videos
on the side right over here,

00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:10.890
or I think I might have
some here, I don't know.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.724
Somewhere there (laughs).

00:05:12.724 --> 00:05:14.663
Thank you guys so much for watching,

00:05:14.663 --> 00:05:16.972
and I will see you guys next weekend.

00:05:16.972 --> 00:05:18.396
Ciao!
