Hi everybody and welcome to our videogame
world!

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:08.700
You know, this year there's a good reason
to celebrate valentine's day, for once. And

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.209
-the reason is... THE LAST OF US LEFT BEHIND.
- It's only because there's no girl who will

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.500
-..hang-out with your yammerer stupid face.
- Shut up, you... pimple.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000
Left behind is a DLC for the ultra, mega...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.050
... unbelievably-super-amazing-
i-can't-believe-it's-so-damn-good THE LASTOF US, for Playstation 3.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.500
- It is a sequel to the main storyl...
- no you klutz, it's a prequel.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.860
Ah, ok. It's a - screw you - prequel to the main storyline and you will
play as Ellie, not as Joel.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.850
The composer of the game is Gustavo Santaolalla,
usually a film composer, he created awesome

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.890
music for movies like Babel, Into the wild
and Brokeback mountain.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.809
- Ok, what are we goin to play?
- Hm, sir, we will play the Menu theme,

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.000
