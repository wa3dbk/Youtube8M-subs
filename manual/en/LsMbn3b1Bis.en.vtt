00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.510
Much of behaviour requires animals to communicate.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.780
Animals can communicate through a variety
of modes, which include chemicals, known as

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.770
pheromones, sounds and signals, even dancing.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.750
It can be defined as a behaviour of one animal
that has an effect on the current or future

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.199
behaviour of another animal.

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.000
Communication between animals can imply messages
or warnings.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.680
For example, plants send out messages via
pheromones to try and attract pollinators.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.630
Pheromones can be a hormone for communication
to the same species, for example to attract

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.720
a mate or they can be a chemical secreted
by one animal to cause a reaction of another;

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.570
they make communication possible.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.980
Honey bees communicate information about food
sources with a special dance, known as a ‘waggle

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:56.980
dance’.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.090
A figure of eight dance tells bees which direction
and how far it is to flowers and a round dance

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.290
tells them that food is close by.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.109
Sound from the dance of the bees is picked
up by the tiny hairs on the bee’s head.

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.439
So bees communicate through sound, and movement
signals, as well as by releasing pheromones

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.450
into the environment.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.170
Killer whales communicate through sound.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.590
Sound is a very important method of communication
for whales because sight is less effective

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.640
underwater.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.069
Killer whales produce whistles, echolocation
clicks, pulsed calls, low-frequency pops and

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.249
jaw claps.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.680
Research has shown that whales produce sounds
more frequently when they are closer to other

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.391
individuals, and less frequently when groups
are dispersed.

00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:52.649
It is thought that the sounds are used for
group recognition and the coordination of

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.990
behaviour.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.200
It is also interesting to note that each pod
of whales has its own unique dialect.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.159
Whales may also communicate using a variety
of postures and gestures.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.640
However, the purpose of behaviours such as
breaching are not clearly understood, although

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.190
it is assumed that behaviours like jaw-snapping
and head-butting communicate aggression.
