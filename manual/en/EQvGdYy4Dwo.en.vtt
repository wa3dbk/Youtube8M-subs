Hi! My name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
expertvillage.com. In this clip we are going

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.090
to talk about one of the maintenance items
involved in a major tune-up or vehicle overhaul.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.170
In this step we are going to talk about in
this clip is checking of your brake fluid.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.120
Your brake fluid is going to be located in
a reservoir right here on top of the vehicle’s

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.892
master cylinder. It is generally located directly
through from the steering wheel. You are going

00:00:29.892 --> 00:00:36.489
to want to take it and remove the cap and
look at the fluid level inside the car. Take

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.511
your finger and get a small sample. Take care
not to get this fluid anywhere. What you are

00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:47.510
looking for on Dot 3 fluid is amber color
which is nice and clear. When adjusting the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.880
fluid level if it happens to be low, when
it is low, you will notice that the red brake

00:00:52.880 --> 00:01:00.050
light comes on. If it is low, you are going
to have to add fluid to it. Each vehicle takes

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:10.490
a specific kind of fluid. There are four kinds;
Dot 3, Dot 4, Dot 5 and Dot 6. Dot 6 is only

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.509
available for military purposes and you won’t
be able to buy it in the civilian world. Dot

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.619
3 covers the vast amount of the drive in public.
Any civilian type vehicles, anything that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.959
is sold, GMC, Chevy or Ford are going to take
Dot 3. You do not want to mix these kinds

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:34.060
of fluids being that they have different hydraulic
standards they are manufactured to. Dot 4

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.380
is going to be listed in the same location
as Dot 3 and now Dot 5 is going to be located

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.349
in the same position as Dot 3. You are going
to want to read either the reservoir cap or

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:48.729
the master cylinder itself. Somewhere on there
it is going to indicate what type of fluid

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:56.539
it takes. This one takes Dot 3 and to fill
it up you don’t want to take it right up

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.649
to the top. You want to fill it up to about
a half inch before the top of the reservoir,

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:19.840
right there. Seem to have lost my cap here.
There we go. All right! That’s how you check

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.900
your brake fluid.
