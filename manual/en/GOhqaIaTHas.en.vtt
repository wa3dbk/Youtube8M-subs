00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.929
-Oh hey! So I’m here with Karen Kavett -Hey
everyone!

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.669
And we’re like in like a Christmas zone
and we’re gonna do Christmas-y fun things

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.549
and I can’t wait to—(phone ringing)

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.580
Hold on, I’ll be right back

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.500
Okay, I’ll just—I’ll be here

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.000
Hi

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.340
Um wait who are you?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.220
Dani, hi

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.180
-So do you wanna do some crafts? -Yeah

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.090
-But, okay I guess until Nic…

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.000
-Can you eat this?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.460
-…gets back

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.820
That doesn’t taste good

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.780
No, um that’s not food

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.020
Uh none of this is food

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.680
Yeah but anything can be food if you really
believe

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.780
I don’t think that’s true with craft supplies

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.480
Well, I’m gonna go first um I’m gonna
pick this lovely snowflake design

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.739
I used to eat this when I was little and then
I got in trouble

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.649
That explains a lot of stuff

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.520
So here you go, here’s your paper

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.949
You’re gonna make a card

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.600
I don’t like the texture

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.700
Do you have scissors?

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.640
okay

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.200
okay

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.360
That’s really pretty

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.540
wait

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.880
okay wait I know what to do

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.260
Yeah?

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.220
You’re good?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.480
yeah

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
Thanks for having me over today

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.980
yeah I mean I didn’t really invite you but—

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.480
It’s a mistletoe

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.430
yeah that’s better

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.600
Better is a subjective word

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.180
So I—this is what I made with my mistletoe

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.310
and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.130
a lot of mistletoe comes with berries

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.860
right?

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.660
-um -oh I love this stuff -so anyway um this
is called a bone folder and it’s um really

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:55.900
useful you can use it to press down your folds
to make them really nice and crisp

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.020
-haha you said it’s a bone folder, it fold
bones

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.170
well they used to be made out of bone, now
they’re made out of plastic

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.280
but they’re still called that

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.500
I have a bone made out of plastic

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.220
I don’t wanna know any more than that

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.590
This is really hard to chew

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.769
So if you have a really busy cardstock on
the front of your card like that you don’t

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.670
necessarily want to write directly on it

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.010
yeah

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.490
because your words are gonna get a little
lost

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.920
yeah

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.099
so instead you can cut a shape like this little
tag shape and I’m just gonna punch a hole

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.599
in it as if it’s like hanging by ribbon
and then I’m gonna glue it on my card

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.759
it’s gonna be super cute

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.909
I have holes

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.239
Do you have like a bag?

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.960
A bag?

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:44.269
yeah

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.310
what kind of bag

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.389
for protection

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.739
hold on

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.540
this is really festive

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.239
so how do you think mine’s coming out? I
think it’s really cute

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.310
I have this nice little gift tag which I can
write my message on

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.470
mine you can just write right on it

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.909
and just give it to your mom

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.859
this is really hard and I’m not gonna use
it

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.749
so I’m gonna use the glue gun instead

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.930
-oh be careful with that -I’m just gonna
plug it in -it gets really hot

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.499
what doe this taste like?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.760
maybe, maybe I should hang onto that for a
few minutes

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.320
that was so…

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.400
…fun

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.980
wait so I just need a little more gl—

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.079
but I don’t know how to get—it’s really
hot

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.860
yep it’s in the name of the thing

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.590
hot glue gun

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.440
oh yeah

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.000
remember?

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.260
okay I’m gonna try again with a different
finger

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.940
okay I’m not gonna use this one either

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.310
-thank you for not burning my house down -yeah

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.840
you’re a great friend

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.349
as you can notice this already says merry
christmas on this part of the mistletoe

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.090
but you want this to be universal so now you
can give it to all of your friends

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.249
because I wrote happy holidays

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.939
hey do you like horse meat

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.259
yours is looking pretty good

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:08.639
but mine is looking pretty gooder

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.930
so a really good way to add texture to a card
is to wrap a little bit of string around it

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.370
and then tie a bow

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.620
and it kinda adds like a 3D element and it
makes it look really pretty and really festive

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.260
if you have like red and white string like
this

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.099
I threw up all over the floor this morning
and it was really festive as well

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.919
so mine is almost ready but I need a hole

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.520
right here

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.470
and then you need a string so do you know
what the tradition of a mistletoe is?

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.100
uh you stand underneath it and then you kiss
whoever’s under there with you

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.819
maybe you should um

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.180
I think maybe we’re done

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.270
I think um

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.070
we’re d—

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.040
do you have any raw eggs?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.680
alright so my card is finished and it’s
super cute

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.990
I think a really nice touch for a card is
to tie a piece of string around it and then

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.900
tie it into a bow and then when you open it
up it’s like a little package with your

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.430
message waiting for you on the inside

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.170
yeah I really like packages

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.870
also a mistletoe

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:21.060
I hope you guys liked our homemade holiday
cards um I thi—mine is so easy like I just

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.610
came up with this right off the top of my
head. It’s so fun

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.900
and I already have one of these so why don’t
we switch and you can give that one to your

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.789
friends and family and I’ll give this one
to mine

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:33.970
-uh wait but no

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:34.879
-thank you

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:35.680
-but

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.420
-omg -Nic! -I am so sorry

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.759
-where were you, where did you go?!

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:46.490
-uh seriously when I closed the door it locked
behind me and I was like knocking on it, I

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.710
like called your phone

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.280
-where is my phone?

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.050
but anyway

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.129
have you seen Dani? she took my card

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.260
I’m sorry

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.120
ugh she must’ve followed me here uh by the
way your bedroom window is open, that’s

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.849
how I got in so

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.800
I’m assuming that’s her doing I apologize
I’m ready to craft

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.000

mistletoe?

this is supposed to be mistletoe?

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.099
that’s what she said, she said there were
like berries on it and um you’d hang it

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:46.090
up in like your mom’s house and then you
know you kiss people under it and—

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.139
