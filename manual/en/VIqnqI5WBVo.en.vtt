00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.180
All right, today I'm here to show you some
more BMX tricks. I want to show you what the

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.390
fakie wall ride is all about. My obstacle
here today is a tree, so it's more of a fakie

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:34.910
tree ride. Either way you go with it. Let
me give you a demonstration.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.520
All right, so, the fakie wall ride, or tree
ride, in my case. You want to go up with enough

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.820
speed to clear the jump, or the transition
that you're taking off of. Now, keep in mind,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.120
the fakie wall ride can be any kind of obstacle,
it can be on ramps, it can be on a tree, that

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.399
just has a nice little transition on the bottom
of it. Basically, you want to get up the transition

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.600
enough to get yourself completely vertical.
Get both tires to touch, in my case here,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.810
I have a little gap between the tree and the
actual transition, it's about that much. So,

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.299
once I get to the top and get both my tires
on, I need to kind of pop off, keeping myself

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.130
level. If you, you know, push forward too
much or you pull backwards too much, it can

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.200
be really dangerous. You're going to come
into the tranie all sloppy. Basically, you

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.109
want to go up, mimic the tree with your two
tires, keep it as, keep it as straight as

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:32.659
possible and pull yourself back into the tranie.
And then you're going to have to roll back.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.289
Rolling back is a little technical, you might
want to work on rolling back before you do

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.560
anything. So, once you've done that, you've
made it through the fakie wall ride, or tree

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:54.469
wall in my case. Let me give you a little
walk through.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:02.609
Take up a little bit of speed, make contact,
pull off. You got to pull off, if you don't

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.380
pull off and case that little thing, it going
to throw you right to your back. So, I like

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.480
to pull off with just enough where I land
in the tranie perfectly, keep myself nice

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.340
and balanced, turn it around. You've got yourself
a nice fakie wall ride.
