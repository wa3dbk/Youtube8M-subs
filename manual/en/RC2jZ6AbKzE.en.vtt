00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.619
I reviewed the Toy Story 2 game a few months
ago, and that game was released on the N64.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.390
The game I have today is the next in the series,
released on the tail end of the Xbox 360’s

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:38.390
lifespan.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.780
How many sequels, especially Pixar sequels,
can you say that about.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.370
It might have done this game some good, however,
as it’s…achem…light years better than

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.000
the last game in the series.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:01.800
This is Toy Story 3 for the Xbox 360.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.220
Toy Story 3 is an interesting game that follows
a similar style to the game released more

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.010
than 10 years earlier.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.160
The main difference is that you have some
different characters and abilities to choose

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.830
from, but you still pick from a few different
levels and get missions from toys inside them

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.030
to complete.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.140
Some of these are actually told as stories
to the other toys, with different characters

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.009
playing the role of villains while guys like
Woody or Buzz try to stop them.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.929
The freedom you get in choosing what to do
still makes it pretty unique among video games

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:33.140
based on movies, even though the second game
did it 10 years earlier.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.630
It just hasn’t caught on with other franchises.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.540
Toy Story 3 actually controls really well,
not just for a movie game, but for any game

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.540
at all.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.140
Jumping and attacking both feel sensitive
but smooth, and camera control is actually

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.670
not an issue at all.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.341
The ability to get a horse in one section
also makes the game a lot more fun, but the

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:52.960
best additions are the sections that allow
you control a few different characters.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.520
Throwing Woody up to a desk so he can reach
something that the other characters can’t

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.509
adds something different to a game that could’ve
gotten a little repetitive.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.509
Toy Story 3 is also the perfect difficulty
for its target audience.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.289
Now, I’m not that audience, so I found the
game to be pretty easy, except for a few jumps

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.580
near the very beginning, but the kids this
is meant to appeal to shouldn’t have any

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.190
problem with it.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.109
Missions can also be marked with an arrow
on your compass so you don’t get lost, and

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:18.630
although they’re all pretty easy as well,
they’re quick enough for short attention

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.880
spans.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.140
Oh, and did I mention that you can just pick
up other characters and chuck them through

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.140
windows?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.230
It’s extremely entertaining.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.380
You can do it to anyone.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.880
Oh, you just gave me a new mission?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.400
Here’s how I feel about that, get in the
water!

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.799
One mission also told me to get a lost donkey
back to his owner by pushing him off a cliff,

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.560
as he claims that donkeys always land on their
legs.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.280
Remember kids, if you see a lost donkey, push
it off a cliff.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.930
Using the same visual style of the movies
also helps to make Toy Story 3 a really good

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.660
looking game on the 360.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.390
It doesn’t try to do too much, and the frame-rate
in cut-scenes is really smooth.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.600
Voice acting is also great, as is the case
with most Pixar games.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.970
I especially liked Kristen Schaal’s performance.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.220
I didn’t know exactly what to expect with
Toy Story 3, but I was pleasantly surprised

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.239
to see that the game not only used some elements
from the last game, but improved them to create

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.260
a great title for kids to play.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:27.400
This is one of the only movie games I’d
say is a must play for fans of 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.479
the film.
