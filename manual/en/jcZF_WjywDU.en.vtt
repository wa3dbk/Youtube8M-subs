00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.230
We first decided on a concept
which was expanding horizons,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.170
and through that we decided on
some of the main architectural

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.830
features. We join with Missouri
University to combine more of

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.170
the architectural feel into the
design. The majority of the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.830
design is horizontal and it just
expands the eye, makes is feel

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.100
bigger. We first started out
with module system this time and

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.730
this year we decided to do one
for easy transport. Just to see

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.470
if it better, and we actually
liked. It kind of limited us on

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.870
the design, but it was much
easier to put up and so it was

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.670
very easy to put onto the mall.
So as you can see with the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.200
louvres and the solar panels
we're able to redirect the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.630
sunlight in a way that we would
like them. Instead of heating

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.270
the house with the direct rays
we can redirect them. If you

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.470
stand in the doorway of the
front door you can actually see

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.430
all the way across. So it
creates a nice open area. We've

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.600
created a system called
"Chameleon" that we've built

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.870
from the ground up and we're
actually trying to get a patent

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.170
through the school and it
controls many of the operations

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.300
in the house including the
washer, dryer, dishwasher, the

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.230
window shades, and the windows
themselves. Back at school we

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.230
actually have a solar village.
We have our other three houses

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.730
from the 2002, 2005, and 2007
competition. And it will be

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.070
placed in there as soon as we
lay our foundation and we can go

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.500
in there and get data and
research that we need. After the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.830
2007 house we wanted to do a
little bit better architecture

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.300
than we did then and so we
joined with the University of

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.500
Missouri and their architecture
department and with the help of

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.970
them and the interior decorators
there. it's helped us understand

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.870
the architecture side better.
Everything is about clear

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.070
visions and making it seem
bigger than it actually is.
