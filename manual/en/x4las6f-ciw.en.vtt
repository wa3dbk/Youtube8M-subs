00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.580
Hi this is Karen for Expert Village now we're
going to toast our breads to put on top of

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:16.370
our onion soup. Set your oven to 375 on broil
place your breads on a baking sheet like this

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:22.239
and we're going to toast them until lightly
brown and then we'll flip them over and toast

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:30.210
them again. Okay when one side is toasted
nicely we'll just take it out flip it over

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.949
and we'll toast the other side and that bread.
And there's our toast you should have enough

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:43.960
toast for every serving that your going to
set up, and I'll put those there for now.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.010
We're going to set our crock right here that
we're putting our servings, now if you have

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.909
3 or 4 servings that you want to setup you'll
put them on a tray, it makes a it a lot easier

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:12.329
to get it in and out of the oven. So I'm just
doing one for today I'll get my soup

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:24.680
and there's our soup full of onions and just
scoop hot soup into the crock with a good

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.969
portion of onion and broth. And then you'll
take a slice of the toast and float that on

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:43.820
the top and then you sprinkle it with your
cheese like this, use as much or as little

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:52.859
as you want and now we'll place this whole
thing the whole tray into the oven, on broil

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:58.539
at 375 degrees until our cheese is melted
and lightly browned.
