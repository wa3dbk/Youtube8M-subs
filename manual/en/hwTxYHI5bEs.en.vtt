What's up guys. Lew here back with another video and this is the third installment in the new series

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:16.600
called, "Does it Suck?" And today I am excited to present to you a $40 Android Tablet

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.360
Settle it down Lew. I mentioned in it in a 3 Tech Deals video when I think it was around $35

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.360
And a bunch of you commented asking for further analysis so I ordered it, bought it, threw it into the cart on Amazon

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.720
to bring you this video and to find out what a $40 Android Tablet is exactly like.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:45.380
A cardboard box for the unboxing experience. Nothing too frilly here and inside a user manual...Oh

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.400
This might be fun. Thank you for your iRulu purchase. Welcome to your tablet. You have made a good decision

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.520
to use an iRulu product. *Laughs*

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.980
Alright!

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:08.100
Here is the tablet. Wrapped up pretty nicely. Little bubble wrap here and another sleeve. This one is orange

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.180
Woohoohoo!

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:17.280
Connecting my world. Good to know that it passed the quality control. QC1. TF card?

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:26.000
What the heck is that? That's gotta be SD/Micro SD. Anyway glue on here. Think there was some stickers there that have been peeled off

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.120
Okay, charging port which is DC 5V. Micro USB, microphone, rear facing camera, speaker,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.760
well placed serial number sticker, volume up and down.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.720
Satisfying click right there.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.160
Forward facing camera, power button, headphone jack. iRulu

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:51.460
Also in the box, charging cable. Not proprietary but really wish that was just micro usb though I don't know

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.700
Maybe you can charge this thing over micro usb. Maybe it's both. That's it, look at that, $40 later.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.020
Not getting power right now. Is there a screen protector on this?

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.860
The screen feels a little odd. Please charge using the supplied AC adapter. Bizarro charging. Okay so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.960
off camera I've plugged this in. I've got the cable going to a USB charger over here. Also I can't decide if

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.180
This has a screen protector pre installed or if I'm supposed to remove it. There's no tab.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.300
So it says that we're supposed to charge it for 10 hours for the initial charge. "Caution...

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.340
Please charge the battery fully when you use the unit for the first time and then you can charge for 7 hours

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.900
otherwise you may got problem with charging battery life"

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.260
You don't wanna got problem

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.660
You may got problem!

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.160
Okay so this thing's been charging for a little bit and I think it's gonna boot up now, at least I hope so

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.640
*piano music from tablet*

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:20.740
Damn...That's emotional right there. Wow I can barely see the screen right now. What? Oh man this screen is

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080
*laughs*

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.220
Come on. There's gotta be more brightness here. That's full brightness.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:37.200
The reflection is so intense-I mean-you guys can't even-I can barely even see the icons in this lighting

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:45.480
Can you see? Oh my god it's faint! I have a feeling this is only gonna get better. Well that's quicker than I expected

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:53.660
Trying to playback a video here. Weird aspect ratio. The fullscreen doesn't quite fill the frame

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.020
there's black bars on each side. So it's 1020 x 600 resolution. Wow...listen I know I sound like a jerk right

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.440
now. It might seem weird but I feel like my expectations were higher for this.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.800
Okay so we have a .3 megapixel camera on the front. Let's flip around to that. Whoohohoo.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.520
It kinda looks like I'm under water. Here we go

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:28.360
Oh yeah. Now I'm gonna flip it back around. It's having so much trouble determining what the hell's going on here.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.240
Quite washed out. Having just looked at a very inexpensive Android phone. This thing feels incredibly unpolished

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.840
There you can see my fingers in the back of the display. The display is terrible

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:52.880
The construction feels sort of like a toy. So for some reason it has right in the tray here: two different

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.740
sound toggles. Doesn't have stereo speakers. That's bizarre. I really game

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.560
"Different game collections satisfy different players. You can find a friend and your interest"

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.240
"Get Start." Okay probably not going to sign up for that. I can't see why you would want to buy this

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.500
I don't know who needs this. So straight up night-I'm gonna have nightmares about this screen

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.720
Does it suck?

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.540
It sucks. It sucks. This--it sucks

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.560
I believe there is something out there for not too much more. I'm gonna go searching for it on an upcoming

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.900
episode of Does it Suck so stay tuned for that but this one sucks. Stay away

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.160
Does have micro SD card expansion though

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.220
Alright that's it. That's all I can say about this. Thank you very much for watching. If you guys enjoyed this new

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.540

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.240

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.240
Whoohoohoo
