00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:06.284
What Destroys Your Smash (3) Taking it above your head (The highest point)

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:13.819
I know many players are trying to hit

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:19.682
their smash at the highest point

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:22.734
and because of that

00:00:23.803 --> 00:00:27.069
their power is lost 30-40 percent

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:31.985
their control, direction becomes poor

00:00:33.095 --> 00:00:36.418
ok this what the players are trying to do

00:00:37.546 --> 00:00:38.900
ok they have been told

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:40.826
they have been heard

00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:46.541
the shuttlecock must be hit at the highest point

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:49.296
the highest point to me

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.355
for smash is here

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:52.552
here

00:00:56.685 --> 00:00:58.469
please watch my hitting action

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.681
so I am trying to hit the highest point

00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:11.153
so my power goes up

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.655
please remember I am not hitting shuttlecock

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:17.957
to the ceiling

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.721
where am I hitting the shuttlecock

00:01:20.721 --> 00:01:24.162
I am hitting the shuttlecock to forward

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:35.045
so accurately the impact point must be in front of my body

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:43.114
so my arm must not be stretched vertically upwards

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:50.154
my arm must be stretched forward

00:01:51.546 --> 00:01:52.362
that way

00:01:52.726 --> 00:01:54.410
not that way

00:01:57.694 --> 00:01:59.032
watch with shuttlecock

00:01:59.801 --> 00:02:04.779
I am trying to hit shuttlecock at the highest point

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:18.482
so my power goes that way

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:21.902
there are many problems

00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:23.062
number 1

00:02:23.808 --> 00:02:26.897
I lose power because my arm moves up

00:02:27.872 --> 00:02:30.981
my eyes has to go up so I lose vision

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:34.349
after I hit like that

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.423
my weight is center

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.649
so I lose recovery

00:02:39.964 --> 00:02:43.279
my ready for the next shot is slow

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:45.173
because I hit like this

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:51.231
now compare

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.009
so same

00:02:53.376 --> 00:02:53.840
same

00:02:55.297 --> 00:02:56.418
it should be there

00:02:59.716 --> 00:03:00.232
there

00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.901
I have to move

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.537
impact point should be

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.676
there

00:03:11.063 --> 00:03:11.476
not

00:03:12.648 --> 00:03:13.085
there

00:03:15.268 --> 00:03:16.387
so the players

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:19.469
the beginners

00:03:20.403 --> 00:03:22.387
newly coming to badminton

00:03:24.217 --> 00:03:26.639
and some advanced player in the club

00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:28.850
telling them

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.956
you must take shuttlecock highest as you can

00:03:33.998 --> 00:03:35.174
so they heard that

00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:38.205
with out thinking of course

00:03:39.055 --> 00:03:39.960
they cannot

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.359
because they are beginners

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:42.840
they have no idea

00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:45.797
so they just try to hit like this

00:03:46.248 --> 00:03:47.118
they look high

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.261
and they go up like this

00:03:51.206 --> 00:03:56.842
and I met many players like that

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:59.953
and their smash, clear, dropshot

00:03:59.953 --> 00:04:00.915
all of them

00:04:02.094 --> 00:04:03.809
completely ruined

00:04:04.938 --> 00:04:10.250
impact point must be in front of my body

00:04:11.002 --> 00:04:13.662
not above my head

00:04:14.127 --> 00:04:15.004
not there

00:04:16.221 --> 00:04:18.505
it has to be there

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.465
