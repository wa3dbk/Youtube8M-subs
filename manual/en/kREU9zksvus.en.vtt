00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.930
Okay, now we are going to learn notes on our
A string. The A string is the fifth string

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:15.480
up. One, two, three, four, five. This is the
open A. If you do it with your pick, you want

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.130
to pick the string that's second from the
top (A). We're going to have the same fingering

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.050
that we had for the D string on the A string.
A, then our second finger plays the note B.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:39.790
Our third finger plays the note C. (sings
out the notes he is playing). Now this can

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.960
be difficult because the A string is pretty
high up. Look how much I'm bending my wrist.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.420
I'm keeping my thumb in the same place. I
really have my hands almost on top of the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:02.010
fret board. A, B, C, B, A. To read these in
musical notation, our open A is two ledger

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.649
lines down. These are called ledger lines,
because they are added extra lines. When we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:13.009
get out of this range we have to use these.
So, think two ledger lines down for A, below

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.749
the first extra ledger line for B, on that
extra ledger line for C. We have the octave

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:28.259
open A, and this octave on the second part
of the G string (that A). We have the octave

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:37.799
of B (on the A string second fret) and open
B. We have the octave of C on the first fret

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:53.259
of the B string C. So they sound like this
(singing the notes and playing). So, don't

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.219
get those confused when you're reading the
notes. Remember that if they are below that

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.489
line for the A string, they're going to be
on this low A.
