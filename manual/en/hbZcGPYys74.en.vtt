00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:05.370
Today on our 2014 Chevrolet Silverado 2500
Series Crew Cab, well be test fitting the

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.670
CIPA Custom Towing Mirror for the passenger
side, part number 10902.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.880
This is also available for the driver side,
with part number 10901.Right here inside the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.890
mirror are the different parts it comes with.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.021
It has a wedge, which is going to be helped
in the securing process of securing it to

00:00:23.021 --> 00:00:24.021
our mirror.

00:00:24.021 --> 00:00:27.679
We have the screw, and then we have two pieces
of foam tape.

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.900
This is what I wanted to go over real quick
with you, because for our video demonstration

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.739
today, we wont actually be installing the
foam tape, but I did want to show you where

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.149
it went.The piece of foam tape that has just
a straight rectangular edge on it, is going

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.640
to go inside the mirror along the guidelines.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.090
On the inside of the guidelines, it says Foam
Tape, so that would simply you would peel

00:00:48.090 --> 00:01:12.570
off the adhesive and you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:33.469
would 
put 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:48.350
it 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:02:09.060
right there.
