Hitherto the role of Sith rituals had been to give rise to the excessive, yet regulated manifestation of power;

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.010
 it was a spectacular expression of potency, an ‘expenditure’, exaggerated and coded, in which power renewed its vigour.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.560
 It always was more or less related to triumph....

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.270
 Discipline, however, had its own type of ceremony.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.480
 It was not the triumph, but the review, the ‘parade’, an ostentatious form of the examination.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:56.810
 In it the ‘subjects’ were presented as ‘objects’ to the observation of a power that was manifested only by its gaze.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.260
What was then being formed was a policy of coercions that act upon the body,

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.860
a calculated manipulation of its elements, its gestures, its behaviour.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.860
The apprentice’s body was entering a machinery of power that explores it, breaks it down and rearranges it.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.150
A ‘political anatomy’, which was also a ‘mechanics of power’,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.910
was being born; it defined how one may have a hold over others’ bodies,

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:31.720
not only so that they may do what one wishes, but so that they may operate as one wishes,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.680
with the techniques, the speed and the efficiency that one determines.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:46.290
Thus discipline produces subjected and practiced bodies, ‘docile’ bodies.
