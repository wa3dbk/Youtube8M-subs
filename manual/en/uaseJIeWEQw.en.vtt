00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.260
bjbjLULU Part 1- I will start this drawing
by taking a second to look at my reference

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.020
photograph on the left.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.250
I try to see the mouth as one big shape first
and I try to match that shape as best as I

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.320
can to start.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.590
Next, I break the mouth in to three smaller
shapes.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.039
I notice that the top lip looks like a flattened
McDonalds Arch and the bottom lip looks similar

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.009
to a crescent moon shape.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.310
The area in between is more complex but that
is ok since I can create that shape by noticing

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.199
the nuances of upper and lower lip.

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.690
Part 2- Take a second to notice that the lower
lip is slightly fuller than the top lip.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.210
This is true for every person.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.910
Once I am somewhat satisfied with the upper
and lower lip, I start to notice the space

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.400
between the lips.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.449
That space is divided between the upper teeth
and the negative space below the teeth.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.420
Please notice that when a person smiles, the
bottom lip comes up and blocks the lower set

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.570
of teeth.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.489
Many people make the mistake of drawing the
upper and lower teeth in a smile.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.910
While drawing the teeth, I am very careful
about not pressing too hard.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.510
Notice that there are NO dark tones, separating
the teeth, only light to medium ones.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.240
The front of our face is rounded and the formations
of the upper and lower sets of teeth are in

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.450
a horseshoe shape.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.000
When drawing a person from the front, notice
that as the teeth go further back towards

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.440
the throat, they become more foreshortened.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.710
Also, as the teeth go back towards the throat,
they are blocked more in a smile by the lips

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.310
and are more shadowed.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.610
Be careful because this can easily be overdone.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.910
The color of the teeth are not white, they
are bone colored, which is a cool off white.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.960
It is a conscious choice for me to start this
drawing with color pencil.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.250
I use color pencil because the fine tip of
the color pencil gives me a lot of accuracy,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.890
and also because, color pencils can be mixed
with oil paint.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.260
You will see me mix color pencil with oil
paint in step four.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:12.689
Part 3- At this point I am satisfied with
the placement of all of my shapes.

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.270
Once that task is accomplished, I focus on
building tones and colors.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.799
In other words, my focus to this point has
been to get all of the pieces of the puzzle

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:27.900
in to the right place and now, I can have
fun by mixing colors and matching tones.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.819
I try to also notice the qualities of the
edges of shapes.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.300
For instance, there is a fuzzy, unclear edge
between the upper lip and the gums above the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.569
teeth.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.540
It is there but it is hard to see.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.180
In contrast, there is a solid, distinct edge
between the upper teeth and the darker area

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.150
of negative space, below the teeth.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.530
Color pencil is a great medium for a contemporary
artist to learn.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.450
I greatly value the accuracy and detail work
that can be achieved with color pencils.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.340
The flaws to this medium is that color pencil
cannot be layered as well as paint, since

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.340
it doesn't fully dry.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.629
Its biggest strength is also a big weakness.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.299
The fine tip of the color pencil, covers surfaces
at an extremely slow rate.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.849
Both weaknesses can be fixed however.

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.030
I found that if you dip a paintbrush in a
painting medium called Liquin and start to

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.420
paint, the color pencils essentially pick
up the properties of oil paint.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:35.239
In the next step, I will use liquin and mix
it with both the oil paint atop of the color

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.099
pencil.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:50.440
Part 4- Now I am painting with Liquin and
oil paint over the color pencil.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.439
They are very compatible with each other and
are essentially made with the same materials.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.590
The pigment of the color pencil is bound with
wax; and wax has been used in parts of many

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.769
painting mediums throughout the history of
oil painting.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.829
Oil paint is considered a traditional medium
but many of its artistic capabilities have

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.279
not yet been matched by other, newer mediums.

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.920
Oil paint gives to the ability to work opaque,
transparently and translucently.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.791
Today, I am using the combination of the oil
paint and the liquin to soften my color pencil

00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:26.510
drawing below.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.890
I am using small soft paintbrushes and they
pick up some of the color that was left below.

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.640
The paintbrush is a great tool to create soft
blends.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:53.320
That makes perfect sense if you compare it
to the tip of a color pencil 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.790
