00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:16.885
Hi, everyone!  My name is Tina and

00:00:16.885 --> 00:00:19.702
for today's holiday inspired hair tutorial

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:21.172
I'm going to show you how to do a

00:00:21.172 --> 00:00:24.944
romantic French twist rope braid updo for long hair.

00:00:24.944 --> 00:00:26.840
Before I even start, I'm going to apply

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.356
some hair wax to my hair because I have a lot of layers

00:00:30.356 --> 00:00:35.925
and I'll be applying this throughout the whole tutorial.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.356
After parting your hair, take a small section at the top

00:00:48.356 --> 00:00:52.032
and split it in half.

00:00:52.032 --> 00:00:55.109
Then start twisting them each separately "Counter-Clockwise" before

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.559
combining them together to twist them together "Clockwise"

00:01:04.626 --> 00:01:06.739
After the first initial twist, start

00:01:06.739 --> 00:01:09.924
adding hair from the sides to the 2 sections

00:01:09.924 --> 00:01:12.530
before twisting them together.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:23.621
As in, adding some hair from the Left to the Left section, before twisting it Counter-Clockwise.

00:01:30.142 --> 00:01:37.828
Add in some hair from the Right to the Right section, before twisting it in "Counter-Clockwise"

00:01:37.828 --> 00:01:41.372
Then, combine these 2 pieces to twist  them "Clockwise"

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:47.289
And this is all you really do until the very end.

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:18.593
And then do exactly the same thing on the other side.

00:03:18.593 --> 00:03:21.138
When both sides have been French Rope braided,

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:29.775
you're simply going to stack it in the back, and pin it up, and free-style it.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.692
Twist the pearls together...

00:04:47.692 --> 00:04:51.335
- by the way, I bought this from eBay for about 3 bucks -

00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:56.558
and then just, stick in a couple of hair pins before you attach it to your hair.

00:04:56.558 --> 00:05:02.151
This is very inexpensive way to decorate your hair for the holidays or for a formal occasion.

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:06.607
And as usual, I'm going to list all the products used today in the description box.

00:05:06.607 --> 00:05:08.134
