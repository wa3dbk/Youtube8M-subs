JESSICA MUNOZ: My name is
Jessica Munoz, I am from

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.410
northern New Jersey.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.050
I'm a makeup artist. it's hard
meeting someone when you live

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.080
home with your mother.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.540
I don't have anywhere to put my
stuff, so maybe I can use

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.250
your closet upstairs.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.780
She's always like, you are so
disorganized, you don't have

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.860
any shoes in the right place,
clothes in the right.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.060
I tell her all the time, I don't
have any space, mom.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.245
What do you want me to do?

00:00:29.245 --> 00:00:33.456
I am the youngest one, but at
the same time I think she's

00:00:33.456 --> 00:00:35.290
ready to give me the boot
and say hey, you've got

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.350
to get out of here.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.765
I'm Jessica Munoz, I'm 29 years
old, and I live at home

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.015
with my mom.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.090
I have been here about
six years.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.520
Just about six years.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.190
I am a freelance
makeup artist.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.670
I have been freelancing for
about four years now.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.620
I used to work for MAC
Cosmetics, and

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.670
then I lost my job.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.520
So economy wasn't doing well, I
wasn't doing well, so my mom

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.700
said, why don't you
come back home?

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.030
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.270
JESSICA MUNOZ: So I work at a
lot of different salons, and I

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.010
also work out of my
house as well.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.400
I've pretty much taken
over the basement.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.330
The basement is like,
all mine.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.820
I have my room down
there, I have my

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.450
makeup area down there.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.750
I have a closet that's stuffed
with winter clothes, and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.580
summer clothes, and
spring clothes.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.900
All type of clothes.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.180
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590
JESSICA MUNOZ: So you come
immediately down the stairs,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.010
and the first thing you see is
a huge couch full of clothes,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.880
because I have nowhere
to put my clothes.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.520
And then I have my chair set up,
where some of my clients

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.000
used to come in when I had
it kind of nice and neat.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.900
I have a mirror set up
right in the front.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.460
And then you walk like, two
steps, and then my room is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.710
like, literally right there.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.880
So it's not as professional as
what I would like it to be.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.040
OLGA CARDENAS: Oh,
that's terrible.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.930
I can't go downstairs,
because I can't walk.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.670
JESSICA MUNOZ: And I have shoes
all over the floor,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.705
because I have nowhere
to put my shoes.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:12.350
OLGA CARDENAS: A lot of
shoes are everywhere.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.985
Clothes for everywhere.

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:17.350
That's terrible.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.260
JESSICA MUNOZ: Everything
is full of my stuff.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.420
And I need to help organizing,
fixing it,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.340
making it look nice.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.690
OLGA CARDENAS: Just messes.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.860
She's disorganized.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.080
You know, that's terrible
with her.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.760
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.350
JESSICA MUNOZ: If my basement
downstairs was nice and put

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.980
together, and the way I would
like it, I feel like it will

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.430
motivate me to do more, and
to bring more clients in.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.260
And to do more for myself as
far as a makeup artist,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.910
because I work off
of inspiration.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.660
I need to wake up in the morning
and be inspired, and

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.784
that is what's gonna take
me to the next level.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.510
OLGA CARDENAS: That's
terrible.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.322
TRACY METRO: Hey, I'm Tracy
Metro, the designer on I Live

00:03:20.322 --> 00:03:22.470
With My Mom, right
here on Spaces.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.230

channel, because the way this

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.830
one turns out is amazing.
