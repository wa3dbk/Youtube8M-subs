00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
"Doctors' Nutritional Ignorance"

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.050
The World Health Organization
blames literally millions of deaths

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.820
every year on inadequate
fruit and vegetable intake.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.759
Almost as deadly as smoking.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.630
So if we care enough about
ourselves and our families

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.850
to not want to die
a horrific death from smoking,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.330
we should put the same effort
into eating more fruits and vegetables.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.200
We should eat fruits and vegetables
as if our lives depended on it,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.780
because in a way they do.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.860
Why haven’t many
of us heard

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.109
of this change from
5 A Day to 9 A Day?

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.460
Well, the Federal Government
spends about $10 million a year

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.649
to educate people
about healthy eating.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.850
Candy corporations spend
about twice that amount

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.500
just launching
a new candy bar.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.960
Okay, but why don’t most doctors
pass this information along?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.620
Because, odds are, your doctor
never learned any of this.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.260
Less than a quarter
of medical schools

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.600
have even a single
dedicated course on nutrition,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.829
and less than six percent
of graduating physicians

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:13.930
may have received
any formal nutrition training.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.800
Out of thousands of hours
of pre-clinical instruction,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.299
your doctor may have gotten an average
of three hours of nutrition training.

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.810
There was even
a study published in

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.620
The American Journal
of Clinical Nutrition

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.620
that pitted doctors versus patients
in a head-to-head test

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.960
of basic nutrition knowledge—
simple true or false questions.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.480
Guess who won?
The patients.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.700
People off the street knew more
about nutrition than their doctors,

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.950
yet people still ask their doctors
for nutrition advice.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.560
What doctors may be telling their
patients to eat may be killing them.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.500
It wasn’t too long ago
that doctors were advising

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.439
pregnant women to smoke cigarettes
to help with morning sickness.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.759
Until doctors are taught
more about nutrition,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.500
their advising us about diet
may be physician-assisted suicide.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.620
There is one doctor though,
everyone trusts.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.620
Perhaps the most famous
physician of all time:

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.599
Dr. Benjamin Spock.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.760
Always on the forefront
of important social issues.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.760
And in the final edition of his book,
the bestselling book in American history

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.989
(second only to the Bible),

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:39.849
he recommended that all children be
raised on meat- and dairy-free diets

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.319
to prevent diseases like cancer.
