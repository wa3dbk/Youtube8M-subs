Joe Hickerson, grindog.com. Today we're going
to learn how to draw bubble letters. The first

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:11.410
thing you want to do is you want to exchange
your straight lines for bubbles. So if you

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:20.590
draw an A for instance, you want to come back
and draw a lips or circular bubble shapes

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.119
where your straight lines are. Now you notice
I'm drawing in pencil here. I draw in pencil

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:35.489
very lightly so I can come back after I pick
the lines that I want and erase my construction

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.270
lines. Okay. So there's an A, B, C; if you
have a curve like this, maybe break it into

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.821
segments, like that. Okay. We'll start with
four letters. The D, will have a little bit

00:00:51.821 --> 00:01:01.410
of both. Alright. There's your bubble letters.
Now I come back with my marker or darker colored

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.120
pencil and just pick the lines on these bubble
letters that I want. Here's, for instance

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:20.390
just the outside edge and on the inside, I
like to accentuate the curves a little bit.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:53.600
Okay. Same thing on the B; I come in. Alright;
C, D. Okay. Now if I'm done, what I wanted

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.220
to do; I'm drawing very lightly on my construction
base, it should be very easy to come back

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.880
and erase these construction lines and see
what I've ended up for. And once you get rid

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:20.150
of these construction lines, you can come
back with your colors or with your shading

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.550
and make them look even more bubbly. For instance
we'll start on the A and I'll just use a pencil

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:37.270
for shading and I might come in and round
it out even more. And you do that, but maybe

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:45.150
shading just one side of this bubble letter.
Don't try to shade the whole thing. Okay,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.650
maybe just shade the bottom side. Alright.
I accentuate where the little bubbles come

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.450
together. Okay. Alright. You might even put
a little reflection on it. If you really want

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.310
to have fun and you want to make a balloon
out of it, put a little circle down here and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:10.450
a, and maybe a balloon line flying off and
same thing on the B and all the other letters.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.440
You just want to make them look more rounded
and to round these things off, you need to

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:23.940
shadow one side and maybe give it a little
reflection. Okay. See how my trends running

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.390
here? That's pretty much what you want to
do with all your letters. And that's how you

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.170
draw a bubble letters.
