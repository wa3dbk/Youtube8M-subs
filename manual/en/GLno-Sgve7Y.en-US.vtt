Computer, open communication channel.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.720
Script and Director: Anna „Annie" Štefánková: 
Director's log.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.840
Today, we started our project on Startovac.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.000
Goal of our mission: Support of production of a new fan film inspired by sci-fi series Star Trek.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.400
Star Trek: Secret Games is part of a bigger project „Between the Lines"

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.760
which follows from the very first Czech Star Trek fan film „The Metren Incident".

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.640
We already have the script, costumes for majority of the actors, and the most important prothetics.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.360
The first shooting begun in March 2013 and continues since.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.200
Compared to our first film The Metren Incident, we would like to improve not only video and audio,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.400
but also masks and special effects.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.280
That is why we would like to use ask your via www.startovac.cz

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.520
for support of fan film Star Trek: Secret Games.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.400
Camera and Cut: Radek „Flash" Bělina: 
Light and film are very closely interconnected.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.760
Sufficient supply of light makes it easier to separate actors from green screen

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.280
and ensures natural and smooth lightning.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.600
That is why we bought special fluorescent tubes for photographers

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.320
and economical metal-halogen reflectors

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.320
originally used for billboard lighting.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.040
We use equivalent of 7kW halogen bulbs.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.200
We use the most recent advances in amateur and semi-professional filming

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.680
-- digital SLR with changeable lenses.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.680
From each shooting weekend we come back with approx. 140GB of raw data.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.160
We built filming equipment which would be otherwise too expensive for amateur filming

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.120
like camera crane and camera slider called Dolly

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.400
Sound: Zbyněk Suchý: 
Compared to The Metren incident,

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.600
we do not record with cheap microphones attached to a broomstick.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.560
We use professional condenser mikes, miniature wireless mikes with bodypacks

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.840
and we record the sound into four tracks.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.640
Recently we started shooting with highly directional mike a.k.a. shotgun

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.640
and we would like to buy second shotgun to the set.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.240
Prothetics and props: Karel „Margh" Škop: 
For extra terrestrials, it is necessary to create prothetics.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.960
In the Metren Incident, you could see for ex. Trill, Bajoran, or Vulcans.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.280
For our new film we decided to push the limits and create more complex aliens.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.200
From painted dots and Vulcan ears

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.040
we advanced to latex prothetics for Andorians, Denobulans or Bolians.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.600
We created forms for Bajoran nose, Romulan foreheads or various cuts and burns.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:41.120
With your help, we would like to progress and create more complex, for example full face masks.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.600
3D effects: Martin „Samuel" Böhm: 
Special effects are the spice of every proper sci-fi film.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.480
For Star Trek: Secret Games we want only the best.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.400
It has been 5 years since production of Metren Incident

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.120
and therefore higher resolution, better 3D models, and higher quality textures are necessary.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.040
All this brings along increased demands on technology.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.640
This is why we turn to you.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.200
With your support, we can acquire better equipment for the film and make it stand out.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.440
Logic dictates the target to be set to 47 047 CZK.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.920
It will help us to cover part of the costs incurred up to now.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.440
If we exceed this magical Star Trek number,  we will use the money for better masks,

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.360
more sophisticated costumes and for postproduction and special effects.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.920
Captain Talisa Ren: Jana „Xyll" Krčmářová: 
If you find our project interesting

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.760
we would greatly appreciate, if you would support us with Latinium rod or Earth currency.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.600
As a thank you, we prepared thematic rewards for you to chose from.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.000
Thanks to you, we will be able to boldly go on a new filming mission,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.240
from which no fan has come back yet...
