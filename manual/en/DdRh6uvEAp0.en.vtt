00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.300
Hey guys,
Chef Mark here.

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.133
Today we're gonna make
a braised veal shank.

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.833
Use the same recipe with pork shank,
if you feel like.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.367
Today we're gonna
use the veal.

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:10.800
We've got a bone in here
on both of them,

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.933
some meat around the outside,
good flavorful broth in there.

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.067
It's gonna make this
very nice and tender in the end.

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:18.800
The next thing
that I need to get for this braise

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.200
is gonna be
some herbs for it.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.500
So I'm gonna grab
some sage and some rosemary.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.600
I've got the large ones--
they come in the smaller packs,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.867
which is really nice
and convenient.

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:29.333
But these will add a lot
of depth of flavor to the dish,

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:31.400
and they hold up
to a longer cooking time.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.767
Next thing I'm gonna grab for the dish
is our pan-searing flour here.

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:37.167
The reason why I'm gonna have you
grab the pan-searing flour;

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:40.433
because it's ground in such a way
so that it allows the protein

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:43.767
to shine through when you caramelize it,
but it'll still give us a nice crust.

00:00:43.767 --> 00:00:45.767
It also has a little bit
of salt and white pepper to it,

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:48.733
so great
for seasoning.

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.767
All right, so let's
put these shanks together.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:54.233
First thing I did is, yesterday--
I planned ahead, bought all my stuff,

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:56.500
and I went home
and I took my shanks out,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.333
put 'em on a plate, season 'em
with salt and pepper ahead of time.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.067
What this does is it draws in
a little bit more flavor for it

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:04.133
so it's a little bit
deeper in flavor in the end.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.833
So I'm at that point now, so what
you're gonna do before you cook them

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:11.600
is just come by, if there's any
excess moisture that's on the outside,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.733
we're simply patting that dry
and bringing that up

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.967
so it sears nice and dry
in the pan.

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:18.000
I turn my pan on.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.333
We're at about
a medium-high heat or so.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm gonna put in a tablespoon
of our Extra Virgin Olive Oil.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.333
I'm gonna wait for that
to faintly smoke.

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:30.133
I've got a pretty strong flame here,
so I'm gonna bring it up quick

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.233
and go right down
to medium-high.

00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:34.300
And then what we're gonna do
is come in,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.033
and I've got my pan-searing flour,
and we're gonna dust the outside of it.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:41.167
I caution you not to put a lot
of pan-searing flour on the outside,

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.200
just a small amount,
'cause what we want to do

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.100
is accentuate the flavor of the meat
as opposed to browning the flour.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.967
The flour helps to get
a little bit of a crust on the outside,

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:53.300
but we don't need
a ton of it.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.567
It's not necessarily meant
to thicken this dish in particular.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:01:59.267
So a little bit on the outside.

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:01.467
Just dust it lightly.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:02.933
And that's gonna allow
that flavor of that meat

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:05.200
to shine through
once we go to sear it.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.133
So a little bit smoky.

00:02:07.133 --> 00:02:08.467
I'm gonna place that inside

00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:10.233
and I'm gonna
brown this on the bottom

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:13.333
until it browns about a quarter
of the way up the sides or so.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.333
Really what I'm looking for
is a really nice, golden brown,

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:17.733
deep, rich
flavor out of it.

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.100
So we'll let it sear.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.333
All right, so these have seared
beautifully on both sides.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.167
We're gonna
take those out.

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:28.400
As you can see, we've got a great color
on these, and that's, in the end,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.367
gonna give us
a lot more flavor.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:32.133
So don't rob yourself
of all that flavor.

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:34.467
Make sure you've really
browned those nice.

00:02:34.467 --> 00:02:38.100
So we're gonna take now
a tablespoon of garlic cloves,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.800
which have already
been chopped.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.700
And I've got a full package
of our mirepoix.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.733
This is that carrots,
onion, celery.

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:46.600
It's gonna give a good
vegetal taste to the dish in the end.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.533
Next we're gonna take
two cups of white wine.

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.233
We're gonna
add all that in,

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.267
and we're gonna
bring it back to a simmer,

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:57.033
and then we're gonna let it go
for about 10-12 minutes

00:02:57.033 --> 00:03:01.433
until that reduces
in volume by half.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:03.133
Now that we have
our white wine reduced

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:06.033
and we've got that nice,
herbaceous smell to it--

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:07.167
and that's what
we're doing here.

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:09.533
We're trying to build a base
so that we're gonna cook our shanks

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.600
in that it's gonna
absorb all that flavor.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.433
So if we have seasoned here,
the inside of our shanks

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:16.067
are gonna taste
seasoned in the end.

00:03:16.067 --> 00:03:22.133
So I'm gonna take a 28-ounce can
of coarse ground tomatoes.

00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:25.100
I'm gonna put in our shanks
back on the inside.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.233
We're gonna turn it up
and a little bit,

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.333
and we're gonna bring this
back to a simmer.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.100
We're gonna season
the liquid a little bit

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.300
because I just added tomatoes
that don't have any seasoning in it.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.867
So a little bit
of salt and pepper.

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:41.567
Bring this back to a simmer
and make sure all of your liquid

00:03:41.567 --> 00:03:44.900
is nice and even, the white wine
is mixed with the tomatoes,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.433
mirepoix is mixed
around nice and even.

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.133
Then we go
on with a lid,

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:52.167
and we're gonna go in the oven
for two hours with this.

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:54.000
We're gonna
go right at 350,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.467
we're gonna add a little bit of herbs
later in the cooking process,

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:59.267
but right now,
we're gonna go into the oven.

00:04:02.167 --> 00:04:03.333
So it's been
two hours.

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:05.700
We're gonna pull our shanks
out of the oven.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.300
Just take the lid off,
and you're gonna notice

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.667
that these are really nice
and gorgeous brown in there.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.533
The liquid's reduced a little bit,
it's nice and caramelized in there,

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.067
but to add a little bit more
depth of flavor to this,

00:04:16.067 --> 00:04:20.000
we're gonna add in a tablespoon
of chopped rosemary,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.067
and a tablespoon
of chopped sage.

00:04:23.067 --> 00:04:27.700
I'm gonna mix that in
to the tomato sauce,

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.167
and then we're gonna go back
in the oven for about 15 minutes.

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:33.133
This time we're gonna
leave the lid off

00:04:33.133 --> 00:04:35.133
so we caramelize
a little bit more of the top,

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:39.600
and some of that rosemary and sage
start to really permeate the sauce.

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:45.400
So we're back with our shanks here:
15 minutes in the oven,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.833
and these things
are absolutely gorgeous.

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:50.867
The tops have caramelized
a good bit more,

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:53.033
and each one of these
is completely falling apart.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:56.167
You see I'm having a little difficulty
putting these on the plate,

00:04:56.167 --> 00:05:00.667
but I'm happy about that because
these things are super nice and tender.

00:05:00.667 --> 00:05:02.567
And to serve these,
I'm just gonna go on a plate

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.800
like this with a little bit
of the sauce.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.200
But I might take that sauce and mix it up
with a little bit of pasta.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.467
One of the artisan pastas
would be great.

00:05:12.467 --> 00:05:15.767
I might mix it in here and toss it
for the last minute of cooking,

00:05:15.767 --> 00:05:19.467
but this is one
definitely not to miss.
