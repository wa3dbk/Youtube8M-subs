AMANDA CLAIRE: All right, so now's the scary
part we're going to open up a jar of the ink,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.940
the fabric screen printing ink. And it is
ink which means it's messy, it stains, it's

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.879
supposed to be permanent on fabric so therefore
if you get it on your clothes it's not that

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.900
easy to get out. And similar to the glue we
used, you know, it's a water soluble ink when

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.509
it's wet but once it dries, forget about it,
you're done. And so there's a couple of things

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.439
that that means, it means that you know, while
it's wet you can work with it you can push

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.000
it around you know, it's not like using spray
paint that like when once it's down it's down.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.660
I mean you can--there's a little bit of wiggle
room there but one important thing is that,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.290
you know while you're screening shirts you
don't want the ink to dry in the part of the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.570
screen that you know that you're printing
through, right? That is you don't want the

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.120
ink to dry within those little pores that
you're printing 'cause once it does it just

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.440
won't print well anymore. So part of the strategy
is, is to always keep only wet ink within

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.102
that--within the image. So, for example, before
we print the first thing we're going to do

00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:07.200
is you know open up our ink, we're going to
put it on the screen, I'll show you how that's

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.140
done. And then just right away we're just
going to go ahead and probably pull one across

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.910
and just get some ink in that screen and then
before we print another one we just want to

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.530
probably put some ink on them again right
away. Maybe with the screen off of the shirt

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.310
so we're not printing on anything at that
moment but my only point is you want--you

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.220
really don't want the ink in the image to
dry out if you're going to continue to print

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:37.700
because once it does it really--you won't
be able to force further ink through those

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.030
holes if you have ink drying into it. So all
right, I'm going to--I have my jar of ink

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.540
open it's really kind of goopy, sloppy stuff.
I mean, it's not like the kinda ink you would

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.060
use with the quill pen. I mean, it does kinda
look like a real goopy paint. okay. And remember

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.940
be careful with this 'cause it'll just--I
mean it's a messy stuff so I'm going to--in

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.031
the next clip I'm going to put some of these
on the screen and we'll try and pull a print.
