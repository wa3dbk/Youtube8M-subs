00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.569
There are lots of choices when it comes to activities in cottage country

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.549
For some it's a round of golf

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.440
For others it's horseshoes and beer

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.139
Sorry!

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.300
What if you could combine all those activities into one

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.900
Well there's a new game taking cottage country by storm and it's called Bola or ladder toss

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.560
simple to learn easy to
build

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.960
Basically this is a really simple build

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.820
we're going to build two legs connect it
with dowel to form a free-standing structure

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.180
and for that we're gonna need two two
by four by eight and six feet of one inch dowel

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.540
Here's our cutting list. Out of each two by four you're going to cut a three foot six piece

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.950
two two foot pieces and two three inch pieces

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.240
basically we're gonna build a sandwich
spacers are on either side of the leg

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.070
to give it stability but we'll only screw the spacer to the foot

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.670
but not the leg to the foot, so later we can pull out the ladder assembly for storage

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.600
I'm going to drill four countersink holes

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.020
and I got my spacers already predrilled 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.630
off-centred so that it doesn't conflict
with my other foot

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.990
and I'm going to glue and screw them in place and use only outdoor wood glue

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.960
Now we're going to put the other foot on

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.420
Got about seven and a quarter there, so the other one will have seven and a quarter as well

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.620
There's our first leg...now we'll simply repeat for the second

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.400
We need to lay out the one inch holes for the dowel and then space them a foot apart

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.060
Three in total...I'm gonna use the top of the forstner bit as a reference for the depth of the hole

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.100
Finished the holes let's cut the dowel

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.080
We're going to need to drill clearance holes in the legs

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.159
Let's add a little outdoor glue and when I put these together

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.059
I will drill pilot holes in the dowel

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.680
Alright!

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.940
that's done

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.640
This is how it's going to go together

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.600
Have some glue to clean up

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.320
And then we're on to the balls!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.470
Each bola consists of two golf balls and fourteen inches of polypropylene line

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.670
in order to make cutting the
polypropylene line a breeze I make

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.880
two marks on my table fourteen inches apart and then I can simply cut them 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.970
with the ropes cut we need to dress the ends a little so they'll go into the hole in the golf ball

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.860
The next thing we need to do is mark the drill bit

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.290
and we want it about halfway through the
golf ball about three-quarters of an inch

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.200
I actually stole these golf balls from my brother-in-law's bag don't tell 'em

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.040
fill the whole with hot glue...well not quite full

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.360
Insert end of said rope...and we all know what hot glue feels like on the fingers

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.840
Completed bola. We need five more like this

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.940
Time to have some fun

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.760
How hard can this be?

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.840
This is a really easy build and a fun game

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.060
But I need a lot more practice

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.660
There's no question that I'm the better
golfer but I'm the better 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.140
almost everything when it comes to Kevin
and I so

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.860
There's strike one!

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.720
Not bad!

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.720
She's done buddy

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.440
I nailed my drive it was straight as an arrow right down the fairway
