Hi.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.220
I’m the YouTube Deal Guy, Matt Granite.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.979
Every day I find a different huge deal to
save you money.

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:09.290
None of these are paid products.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.740
I never care what you buy but I do want to
save you money.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.190
Before we get to a flower pot that will charge
your smartphone, yesterday I featured these

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.619
photo canvases that were a one day only deal.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.320
I think it’s still going strong.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320
$25 … free shipping.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.310
Again, that was yesterday’s deal and now
to a half price deal I found for you today.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.750
And if you’re wondering, what is this strange
set-up I have…

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.910
I borrowed a lamp from one of our desks and
I’m using this to replicate the light you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.350
might get if you put this bad boy on a window
sill.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.559
The charger has now taken that light and transferred
it into a smartphone charge.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.239
As you can see my device is now charging,
plugged in to the flower pot!

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.969
It has no other power source right now.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:03.730
This futuristic sunflower can sit in your
window sill or anywhere else and when exposed

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.830
to light it quickly charges apple… android…
and virtually any other digital device.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.860
It performed well in my tests and other than
the price drop…

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.460
I like the fact this is a great go to during
a power outage when you really need a charge.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.920
Today I found a way to get it for half price…
around thirty dollars and I just posted the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.920
deal right under this video window.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.920
I think it’s kind of cool.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.860
At the end of the day, you can just put this
beside any of your other flower pots, or just

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.360
expose it to light - not necessarily sunlight,
and you’re good to go.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.920
Two ports on the book… see it’s not plugged
in but it’s still giving an output.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.369
Wow.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.369
Solar energy.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.369
Great Granite.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.369
Wrap your head around it….

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.390
…..The input if you do want to charge the
pot via USB, that’s fine.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.230
If you just wanted to run this using solar
energy to power another device, just take

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.899
whatever USB charger it is that you want and
then you can power that device.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.110
Again, the link for this deal, right under
this video window.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.079
