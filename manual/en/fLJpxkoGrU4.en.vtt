 Mom! What’s for breakfast today?

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:20.945
Honey. I’ve made you some pancakes and bacon.

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:24.554
Okay, cool. Have you fried the bacon or roasted it?

00:00:24.844 --> 00:00:26.117
 I roasted it.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:30.781
Oh! I’m so tired of eating roasted bacon. Can you fry it today please?

00:00:31.523 --> 00:00:33.789
No, fried bacon is not healthy.

00:00:34.523 --> 00:00:37.554
Who cares about health? I love fried bacon!

00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.867
Okay, I’ll fry it next time, alright?

00:00:47.702 --> 00:00:50.256
Hey! Did you finish eating your breakfast yet?

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.000
No, not yet. Do you have something to drink?

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.992
Yeah, sure! What do want orange juice or milk?

00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:01.944
 I’d like some hot milk with chocolate.
Do you have any chocolate syrup?

00:01:02.336 --> 00:01:04.109
Let me check. I might have it.

00:01:04.602 --> 00:01:05.179
Okay.

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:09.156
Nope, there’s no chocolate syrup or powder.

00:01:09.641 --> 00:01:12.476
Oh! Then I’ll just go with orange juice.

00:01:12.977 --> 00:01:13.828
Here you are.

00:01:20.445 --> 00:01:22.515
I’m traveling to the UK next month.

00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:26.367
Okay, do you know what to order for breakfast when you’re there?

00:01:27.002 --> 00:01:28.718
No. What?

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:30.992
 An English Breakfast.

What’s an English Breakfast?

00:01:33.788 --> 00:01:44.609
Oh, that’s what they call their traditional breakfast. It’s huge.
It has bacon, eggs, coffee, tomatoes, mushrooms and toast.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.624
 Really? No way! Who can eat all of that?

00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:50.858
What do you usually eat for breakfast then?

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:53.147
It's cereals in a bowl of milk.

00:01:53.484 --> 00:01:55.273
Well, we’re in America!

00:02:01.844 --> 00:02:04.195
 Hello. What would you like to order?

00:02:04.727 --> 00:02:06.851
What is today’s special for breakfast?

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:14.078
Well, we have a combination of ham and
cheese sandwich, and hot milk with the muffin.

00:02:14.826 --> 00:02:15.882
And what else?

00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:20.828
And Fruit Loops with milk and scrambled eggs with bread toast.

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:22.757
I’ll go with the second one.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:28.437
You mean Fruit Loops with milk and
scrambled eggs with bread toast?

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:33.117
Yes, that. Could you make it fast, please?
I need to leave for my office.

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:34.953
Okay, sure.

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:36.382
Thanks!
