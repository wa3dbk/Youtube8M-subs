00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.000
When you decide to do a tattoo...

00:00:39.035 --> 00:00:43.135
what kind of artist you must search?

00:00:46.273 --> 00:00:50.413
Nowadays is common for tattoo artists to specialize.

00:00:54.465 --> 00:00:58.485
As well as in other professions, like a dentist, for exemple,...

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.480
won't do everything inside of dentistry. 

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:11.574
I believe that the tendency in the tattoo is also this

00:01:15.589 --> 00:01:19.689
So it's important, before look for a tattoo artist, analyze his portfolio...

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.600
For confer that you want to do fits in artist's profile.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.860
Of course that exists tattoo artists who do everything...

00:01:38.108 --> 00:01:42.168
But believe me, if the professional refuses to do certain style...

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.920
it's because he seeks to do what he likes.

00:01:52.936 --> 00:01:57.436
When the artist do his work with pleasure, the result is much better.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.789
Both you and he will be happy.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.740
In this video's tattoo, I worked in my preferred styles:

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:24.494
Realism and small watercolor effects.

00:02:29.475 --> 00:02:33.695
Today I can say that I've done what I like most in tattoo...

00:02:37.934 --> 00:02:42.034
giving up of doing others styes that don't bring me so much satisfaction.

00:02:46.513 --> 00:02:50.553
So, if you follow these steps:

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.660
Search for a tattoo artist for his style, in a studio that offer sanitary conditions of work,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.760
Personalize your ideias in a cool art...

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:10.777
There will be no mistake!   Good luck!!
