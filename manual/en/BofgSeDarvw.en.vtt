00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.060
Simply put, Lean Six Sigma would just
be a systematic approach to

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.240
problem-solving and one of the keys to
Lean Six Sigma

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.960
is "sustain the gains". It's putting
controls in place

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.230
so that we sustain the improvements
that we make over time.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.840
I think a lot of people that come to
the class already have a basic

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.359
understanding of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.369
what they're trying to do in their industry.
What we really do try to give them some

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.599
structure to frame problems,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.680
to figure how to collect data in a more
productive way, and to come up with

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.410
solutions are more sustainable.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.260
the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.250
program is very practical. We bring a lot
of case studies from industry,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.460
both projects that I have done, projects that I have mentored,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.129
projects my colleagues have done - we
believe very strongly that

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.809
bringing practical examples and turning
them into in class

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.820
and take home case studies is really what
drives the "aha" moment

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.949
in the learning from our students.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.970
I have experience with University Michigan
through the lean certification course, the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.960
lean logistics,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
and that was a first-rate education that
that really helped me

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.819
in my career. One of the tools that I
was lacking in

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.259
was the Six Sigma piece, so it was
just part of my personal development to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.039
take

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.190
Six Sigma Green Belt certification.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.380
This course gives you the tools and
you really can't go wrong if you

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.399
use these tools and apply them

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.140
appropriately with the correct data, it will be a good outcome.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.720
In the big picture of problems, probably
80 - 90% percent the time you

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:38.590
really don't need

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.619
heavy statistical tools to solve them. You really just need a systematic approach

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.050
through a dedication to the commitment to
solving the problem.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.849
I think the green belts have enough
skills and enough structure

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.349
that they're able to do this for a wide
variety of problems in

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.229
different industries. It's always been
fun to over the years to watch number of

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:58.569
people who have come back

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:02.319
and use the tools and have tremendous
success

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.440
at their organizations. That's really
what drives the benefits.
