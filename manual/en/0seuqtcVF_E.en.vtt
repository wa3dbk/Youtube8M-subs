Hi this is Yolanda from vanveenbulbs.com,
and in this section we're going to talk about

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.740
how to control corn ear worms. Now there's
all types of bugs that affect our crops in

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.380
the United States, and a big problem right
now for all the corn industries is the corn

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.420
ear worm. Basically it really is a caterpillar
that gets into the corn, and then makes a

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.630
little cocoon, and then turns into a moth.
It eats into the corn and does terrible damage,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.379
and so it can ruin a whole crop, but there
is different types of methods that you can

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.760
use to rid the corn fields of the corn ear
worms. So one of the most organic ways to

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.810
rid the problem is as soon as the corn head
starts to develop, actually put corn oil or

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:51.659
mineral oil, or vegetable oil on the tips
of the corn, because that is where the caterpillars

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.710
enter the corn, and they don't like the oil,
it breaks down their outer coating, so it'll

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.600
stop them from coming in. Another trick that
the farmers have been using is as soon as

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.070
the corn develops, they spray the whole crop
with a basilis. It's a kind of a bacteria

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.710
that's called BT, and it's safe for children,
and animals. The only set back is that it

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.200
kills all caterpillars. So all the beautiful
butterflies, it kills it as well, but apparently

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.230
it's something that is needed to be used,
so if you have a problem with corn ear worms,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.850
and it works. So bacterias can be used to
kill corn ear worms, but there's other methods

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.810
as well. Pyrethrins, which are really bad
for all types of insects are used, and it's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.400
basically a chemical that's taken from chrysanthemums,
so it is organic, but it is one of the most

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.370
dangerous chemicals known to man. So even
if something is marked organic, it might still

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.810
be dangerous to other animals, and to different
pets, and other bugs. So always do your research

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.210
and find out, and try the most natural methods
first.
