My name is Christine Marquette and I am a
registered dietitian with theAustin Regional

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.800
Clinic and I am going to talk to you about
how to raise vegetarian children. Vegetarian

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.900
children go through a lot of the same things
that kids who eat meat do. They'll go through

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.909
their periods where they have food jags, where
they may not like particular vegetables or

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:24.560
they may not like particular fruits. So, in
a lot of ways, it's the same type of concepts

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.140
that you would apply to a child who is a meat
eater. You want to make sure that you're offering

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.260
as much variety as you can. And you want to
really try to include different fruits and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.649
vegetables and whole grains. But the primary
thing to keep in mind is make sure that there

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:43.719
is a very good quality source of protein on
a daily basis. Whether that's coming from

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:51.120
milk, cheese, eggs, beans, nut butters, like
peanut butter. Make sure you have all those

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.620
options available so if your child is going
through a food jag and maybe they don't want

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.629
to eat yogurt or they don't want to eat cheese,
you've got peanut butter or you have nuts

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.130
or you have some other option that is high
protein source that they can choose to eat.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.440
And keep in mind that food jags usually are
temporary. They are just a period of time

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.550
when kids are growing very rapidly, their
taste buds are changing, so their sense of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.530
taste is very acute. They taste things much
more intensely than we, as adults, do. So,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.750
that's something you want to keep in mind.
Have patience with your child. Again, just

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.800
make sure that you are offering different
things. Also keep in mind that as a child

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.420
is growing, their portion sizes are actually
a lot smaller than an adult portion size.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.670
For example, if some child is still in the
toddler age range, for them, a serving of

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.910
a high protein food, if it's beans, it's only
a quarter cup. So it is a very small portion.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.390
So, if your child eats half a cup of beans
in a day, they've actually gotten two servings

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.760
of high protein food. So, keep that in mind
when you are doing your meal preparation,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.180
make sure when they are toddlers the portion
size is very small. As they do start to get

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.259
older, get to be grade school age, the portion
starts to increase somewhat, but it's still

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.540
not at the level of an adult portion. So,
if they are going through a food jag, just

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.200
make sure you do have other options of protein
sources available. Continue to offer the different

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.040
fruits and vegetables. Continue to different
offer the different grains. A lot of the concepts

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.310
are the same. The main difference is that
the protein is coming from a plant source

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.980
as opposed to a meat source. So, just a couple
things to keep in mind when raising vegetarian

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:34.069
children.
