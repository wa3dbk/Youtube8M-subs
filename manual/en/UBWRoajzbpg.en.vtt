Hello. My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter. And, today I'm representing

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.900
ExpertVillage.com. Well, we finished painting
the wall, and, man, it really did come out

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.120
great. Now, I've got to go ahead and pour
up this paint. And, to do that I'm going to

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:24.929
go ahead and open up one of these cans I had
on the site. Alright. Now, you want to grab

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:31.929
the bucket by the handle. And then, just pour
the paint into the bucket. Now, let it drain

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.590
on out. Now, the trick to doing this is you
want to get this up in here and pull that

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.370
paint on out. And, just work that all the
way down the side. Alright. Now, we've got

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.991
that in the cut pot. You want to keep that
aside because you need that brush to clean

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:54.710
up with. Now, it's a little more difficult
when you're dealing with a roller. But, it

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.320
can still be pretty easy. Now, what I use
is my five-in-one tool. And, I scrape the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:16.499
paint out of it just like this. See that just
gets that paint out of there. Working it this

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:24.659
way, you get all that paint out of the roller.
Now, just do the best you can with it. Now,

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.070
these rollers are not nearly as expensive
as they used to be. You can clean this out.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.450
I'll show you how when we do clean up for
the brushes. But, really, they're so cheap

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.509
now, unless I really need them, I just leave
them in the paint if I'm coming back to the

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.149
job. And, if not, I just toss them. Sometimes
I can pick these up for two bucks a piece.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.789
Alright. Now, once you've gotten all the paint
out of that, you want to keep that in a cleaner

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.420
area to get it out of your way. I usually
set it on top of one of these paint tops.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.799
That way it doesn't get all over everything.
You're going to do the same thing with your

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:12.440
five that you did with the little bucket.
Only, it's just a little bigger. First of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.170
all, pour all the paint in there. And, once
you've got that all in, go ahead and work

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:31.780
that out of there in the same manner as you
did before. And, you just work all the paint

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:43.510
out of the bucket. Now, we'll pour that on
in. Keep working that on in. Nice. And, you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.829
just keep working it around the edge until
it all comes out. Get all that paint out.

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:56.319
Alright. Now, we've got that done. Put our
paint bucket brush there. Put our roller back

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:05.510
in the bucket. Pop that can on there. Now,
this is kind of a mess so, I'm going to

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:13.559
use my stick. Knock that down. And, this is
how we pour up the paint after a paint job.
