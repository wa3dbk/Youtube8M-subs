Hello everyone and welcome back! My name is
Mr. Q. Today we're going to talk about Ancient Egypt.

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.909
Modern day Egypt is a country in North Africa.
But people have been living in that area for

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.860
a long,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.920
long,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.700
long time.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.520
Now, the important thing to remember is, way
back in the olden days there was never enough food.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.980
There were no refrigerators, no microwaves, no supermarkets, so people had to spend all their time finding food.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.100
Want a tuna sandwich? You had to go fishing.
Want a steak? You had to go hunting. All this

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.740
changed when people learned how to be farmers.
'Cos then, they could grow more food than they needed.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.730
In Egypt, the best place to do this was on
either side of a long river called the Nile.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:01.730
Because it flooded in the same way every single year. That meant people could plan when was the best time to plant their crops.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.640
And the rest of the time, they got to take a break!

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.980
Now, people could be artists, or architects.
They also learned how to write.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.960
Ancient Egyptians did this with pictures called hieroglyphics. They looked pretty cool, almost like a comic book.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.040
Egyptians believed in a life after death,
where you had to take everything you owned.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.930
The Pharaohs would be buried with lots of gold and treasures.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.330
Now, some people think mummies are scary, but that's just because they came back to life

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.800
in some old Hollywood movies. There's
really nothing to worry about.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.659
I know you're back there, I'm not going to
look.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.479
Did you know that Egyptians worshipped cats?
That's because they represented the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.600
Egyptian Goddess, Bastet.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.900
They were so important, sometimes they would
also be turned into mummies when they died.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.800
Seriously, there were mummy cats!

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.650
Someone should make that movie.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.930
I'd watch it.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.900
The Pyramids of Giza look like this. It would
be hard to make one even today, with all of

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.670
our technology and machines. But when they
were first built, they looked like this.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.069
An outer layer of polished limestone reflected
the sun and made them shine.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.870
An earthquake made the limestone fall off.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.690
And then people stole it.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.560
Part of the reason we are so fascinated with Ancient Egypt is that so much of it is with us today.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.080
The pyramids are still there, you
can visit them.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.600
And the Sphinx.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.300
You can even see real mummies in museums.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.410
