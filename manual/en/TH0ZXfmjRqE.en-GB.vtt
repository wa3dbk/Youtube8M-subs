The street has been cordoned off
to protect the surrounding residents

00:00:34.297 --> 00:00:35.855

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:49.669
Citizen! Put down the weapon!

00:00:50.175 --> 00:00:51.375
Who?... Me?!

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.159

00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:00.481

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:01.736
What hostages?!

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:04.210
We are told you have two hostages

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:06.928

00:01:30.348 --> 00:01:35.281

I just want to make toast!

00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:38.791
Get this man some toast!
Nobody else needs to get hurt

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.034

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.792

Hello! I'm Villager number 9 from
Villager News

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:53.980
Can I ask what brought on this bout
of crazed lunacy?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.059
All I want is to make some toast

00:01:57.145 --> 00:01:58.980

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.309

00:02:01.395 --> 00:02:04.526
...please tell Villager number 4 that
I ate his sandwich!

00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:06.326
GASP! I knew it was him!

00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.021
It's gone too far!
We have to move now!

00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:10.071
Go! Go! Go!

00:02:10.483 --> 00:02:11.483
Go! Go! Go!

00:02:12.384 --> 00:02:13.279
Take him down!

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.379
Let's do this!...Let's Go!

00:02:14.457 --> 00:02:17.020
What are you doing? Now you're
all hostages too!

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.720
WHAT?! NO! I had so much to live for!
I was supposed to be retiring!

00:02:22.154 --> 00:02:24.721
Wait! I'm not taking ANY hostages!

00:02:24.733 --> 00:02:26.200
He's riddled with lies!

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.800
This just in: The mayor has
been informed of the situation.

00:02:30.843 --> 00:02:32.343
So what can we do?

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.076
Your in a position of power
maybe he'll listen to you...

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:39.909
Yes! That's a good idea.
Let's go talk to him.

00:02:41.156 --> 00:02:43.289
YAY! I'm a hostage too!

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:48.227
