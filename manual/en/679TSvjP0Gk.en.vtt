00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi, I'm Aiman, and in this video I'm going to tell you how I became a Youtube Star

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.889
some people might think I'm not a youtube star

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.599
but maybe one day I will become one

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.339
I'm only 8 years old

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:19.139
but I have produced over 30 short videos so far

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.600
if you're wondering how I became a self-proclaimed youtube star

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.229
here are my stories

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:27.579
for parents out there, this is an example of nurture versus nature

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.170
I wasn't born actor

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.830
my sister Amira 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.210
got me into acting

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
every time my sister went home from Stanford University for college winter break

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.840
she would try to put me  in front of the camera

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.630
to just record me

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.190
this is a short video she made

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.490
three years ago in December 2009

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.490
she was only trying to get me to sing a song in front of the camera

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.780
I was only 5 years old and I was shy

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.390
this next video clip will

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.960
show my sister trying to get me in front of the camera to sing a song

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.970
this video clip was taken two years ago

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.970
and I was six [years old] and I was still shy

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.750
okay let's see if this works

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.270
we're going to play a song that you will sing to...okay

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.270
during last year's winter of 2011, my sister came home from Stanford University, and I hijacked her laptop

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.630
and recorded this funny video

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.970
from that point on I always try to find anything that I can use to record myself...

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.909
in front of the camera

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.409
this next clip I made will show you

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.199
the attempts of me 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.919
trying to be a director

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:18.430
three, two, one...

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.679
hello guys

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:24.389
we are playing "Just Dance Four"

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.409
when I dad saw this

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:28.079
he helped and encouraged me

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:30.189
he took videos of my projects

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:31.359
edited them

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.249
and posted them on youtube

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.599
this is a story how I became an actor

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.469
when I grow up and movie producers see my videos

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:40.449
they will hire me

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.869
as a famous actor, some day

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:48.009
I might become a famous movie producer like Steven Spielberg

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.790
or I might go to Yale, Harvard, Stanford, MIT or Princeton

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.829
and then maybe

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.029
I will grow up to be successful

00:02:56.029 --> 00:03:01.679
as a scientist, a surgeon or a CEO of big corporations

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.039
and since I'm very good at making movies

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:09.639
and public speaking I could become the
President of the United States some day

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:15.309
President Ronald Reagan did, he was a good public speaker and a movie star

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:18.739
but for now this is what I enjoyed doing

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.539
I am a normal kid, and I want to grow up like other normal kids, like playing with everything like

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.529
Pokeman TCG [trading card games]

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.869
video games like Minecraft

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:32.369
and Roblox, and toys

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:37.499
for parents out there, this is another
piece of evidence of nurture versus nature

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:42.169
just be sensitive to what we kids like and what we do

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.319
and encourage us and help us

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.469
here's a little fact, my sister was a child prodigy too

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:50.959
at the age of seven, her essay

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.869
was published to a school newsletter

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:56.649
at the age of eleven

00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:01.769
she received any official citation from
a town mayor for her presentation

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.479
on the Rainforest and Poetry

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.540
at the age of thirteen

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.219
she became a district winner for her essay entitled "Dynamic DNA" she wrote for

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:14.089
the Council for

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:18.720
Agriculture, Science and Technology

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.740
she received congressional remarks by House of Representative

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.070
Honorary Rosa DeLauro

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.700
speaking of Rosa DeLauro, she just visited our school

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.119
to read to us

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:37.639
the book she read to us was

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.509
"Circus Ship" [title of the children book]

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.870
okay, back to where we were talking about

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.610
my sister's essay was published in the
library of congress

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.409
in the future I will make a video about my sister

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:58.179
it'll be entitled "My sister's road to Stanford University" or something like that

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:01.559
