00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.610
In this video, I’ll show you how to make
some simple modifications 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.260
to an Access 2010 database. 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.160
I created this database by using the
Contacts Web Database template, 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.230
but the techniques I'll show you apply to
all Access databases.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.080
One of the most common modifications
people make to a database 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.750
is to add a new field, so that they can
store a new piece of information 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.170
about the people or things they’re
tracking in the database.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.560
For example, this database stores
information about contacts, 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.360
but it doesn't have a field for the person's
birthday.  

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.320
I'll close the form that's currently open,
and I'll open the Navigation Pane, 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.640
where I can see all the objects in the
database.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.400
Contact information is stored in the
Contacts table, 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.220
so I'll double-click it to open it.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.750
I could insert the new field anywhere in
the datasheet, 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.920
but I'll just scroll over to the right, 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.600
and click the down-arrow next the "Click
to Add" label.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.380
This shows me a list of data types that I
can use. 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.910
For the birthday field, I'll choose Date &amp;
Time.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.150
Access creates the new column and
selects the field name.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.830
I'll just type "Birthday" for the field name.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.540
When I press Enter, Access moves to the
next column 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.870
and opens the data type dropdown list,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.800
but Birthday is the only field I wanted to
add, 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.610
so I'll just click Save and then close the
table.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.180
Now I want to add the new Birthday field
to the Address Book form. 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.480
In this case, the title on the form does not
match the actual object name. 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.220
I know that Contact Card is the form I
want to change, 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.150
so I'll right-click it in the Navigation Pane,
and then click Layout View.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.820
I'll close the Navigation Pane to make a
little more room.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.060
If you don't see the field list, click Add
Existing Fields on the Design tab. 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.330
Here, I can see my new Birthday field.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.380
I want to put the Birthday field just under
the Mobile Phone field. 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.810
All the controls are contained in a layout
grid, 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.720
so I need to insert a new row into this
grid.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.600
I want the new row to match the structure
of the one above it,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.700
so I'll select one of the cells in that row, 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.480
and now on the Arrange tab, I'll click
Insert Below.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.330
Access adds the new row, with the same
cell layout as the one above it.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.010
Now, I can just drag the new Birthday field
from the Field list to the form.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.380
And, I’ll resize the row a bit.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.180
That's all I need to do, so I'll save and
close the form.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.320
I'll also add the new field to the Contacts
Datasheet form. 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.240
Datasheets don't have a Layout view, 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.600
but you can just open them and modify
them directly. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.430
I’ll double-click the ContactsDS form,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:52.850
and drag the field to the datasheet.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.460
Now I’ll save and close the datasheet.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.570
Now, I'll open the Main form, and close
the Navigation Pane.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.660
Incidentally, the Main form is a Navigation
form that enables you to switch 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.290
between different forms and reports in
the database. 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.070
All the Access Web Database templates 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.220
make use of this kind of form for basic
navigation.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.010
Here's the new field on the Address Book
form,

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.190
And on the datasheet.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.760
And remember, you can add fields to any
Access database 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.900
by using the steps in this video, 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.870
whether you created the database by
using a template, or from scratch.
