00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.389
&gt;&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.910
JAY K. HARNESS: I have been asked a somewhat
confusing question in the sense that people

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.240
are confused about genetic counseling vs genetic
testing for BRCA1 and 2.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.070
It is a good question.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.470
What comes first is in my mind clearly, and
I think everyone that I deal with nationally

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.150
and internationally, what should come first
is in fact genetic counseling.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.550
With the genetic counseling, there is a
detailed history taken of the family, both

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.760
on the maternal side and the paternal side
looking not only for a history obviously of

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.200
breast cancer but also ovarian cancer or other
things that would indicate that somebody should

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.629
be tested for BRCA1 and 2.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.350
Now, depending on the location where people
live, this may not always be possible but

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.660
it is clearly the preferential way to go.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:17.020
The cost of testing for BRCA1 and 2 is high.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.939
There are locations where genetic counsellors
are not available.

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.909
There are certainly physicians who are well
schooled and knowing when the test should

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.680
be ordered, so there would be certainly a
second line approach.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.200
There may be a few other circumstances where
you will go straight to actually drawing blood

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.860
and doing the genetic test.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.680
So in summary then, it is absolutely always
appropriate, always better to do the genetic

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:58.840
counseling first, and frankly if you do not
qualify, at least in the United States, for

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:04.369
having blood drawn for BRCA1 and 2, you would
have a better idea of what your real risk

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:05.960
factors are.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.650
So my bottom-line suggestion, I like to get
bottom lines, is please see a genetic counsellor

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.260
first when it comes to this issue.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:24.760
Hi, I am Dr. Jay Harness and I want to share
with you important information that I believe

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.170
that every newly diagnosed patient with breast
cancer needs to know.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.510
Susan Denver: I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.670
Katherine Stockton: I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.739
Coree: I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.360
Susan Denver: And I want every woman to know…

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.390
Katherine Stockton: …about personalized
breast cancer treatment…

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.390
Susan Denver: …and the genomic test.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.540
Coree: A test that helps guide a woman and
her doctor…

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.550
Katherine Stockton: …to the best treatment
options for her.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.340
Susan Denver: Pass it on!
