00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.800
Hey there and welcome to part 5 of this
video series!

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.029
Now that we have completed painting our
pieces, we are going to go over some

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.619
different distressing techniques!

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.140
Before you distress, you want to let your
piece dry overnight

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.860
so it has a good chance to dry. If
you're painting an oil-based surface

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.300
then I would suggest waiting for another
four days

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.670
before you distress your piece, just to
give it a good chance to adhere well to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.600
the surface.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.570
To create a distressed look I'm going to
show you two different techniques

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.890
For this table I'm going to show you how
to use the wet-distress technique

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.899
with a scouring pad. I'm just going to 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.480
go ahead and cut this one in half. I'm
going to use this scouring pad that I cut in

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.399
half and make it wet.

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.699
Then I'm going to gently rub across the
surface

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.410
to remove some the top-paint player and
to expose the paint

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.770
color underneath! I'll use this rag 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
to wipe while distressing so that I can
see better what I'm doing

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.369
as the removed paint can sometimes cover things up.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:23.369
As you can see I'm using a

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.890
sanding sponge to distress this
tabletop.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.890
It is my favorite method of distressing when I want to

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.979
expose the original wood layer. You can
decide to distress just a little or

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.810
you can really go wild with it!

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.360
The look you want to create is up to you
and there's really no right or wrong.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.349
For our

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:55.030
table that we painted in Delightful, I'm
going to use a sanding block

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.080
to distress and to expose some of the
natural wood

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.500
underneath. If you feel like you have distressed

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.560
too much then you could always paint over it again.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.900
When using sandpaper make sure that your sandpaper

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.239
isn't too coarse as this will create scratch
marks, which don't look natural.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.569
I would suggest starting with 120 grit
sandpaper

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.610
but feel free to experiment to find
something that works best for you.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.110
Thanks again for watching this video

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.820
If you want to learn more about
different distressing techniques

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.070
I would suggest going to our website and

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.500
visiting the tutorial section. Next video
will go over how to finish your piece 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.300
with wax and Tough Coat so I hope to see you then!
