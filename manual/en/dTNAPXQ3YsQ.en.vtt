00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.880
Dan Gilford from New Hampshire writes my father
had cataracts and bad eye sight and so did

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.330
my mom.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.920
What can I do to keep my sight in tact as
I get older.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.010
So losing problems with our vision as we get
older is actually extremely common and I hear

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.060
so many people complaining, gosh if only I
didn't have to wear glasses!

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.130
It's the most irritating thing about getting
older.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.050
So there's several different processes we
find that happen as we get older.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.050
Cataracts are one of them.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.480
That comes from too many oxygen free radicals,
and also sunlight, so the ultraviolet light

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.860
is something that can be damaging to the lens
of our eyes so that's what a cataract is where

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.461
it starts to opacity or get cloudy from the
damage from the oxygen free radicals and the

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:51.809
ultraviolet radiation so wearing a good pair
of sunglasses that helps to filter out the

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.720
UAV and UVB rays is extremely beneficial.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.250
Also having a diet that is high in antioxidants
then the next thing is the problem with macular

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.430
degeneration.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.870
So macular degeneration is the number one
cause of adult onset blindness.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.900
The macula is at the very center of the retina
in the back and that's where we have our best

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.690
visual equity and our culture there, so what
happens with macular degeneration is that

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.220
it just starts to get damaged basically and
degeneration means it's starting to fall apart,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.310
but there are ways that you can help to protect
against getting macular degeneration which

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.070
includes all the things we talk about with
health or are beneficial with plants and eating

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.520
fruits and vegetables and so forth, but there's
also certain supplements that you can take

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.490
that are extremely helpful too.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.480
Ok well we're going to come back to those
in a second but I mean the optic nerve is

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.850
a muscle right so are there things that we.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.850
It's a nerve.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.600
Are there things we can do to exercise that
nerve or keep it healthy or bring oxygen and

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.600
blood to it.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.201
Well blood flow is the main thing so exercising
and keeping your blood pressure low so that

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:08.340
we know when your blood pressure goes up it
constricts all the little blood vessels and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.200
when you get cardiovascular disease so all
the things that increase your risk of cardiovascular

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.560
disease it causes it in the blood vessels
throughout your body so it can effect your

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.560
eyes too.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.410
So just review what those are just because
they effect eye health as well.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.410
Sure.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.410
So you know eating meat and potatoes is not
good for cardiovascular disease.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.810
Increasing inflammation is kind of the big
thing that we found more so than cholesterol

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.290
as far as you know causing the deposits in
the plaque undo stress you know without having

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.460
affective stress reducing techniques cause
an elevation in blood pressure and not getting

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.000
enough exercise.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.130
Ok. so some of the supplements that have been
useful to try and maintain good eye health,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.280
what are they?

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.540
So specifically for macular degeneration when
you look you know you have a little the doctor

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.020
will look in your eye through your pupil and
see that macula has got.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.640
And open that eye so far.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.640
That's right.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
I feel like something is going to go wrong.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.060
That's right so when you actually look at
the back of the retina the area where the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.750
macula is yellow so that yellow pigment is
xanthene and lutein as a specific you know

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.900
in their antioxidants and derivatives of vitamin
A so you can take them as supplements you

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.430
will find them in certain foods and sometimes
it's deceptive.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.950
I supposed your going to tell me I can find
lutein in something like that.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.920
Well it's close actually you know one thing
where you wouldn't even know that it's in

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.020
there is in kaile is one of the biggest you
know repositories of lutein that you don't

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.530
see it because it has just like deciduous
trees you know that are green during the summer

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.220
time, you don't see either color until the
chlorophyll goes away and then it exposes

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.730
so you can see that as kaile starts to get
older it turns yellow so it's a very high

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.730
source of loutine.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.310
But again for your eye health its actually
a good idea to take a supplement because it's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.600
hard to get enough of those nutrients in there.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.190
Bilberry is another one that's very specific
for helping with macular degeneration.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.069
How about Actual eye exercises things that
where you just are working the eye, are those

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.110
of benefit?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.830
Those are more benefit for the condition where
we lose our ability to accommodate so that

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:16.540
usually hits people around forty.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.590
Some of us you know fifty or so but you know
where you have to start to wear reading glasses

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.880
and so there have been an entomologist or
optometrist that worked on these various different

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.820
eye exercises and even these glasses that
have little pinholes in them.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.900
Oh I've seen those things that make you look
like a frog.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.150
That one.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:38.990
Those actually do help so there is some benefit
from using the exercises and using those glasses

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.960
and slowing down the natural progress that
we get and losing the ability to see things

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960
close up.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.470
Ok so let's just review a couple of these
things because there's been a lot of information

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.620
here.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.300
So some of the things associated with cardiovascular
disease can also be problematic for eye health

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.970
like a large rich meat diet because that can
cause heart problems.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.410
We want to try to lower that and replace that
with plants.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.550
So in then exercise and some actual eye exercises
can be useful and certain supplements.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.060
Well thank you very much doctor Horner for
sharing your views on how to maintain good

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.540
eye health which is so important to all of
us.

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.830

eye health as you age just click on the link
