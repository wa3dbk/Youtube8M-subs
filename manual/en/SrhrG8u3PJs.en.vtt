00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.960
Hello everyone, and welcome to Nicko's Kitchens
budget meals!

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.340
Today we are going be making a Chinese pork
stir-fry.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.919
Now, the ingredients only cost me $11,85,
it servers four,

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:18.500
so per portion, it's only going to cost you
$2,95.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.099
So, let's get started!

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.600
*He's got budget meals Monday, what you want
Wednesday,

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.769
Fast food Friday, what else could he share?

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:38.610
It's Nicko's kitchen, where satisfying meals
are prepared.*

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.390
So guys, I am cooking outside today,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.350
because it is such a beautiful day.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.190
I just had to get out here and do today's
video outside.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.390
So the first thing we are going to do, into
a bowl,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.560
I've just got some Singapore noodles here,

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.830
and I'll put them straight in.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.690
Now, these are already part cooked,

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.720
so all I'm going to do, is put some hot water
over the top.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.420
And I am going to leave them there

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.940
for about 7 minutes, to soften.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.260
So guys, I'm using a high heat for this,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.650
and I want the wok nice and hot,

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.070
before we start cooking with it.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.890
Now the first thing I am going to put into
the wok,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.070
is just some sesame oil.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.600
To that I'm just going to add some garlic
paste.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.140
And to the garlic and oil, I am going to add
some union

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.390
that I just roughly sliced.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.020
And just give that a good stir.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.670
Now you really want these unions nice and
soft.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.350
Once your union has started to go soft,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.130
and just slightly caramelized

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.240
with that garlic and sesame oil,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.030
I want you to put in some pork.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.710
And the pork that I'm using here,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.620
I've just sliced up some pork medallions,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.810
but you use any cut that you want.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.260
Now again, before we add any more sauces,

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
you really want to get a nice colour

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.240
on the outside of those pork strips.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.690
So now we are going to add in some sauces,

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.869
and the first one I got is just some soy sauce.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.610
And soy sauce and pork go really well together

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.119
because the soy sauce is really salty.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.529
And for some real stickiness with our noodles,

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:16.069
I'm going to add in some oyster sauce.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.310
And the very last thing I want to add guys,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.790
is I've just got some broccolini

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.620
that I have just taken the storks off,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.829
and I'm going to add that straight in.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.939
It just gives this stir-fry a nice fresh look

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.049
and gives a bite to it as well.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.659
So guys, the pork should take about 7-8 minutes

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.400
to cook in the wok.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.680
Now, right at the end, what I'm going to do,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.121
is I've just discarded the water from our
noodles,

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:43.189
And I'm just going to pop them straight in,

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.560
and just mix the noodles around with the pork
mix.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.040
And that's it guys, so lets now plate this
bad boy up!

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.930
So there you have it guys, check that out.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.390
It smells absolutely gorgeous!

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.299
I bet my neighbours are totally jealous.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:09.010
Okay, lets get stuck in, and give this a go.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.439
Oh!

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.959
The sweetness and saltiness...

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.950
The broccoli and the pork go so well,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.239
the noodles are fantastic.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.519
So give this a go guys,

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.819
all the ingredients are below,

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.700
so check it out, and you will not be disappointed,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.400
I guarantee it.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.819
You guys take care, and I will see you this
Wednesday,

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.430
for what you want Wednesday.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:52.939
So until then, take care!
