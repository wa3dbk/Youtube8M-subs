Fraser Regional is a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.726
multi-security level facility

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.695
with open, medium
and secure levels,

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:32.698
and we also have remand inmates.

I'm a Program Facilitator here

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.135 line:0%
at Fraser Regional
Correctional Centre.

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:38.271 line:0%
And I enjoy my position

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:40.473 line:0%
because it gives me
an opportunity

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.375 line:0%
to facilitate programs

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.477 line:0%
to our inmates they
wouldn't otherwise

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.846 line:0%
be able to receive.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.716
I try to impart some type of
positivism to the inmates,

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.251
you know, a little bit of hope

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.454
here and there doesn't
hurt anybody.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.822
And if I can impart
that on them,

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.191
maybe it will be good
for society in general.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.227 line:0%
MATT:
I get these guys

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.663 line:0%
prepared for work.

00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:05.398 line:0%
This particular range,
this unit,

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.434 line:0%
we're the maintenance unit.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.170
These guys get paid
on a weekly basis.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:12.605
We provide the cleanliness

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.273
for the institution

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:17.343
and then they are sent off
to a maintenance area

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:21.280
where another officer will
basically assign them tasks

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:23.216 line:0%
to do throughout the jail.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.384 line:0%
We have outside word programs

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:27.186 line:0%
and outside work crews,

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.188 line:0%
such as Zajac Ranch, fisheries,

00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:31.624 line:0%
the tree program,

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.758
and then we have crews

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.594
going out to the fairgrounds

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.263
and do maintenance
on their lawns.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:39.632
We have a metal shop;

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.302
it's a full shop with
machines and welding,

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:44.770
blowtorches, everything.

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.472
We have a full carpentry
program.

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:48.774
We have a carpenter
that's contracted out

00:01:48.807 --> 00:01:50.143
and he comes in
and helps the guys

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.745
and they can get their
ticket here.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:53.913
IZACH:
We also provide

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:55.414
vocational programs.

00:01:55.447 --> 00:01:57.250
And I've been lucky enough

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:01.254 line:0%
to be able to be selected
as a facilitator

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.588 line:0%
for hazards recognition,

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:05.291 line:0%
WHMIS, fall protection,

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:06.125 line:0%
so some of these skills that

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.827 line:0%
I can facilitate
and certify them for

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.862
allows them to be equipped

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.398
with certificates that
they can use

00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:14.734
in the workforce
or in the field.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.444
MATT:
I've been in Corrections

00:02:25.477 --> 00:02:27.680
for two years.

00:02:27.713 --> 00:02:28.581
What appealed to me was

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:30.816
when I started and first got
hired on,

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.252
I was guaranteed full-time work,

00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:35.588
and I started on a four on,
four off.

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.224
I get the feeling when
I come into work

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:39.292
that I'm part of a team

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.193
and we work together

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.395
and it's a pretty positive
atmosphere,

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.596
we have fun together.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:44.330
You have people to talk to

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.798
when you have tough days
at work,

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:47.333
which is nice.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:48.501
Doing this job,
it really helps

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:50.903
to have a strong sense of self,
awareness.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.705
You may find yourself

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.607
in a particular situation

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.976
and really discover who you are.

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.811
It will come out.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:00.813 line:0%
These guys will make
it come out.

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:03.816 line:0%
You don't always have
a supervisor

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:04.884 line:0%
looking over your shoulder,

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:06.686 line:0%
so you have to be able to
manage your time well.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.621
Being able to stay honest,

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:10.223
with not only your job,

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:12.258
but be honest 
with yourself too.
