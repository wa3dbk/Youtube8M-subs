00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:14.053
For the set up

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:15.635
Log in a second account

00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:18.711
by pushing start on the second controller.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.083
Start a co-op game.

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:31.049
We're going to choose No Mercy

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.322
The appartements, and begin on expert.

00:00:55.637 --> 00:01:00.334
When the game begins start by incapacitating the two AI's

00:01:14.325 --> 00:01:15.646
Once they are down,

00:01:15.646 --> 00:01:17.867
shoot the player that wishes to receive

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:20.726
the achievement 3 times with the handgun.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.788
Then use the other controller to

00:01:26.022 --> 00:01:29.137
shoot the other player once and heal them.

00:02:04.095 --> 00:02:06.992
Move the player that wishes to recieve the achievement

00:02:06.992 --> 00:02:11.493
downstairs and allow them to get incapacitated.

00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:27.796
Once the main controller is down

00:02:28.027 --> 00:02:30.557
switch the difficulty to easy.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.275
Now all you have to do is wait for a special infected

00:02:43.556 --> 00:02:46.015
to grab the player and then save them with

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.142
the incapacitated player.

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:14.969
For the next achievement you just have to move

00:04:15.185 --> 00:04:18.103
downstairs and wait for one of the AI's to spawn.

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:20.658
Then let them out.
