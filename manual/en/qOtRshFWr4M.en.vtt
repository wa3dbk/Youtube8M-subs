Hi and welcome to the video: positive post-it!

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:19.160
It's a video about a very simple idea:              
You take a post-it note and you write a compliment on it.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.860
I wanted to do this for my nan but then I though: one post-it note is nice but more notes is nicer !

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.740
We've written a lot of post-its with a lot of people; over 4000 of them!

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.460
And then comes the moment that you have to hang them all up.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.010
While we were busy putting all the post-it notes up, the phone rang.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:06.489
My nan wanted to come home. My mother had devised and excuse to take her out and now she asked if she could be picked up immediately.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:10.300
We quickly put up the last post-its and I got in the car.

00:01:10.309 --> 00:01:10.809
She deserves a little pick me up. She could do with some positive messages and we'll give them to her.

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:19.289
I'm on my way to my nan. She's 89 years old and has been through a lot in her life. She's lost two husbands and experienced the war.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.300
She deserves a little pick me up. She could do with some positive messages and we'll give them to her.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:44.760
While we get closer and closer to my her house the tension mounts. How will my nan react to all those notes?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.900
All post-its with sweet notes.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.260
How did you make this happen?

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.860
Why did you move the curtains to the side?
You can see it better then.  We'll put them back.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.140
They have to be pleated very neatly.
Yes..

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.420
Look it's all messages with 'sweet' or 'cosy' or 'I'm so proud of you' 'it's a lovely day, enjoy it.'

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.820
Look at that! It's all being filmed!
Oh!

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:39.300
This is the video I was talking about. This is one of those videos to make people happy.

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:47.119
Immense... really fun. You like it?
Yeah!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.840
You can do it... inspiring
You're doing great

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.020
Best nan in the world.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.560
It's a different way to show you how much you mean to us.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.740
Thank you nan.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.640
You're prettiest when you smile.

00:03:03.763 --> 00:03:06.963
Tada! Even more!
Oh even the door!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.860
You're a beautiful person.

00:03:12.095 --> 00:03:15.715
We'll enjoy this together.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.740
Join in and get each week an inspiring video.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.540
Amazing. Beautiful that reaction. So much fun to work on something with so many people and then the result is what you do it for..

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.080
Do you want to join?
Has something in you triggered and are you thinking can I do it better? Of course you can! All you need is a post it and a pen.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.820
Go write!
Go make people happy!

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:56.500
You don't gave to fill a room, even three little post it's on your colleague's desk or on your dad's mirror - anything!

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.820
To let people know how much they mean to you in a positive way, that in turn is really meaningful to them.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:11.480
I'm really curious about your ideas on making people happy with your own post-it project.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.280
So let us know if you do, send us a picture or a video. I'm looking forward to seeing them.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.380
I wish you good luck with your own positive post-it.
