00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.910
if you're not alone in being surprise as
my wife

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.510
uh...

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.510
alright and personalizing assailed what
a great conferences and at

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.890
uh... being a talk show host i i'd like
to think that i know a lot

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.800
uh... but i've actually

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.739
are actually learned time today i think
that he's been incredibly former but we

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.919
continue that for you guys this panel
uh... i'm ecstatic to hear more more

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.300
about the lodhi

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.829
uh... case that i've been screaming
about republic uses grady here everybody

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.910
talking about it

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.120
i think citizens united

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.250
was basically shooting a dead horse

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.170
i think a lot of shot the horse in the
first place

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.350
so uh... it's good to see that

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.250
people recognizing the fact that
corporations are giving the these uh...

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.850
speech rights of able to contribute on a
massive scale politics is what caused

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.600
the problem in the first place

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.470
uh... i think is a lot of different ways
to solve that obviously amendments been

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.679
discussed this

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.549
summing it has been discusses
shareholder rights and and giving them

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.730
more power

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.970
so they can limit what uh... political
spending the corporations there's just

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.080
been touched on

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.610
it should be discussed more here we'll
talk about legislative solutions

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.890
and there's some terrific legislative
proposals as well are just wanna say

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.680
that uh... from

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.860
my perspective really quickly is was
mentioned on a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.090
that's our wolfpack because i i happen
to think that constitutional amendment

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390
is absolutely necessary

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.870
uh... there's two things that amendment
does

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.870
intense corporate personality and it
does the public financing of elections

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.530
i now i understand from some of the
speakers and others that i have

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.990
discussed with that ending corporate
person had entirely and in my amendment

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.490
it says either they have no
constitutional rights

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.450
is a bit of a nuclear option

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.530
george i say

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.090
the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.180
now that is not to the exclusion of
other ideas whether they're liberal

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.319
libertarian are conservative ideas

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.509
i would love to have a convention and
that is what we're pushing for

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.389
where uh... everybody would get to
propose

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:16.249
there different ways of ending the
corruption

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.959
sosa convention tech and corruption
which i think eg great majority of the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.499
country can get behind

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.169
and that is why i'm also very hopeful
about these legislative solutions

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:30.979
because there's one thing that this
divided country grease up

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:34.849
which is that our politics is corrupted
by money

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
as professor lessig showed you seventy
five percent

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.469
uh... of americans believe that that is
the case i've seen of course polls that

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.359
they get into the eighty four eighty
five percent range as well so we all

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.499
agree

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.519
it seems like an incredibly hard fight

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.489
no matter which way you go uh... msn
just let me give you a quick sense of

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.090
the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.860
problem reported to the solution

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.489
uh... i'd think it's so deep

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.879
that we have

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.139
in a fact

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.339
loss our democracy

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:05.619
now that

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.510
to the person who's not familiar with
all the details of that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.319
it might sound rather harsh

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.469
isn't really harsh when ninety three
percent time in congress the person with

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.559
more money when selection

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:21.669
now what is not determinative is whether
that person is a republican or democrat

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:25.530
what is not determinative is whether
they or a liberal or conservative

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.569
what is not determinative is any of
their ideas or ideology

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.659
what is most internet

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.479
is how much money they have if they have
more money

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.049
they win the election

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.060
so you tell me what decide selection is
of the votes as a democracy

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.599
words of the money

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.930
and i think that

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.719
all most americans know that in their
bones

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:51.579
republicans call crony capitalism

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.550
we call a corporate corruption

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.339
but it's the same thing by different
names

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:58.289
and it has gotten so be

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.969
that for example again on a issued a
press list is brought up this morning on

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:06.909
climate change there was just a poll
done aware sixty seven percent

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.269
of american said

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.999
politicians need to do something about
climate change the need to take

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.689
legislative action

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:17.350
all e twenty five percent said no don't
don't do anything

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.459
sixty seven to twenty five it we had a
functioning democracy

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.179
well there would be and needed action on
that

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:30.039
but in reality there is not at

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.340
not just from the republican candidate
who brags about how his energy policies

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.560
written by the energy companies oil coal
companies

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.409
but by the democratic candidate

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.899
and by the way also very importantly the
people that profit the most from this

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:46.560
corrupt system

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:52.560
television stations

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.300
where does all that money go

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.199
at great major already very close to
t_v_ ads

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:03.149
are you surprised that there were no
questions

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:05.939
about corruption in any of the debates

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:09.199
there was no questions about climate
change there was no questions that it

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.569
anyway challenged

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.680
the supremacy of corporations

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.040
that raise that money

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.189
and then handed over to those same t_v_
companies

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:22.740
we do not have a functioning democracy
that is why we lose on climate change

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.690
even though

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.020
the great majority of american people
are with us

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.530
the great majority american people
believe associ remake you should not be

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.620
cut under any circumstances again

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.899
in the eighties high seventies

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:35.230
overwhelming issue

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.189
never be discussed in a democracy

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.080
which politician in their right mind

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.840
they thought

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.379
the voters a sign of the elections would
go ahead and propose something that

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:49.499
eighty four percent two countries are
posted

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.360
never do that

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.990
we had a democracy

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.679
if the boys would think that mattered
most but it isn't

00:05:55.679 --> 00:05:59.610
what matters most and with the term is
elections more than anything else

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.919
about ninety three percent of time

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.499
is who has more money

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:05.600
we have to

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.029
we must

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.419
change that system

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:10.389
in order to save our democracy

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.960
now as i said there are many different
ways to do away with find out some of

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.360
those on the panel today

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.430
but i will leave you on a note of
optimism

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.439
for my portion here

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:22.249
which is that

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:23.950
we've got at least

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.369
three chords the country on our side a
message

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.160
three quarters of the country

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.620
the long run

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.889
is not going to lose

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.490
we are going to wear

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.539
though all the question is

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:39.570
when and how

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.069
that seventy five percent a country

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:44.330
is dying for a vehicle

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.380
to clean up this corruption

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.330
there waiting for somebody

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.169
or somewhere decision to say

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:51.650
here's how you do it

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.770
here's how you

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.950
date your power back you take it back
from the people that are spending the

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:57.580
money

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.520
to buy your politicians and a by your
government

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.940
and here's what they did say when they
see that

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.250
hell yes

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.189
to liberals are gonna say conservatism
in a sale libertarians are u_s_a_

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.550
you know people worried what happens at
a convention

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.190
uni three quarters of the states the
ratified any amendment no matter what

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.009
happens in a connection

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.459
dot only thing that three chords the
country agrees on is

00:07:20.459 --> 00:07:24.889
money has corrupted our politics and
we're gonna put in end to it
