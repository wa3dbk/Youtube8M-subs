00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.220
Hi Guys, it's Robert.&nbsp;&nbsp;So with the winter
holidays behind us, I know it feels like spring

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.429
cannot get here soon enough.&nbsp;So I thought
for today's DIY we would get a jump start

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.190
on Mother Nature and make some flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;But
not just any flowersâ€”giant paper flowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;So

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.449
let's get started.&nbsp;
I love this project because the primary material

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:25.179
is simple, inexpensive, colorful construction
paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first thing we will need

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.349
to do is to create a template for our petals,
and the way we will do that is by taking a

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.530
piece of card stock, tracing a bowl, or a
small plate to create the upper rounded portion

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.530
of the petal, and then take a ruler to create
the sides, tapering it slightly at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.590
each flower, you are going to want to repeat
the shape in three different sizes.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.359
The next thing we will need to do is to trace
and cut out our petals.&nbsp;&nbsp;But to prevent

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.469
you from having&nbsp;&nbsp;to cut out each one individually,
we are going to stack two to three sheets

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.480
together at a time, trace the template on
the top one, clip the stack together, and

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.000
then cut it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;The clips will prevent
the paper from shifting around while you cut.&nbsp;&nbsp;For

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.920
the flower I'm creating today, we are going
to need five large petals, three medium, and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.600
three small.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once your petals are completely
cut out, stack them according to size, and

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.700
then we are going to cut a slit in the center
of the tapered bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is going to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:27.700
allow us to create petals that are three dimensional.&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin
with the largest petals, and if you take the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.470
paper on either side of the cut, and gently
overlap it, you will see that the petal begins

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.220
to sit up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the large petals create
the exterior of the flower, and we want them

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.030
to be fairly open, so we are just going to
overlap them gently and then staple them in

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.700
place.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead and do this for all five
of the large petals.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.899
Next we will move on to the medium size.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
want these to stand up a little bit taller,

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.719
so overlap the two sides of that cut a little
bit more and staple those in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;And

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.229
then for the smallest size, we want these
to stand up the tallest of all, so overlap

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.310
those two sides even more and then staple
them together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are going to begin

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.000
to construct the flower and we'll move back
to the large size petals.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are going

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.910
to connect these by gluing them at the base,
overlapping each one slightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.770
to be using hot glue, because it dries quickly
and will speed up construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once all

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.220
of the large petals are connected at the base,
you will see we have formed a little bit of

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.490
a cup shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next move on to the medium
size, apply glue on the underside, press it

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.630
down into the interior of the cup shape, and
overlap each one slightly to create our second

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.800
ring of petals.&nbsp;&nbsp;And then for the smallest
size, do the same thing: apply glue on the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.550
underside, place them down into the center,
overlapping each one slightly.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.260
Finally, we are ready to create the center
or the stamen of the flower and the way we

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.950
are going to do this is by taking a sheet
of paper, cutting it in half lengthwise, and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.940
then taking each of those pieces and folding
them in half lengthwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next we will take

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.830
a pair of scissors and create a series of
cuts down the entire length of the fold.&nbsp;&nbsp;You

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.650
can use a regular pair of scissors or what
you see I am using here is actually a multi-blade

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.260
scissors just to speed up construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
you're finish cutting, open up those sheets,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.040
and fold them in the opposite direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;This
is going to create a little bit more dimension.&nbsp;&nbsp;Staple

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.690
them at one end, and then begin wrapping them
around the top of a pencil.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you have

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.800
coiled it all the way around, seal it in with
a little bit of hot glue, and then attach

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.410
the second piece of cut paper, wrapping that
all the way around and again finishing it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.040
with a little bit of hot glue.&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the
stamen, flip it upside down, apply a generous

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.050
amount of glue and then press it down into
the center of your flower.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.370
It looks pretty good at this point, but we
want to finish it off with some foliage.&nbsp;&nbsp;To

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.540
do this, take a sheet of paper, fold it in
half lengthwise and cut out half of a tear

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.710
drop shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;To add a little bit of extra
dimension, we are going to fold this accordion

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:09.710
style, but doing it at an angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fold it
all the way up the leaf, and then when you

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.820
open it up, you will see it has created some
great ridges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply a little bit of glue

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:21.820
and adhere it to the underside of the flower.
I&nbsp;love these flowers because they sit flat,

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.290
making them perfect for party decorations.&nbsp;&nbsp;They
are fantastic as centerpieces or on your mantle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.600
if you have some temporary adhesive you can
even mount them on your wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do hope

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.010
you will give this project a try, experiment
with some different colors and petal shapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;And

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.380
I hope they add a little brightness and cheer
to your space.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you enjoy these DIYs,
