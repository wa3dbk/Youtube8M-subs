00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.219
This New York based, bicycle-centric action
film was released on August 24, 2012 and unfortunately

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.969
failed to recoup its 35 million dollar budget
at the box office... but perhaps it'll do

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.379
better on DVD.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.050
Starring in his third of four movies that
summer, Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a Manhattan

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.670
bike messenger with a death wish... who prefers
to ride a fixed-gear machine with no brakes,

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.019
remarking in the opening narration, "Can't
stop.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:28.490
Don't want to, either".

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.529
When he's tasked to deliver a mysterious envelope
to China Town, things get interesting.

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.780
For one woman, it represents life and happiness,
for a corrupt NYPD cop played by a one-dimensional

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.880
Michael Shannon, it represents his $50,000
ticket out of a bad gambling debt.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.820
After a quick introduction to the fast and
furious world of bike messengers, this extremely

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.150
fast-paced picture by director David Koepp
plays out literally as one long chase sequence...

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:24.500
with our two-wheeled hero flying through the
streets of the Big Apple at breakneck speeds.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.040
The near real-time plot is sporadically interrupted
by a few extended flashbacks that provide

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.510
much needed story and context to the coveted
piece of paper being transported.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.120
The plot is a simple, but intriguing one,
giving many of the underdeveloped characters

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.560
an opportunity to say a few lines or two,
before resuming their furious mid-town chase.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.170
Gordon-Levitt has certainly had better material
to work with, and this film showcases more

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.350
of his unstoppable biking skills, rather than
his impressive acting chops.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
Commendably however, the 31-old appears to
do all of his own riding and stunts, even

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.810
crashing into a taxi during filming, requiring
the actor to get 31-stitches.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.580
This is a formulaic, hyper-kinetic chase movie:
expertly filmed with some frightening low,

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.979
first-person camera angles, unique use of
a Google Maps-style scene transitions, and

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.440
amusing cut-aways to JGL's snap intersection
navigation decision making -- all of which

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.950
give this picture a real sense of urgency
that's hard to look away from.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.440
There's a romantic subplot involving Dania
Ramirez, that although containing some sharp

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.200
dialogue and decent chemistry, receives far
too little screen time to actually make an

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.459
emotional impact.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.650
This is a quick, and fun film that delivers
some palpable, but ultimately familiar thrills.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.569
"Premium Rush", an "Exciting rush, but nothing
involved".

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:49.370
Now for ours scores on the rate-o-matic...
a SEVEN and a SIX.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.290
Every loves Joe, and unanimous praise was
given to the acting in this picture, with

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.700
your scores averaging to a COOL.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.270
This is a enjoyable way to spend an hour-and-a-half,
but as its little more than a fast-moving

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.120
bike chase for the duration, I definitely
went into the closing credits wishing for

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120
more.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.889
I thought it was GOOD.
