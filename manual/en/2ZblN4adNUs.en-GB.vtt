Afternoon, today I am showing you how to make Chinese barbecue sauce

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.680
These are the ingredients

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:13.780
onion, 1 apple, 1 orange, 1 carrot, 1 strip of celery and 2 beet roots.

00:00:13.808 --> 00:00:15.808
Turn the heat on

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:20.498
I've got 500g water

00:00:22.104 --> 00:00:24.104
heat it in a pot

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.900
Now we are going to cut the vegetables up

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.400
cut them up before putting it in a pot

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:39.318
remember to wash the vegetables first

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.120
the thinner you cut the better

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.860
now the water is boiled .. add the vegetables

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.500
these are fruit as well as vegetables...healthy:)

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.860
leave it to simmer for about 30 minutes

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.160
turn the heat down

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.880
ox tail soup 100g

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.704
hp sauce 60g

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.719
worcester sauce 60g

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.820
tomato sauce 100g

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.894

00:02:25.894 --> 00:02:27.317
sugar 150g

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.040
these all go in later

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.860
I have simmer this for about 30 minutes now

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.780
turn the heat off

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.920
filter out the bits

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.160
lets measure it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.980
I've got 250ml now

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.400
pour the 250g liquid back in the pot

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.540
now add all our earlier ingredients in

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.660
turn the heat on

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.360
stir them in thoroughly

00:03:56.178 --> 00:03:58.178
let it boil for a bit

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.400
it is boiling now, we can add the sugar

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.580
once you add the sugar, you must keep stirring

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.380
otherwise the bottom will burnt

00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:16.391
and it wont taste very nice

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.220
once it boils, it will be ready

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.940
it is boiling now... so it's done! we can turn the heat off

00:05:32.454 --> 00:05:35.894
OK..all done!

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.129
Very nice

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.900
the color look cool too!

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.340
Look!

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.960
