Today in our 2013 Dodge Ram Pickup well be
installing the Curt Hitch, part number 13333.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.870
Thats what our hitch to look like once its

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.769
Next, well go ahead and give you a couple
of measurements to assist you in selecting

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.430
accessories for your new hitch.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.520
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outer most edge of the bumper is 2 inches.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.430
On the top or the inside of the receiver tube
opening to the ground in 19 inches, this will

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.470
assist you in selecting accessories such as
a ball mount, a bike rack, or cargo carrier.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.880
Now, lets go ahead with installation.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.720
Note weve already gone ahead and lowered and
remove the spare tire for the ease in installation

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.920
of the install.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.340
Our first step will be removing the ball mount
cap in the bumper, and it will be our upper

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.360
or rear attacher point.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.310
Here well be using the flat headed socket
cap screw that will thread directly in to

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.379
the hitch.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.351
For our lower or forward attachment points
well be using a half inch carriage bolt and

00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:53.239
block that will get fed in to the cross tube
using the half inch pull wire provided with

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.910
our install kit and then securing this hardware
well use a half inch plunge knot.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:37.640
Next well go ahead and hitch up 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:51.200
