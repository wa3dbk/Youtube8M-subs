Hi, I am David Clemen on behalf of Expert
Village and today we're going to draw the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.429
face. Okay, now that we've done the front
of the face like full on drawing of the front

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:18.210
face. We are going to turn the head to the
side for a profile. So, what I'm going to

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.340
show you now is that we used an oval for the
front of the face we're going to turn the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:31.410
head and it's actually two ovals. So, let
me just show you an example of this. So, there's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:42.870
one oval and now basically you take the second
oval and it comes like this. It kind of looks

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.800
like alien right now but just bare with me
and you'll see what I'm talking about. We'll

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.540
be able to use the same line up marks that
we did on just the one oval for the front

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:04.210
face in relation to the profile. For example,
if we go right in the middle of this oval

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:12.049
again and then we split that again. This is
where we will place our ear on the side of

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:23.100
the head. Now on the forehead, we can soften
this once we get our ovals drawn and the nose

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.390
will have the bridge and the nose actually
extends out because you have that piece of

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:40.569
cartilage there. What happens, from the nose
to the lip it actually is kind of sunken back

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:51.369
a little bit and then you put the lips here.
Then the bottom lip, even though it's larger,

00:01:51.369 --> 00:02:00.380
it sinks back as well. Then we come down to
the chin then this extends out. Then once

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:10.720
we soften this, we can soften this oval as
well. We don't have to make it so exaggerated.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:20.080
The eyes actually set in here; once again
the eyebrow is there. You have to imagine

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.640
the eyeball being set in here but we have
eyelids that cover that to make it not look

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:36.920
so scary. Then you'll just see the iris there
and the same goes with the eyelashes here.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.890
That's the profile.
