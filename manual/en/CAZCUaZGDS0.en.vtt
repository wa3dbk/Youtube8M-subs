Hi

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:14.049
I'm Steve Washer with BrainyVideo.com

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.779
Have you ever noticed that when something
or someone sounds good,

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.670
they also look good?

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.330
Think about the Plain Jane who steps out
on the stage and is transformed

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.729
by the beauty of her voice.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.100
Of course,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.900
it works the other way too. 
Imagine you're in a Rolls-Royce.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.470
You turn the key to start it and you hear...

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.950
Sound. It has a huge impact on 
how we see our world.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.290
On TV, we naturally expect people to
sound just like they do in real life.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.850
Even when Hollywood roughs up the
picture, puts it in black and white,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.680
or shakes the camera. When people talk, we
still expect them to sound realistic.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.560
But, in many Web videos, this isn't the case.
People sound far away even though they

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.350
might be only a few feet from the camera.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.490
How do you think this effects 
the way you're perceived?

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.630
Your professionalism, expertise, 
your trustworthiness?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.150
Well, let's find out right now.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.720
does a video with good sound look
better and feel better than the same

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.950
video with bad sound?

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.030
Let's look at three different cuts
of the same scene.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.950
I'll be talking, and right in the middle,
I'll switch the microphones two times.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.010
So we'll have three different mics. And you
can decide if any of this makes

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.100
a difference.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.640
Ready? Roll 'em.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.060
So, now you're watching me on the Kodak
Zi8,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.020
a popular little camera that allows
you to plug in a microphone.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.150
The one you're listening to me now on
is an audio-technica--a little

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.830
$20  microphone.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.910
But there are people who believe 
this is not necessary.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.259
They think that taking the time 
to plug in a microphone

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.979
just takes too much time, and besides, there's
really no difference in the sound anyway.

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.649
What do you think about this
more unfiltered approach?

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.590
How does it make me come across?

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.200
Hey, what if all of a sudden, there was 
a beautiful background behind me?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.689
Would that make a difference?

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.049
Would that make me come across any better?

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.259
Now, just as a bonus question,

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.010
what if we used the sound from the 
sennheiser mic

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.229
under the picture from the Kodak

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:39.719
Zi8?

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.870
For my weekly videos, I prefer the
combination of a camera and a mic.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.730
It makes me feel closer to my audience,
and that's important to me.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.249
Now, some people may say,

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:56.239
"But Steve, Web video isn't Hollywood." 
And I say, that's exactly right. Web video

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.299
is different than Hollywood. Movies and TV
speak to masses of people at once.

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.099
Web video

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.519
speaks to one person at a time.

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.069
The question is, which of the approaches
you've just heard makes that

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.359
relationship more like real life?

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.199
Oh sure, there's a difference between
the $500 mic and the

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.209
$20 mic.

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.109
But the difference between no mic at
all and the $20 mic is much

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.599
greater than the difference between the
$20 and the $500 mic

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.679
when it comes to communicating with
your selected audience.

00:03:27.679 --> 00:03:29.889
Now that's that's just my opinion.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.079
I'm sure you have your own.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.979
In fact, why don't we talk about it. I'd like to
invite you to post a response video

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.889
right here,

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.109
or on your own channel, with a link back.

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.239
The more examples we have,
miced or un-miced,

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.739
the better the learning.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.599
