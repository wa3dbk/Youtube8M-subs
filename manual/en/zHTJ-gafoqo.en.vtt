00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.120
hey guys, just got some new military ponchos
in today.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.650
Just want to show you the new product.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.900
Effectively the ponchos come in a nice little
flat pack.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.200
As you can see over here, the measurements
around this are basically 9 inches width,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.630
and about 10 inches, as you can see over here
its pretty thin, its probably about, roughly

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.870
about three quarters of an inch, or two and
a half cm, so um, pretty good, pretty slim,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.230
fits into your backpack really well, fits
into your packed suitcases pretty well.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.090
Lets have a quick look.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:55.430
This is made out of heavy duty nylon, 100%
waterproof, when you open this up over here,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.980
as you can see they actually come with nylon
snips, or plastic snips. over here that all

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.790
clips together.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.840
This is a square styled poncho, that you just
put your hands through.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.291
One of the great things about this particular
lot that have came through, is that they come

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:17.500
with a head piece as well.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.400
So as you can see, over here.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.450
If your out and about and in heavy rain, what
you really want is the really nice hood over

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.330
here, and that actually sits over the top
and is much more comfortable.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:02:01.259
Also got a little zip at the front over here
as well, You can see like this.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.210
Nice little zip up the front over here, and
you got some little string ties as well to

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.010
cinch that down, around your head when you
need it.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.639
If you want some, feel free to pop into the
website and acquire them there, were also

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:21.549
