00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.800
a computer by the name a new gene
because what are their names with a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:04.710
computer have

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.389
path the Turing test which basically
means

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.670
a it simulated humored human
conversation

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.830
as a 13-year-old boy a we've got a
little more info Korea

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.140
at deterring test which has artificial
intelligence with introduced by Alan

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.750
Turing

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.590
in 1950 he predicted the computer is one
day be able to be programmed to acquire

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.740
abilities rivaling

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.990
human intelligence were pretty much
right there a person engages in a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.910
text-based conversation with another
person and a computer

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.430
and must determine which is which if
they're unable to do so the computer is

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.969
deemed

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.070
to a path it requires 30 percent of
human interrogators

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.940
to be duped during five-minute keyboard
conversations I think we've all

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.700
forgetting to the specific to that we've
all had these experiences with these

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.950
computers like if you go I'm

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.129
to like time-warner check to try to find
out

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.829
and you can you literally can't tell if
you're talking to so

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.559
does this surprise you that this test up
in have what I have been really weird

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.980
but I agree with this online is that
this is a hoax

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.170
that this guy I would look at that okay
you know the regular I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.280
know yet this guy at Reading University
the pearly infamous for these are things

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.490
I think he claimed to be the first human
to be infected with the computer viruses

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.049
and they're apparently a lot of people
are going to go oblique kinda

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.560
reporting the story but it's not true
218 it seems like it half true that

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.850
apparently this did

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.240
it'd actually path but there's some
questions about his

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.920
methodology they're really really great
so I don't get to focus on that just

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.799
more the broth or to broader idea by the
way

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.720
real quick about Allen turning he was
persecuted for homosexuality

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.409
and after he was convicted in 1952 I

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.460
he with chemically castrated little

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.939
little something there and after winning
world war two thanks very much and I

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.600
know he is one of the great game martyrs
of history and actions we movie about

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.079
him

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.159
starring Benedict Cumberbatch coming out
this year really know how to properly at

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.490
that and I think a stamp will get him is
do I think but yeah no

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.430
halperin is a what is it that you're a
really smart gay people because the guy

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130
from a beautiful mind also

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.420
although the movie made it through my
yeah it's great I was or wasn't he a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.960
author

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.650
I i weird you're weird for gay guys are
good with numbers either I'm

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.220
okay but I took no going back to this
without getting too much into the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.660
to the specific to the desk that a
little unclear as yet I whether about

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.390
taking over

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.920
as I somehow after the show every week
with interesting that recurs will put

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.599
together this would happen by 2029 and
yes obviously a lot sooner than that but

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:27.230
I wrong

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.120
I think that well no I mean I you know
that guy does is the upgrade years of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.120
his pro I like human Criswell that but
the truth is the guy you know her and

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.640
when I do not expect her

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.209
all TVs like it okay nevermind while
he's like the head injuries are okay

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.860
then you probably don't know anything
about are you a hard hat ok where are we

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.140
going to lie I think we need to redefine
how we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.530
how we define artificial intelligence
you know I mean obviously this is a test

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.540
that was devised in nineteen fifties so

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.629
what others ideas you know whenever they
try to predict the future in the fifties

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:56.030
and

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.810
ends up looking ludicrous like that well
what on

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.360
I well yeah arm but you know I think
it's somewhat interesting is that

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.690
this device what they told the pat the
jury panel that it was a 13-year-old boy

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.349
English was not his first language
automatically Arabia great

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.120
yet and and so I don't think it's a
surprise that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.760
he won you know I and but it was hardly
a supercomputer was an algorithm that

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.330
was designed to chat bot and by the way
this is the first time that happened

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.680
rabbi in 2011 call the clever Bob
Davidson

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.599
India so again when to the robots take
over I wanted

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.459
man I i wanig day I think it's
neck-and-neck do the robot takeover

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.950
before or after we render the earth

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.290
uninhabitable humana you're gonna be a
great time

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.930
and yeah that I think you know to do
who's gonna get their purse I don't know

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.640
yeah I do you guys think that maybe
somebody is why I always talk about it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.470
as if the robot retailer we getting a
Google cars last week they won't even

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.530
have steering wheel

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.510
so you'll be trapped in your car to be
were to hack into them and they were all

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.830
walking around with these devices so
they can watch it and let it go to

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:00.260
bother

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.629
a.m. I just totally alarm is on it and
that being said I still do all this

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.510
stuff and I love it I think it's so cool
and I love all the movies about it

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.299
but is that is purely alarmist that mean
I think I think it's great i think the

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.580
idea of having driverless cars could
potentially save us from having water

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.419
accidents I mean there's a huge accident
in the news over the weekend about a

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.109
truck driver who had slept for 24 hours
and cause a huge pile up knowing right

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.030
from ordinary I

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.949
right army you know Google is now
they're offering like

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.449
you know cloud storage for autism
research which is supposed to be amazing

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.270
so I'm

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.729
I'm definitely like bullish on the
future I think that like technology has

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.210
amazing things to offer and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.520
you know it's it's it just gets sorted
out of hand when the media take

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.400
something that's not really a story in
Bend

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.340
you know blows up abortion-related with
us supercomputer but I do think that at

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.100
the end of the day

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.080
we're heading in the right direction yet
do you agree with his yeah I you know I

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.330
I wish Google would stop censoring the
Chinese internet but they are obviously

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.080
you may be making a lot of cool things
happen and I'm not I i don't worry so

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.960
much about

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.190
what we're what we're up surrendering
the technology as much as low I'm not

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.930
kidding I really wonder if

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.150
if it's kind it's going to take over if
they're gonna beat us to destroying the

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.710
ozone layer and you know like

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.789
making another ice caps melt right or as
in what happens in the Terminator movies

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.910
and and in like Wile E that they'll have
the flavor us

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.090
because we're the ones that are
destroying the Earth and it'll be

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.259
against their

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:23.919
written orders their laws and then
they'll have to turn on a

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.210
I for one welcome our new robot
overlords I don't know there you go
