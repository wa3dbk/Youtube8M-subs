It's such a simple case to make.

00:00:08.656 --> 00:00:10.656
It can easily be hand-crafted!
Even if you're an amateur, you can make it! A good stuff to do with your kids!
It's certainly a good challenge to begin with ♪

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:15.550
Just a hanky and a piece of tissue are needed.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.430
First, prepare the piece of tissue you want to use for the case and lay it down. Then put the hanky (or a handkerchief paper) over it.

00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:26.732
As shown above, make sure that the piece of tissue is twice the size of the hanky, leave 2 cm from each side as a seam and cut what remains.

00:00:29.553 --> 00:00:31.553
Oversewing prevents tissue from fraying.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.366
Let's start sewing.

00:00:34.894 --> 00:00:36.894
Oriente the tissue so the hanky lay on the halfback. Put it aside.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.410
First we'lI sew the opening for the case.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.908
Fold down one brim by 1 cm down.Then sew it straight.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.326
Do the same with the other side.

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:14.966
Now crease the piece of tissue by folding it halfback (Mountain fold).

00:01:20.784 --> 00:01:22.784
Join both ends by bringing them up to the crease.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.360
Like before with brims, sew each side 1 cm away from the end.

00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:40.220
Do the same with the other side.

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:59.490
Cut what remains of the thread.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.710
At last flip it. Follow the explanation above.

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.140
You're done

00:02:23.564 --> 00:02:25.560
I used it to put tissues inside.

00:02:32.393 --> 00:02:34.390
