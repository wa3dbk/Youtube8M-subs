00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.635
[NOISE] 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.094
We decided to trim the patio pond with wood.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:31.150
Now typically, in an outdoor environment,
I'm gonna choose red wood.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.990
Come to find out my client doesn't like
red wood, he wanted a light color.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.010
So we chose pine.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.798
It's easier to come by.

00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:38.520
It's affordable.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.800
The trick is, it's sensitive to elements.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.360
It doesn't want water on it.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.330
So, of course,
we're gonna have to put some sealant on here.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.940
But it got me thinking of a cool element that
we could do is we could make it to where

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.720
when you come around the corner,
this patio pond's gonna look elevated.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.060
I wanna elevate this off the ground,
say an inch and a half to two inches.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.510
I don't wanna see the legs that
are touching the floor, so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.060
it's gonna look like
the whole thing is floating.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.590
I got a couple more cuts to make.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.358
And then we're gonna start screwing it all
together, and we'll show you how to do it.

00:01:06.358 --> 00:01:11.318
[NOISE]

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.300
 I wanna give you
a quick explanation about

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.531
how the frame is gonna wrap
around the patio pond.

00:01:16.531 --> 00:01:18.187
There's a couple different
ways you can do it.

00:01:18.187 --> 00:01:23.003
[NOISE] There's a log cabin approach
where these two pieces come like that.

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.769
You can see how I'm joining
these together here?

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.570
And then the next one would come inside.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.588
So you would see a joint here,
and not see a joint here.

00:01:33.588 --> 00:01:36.440
And then the same thing would
happen across the back.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.330
Well, since that side of the feature
is going to be covered with plants, and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:41.790
this side is going to be covered with plants,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.310
I want the whole face of
the feature not to have any seams.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.370
So I've taken the time to
measure all the way across.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.490
And this is gonna be one continuous piece,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.000
and the seams are gonna come
from behind this section.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.090
So that's what I've done when I
cut all the pieces around there.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.720
Now, I explained I don't want to see any
hardware when you walk around the corner and

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.950
see this feature.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.610
All the hardware is gonna
be done from behind.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.440
So I made these cleats.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.360
And these cleats are what we're gonna use.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.970
I'm gonna screw through
the back of this wood.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.363
So when we stain it, you're not even
gonna see how the thing was put together.

00:02:15.363 --> 00:02:17.110
I got a couple more cleats to make.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.941
I do wanna show you,
since I'm dealing with a little bit more

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:26.037
sensitive wood,
I have a little pilot [NOISE] hole.

00:02:26.037 --> 00:02:30.972
[NOISE] We'll drill a little
pilot hole like so.

00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:36.788
And then I have my little impact gun here.

00:02:36.788 --> 00:02:43.347
[NOISE] So by doing the,
the pilot hole first.

00:02:43.347 --> 00:02:49.331
[NOISE] It's gonna make for
[NOISE] a really clean connection.

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:52.820
And it'll,
it won't make this crack as easily.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.469
So if you're using a treated wood,
a lot of times if it's kiln dried,

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.105
you go to put it together like that,
it'll crack.

00:03:00.105 --> 00:03:04.878
But if you put a pilot hole in there first,
[NOISE] it'll come together nice and

00:03:04.878 --> 00:03:05.990
clean like that.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.928
So now, all the cleats are put together.

00:03:07.928 --> 00:03:09.589
We can start putting together the big frame.

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:16.034
[NOISE] So I'm gonna flush these ends up.

00:03:16.034 --> 00:03:22.180
Now, the Laguna pre-fabricated ponds that
I've chose that are exactly 18 inches.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.110
So we used one by 10s, it gives us two
9.5-inch pieces or so, gives us 18.5.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.150
So I have about a half-inch play.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.892
So I have this thing lined up nice and even.

00:03:33.892 --> 00:03:39.250
Now, it's time for me to drop this cleat on
here, and then I can draw all this together.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.594
Now I'm gonna pilot this.

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:48.469
[NOISE] This is the back of the,
of the feature [NOISE], the inside.

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.371
[NOISE] I just barely wanna pilot that.

00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:54.691
[NOISE] I don't wanna go too far in.

00:03:54.691 --> 00:03:58.709
[NOISE] Because I don't wanna see
the screws protruding through.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.648
[NOISE] So
I just barely [NOISE] get a pilot going.

00:04:04.648 --> 00:04:09.708
And I don't want to bury these too
deep either cuz I don't want the [NOISE],

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.680
I don't want them to pop
through the other side.

00:04:17.406 --> 00:04:20.417
[NOISE]

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.280
Okay, so this pice is complete.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.500
[NOISE] And as I turn it around [NOISE],
you'll notice we

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.591
won't see any of the hardware
[NOISE] sticking through.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.100
[NOISE] Nice and clean.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.240
[NOISE] So now,
it's time to extend that long boards and

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.180
[NOISE] connect them all together.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.692
[NOISE] We have most of
the frame put together by now.

00:05:04.692 --> 00:05:08.240
But we're gonna work on the face of
the whole feature at this point.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.680
So I've taken the liberty to pick out
the most interesting pieces of wood with

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.276
unique knots in them.

00:05:15.276 --> 00:05:17.335
[NOISE] Because the varnish
is gonna be clear.

00:05:17.335 --> 00:05:20.830
It's gonna be a medium to light stain,
so you're gonna see right through this.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.040
And I figured we'd pick up the interesting
stuff so when you come around,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.760
it will give it some character.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.501
So this is where we're gonna put
this one together right now.

00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:31.276
[NOISE]

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.700
All right, I'm just about to have this wrapped up.

00:05:55.703 --> 00:05:58.300
I do have a couple more boards to put on.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.460
And then before we put the,
the tubs in here and

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.910
insert it into place, we're gonna stain this.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.620
And we're gonna seal it, and
protect it from the elements.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.776
I'm Eric Triplett, The Pond Digger.

00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:08.284
Thanks for watching.
