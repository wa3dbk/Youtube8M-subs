00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:07.390
&gt;&gt; My name is Robyn Sue Fisher.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.570
And I'm the founder and chief ice cream
maker at Smitten Ice Cream.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.710
Started off, actually, at the GSB when I
dove into entrepreneurship.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.320
And took a bunch of classes in that space
and decided to

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.970
focus on something I loved and was
passionate about, and that was ice cream.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.300
My goal was to take a product I love and
make it even better.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.270
Looked into the science behind ice cream
and figured out that a lot of

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.210
the quality of the product is the results
of ice crystal formation.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.630
The colder you freeze a product, the
smaller the ice crystals can be,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.370
and the smaller the ice crystals, the
smoother the texture could be.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.200
So if I could actually freeze it really,
really cold, I could make it to order.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.770
I started playing around with liquid
nitrogen,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.060
which is negative 321 degrees Fahrenheit,
and I started literally, at GSB,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.650
I was sourcing a tank of liquid nitrogen
and making ice cream in my backyard.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.330
And pretty much by the end of my two years
there, I was known as the ice cream girl.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.680
Some people didn't even know my name.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.790
I was just the ice cream girl.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.200
I actually spent the next two years after
the GSB working in

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.420
a basement shop with a brilliant engineer
and really just making ice cream over and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.040
over again with different types of mixing
devices.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.200
And we ended up with a prototype of our,
now machine that we use at our shop,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.260
which we call Brr.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.700
What I decided to do was just sort of go
rogue a little bit,

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.660
and figured I needed something to carry
this, you know,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.330
40 pound stainless steel device and a tank
of liquid nitrogen.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.760
And I also wanted something to sort of
prove that I was trying to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.580
do a wholesome approach to ice cream,
despite that it looked kind of modern.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.989
So the Radio Flyer wagon idea sort of came
about.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.364
I was telling someone that I was selling
on the street, and

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:52.243
they were like, oh, Wall Street?

00:01:52.243 --> 00:01:56.510
And I was like uh-uh, the, the street, as
in the street.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.680
And so that was my life for the next nine
months,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.760
I just sold ice cream on streets and
alleys and parks in San Francisco.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.920
I actually got to the point where I was
totally fine with it not working,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.590
I just wanted to know.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.560
And then we started getting lines and
lines and lines and selling out every day.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.510
So we were able to create enough momentum
to open up our first shop in Hayes Valley,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.440
San Francisco.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.936
And that shop has now been open for two
years.

00:02:18.936 --> 00:02:20.705
[MUSIC]

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:24.345
It's a very, very interesting shop in that
it's actually built out of

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:27.250
a 40 foot long recycled shipping
container.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.180
And what we did is we cut that shipping
container in half.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.840
And half is our tiny little kitchen, and
half is our open retail front bar.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.850
And on that front bar, you will see four
of our Brrr machines.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.949
You can interact and

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.163
watch your very own ice cream being made
right in front of you.

00:02:45.163 --> 00:02:47.598
[MUSIC]

00:02:47.598 --> 00:02:49.543
You actually get to see this fog,

00:02:49.543 --> 00:02:53.100
this sort of nitrogen vapor that forms
around the machines.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.610
San Francisco fog over the machine.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.470
It has like a double-helical mixer, which
together sort of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.440
scrapes every surface of itself to create
the exceptionally small ice crystal.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.510
And then it has proprietary software that
controls viscosity and dosing.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.980
So it actually gives real-time feedback,
and the machine is quote-unquote smart,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.630
and it knows when it's created the perfect
scoop, and it stops for you.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:19.640
I think it's really,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.600
really hard to do two things better than
anyone else in the world.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.250
So we don't.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.600
We just focus on that one thing and we
make sure that everything that comes out

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.380
of our shop is that one thing done as best
as possible.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.270
Having such a small menu allows us to pick
the best of the best ingredients and

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.020
make sure that every single flavor is as
perfect as we can make it.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.850
&gt;&gt; So we got the salted caramel and it was
very cold was what Emily said about it.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:40.707
It was delicious.

00:03:40.707 --> 00:03:44.750
So we got the salted caramel and it was
very cold, was what Emily said about it.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.560
She remarked how cold it was, but it was
very smooth.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.200
&gt;&gt; When I eat their ice cream, it tastes
very natural.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.950
&gt;&gt; You get to see like, where its coming
from.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.467
They are full disclosure on like, the
ingredients, which is always nice.

00:03:56.467 --> 00:03:58.135
[MUSIC]

00:03:58.135 --> 00:04:02.478
&gt;&gt; I'd been in the consulting world and
had done a lot of biotech and

00:04:02.478 --> 00:04:05.630
health care and large-scale big companies.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.310
And I really wanted to go after something
that was more personable and, and

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.700
actually got a real, human reaction from
people.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.150
Ice cream was always a thing for me and my
family that brought people together, and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.500
it was always a thing that was a
delightful moment in the day.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.160
My advice for

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:30.580
entrepreneurs is go after something that
you love, and not just a business idea.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.000
I didn't have, you know, any real success
until year four, and so I definitely don't

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.330
think I could have kept going unless I
really loved what I was doing.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.430
I've got about ten different hats that I
get to wear, but

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.050
it all comes down to making people happy.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.080
I definitely make sure that part of my day
is just seeing the smiles on

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.645
the faces of the customers who come
through the door.

00:04:53.645 --> 00:04:58.263
Makes me very grateful to be, to be where
I am and for the path that I've taken.
