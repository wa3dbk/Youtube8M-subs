The Behringer LC-1 is an excellent choice
if you are looking for a controller with a

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.460
lot more buttons.

Its got a total of 52 and you'll find no shortage.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.170
Designed with a session style triggering of
Ableton or Traktor's remix decks in mind,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.090
the button grid is ready to fire off loops
and samples and give you the ability to browse

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.740
through the session to change the group you're
controlling with on the fly.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.750
The LC-1 also features 8 endless encoders
at the very top and you can also control modulations

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.780
or anything you'd like to assign those to.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.530
On the LC-1 we have one shot samples and gated
samples set up so that when you crossfade

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.750
over, you switch in Ableton you can actually
crossfade over to the other samples.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.070
You can browse up and down or left, right.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.760

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.960
You can browse each device or assign these
endless encoders to different EQs or filters

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:42.760
on each track.
