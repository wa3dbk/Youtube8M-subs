00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.340
we're pretty much cooking up our chicken

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.620
you know it doesn't have to be cooked

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
all the way because we're gonna add it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.460

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.260

that off you know but I'm not gonna

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.960
clean my skillet out because I'm gonna

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.390
leave some of that chicken fat in there

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.490
add me a little bit of butter then I'm

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.770
gonna throw me in about five cloves of

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.350
garlic that I got chopped up pretty fine

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.180
a little bit of hot pepper you know use

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.159
a red chili pepper jalapeno pepper

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
whatever the hell you got you know and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.900
then one large onion and I got this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.700
onion chopped up a little finer than I

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.939
usually have it you know cuz I want my

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.920
sauce you know no not me is chunky for

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.540
this chicken curry but go ahead and let

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.400
these ingredients start to soften up

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.890
then we'll throw in a little bit more

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.009
spices here some turmeric some coriander

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.470
a little bit of chili powder what the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.210
hell else did I have in there I don't

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.299
know I'll put it on the screen right a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.549
little bit of crushed tomato and this is

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.200
like a 28 ounce can you know and this is

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.670
kind of thick you know and it's a lot of

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
tomatoes I'm gonna throw some more salt

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.079
in here too but I'm also gonna put a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.549
little bit of water to thin it out you

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.229
know so then it'll it'll cook through

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.270
but not a whole lot of water cuz you're

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.829
not making soup here you don't want it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.659
to be too water and you can always add a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.460
little bit more if you need to go ahead

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.009
and get it stirred up you know cover

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.599
your skillet up let it simmer away for

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.760
about ten minutes and then we're gonna

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.319
go ahead and return our chicken into the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.450
mix

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.370
and toss our chicken around in here and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.480
then we're gonna throw in some garam

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.639
masala which is kind of a sweet Indian

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.989
spice you know adds a little more layer

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.939
of flavor there and it's good to finish

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.499
up a dish with some garam masala and

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.930
then I'm gonna spoon some plain yogurt

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:32.329
in here which you don't have to do and

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.489
I'm not putting a whole lot you know put

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.590
you know about two tablespoons or a

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.750
quarter cup you know what the most in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.000
here and stir it around and it'll smooth

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.349
your dish out you know it'll give it a

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.930
little bit of class and a nice

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.579
consistency and just a different texture

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.439
just that little little hint of

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.879
creaminess but we're not totally

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.280
creaming it up like you would with a

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.659
chicken tikka masala and then I'm gonna

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.760
throw a little bit of fresh chopped

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.859
cilantro in there you know for a little

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.379
bit color and flavor stir it around and

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.659

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.000
