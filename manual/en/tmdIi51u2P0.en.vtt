00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:00.920
We drink...

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:03.380
Cristal beer.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.260
El Salvador we must visit.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.020
...Of this world.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.480
Believe in...

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:12.220
Meat.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.720
Steak!

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.673
Batista.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.420
And... bitch.

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.694
And Steven!

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.780
He is made an animal!, Batista!

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.080
This is the thing?

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.380
The place?

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.720
Yes, Steven.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
But if you don't shut up, I'll make you one-eyed.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.620
Destroy his spine with the ladder.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.440
Garnet!

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.320
What are you doing!?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.700
She's out of control!

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:38.760
Don't bite! (Drake: Just take it easy)

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.160
He's wrathful!

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.400
Oh, oh!

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.000
His mane has so much swag...

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.420
So...

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.460
You like dancing?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.960
What!?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.110
I would like to cook you.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.820
Wouldn't you like to be my dinner?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.920
I thought we were best friends.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.880
Quick! Put my head in your mouth.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.515
Steven!

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.653
Get your hands out of Vardoc!

00:00:58.665 --> 00:01:00.665
Now I'm gonna grab me some sweet.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.280
What's that sound?

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.220
Only hear your mouth.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.060
I thought...

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.760
You mouth!

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.960
Who will be making that noise...

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.738
Probably some insurance salesman.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.511
Stop!

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.520
I told you he was onto us.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.000
Catch me!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.280
I'm falling!

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.220
I'll die!

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.140
Ah!

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.780
The following preview has been APPROVED F...

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.840
...F DEVORPPA neeb weiverp.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.520
In a world were humanity.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.000
Is invaded by chileans...

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.120
It turns out that they all speak like idiots.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.460
And did you see how their president speak?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.980
Yeah...

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.600
And then...

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.783
We have to deal with this...

00:01:33.783 --> 00:01:34.283
Shit.

00:01:34.283 --> 00:01:35.480
Nooo!

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.047
Snacks!

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.440
Woah!

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.100
Is this one of those fairly oddparents you told me about?

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.580
I'm too sexy for my sexy, too sexy, sexy, sexy.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.840
Yup, fairly oddparent.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.300
Lion, I don't like this crap.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.880
Why don't you bring me an Imagine Dragons song?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.440
HeEeH

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.500

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.120
WeW

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.840
WEW

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840
I like you...

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.320
I mean... I... don't like you.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.820
I mean...

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.800
You nigga.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.300
I mean...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.480
Nigga please.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.020
Run!

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.217
Mom get the weed!

00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:53.107
But when I break up with you...

00:02:53.894 --> 00:02:55.894
What will happen to all these "Ioris" in your  drawings?

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.900
What do you mean with "break up" with me?

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.242
Yeah!, when I'm done with you.

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:00.409
No, you won't.

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:03.663
Aaah!

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.400
I like you ♥

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.340
What magical and mysterious place is this?

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.700
This was once a Nickelodeon's communist center.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.060
But then it started to air trash.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.700
It damaged my TV.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.720
Sorry.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.080
But we need a Steven at least this rich.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.580
(Money)

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.100
That's how I want to be.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.600
No way.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:58.780
Amethyst!

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.591
1 x 1?

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.340
That's easy.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.780
Two.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.020
Failed!

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.420
What we need is Flats.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.956
"I'm gonna kick your butt".

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.200
We need to be fascists.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.880
Amethyst.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.620
We need the Fus ro Dah.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.600
Ah...

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.096
Are you guys become The Rock!?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.140
Wait!

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.920
Think about this.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.420
No.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.920
Think!

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.420
No.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.920
You can be a little...

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.420
No.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.565
Can't you say anything but "no"?

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.000
Holy crap.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.733
What a troll.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.880
Synchronize...

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.480
Garnet is having a seizure!

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.060
Da fuck?

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.280
Oh!

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.065
Steven!

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.060
Qué caray.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.360
¡Viva México!

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.079
Bitches.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.279
What happened?

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.940
I became illuminati!

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.700
If I were not broken I w...

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.660
Sarah Connor?

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.020
Fabulous!

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.260
Hey, Pearl.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.100
You want tickets for Colo Colo's match?

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:19.400
No.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.171
♫ Colo Colo ♫

00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:21.000
Steven.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.800
What on earth are you up to?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.320
I wanna be strong like Super Captain!

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.420
Hey.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.080
Is that a Captain Falcon's magazine?

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.900
Yes!

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.088
I'm going to space!

00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:30.694
Yo know...

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:32.548
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:16.600
Thanks for 1k+ subs!

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.020
WHAT THE...

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.138
FUUU!
