Jon: I'm gonna record this video of these guys on 
 the flying roller coaster the Tatsu, the world's tallest...

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.467
I hope I can fit in, 'cause I'm pretty fat!

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.300
Jon: The tallest, fastest, longest flying roller coaster on the entire Earth!

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.233
Jon: It looks like a lotta fun!

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.310
Ezra: It's got straps on the inside. It doesn't matter- you're gonna be scared!

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.200
Okay, we're on Tatsu.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.767
This is really, REALLY high up!

00:00:40.588 --> 00:00:42.588
Jon: Check this out! Look how high up 
 we are! What the [beep] is this?!

00:00:45.232 --> 00:00:47.232
Jon: HOLY CRAP!

00:00:47.647 --> 00:00:49.647
*Jon and Ezra scream*

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
Jon: WOW! What the hell?! Whoa!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Jon and Joe: (singing) "I can show you the world, shining, shimmering, splendid!"

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.300
Jon: Oh, here's the loop! Holy crap!

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Ezra: Holy [beep]!

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:22.533
Jon: What's that? Oh, my God! I think my bowels went through my throat!

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.800
Jon: Yippie-kai-yay, mother[beep]er!

00:01:34.167 --> 00:01:36.167
Jon: That was excellent!

00:01:36.733 --> 00:01:38.733
Jon: Oh, we're still goin'! I thought we were done!

00:01:39.614 --> 00:01:41.610
Ladies and gentlemen, that was Tatsu at Magic Mountain.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.470
Ezra: (laughs) Amazing!

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.440
That was incredible!

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700
Ezra: All those dreams!

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.930
Always a good decision! Oh, man!

00:01:51.456 --> 00:01:53.460
*Ezra fake vomits, and then, laughs*

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
You know, like, when you were a kid and you had those dreams about flying, and you 
 were, like, "Oh, man, I wish I could live that dream"? I just lived that dream!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200
That ride was a [beep]in' dream!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It was! It was the most amazing experience I've ever felt in my life!

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.570
Most amazing ride I've ever been on in my life!

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:12.230
Jon: And he's had sex, ladies and gentlemen!

00:02:12.261 --> 00:02:14.260
*Ezra laughs*

00:02:12.911 --> 00:02:14.910
