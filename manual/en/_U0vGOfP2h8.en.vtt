00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.241
This week: Android craziness, BlackBerry madness,
and more!

00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:07.839
This is the Mobile Nations Monday Brief!

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.459
TITLE GRAPHIC

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:24.030
Greetings mobile delegates, I’m Ashley Esqueda,
and you’re tuned into the Mobile Nations

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.320
Monday Brief.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.420
Android Central had a LONG week, with folks
frustrated for the second year in a row regarding

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.730
Google IO tickets selling out in less than
an hour, Google announcing Andy Rubin would

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.780
step down from running Android, AND later
mentioned they were spinning down their RSS

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.950
aggregate Google Reader on July first of this
year.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.790
Did I mention all of that happened in ONE
day?

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.510
If that wasn’t enough news for Android Central,
Samsung held their Unpacked event in New York

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.460
City, unveiling the highly anticipated Galaxy
S 4.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.559
I won’t bother regaling you with my personal
feelings about the insane, over-the-top, oddly

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.379
sexist, shark-jumping extravaganza Samsung
thought was a good idea, though.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:16.350
I’ll let Phil show you the phone.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:24.840
VIDEO: SGS4HandsOn.mp4
Ex-ee-nos 5 processor, 13 megapixel camera,

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.429
expandable memory, removable 26 hundred milli
amp battery, a bunch of new S...

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:31.609
STUFF, and Jellybean 4.2.2.

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.979
You’ll be able to get your hands on the
Galaxy S4 this April on all four US carriers,

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:43.350
and judging by Samsung’s previous releases,
loads of international carriers, too.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.060
Head over to Android Central dot com to check
out all things SGS4.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.280
Crackberry had a really busy week last week,
too, with WhatsApp Messenger officially launching

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.109
on BlackBerry World, Verizon BlackBerry Z10
pre-orders starting up, and the beautiful

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.549
new Crackberry dot com design getting loads
of love from you.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.520
But the biggest news of the week was a press
release from BlackBerry, announcing they’d

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.700
received their largest single order purchase
ever.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.410
An unnamed company has apparently put in an
order for one MILLION BlackBerry 10 smartphones,

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.110
and shipments are starting immediately.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.730
That’s a lot of confidence in what BlackBerry
is selling, and it’s great news for BB10

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.980
and the developers working hard to bring more
apps to the platform.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.300
No word on who officially purchased the phones,
but if I had to guess, I’d obviously go

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.300
with Kevin.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.750
Before you naysayers start laying into me,
let’s look at this logically.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.150
First off, this is the same guy who bought
a $500 clock app on BB7, and second, he’s

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.790
been known to do wild and and crazy things
in his support of the platform.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.790
Too far fetched?

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.830
I don’t think so!

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.720
To check out the new look of the site, read
more about WhatsApp, learn how to preorder

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.201
your Verizon Z10, or ask Kevin where he’ll
be storing those million BB10 phones, head

00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:02.070
over to Crackberry dot com.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.960
Windows Phone Central had an exciting week
last week, as Microsoft publicly mentioned

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.680
Windows Phone 9 for the first time officially.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.990
Both a job posting and an employee post mention
Windows Phone 9 specifically by name, so it

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.510
seems Microsoft is ramping up development
on the next big software update for Windows

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.510
Phone.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.210
It’s pretty interesting to note that the
employee post makes no mention of hardware

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.670
testing Samsung, even though he mentions HTC,
Qualcomm, and Nokia by name.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.900
We’re not quite sure how or if Windows Phone
9 is related to “Blue,” the software codename

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.660
mentioned last holiday, but we can say that
the job listing mentions deployment of both

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.780
XAP and XAPP files to Windows Phone 9, which
would suggest Microsoft is looking to unify

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.960
- or at least improve - their phone and tablet
OSes.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.360
That move would be a very GOOD thing for Windows
Phone developers and folks hoping to see some

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.410
more synergy between WinPhones and RT tablets.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:05.030
Oh, and in case you’re wondering: All Windows
Phone 8 devices are expected to be fully upgradeable

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.820
to Windows Phone 9.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.511
Danny and the WPCentral crew are pretty confident
this is a sign Microsoft’s moving in the

00:04:11.511 --> 00:04:17.680
right direction, so keep up with any new developments
on WPCentral dot com as they happen.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.129
iMore’s Rene Ritchie commented this week
on Apple’s iPhone 5S “problem.”

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.770
It’s a pretty interesting read, and Rene
delves into the conundrum Apple’s kind of

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.240
found themselves in recently.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.330
You see, Rene thinks the general perception
and expectation of a yearly update cycle has

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.180
become problematic for the folks up in Cupertino.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.310
Most of you guys watching already read iMore
or your favorite Mobile Nations site, and

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.430
know when products are slated for release
and upgrades.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.180
Casual consumers, on the other hand, usually
don’t know these things, which is why their

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.539
knowledge of Apple cycles is a problem.

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.909
Now, they stop purchasing phones right before
new ones get announced, just like you do.

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.319
On the manufacturer side, competitors are
also able to predict upgrade cycles, and will

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:11.740
launch hardware after the previous iteration
of the iPhone seems a little old, but the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.740
new one is too far away for consumer buzz
to hit a fever pitch.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.539
That doesn’t mean Apple’s in trouble,
though; in fact, Rene points out Apple’s

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.020
already starting making moves to solve this
issue.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.990
But overall, it’s an interesting look at
how a regular release cycle can actually hurt

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:27.069
a company, rather than help it.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:31.080
It’s a really good read, so head over to
iMore dot com and check it out.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.590
