00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.360
Recently, the FDA gave the go-ahead for two
new types of genetically engineered foods

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
- apples that resist browning and potatoes
that resist bruising.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.920
These are examples of genetically modified
organisms, or GMOs.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.000
Although there has been a lot of debate about
GMOs lately, the FDA claims these new GM apples

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.780
and potatoes are “as safe and nutritious
as their conventional counterparts”.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.770
So what are the pros and cons of the GMO food
controversy?

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.339
Well, let’s first explore what GMOs are.

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:37.670
Every living thing has genetic instructions,
or DNA, which tell an organism’s cells how

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.719
to replicate.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.070
If you change those genes, or splice them
with new ones, different traits can be expressed,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.820
like, adding fish genes to tomatoes can make
the plant more tolerant to cold.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.380
And others have added genes to make drought-tolerant,
or pest-resistant plants.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.609
Because a farmer’s livelihood is so susceptible
to weather changes, famine, and blight; many

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.039
use GMOs to secure reliable crop-yields and
profits year over year.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.860
But, GMO seeds are pricey, because big-agricultural
businesses like Monsanto have been able to

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.370
maintain control over much of the genetically
modified seed industry with restrictive patents.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.250
So, why do so many people oppose GMOs?

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.250
Well, anti-GMO critics cite health and environmental
concerns.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.900
They worry there’s not enough research on
GMOs, and we don’t know the long term consequences

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.710
of modifying the DNA of our food.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.790
Others worry about the unnatural mixing of
the genes of different species.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.860
As an added concern, pesticides specifically
associated with GMO crops are reportedly connected

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.720
to the national uptick in gluten-allergies.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.790
But, on the other hand, as one Swiss report
found, “The real choice is between GM crops

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.340
and current conventional pest and weed management
practices”, which are known to have their

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.810
own problems.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.740
Additionally there are plenty of reports out
there that DON’T find GMOs harmful.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.950
One study compared animals that were fed normal
or GM food over the course of almost 20 years

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.350
-- and found that there was virtually no difference.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.590
However, it is important to note that many
studies are funded by pro-GMO interests.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.869
But some of the most well known scientists,
like Neil Degrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.189
Science Guy, have also come out in support
of GMOs.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:15.939
The fact is that plants and animals have been
genetically modified through human selection

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:17.790
for thousands and thousands of years.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.580
That’s why we have domesticated farm animals,
and high-yield crops like wheat and corn.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.859
But, the biggest fear is now that the process
of genetic modification is evolving so quickly,

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:31.380
researchers don’t have the time to study
their long term effects.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.481
But besides the fear of trusting corporations
with the safety and quality of our food, the

00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.060
argument against GMOs falls a little flat.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.799
If you want to dive deeper into the debate
and what proponents and critics of GMOs are

00:02:43.799 --> 00:03:02.510
