00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.214
Is this… hair?

00:00:30.786 --> 00:00:33.480
You struggle… you struggle in vain!

00:00:36.904 --> 00:00:40.940
I know why you've come… and I'm not afraid of you!

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:42.228
What?

00:00:51.216 --> 00:01:01.327
Who are you? How did you find me?

00:01:03.783 --> 00:01:08.020
(poor attempt at poetry) I know not who you are, nor how I came to find you,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.726
But let me just say to you… this.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:12.405
Hi.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:16.333
How are you doing?

00:01:16.626 --> 00:01:18.474
I'm Flynn Rider.

00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:20.561
Life going well?

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:26.256
Who else knows of this place, Flynn Rider?

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:27.962
Listen, Blondie- / Rapunzel ('little turnip girl')

00:01:28.506 --> 00:01:30.101
...Turnips are nice! The facts are these.

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:32.816
I was in great danger, so I fled through the forest.

00:01:33.105 --> 00:01:37.434
I saw your tower, and- oh no! Where is my satchel?

00:01:37.653 --> 00:01:39.653
I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.559
It's in that pot, isn't it.

00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:54.343
Enough! It's unbearable!

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.299
Now I've hidden it where you'll never find it.

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.750
So. Why were you after my hair?

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:02.957
To cut it? (What?) To sell it?

00:02:03.464 --> 00:02:06.087
No! The only thing I want to do with your hair is...

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:09.507
get out of it! Literally!

00:02:10.246 --> 00:02:12.886
Wait. You… don't want my hair?

00:02:13.353 --> 00:02:14.588
Why on earth would I want your hair?

00:02:15.224 --> 00:02:17.266
They were chasing me, I saw a tower, I climbed.

00:02:17.607 --> 00:02:18.509
End of story.

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:19.843
You're… telling the truth?

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:20.860
Yes!

00:02:33.424 --> 00:02:34.891
I know I need a guide.

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:37.747
I think he's telling the truth too.

00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:39.703
No pointy teeth.

00:02:40.064 --> 00:02:41.564
When will we get another chance?

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:47.059
Okay, Flynn Rider. It suits me to make a deal with you.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:47.946
Make a deal?!

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.467
Look over here.

00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:53.031
Can you tell me what these are?

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.540
You mean the lanterns they release for the princess?

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.423
Lanterns. I knew they weren't stars.

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:06.383
Well, tomorrow evening, these lanterns will shine in the sky.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:10.732
You will be my guide. You'll take me to see the lanterns,

00:03:11.548 --> 00:03:12.496
then bring me back home safely.

00:03:13.195 --> 00:03:15.551
Then, and not before, I'll give your satchel back.

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:17.686
That is my deal.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:21.352
No can do.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.252
It so happens that the kingdom is… barely open to me. 

00:03:26.007 --> 00:03:27.523
Sorry, I'll be taking you nowhere.

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.877
You didn't come here by chance, Flynn Rider.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.068
Something brought you. Fate, destiny-

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:41.240
A horse.

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:43.137
So I've decided to put myself in your hands.

00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.490
A terrible decision.

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:47.089
But listen now - I'll speak plainly.

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:53.291
You can try to destroy this tower from the foundations up,

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.175
but without me, you'll never get your precious satchel back.

00:03:59.197 --> 00:03:59.832
Let me get this straight...

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.742
We see the lanterns, I bring you back home,

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:04.408
you give my satchel back?

00:04:05.668 --> 00:04:06.113
I promise.

00:04:08.611 --> 00:04:12.821
And when I've made a promise, I never, ever break it.

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:15.834
Ever.

00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.491
Let's get to the point. I didn't want to do this,

00:04:22.171 --> 00:04:25.750
but you've pushed me to extremes. I must take up arms.

00:04:33.617 --> 00:04:36.541
That didn't go as I was expecting - that always gets the girls...

00:04:37.732 --> 00:04:39.078
All right! I'll take you to the lanterns!

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.731
Really? Oops!

00:04:42.887 --> 00:04:43.984
She's disarmed and abandoned me!
