00:00:00.032 --> 00:00:02.320
- We're hunting bobcats
in central Kentucky.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.882
Wired Outdoors starts right now.

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:09.382
(intense, fast drumbeat)

00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:15.812
- Hello, and welcome to Wired Outdoors.

00:00:15.812 --> 00:00:17.000
It's hard to believe that this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.763
is the first show of Season Seven

00:00:18.763 --> 00:00:19.782
and we're gonna pick up right

00:00:19.782 --> 00:00:20.615
where we left off.

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:21.637
We're gonna join field staffer

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:23.757
Jon Collins in Kentucky as he's

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:24.764
chasing bobcats.

00:00:24.764 --> 00:00:27.252
And any of you who's saw
our show in Season Six,

00:00:27.252 --> 00:00:29.380
we explain to you the numbers in Kentucky

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.224
of bobcats, are doing so well.

00:00:31.224 --> 00:00:33.006
You can actually take three bobcats

00:00:33.006 --> 00:00:34.725
by hunting and we know that there's a lot

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:35.957
of people out there that issues

00:00:35.957 --> 00:00:37.681
sometimes with cat hunting,

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.120
but Kentucky Department of Fish

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.743
and Wild Life Resources,
they do a heck of a job

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:43.483
of managing all their game.

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:45.218
And bobcats have a direct effect

00:00:45.218 --> 00:00:46.861
on all the other wildlife.

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.069
Including turkeys and birds.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:49.647
So just like any other animal

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:50.860
they need to be managed.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.700
So let's get right to it

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.138
and see if Jon Collins can get it done

00:00:53.138 --> 00:00:54.980
on a bobcat in Kentucky.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.897
(electric guitar and drum music)

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:02.083
- I'm out doing a little predator hunting

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:04.041
this morning and it's
kind of a little windy.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.622
I was gonna hunt in a little
pasture field up here,

00:01:05.622 --> 00:01:06.983
but I decided to drop off in this

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:08.338
hollow to get out of the wind.

00:01:08.338 --> 00:01:09.894
You got a logging road that leads

00:01:09.894 --> 00:01:13.401
down to the bottom and
big, thick hillsides.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:15.007
Could be a chance that
we'd call something up.

00:01:15.007 --> 00:01:16.293
You know, a coyote, bobcat or anything.

00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:17.776
So stay tuned and hopefully we'll get

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.401
into something.

00:01:19.401 --> 00:01:23.901
(electric guitar, drum
and crunching leaves)

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.150
(decoy calls)

00:02:17.986 --> 00:02:21.236
Man, we just called up a pretty bobcat.

00:02:22.313 --> 00:02:23.745
It come runnin' done the side of

00:02:23.745 --> 00:02:25.652
that hill down there and stopped down in

00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:27.241
this brush pile and I started to shoot

00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:28.709
it down there, but I kind of figured

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.065
it would come on up here to this decoy.

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:33.481
But our wind is blowin' down through here

00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:35.993
and then going back up that other hollow.

00:02:35.993 --> 00:02:37.558
That was the last thing I thought about

00:02:37.558 --> 00:02:39.676
was that dang wind and it spookin',

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:40.729
but it sure did.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.162
It just got right down here not,

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:44.313
probably 50 yards and just turned around

00:02:44.313 --> 00:02:46.896
boogered, took off on us, so...

00:02:47.787 --> 00:02:50.866
You win some, you lose some.

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:54.459
(keyboard, drum music)

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.595
- Well Jon, you win
some and you lose some.

00:02:56.595 --> 00:02:58.250
And that bobcat definitely busted you.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.757
But he is not done yet.

00:02:59.757 --> 00:03:01.368
He has a particular
farm he's been scouting.

00:03:01.368 --> 00:03:03.152
He's been getting a ton
of trail cam pictures

00:03:03.152 --> 00:03:04.827
of a bobcat, so he's gonna to be heading

00:03:04.827 --> 00:03:05.776
to that farm.

00:03:05.776 --> 00:03:07.157
Let's see if he can get it done.

00:03:07.157 --> 00:03:08.901
- We're out after bobcats this morning.

00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:11.272
I hunted this place just
a couple nights ago.

00:03:11.272 --> 00:03:12.530
I was just hunting it by myself

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.124
and was trying for a
bobcat and had two coyotes

00:03:15.124 --> 00:03:15.957
come runnin' up.

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:17.601
Course I wasn't gonna to pass them up.

00:03:17.601 --> 00:03:18.850
(wind muffles Jon's voice)

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.802
As you can see this
country is just perfect,

00:03:20.802 --> 00:03:21.955
perfect for cats.

00:03:21.955 --> 00:03:24.270
Just little blocks of thickets.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.599
Got brush piles in 'em.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.695
There's tons of rabbits and tons of birds.

00:03:27.695 --> 00:03:30.927
And everything in there
is just thick as can be.

00:03:30.927 --> 00:03:33.065
So we're going to get
back here and set up.

00:03:33.065 --> 00:03:35.630
Hopefully we can drag us a bobcat out.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.963
(electric guitar and drum music)

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:59.852
(wind and decoy calls)

00:04:02.687 --> 00:04:03.603
Got one coming.

00:04:03.603 --> 00:04:04.770
He's runnin...

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:08.349
He's got the decoy.

00:04:23.003 --> 00:04:25.154
(Gun shot)

00:04:25.154 --> 00:04:25.987
Yes! Yeah!

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.154
What do you think about that Dave Reed?

00:04:30.154 --> 00:04:31.759
(laughs)

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.842
Oh yeah. Yes!

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.229
Man it worked out perfect, didn't it?

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.337
Quick.

00:04:40.337 --> 00:04:42.295
We've had this place scouted out,

00:04:42.295 --> 00:04:43.559
been getting tons of pictures.

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:44.522
We said we was gonna come right in here

00:04:44.522 --> 00:04:45.730
and hunt it.

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.890
Super bad windy, we said we was gonna

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.085
hunt it anyway, cause we thought we

00:04:50.085 --> 00:04:52.254
could kill a bobcat baby.

00:04:52.254 --> 00:04:53.600
Yes!

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.933
(electric guitar and drum music)

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:00.008
Nice cat!

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:03.550
(wind)

00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:06.631
Hahaha!

00:05:06.631 --> 00:05:07.964
What about that!

00:05:14.078 --> 00:05:16.911
That's a big cat right there Dave.

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.257
Look at that face.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.599
Whew.

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:29.406
Man, we've had another awesome morning.

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:31.504
Comin' to this spot, been having a lot

00:05:31.504 --> 00:05:34.108
of bobcat pictures in this area

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:36.738
and it's bad windy, but
we wanted to come in here

00:05:36.738 --> 00:05:37.571
and hunt it anyway.

00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:39.986
Just 'cause of all the hot signs.

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:42.599
And man, we got this bobcat come.

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.759
Pretty nice bobcat, come runnin' out

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:47.031
within three or four minutes of callin'.

00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:48.822
Just come runnin' to the call.

00:05:48.822 --> 00:05:51.187
And we put a great shot on it and

00:05:51.187 --> 00:05:53.230
brought him right down
and I'm super pumped

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.511
to get my second bobcat of the year.

00:05:56.511 --> 00:05:58.272
- Congrats Jon. What a year!

00:05:58.272 --> 00:06:01.401
To get two bobcats on film,
is absolutely awesome.

00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:03.074
And we can't stress it enough,

00:06:03.074 --> 00:06:04.228
we know there's a lot of people out there

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:05.631
that maybe they don't know a lot

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.471
about bobcat hunting or they think that

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:09.992
bobcats are very scarce
'cause they never see them.

00:06:09.992 --> 00:06:11.585
We'd encourage you to watch our show

00:06:11.585 --> 00:06:13.372
from Seasons Six, where
we really go through

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.308
the numbers and just how well the bobcat

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:16.333
population is doing.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.254
And lastly, you know we said this

00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:19.714
is first show of Season Seven.

00:06:19.714 --> 00:06:21.743
It's gonna be an absolutely awesome year.

00:06:21.743 --> 00:06:23.860
We want to thank you all for your support

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.085
and thank you for joining us on

00:06:25.085 --> 00:06:26.753
Wired Outdoors.

00:06:26.753 --> 00:06:30.836
(electric guitar and drum music)
