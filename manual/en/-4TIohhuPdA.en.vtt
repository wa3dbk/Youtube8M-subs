00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:15.240
Today we are going to be installing hitch
part number 70785 from Hidden Hitch and it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.370
is also part number 75432 from Draw-Tite on
a 2006 Toyota Rav4.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:27.790
Looking underneath the vehicle we are actually
taking a look at the drivers side frame rail,

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.450
and as you can see there is a tie-down hook
here that is going to need to be removed.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.050
It will only be on the drivers side.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.460
Just take out these two bolts and allow it
to come down.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.710
We are actually going to be using this weld
nut in the frame, and this weld nut here,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.930
as well, as the attaching points for the hitch.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.410
And that will be the same on both sides of
the vehicle.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:03.300
So, the first thing we are going to do is
go ahead and take the tow hook down.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:14.520
As you can see when we removed the tow hook,
these weld nuts are fairly clean because they

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.439
were not exposed to the elements -like the
more forward one here is pretty grimy.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.049
It has some rust in it, so it may be a good
idea to go ahead and spray it down with some

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.380
form of a spray lubricant and maybe get a
wire brush in there to help clean out the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:39.090
threads to make it a little bit easier to
get the bolts in.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.509
OK, I have gone ahead and cleaned out the
weld nuts on both sides of the frame rail.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.399
The instructions do not state this, but sometimes
it makes the installation a little bit easier

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.560
if you go ahead and remove the exhaust from
the hanger here on the passengers side.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.890
It gives you a little bit more room to work
with.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:18.240
So I am going to go ahead and do that now.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:41.790
When removing the hanger, it definitely helps
to use some kind of a lubricant onto the stud.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.349
It makes the removal a whole lot easier.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:54.200
And you can see, that gives me a little bit
more room to get the hitch up there and tighten

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:02.370
the bolts down.
