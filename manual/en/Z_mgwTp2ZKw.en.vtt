Sawasdee ka.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.000
Welcome to Sweet
Secrets with Jenny.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
Today, I have a real sweet treat
for you called "Khanom Chan."

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.467
"Chan" means level or layer,
and Khanom Chan is an ancient,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.233
9-layer sweet cake that
is great for dessert

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.167
or as an informal snack.

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:44.233
The primary
ingredients are coconut milk,

00:00:44.233 --> 00:00:46.833
jasmine essence
and pandan juice.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.700
It's usually served
in its 9-layer form,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.133
and sometimes the layers are
crafted to create beautiful

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:55.100
flowers and
playful animal shapes.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.800
Khanom Chan is also featured
as the First Layer in the

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.600
"9 Auspicious Layers of Thai
Desserts" that is often

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200
presented at important
ceremonies such as job

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.433
promotions and weddings.

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:15.300
In Thai culture, the number 9
is believed to be a lucky number

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.067
that represents
advancement and progress,

00:01:18.067 --> 00:01:20.833
so the "9 Auspicious Layers of
Thai Desserts" is often offered

00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:24.233
as a harbinger of
prosperity and good luck.

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:29.600
As the First Layer,
Khanom Chan is associated with

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.367
advancement and
promotions as well as

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.900
continual success in your work.

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:42.000
I hope you've enjoyed this
inside look at one of Thailand's

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.200
most famous and
auspicious desserts.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.333
We will be going on more
sweet frenzies again next time,

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.467
right here at Sweet
Secrets with Jenny.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.300
Sawasdee ka!
