Hi everyone!

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.500
We hope you’re all doing well

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Today we are sharing this video to thank you all

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.000
Because since the release of our debut EP "Ghosts, Fools &amp; Fakes" in June 2014

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.500
You’ve supported us massively and allowed us to live a dream. It’s incredible, we can’t get over it. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.500
You came to all our shows and that also makes us so glad

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
So

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.900
We decided to surprise you with an acoustic version of our track “Halloween Party”

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.500
We really hope you enjoyed it!

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.000
We truly enjoyed doing this video for you

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.500
Now, it’s time for some announcements

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.500
In 2015, lots of things are going to happen for Glowin Shadow

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.500
We are currently working hard on a new music video and on our new record

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.000
So, stay tuned, because it’s going to rock

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.800
And above all, don’t change anything about yourselves, you’re awesome!

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.500
See ya’ soon!
