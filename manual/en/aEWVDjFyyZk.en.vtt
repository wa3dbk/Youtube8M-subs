00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.261
Hello my name is Anna.
I am a toxicologist working at EFSA.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:15.922
My work involves assessing
the safety of chemicals in food.

00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:19.612
Today I am here to talk about
endocrine-active substances

00:00:19.613 --> 00:00:22.913
often called endocrine disruptors
and their relevance

00:00:22.914 --> 00:00:24.924
for the body's system of hormones,

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:27.051
which is called
the endocrine system.

00:00:27.052 --> 00:00:29.158
But first of all
let me explain

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.418
how the body's endocrine system
and our hormones work.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.784
The endocrine system
consists of glands,

00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:39.013
such as the female ovaries
and the male testes,

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:41.534
the pancreas, the adrenal,
the thyroid

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:45.572
and the pituitary glands
that produce hormones.

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:49.193
From pre-natal to old age,
hormones released

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.254
into the bloodstream travel
throughout the body

00:00:52.255 --> 00:00:55.715
and trigger specific responses
that regulate the organs

00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:58.826
and body functions –
for example brain

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:04.577
and sexual development, reproduction,
mood, metabolism and blood sugar levels.

00:01:04.578 --> 00:01:07.458
Sometimes, only a tiny
amount of hormone

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:09.945
is needed to trigger the intended action.

00:01:09.946 --> 00:01:14.441
Imbalances and malfunctions
of the endocrine system

00:01:14.442 --> 00:01:17.050
can result in
well-known diseases,

00:01:17.051 --> 00:01:21.701
such as diabetes and obesity,
infertility and cancer.

00:01:21.702 --> 00:01:24.452
Also, disruption of
the endocrine system

00:01:24.453 --> 00:01:27.577
can cause birth defects and
learning disabilities.

00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:31.453
So what are endocrine active substances?

00:01:31.454 --> 00:01:34.385
They are chemicals
that can interact

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:37.959
directly or indirectly with
the endocrine system.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.959
They can be both man-made
and naturally occurring.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.722
Other endocrine-active substances,
sometimes found in food

00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:50.850
and the environment,
include some pesticides

00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.419
and some industrial
pollutants like dioxins,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.050
PCBs and BPA, which is used
in some food packaging.

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:02.581
How do these substances
interact with our bodies?

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:03.683
In different ways.

00:02:03.684 --> 00:02:06.993
For example, they may behave
similarly to natural hormones

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:11.014
or block their effects, or change
hormone levels in the body.

00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.698
These effects are not
necessarily adverse.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.099
Certain drugs, such as
birth-control pills,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.260
are used precisely for their
endocrine effects.

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:23.920
Whether or not the effect
is adverse or disruptive

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.887
depends on various
factors, such as

00:02:26.888 --> 00:02:29.661
the nature and the dose of
the chemical,

00:02:29.662 --> 00:02:32.468
the type of effect and
the condition of the body.

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.793
The time when exposure takes
place is also critical.

00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:39.459
During important phases
of development

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.723
such as prenatal and infancy

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:44.663
– the so called windows
of susceptibility –

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.944
 individuals are more sensitive to
hormonal activity.

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:51.475
In other words, the same amount
of an endocrine disruptor

00:02:51.476 --> 00:02:55.181
could damage the foetus
without affecting the mother.

00:02:55.182 --> 00:03:00.092
Can scientists assess the safety
of endocrine-active substances?

00:03:00.093 --> 00:03:03.753
Endocrine activity is
one of several aspects

00:03:03.754 --> 00:03:05.865
that scientists consider
in the assessment

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:08.036
of chemical risks to consumers.

00:03:08.037 --> 00:03:11.133
The results of toxicological
tests and studies

00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:13.795
are key sources of
information in evaluating

00:03:13.796 --> 00:03:17.408
the potential risks to public health
from these substances.

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.920
Together with other European

00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:22.581
and international
scientific advisory bodies,

00:03:22.582 --> 00:03:26.182
EFSA is actively involved
in deepening our knowledge

00:03:26.183 --> 00:03:28.313
of endocrine-active
substances

00:03:28.314 --> 00:03:31.528
and assessing the human
and environmental health risks

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.173
in order to ensure the
safety of consumers.
