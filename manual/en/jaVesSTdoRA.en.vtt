00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.930
This video covers the basics of the
SAP Cloud for Customer iPad app,

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.110
including: the Feed, navigating to
different views,

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.370
selecting items, and the functions on the
toolbar.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.589
After logging on, the first screen you
see is Feed.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.770
The Feed is where you receive the latest
updates on items you’re working on, such as

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.460
accounts,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.060
leads, and opportunities, as well as where
you post messages and view and comment

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.500
on messages from other employees and
your team.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.020
If your company uses SAP Jam, the Feed
looks a bit different, but has similar

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.699
functions.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.469
The latest updates appear at the top of
the screen. Scroll down

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.620
to view older updates.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.570
Load more updates by tapping ‘more items’

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
at the bottom of the list. This also
works for any list view,

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.320
not just Feed.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.130
Pull down and release to refresh

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.860
the Feed.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.530
The filter button narrows the list of
updates.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.590
The button label shows the current
filter. Here’s how you post a new update.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.500
 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.050
You can comment on an

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.020
existing update posted by you or someone
else.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.720
 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.659
Use the toolbar to navigate to lists
of items called

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.439
Views. Expand the toolbar to see the icon
labels

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.240
by tapping the Views button.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.210
Related views are grouped together under
the same icon.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.430
For example, you’ll find the Leads view

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.320
under the Marketing icon.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.909
Let’s take a look at the Accounts view.
Each view

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.840
shows you a list of items. You can use
filters here as well

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.479
to narrow the list to just the accounts
assigned to you, for example.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.200
If you want an item summary without
leaving the list view,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.420
use a two-finger tap for a quick summary
view.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.739
In the summary area, you can flag an item,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.920
mark it as a favorite, follow or unfollow
the item,

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.530
and add or delete tags. Tap

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.950
‘Details’ if you want to leave the list
and see full item details.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.090
Let’s stay in the list for now. The
Accounts and Contacts views

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.739
include a map layout that displays
accounts near your current location.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.519
The list is sorted by distance with the
nearest accounts

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.180
at the top. Your current location is shown
as a blue dot.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.890
The selected account is a red pin, and
accounts shown in the list are blue.

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.150
Tap the arrow to hide the list and view
the map

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.840
full screen.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.840
Use spread and pinch gestures to zoom in
on the map for more detail ...

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.570
or to zoom out to see more area.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.810
Tap a pin to see a summary of account
information.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.010

or view help. Detail view breaks down
the item information into several tabs.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.180
The Details tab shows item information

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.450
