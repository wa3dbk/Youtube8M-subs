On behalf of expertvillage.com my name is
Don with Friendly Computer's and I'm here

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.970
to talk today about buying a used computer.
Now, you've decided that you do want to look

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.340
for a used computer, you've already determined
some of your needs and requirements. Now,

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.150
where do you go to find the computer that
meets those needs? It's not like there's a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.650
lot of used computer stores on every corner.
Now one thing a lot of people do is they go

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.410
to the yard sales and garage sales. Now, granted
there are some great bargains to be found

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.180
when you go to these places. I've heard of
people finding perfectly good, almost new

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.670
machines for next to nothing, but those bargains
are more the exception than the rule. When

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.260
you go to a yard sale or garage sale to buy
a used computer, always see what the price

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.170
is and the feature set unless you're comfortable
just throwing it away if it doesn't work.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.469
Find out if there's a way that you can actually
turn that machine on before you purchase it

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.449
and make sure that it at least starts up.
Beyond that there could be a lot of small

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.640
issues or problems and some of those things
are just inherent in buying something second

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.490
hand. Now, the next place that you can go
and one that is usually a pretty good place

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.560
to see used computer equipment is through
your local newspaper or your local bargain

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.220
shopper type page. Many people advertise in
them. Now, there's two types of people there,

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.000
there's mom and pop who just want to sell
their old computer cause they're buying a

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.409
new one and then there's people that actually
go and buy and refurbish computers and sell

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.740
them. Now, both of these can offer some great
bargains, but both of them can have some things

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.940
to watch for. If you're going to someone's
home, remember the first rule of a used computer

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.040
is if they don't want it there might be a
good reason. So check it throughly, make sure

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.460
what they're asking is fair, make sure it's
something that you're willing to pay for that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.659
machine and before you even go there make
sure you understand the capability of that

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.310
particular machine is. Now, buying them from
somebody who is rebuilding them and does that

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.229
to resale them, that might be a very good
option, because at least somebody who is technically

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.129
competent or sufficient to some degree has
had their hands on the machine and has probably

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.861
done some repairs and fix ups and made sure
that the thing runs. However, most of the

00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:22.790
times you're not going to have a warranty
with that and you're not going to have any

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.519
way to go back. So, again you have to be a
little bit careful even with these kinds of

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.930
things to make sure that you get some references
from other people that have bought machines

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.110
from them or make sure that the price is such
as if you have to go back and you can't, you're

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.680
still okay with fixing it up the rest of your
way yourself. You can also go into local computer

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.359
shops like any Friendly Computer's. Many times
we do get used computers and when we do if

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.709
they're valuable, if there's good in them
we'll fix them up, we'll mark them appropriately

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.411
and then we'll resale them. It's not as inexpensive
as the other ways, but you know that it's

00:03:00.411 --> 00:03:01.180
been certified.
