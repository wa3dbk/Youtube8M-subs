00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.820
Cats Protection is the UK's largest cat
welfare charity. They look after and then

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.720
rehome around 52,000 cats and
kittens every year. Cats Protection finds

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.269
loving homes for unwanted cats and
kittens, neuters cats to stop unwanted

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.460
kittens being born, reunites lost cats
with their owners and provides lots of

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.760
information and help about cats and cat
ownership. As well as being the largest

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.809
cat charity in the UK, Cats Protection is
the oldest too. It was formed in 1927 and

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.670
is over 80 years old. Most of the work at
Cats Protection is done by volunteers –

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.259
people who give their time for free
because they love cats so much. Cats

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.049
Protection branches are run entirely by
volunteers and cover their local areas.

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.329
Cats for rehoming are cared for by
volunteer fosterers in their own homes.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.450
Branches fundraise to support their work
and are always looking for new

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.460
volunteers. Cats Protection has over 250
of these volunteer branches across the

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.520
country. It also has 30 adoption
centres, which are run by a mixture of

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.440
paid staff and volunteers. Unlike
branches, adoption centres are open to

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.850
the public on a daily basis and all the
cats live at the same site rather than

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.490
in fosterers' homes. Cats Protection is paid
for by donations from the cat-loving

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.610
public – people who care about cats and
want to help them as much as they can.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.299
When a homeless cat is brought to Cats
Protection, it is looked at carefully by

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:07.379
a vet. If the cat is poorly or injured,
it can be treated until it is well again.

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:12.670
Cats are given injections needed to
protect them from some illnesses. This is

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.439
called vaccination. All cats are given
medicine to stop them from having fleas

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:23.200
and worms. Fleas and worms are parasites.
Parasites are creatures that live off

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.490
another animal. Fleas live on the cat's
skin and bite both the cat and

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.910
humans. Worms live inside the cat's tummy
and can make the cat feel unwell. Cats

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.850
Protection also microchips cats so they
can be found again if they get lost. A

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.780
microchip is smaller than a grain of
rice and it is inserted into the cat's

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.980
skin between its shoulders and it works
like a barcode on an item in the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.200
supermarket. The cat can then be scanned
with a special scanner which tells you

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.120
the address that the cat lives at. All
adult cats that are brought into Cats

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.040
Protection are neutered. Neutering is a
small operation that stops a cat having

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.170
kittens. It is very important, as adult
cats can have as many as three litters a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.870
year, with five or six kittens in each
litter. That's a lot of cats to find new

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.260
homes for! Cats become homeless for many
reasons. Sometimes their owners move

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.610
house and don't have enough room for
their cat anymore. Sometimes the cat's

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.200
owner has died and the cat is left
without anyone to care for him. Because

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.740
many people don't neuter their cats, they
often end up with litters of kittens

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.810
that they cannot find homes for or
afford to keep themselves. Sometimes

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.860
people become bored with their cat or
haven't realised how much work is

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.370
involved keeping a cat happy and healthy
or how expensive it can be. Kittens are

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.080
very cute but they soon grow up and
older cats are the hardest for Cats

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.120
Protection to find homes for. Thousands
of cats and kittens are abandoned or

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.340
handed in to charities every year. If
only people thought a bit more about the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.940
responsibilities that owning a cat
brings before they took one into their

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.870
home, this would mean that Cats
Protection would have to care for fewer

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.630
cats. If you are thinking about owning a
cat, it's best to think carefully about

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.090
what the animal needs and then make sure
that you are able to meet those needs.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.690
Cats need lots and lots
of love and need to be treated with

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.580
respect. We should always be kind to cats.
They need plenty of food and fresh water.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.270
Adult cats should be fed twice a day; a
kitten should be fed little and often

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.160
throughout the day. Cats need to have
vaccinations to protect them from

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.319
serious illnesses like cat flu. Kittens
have to be vaccinated at about nine

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:53.210
weeks of age, with a second dose given
about three weeks later. Regular booster

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.770
injections are then necessary
throughout a cat's life. Your cat should

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.270
be microchipped – this will make it easier
to reunite you with your cat if it ever

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.699
becomes lost. Neutering is a very simple
and very important operation that

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.990
prevents cats from having kittens. It's
an owner's responsibility to make sure

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.720
that their cat is neutered. Cats need
regular grooming, especially if they have

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.909
long hair. You will have to protect your
cat from fleas and worms. Your cat will

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:28.550
need toys to play with and a scratching
post. Cats love scratching and a post

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.349
will help prevent damage to your
furniture. If your cat stays indoors, you

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.580
will have to provide a litter tray so it
can go to the toilet – and keep it clean

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.560
and tidy. If your cat goes outdoors then
you will probably need to have a cat

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.150
flap fitted to a door that leads into
your garden. You will also have to

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.620
provide veterinary care for your cat if
it becomes ill or gets injured – this can

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.780
be quite expensive. Your cat will need
proper shelter indoors available at all

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.539
times and your cat will need plenty of
sleep. In fact, cats spend two-thirds of

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:09.440
their lives asleep. If you have thought
about all these essential things: love

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.969
and respect; food and fresh water;
vaccinations; microchipping; neutering;

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:22.340
parasites like fleas and worms; play and
exercise; grooming; veterinary care;

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.780
shelter and sleep and you are ready to
share your home with a cat, then Cats

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.580
Protection is the place to visit. We have
cats of all shapes and

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.439
sizes who are looking for a loving home.
All of the cats at Cats Protection have

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:43.110
been checked by a vet, treated for
illnesses, neutered, de-fleaed, wormed and given

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.840
vaccinations. Cats Protection does not
charge for cats but does suggest a

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.030
donation to help cover costs. Everyone
who visits a Cats Protection branch or

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.830
adoption centre fills out an application
form and is able to look at the variety

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.780
of cats available for adoption. New
owners receive a visit from a Cats

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:08.099
Protection volunteer or a member of
staff to ensure that they are suited to

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:13.620
the cat. Together with Cats Protection,
you can help give more cats a better

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:19.229
chance of a happy home. You can find out
