00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.600
I'm definitely happy that I've picked
Columbia Secondary School.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.600
The teachers, they're incredible.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.310
They're very fun, active,
and they connect with the students.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The diversity is amazing here
and there's no other school I know

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.800
that has diversity like we do.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.600
It's a challenge, and I love challenges.
Challenges push me to the next level,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.909
and the next, and the next.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:30.759
Columbia Secondary School's core mission
is to provide the talented students from

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.550
Upper Manhattan and from the city of New York
with an accelerated program in science,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.980
math, and engineering.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.739
Our teachers are very good.
We make very good connections with them,

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.649
we can talk about anything,
we can just go into their class.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.199
So they can help us out and they do.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.199
One of the things I love most
about this school is that the staff

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.800
is on top of the kids, the kids have
a great working relationship,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.989
it's a very small school,
so it really does feel like a community.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:04.250
Last year for sixth grade
I was with my principal and we went to Puerto

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.589
Rico

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.810
with the faculty of staff.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.810
And the course was Biodervsity in Puerto Rico,
and although it was extremely fun,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.210
you were learning about the diversity
about biological organisms

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.439
that lived in Puerto Rico.

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.640
We dropped an egg off the roof in engineering
to see if it survived.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.790
I know none of my other friends
that don't go here have never dropped

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.810
an egg off a roof on a parachute
and I tell them that and they're like,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.219
oh that's so cool I wish I could do that
at my school.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.210
Dr. Maldonado was offering a course
in marine biology in seventh grade

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.030
and so I took his elective
and that was really fun.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.659
We did presentations,
we actually got to dissect lobsters and fish

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.969
and do all the marine biology stuff.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.020
When my dad and I we went
to the open house, we saw

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.549
their philosophy program and we thought
wow, no other school has that

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.829
and we also saw how they did
engineering hands-on activities

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.229
so we were like, wow, this
is a really good school.

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.570
No other school has activities like this
so I decided to apply

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.530
and thankfully I got in.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.350
CSS has managed to attract a student body
that's very unique: the talented Hispanic

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.540
and Afro-American kids of Upper Manhattan.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.590
With a very early point of entry
in sixth grade, most of the selective

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.740
specialized schools start in ninth grade,
right, so we're allowing them to enter early

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.470
 -

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.280
earlier and then providing them
a seven-year continuous experience

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.660
rather than the norm which is that
after three years in a middle school

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.280
they have to reapply again for the high school.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.480
I live in Harlem
and I thought it was perfect

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.420
because I wanted a school that started
in the sixth grade 'til the twelfth grade.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.260
I think it's very difficult for the kids
when they are in eighth grade

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.060
because they're going through a lot
of transformation as teenagers

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.630
to switch them again to another school.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.530
I'm looking forward to coming
to Columbia Secondary School

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.900
as a high school because I'll be taking
a lot of advanced classes that nobody else

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.370
can take, and in 11th and 12th grade
I can take classes at Columbia University

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.350
and that's like a head start in college.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.590
The partnership with Columbia provides
us with many, many, many benefits.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.780
There is its symbolic elements
of being associated with one

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.040
of the great universities of this nation
and of this world,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.680
then allowing us to use their name
helps us incredibly.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.540
In a cultural and symbolic sense
it allows us access to other organizations

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.370
that public school would not normally
have access to.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.980
They also provide us with concrete things
like access to their campus,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.910
the use of their facilities.

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.000
Many graduate students and professors
have been involved doing research projects,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.420
doing internships, teaching courses,
getting involved with the research program

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.420
that is necessary for us to fine-tune,
tweak, improve, and develop our curriculum

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.170
and our school's organization.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.250
So both on the facilities side
and the human resources side,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.230
they add enormous possibilities
not normally afforded to public schools

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.720
anywhere in the world.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.120
Being able to take creative arts,
engineering, math, electives -

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.879
all those things are just gonna prepare
you for life and especially for college

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:25.199
when we get into, you know, like, Harvard
or Columbia University or Yale,

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.689
all those very high-level colleges.

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:34.900
We get over a thousand applicants
for 96 slots in the middle school.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.900
The total pool of fifth-grade graduates in Upper Manhattan
is somewhere between six and seven thousand

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.900
students, so we're capturing about 20%
of that population who, I think,

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.199
traditionally may not have applied
to a school like ours are convinced

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:52.710
that they can and they should.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.330
I had to convince my daughter
to come to the school.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.099
I said listen, just come here two weeks.

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:00.919
Go to Columbia Secondary School for two weeks.

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:07.919
If you don't like it, we go to the other school.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.189
She was convinced in two days.

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.370
It feels really good to be
in the first graduating class because

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.740
I'm setting the example for the other kids
and I like that because some of them

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.599
might look at me as a role model
since I'm in the eighth grade.

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:29.370
It's cool to be a good student here
and my daughter is surrounded by other

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.229
peers that are reading the same books
and doing the same things

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.659
and are excited and want to talk about it.

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:42.060
I know that whatever she's learning now
is a stepping stone for the future.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:45.270
When the teachers are succeeding,
the school is succeeding

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.460
and the students are getting
the extraordinary experience

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.770
that is what this school was planned for.
