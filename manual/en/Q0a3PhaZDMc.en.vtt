YOU KNOW, BECAUSE ONE OF
MY FRIENDS, HE HAD A JALAPENO.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:28.928
HE HAD A JALAPENO,
AND HE WENT, "AAH! HOT!"

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:31.297
LUCKY: WHO WOULD GUESS
THAT JACKSON MORRIS

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:33.632
WAS ANYTHING
BUT A TYPICAL 8-YEAR-OLD?

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:36.602
BUT HIS MOM BRENDA
SAYS SHE KNOWS DIFFERENT.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:40.105
MAYBE IT WAS HOW EARLY
HE LEARNED VIDEO GAMES

00:00:40.105 --> 00:00:42.876
OR HOW QUICKLY HE'S LEARNING
TO PLAY THE PIANO.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.416
VERY GOOD. NOW, YOU PRACTICE
THAT THIS WEEK, OK?

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.518
OK.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.352
I HAD DONE SOME RESEARCH
ON GIFTED KIDS,

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:54.754
AND ONE OF THE THINGS
I FOUND OUT

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.456
IS THAT THEY CRAVE KNOWLEDGE.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.424
ONE PERSON ACTUALLY
SAID THAT MOST OF US NEED

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.293
BREAD AND WATER TO LIVE.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:02.495
A GIFTED KID NEEDS BREAD,
WATER, AND KNOWLEDGE,

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:04.763
AND OBVIOUSLY MY KID
WASN'T GETTING THE KNOWLEDGE.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.098
WHAT'D THE SCHOOL SAY?

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:08.100
BRENDA: THEY SAID THAT
THEY RECOGNIZED HE WAS SMART,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.636
BUT HE COULDN'T WRITE.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:12.104
I HEARD THAT OVER AND OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:14.807
JACKSON HAD A TOUGH TIME
IN THE FIRST GRADE,

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.542
AND BY THE TIME
HE WAS IN THE SECOND GRADE,

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:19.512
HE WAS A VERY UNHAPPY
LITTLE KID.

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:21.514
IT WASN'T THAT HE WAS
A BAD STUDENT.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.983
IN FACT, HE WAS EXCEPTIONAL
IN SCIENCE

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.151
BUT BELOW AVERAGE IN WRITING.

00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:28.321
AS LONG AS THAT WAS THE CASE,
HIS TEACHERS WOULDN'T

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.123
MOVE HIM FORWARD IN THE CLASSES
HE WAS GOOD AT.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:33.325
AS A RESULT,
JACKSON SEEMED TO LOSE

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:36.162
HIS UNUSUAL APPETITE
FOR LEARNING.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.197
JACKSON WAS BORED

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:41.568
AND HIS MOTHER QUITE DESPERATE
TO FIND A SOLUTION.

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.572
BRENDA: I SAW MY LITTLE BOY
WHO LOVED TO READ,

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:49.142
UM, WHO LOVED TO PLAY, MATH
BE DEPRESSED,

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:51.544
AND ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS SIT
AND PLAY VIDEO GAMES.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.245
HE WOULDN'T GO OUTSIDE
AND RIDE HIS BIKE.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:57.016
HE WOULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH ME.
HE WAS SICK ALL THE TIME.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:59.285
IT WAS NOT PRETTY,
AND I WAS WORRIED.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:01.754
LUCKY: IT WAS AROUND THIS TIME
THAT JACKSON

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.956
CAME UP WITH AN UNUSUAL THEORY.

00:02:03.956 --> 00:02:06.759
DINOSAURS DIDN'T DIE OFF
FROM A GIANT METEOR.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.862
THEY DIED FROM BOREDOM
IN SCHOOL.

00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:11.364
HE WROTE A SHORT BOOK ABOUT IT

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.133
CALLED
"EXTINCTION BY EDUCATION."

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.567
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?

00:02:15.567 --> 00:02:18.471
IT MEANS SECOND GRADE.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.773
LUCKY: IT MEANS THAT YOU WERE--
YOU WERE ALMOST MADE EXTINCT

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:23.676
BY THE SECOND-GRADE EXPERIENCE?

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:26.045
I-- THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.547
BRENDA: MM-HMM.
I WOULD SECOND THAT.

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:30.583
THAT ONE IS THE SAND.

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:31.851
JACKSON: AND ROCKS.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.223
THE SAND APPEARED MIXED,
BUT NOT THE ROCKS...

00:02:39.091 --> 00:02:41.527
SO I'M HALF RIGHT, HALF WRONG.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:43.829
LUCKY: NOW JACKSON
HAS COME OUT OF EXTINCTION,

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.032
AND HE IS BACK TO HIS OLD,
YOUNG SELF,

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:49.335
APPROACHING HOMEWORK
AS IF HE ACTUALLY ENJOYS IT.

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.602
HERE'S WHY.

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.405
BRENDA: LUCKILY, WE HAD A FRIEND
WHO WAS DOING K12,

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:56.175
AND SHE SAID, "TRY IT.
YOU KNOW, IT WORKS FOR MY KID,"

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.077
AND IT DID.

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.745
HE'S EXCITED AGAIN,

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.982
AND HE'S READING EVERYTHING
I CAN GET IN FRONT OF HIM.

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.684
FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS
WE WERE DOING K12,

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:07.153
I BET WE WERE AT THE LIBRARY
5 TIMES A WEEK.

00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:09.054
LUCKY: LIKE, WHAT'S
YOUR FAVORITE SUBJECT?

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:10.255
HISTORY.

00:03:10.255 --> 00:03:12.091
BRENDA: THAT IS A MAJOR CHANGE.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.961
HE'S JUST EXCITED
ABOUT THE HISTORY LESSONS NOW.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.968
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE
ABOUT THE PROGRAM IS THAT

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:24.337
HE CAN BE GOOD AT THE THINGS
HE'S GOOD AT,

00:03:24.337 --> 00:03:26.739
AND THE THINGS
THAT HE'S NOT GOOD AT,

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.208
HE CAN WORK AT ON HIS LEVEL.

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:29.875
FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW,
HE'S DOING--

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:32.578
HE'S A THIRD GRADER, AND HE'S
DOING THIRD-GRADE LANGUAGE ARTS

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:34.280
BECAUSE THAT'S
WHERE HIS LEVEL IS,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.283
BUT HE IS GETTING READY TO START
SIXTH-GRADE MATH.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:42.721
LUCKY: THE K12 PROGRAM
ARRIVES AT YOUR FRONT DOOR

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:45.458
WITH AN ENTIRE CURRICULUM,
COMPLETE WITH BOOKS

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:49.862
AND EXPERIMENTS AND LESSONS
AND THE ONLINE VIRTUAL ACADEMY.

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:53.665
K12 LESSONS ARE CRAFTED BY SOME
OF THE COUNTRY'S TOP EDUCATORS

00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:57.070
AND DESIGNERS, AND THEY'VE LEFT
LITTLE TO CHANCE.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.906
TEACHER: I'M GONNA CIRCLE A WORD
AND HAVE YOU--

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.707
HAVE YOU TELL ME
WHAT THIS WORD IS AGAIN.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.476
WHAT IS THAT WORD?

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.478
"APPROPRIATE"? "APPROPRIATE"?

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:07.613
LUCKY: THERE'S ALSO
A STATE-CERTIFIED TEACHER

00:04:07.613 --> 00:04:11.050
EMPLOYED BY K12 TO HELP JACKSON
WITH HIS HOMEWORK.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.551
TEACHER: RIGHT. EXACTLY.

00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:14.820
BRENDA: SHE'S GOT A LOT OF YEARS
WORKING WITH GIFTED KIDS.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.690
SHE UNDERSTANDS MY SON.
SHE KNOWS WHAT HE NEEDS.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.158
SHE ALLOWS US TO--

00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:23.930
TO TAKE OFF AND DO DNA,
YOU KNOW, IF WE NEED TO DO THAT.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:30.570
LUCKY, THIS IS THE SECOND TIME
WE'VE GONE OVER THIS.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.904
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GONNA
GET IT THIS TIME?

00:04:31.904 --> 00:04:34.407
I'M GOING TO TRY REAL HARD.

00:04:34.407 --> 00:04:38.511
LUCKY: JACKSON FANCIES HIMSELF
SOMETHING OF AN EXPERT ON DNA.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:41.681
TRUTH BE KNOWN, HE DID SEEM
A LITTLE AHEAD OF ME.

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.051
JACKSON: BUT SOME OF THIS...

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.185
LUCKY: YEAH.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.320
JACKSON: COULD JUST BE RUBBISH.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.590
LUCKY: YOU MEAN IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SIGNIFICANCE AT ALL?

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.260
JACKSON: DON'T EVEN--
DON'T EVEN WANT TO HAVE IT.

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.562
LUCKY: OH. SOMETIMES
YOU HAVE TO REMIND YOURSELF

00:04:56.562 --> 00:04:59.399
THAT THIS KID IS ONLY
IN THE THIRD GRADE.

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:04.136
JACKSON: THEY--
THEY STOP AT THESE.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:05.804
SO THAT'S A STOP.

00:05:05.804 --> 00:05:08.174
LUCKY: WOULD YOU RATHER
DISCOVER SOMETHING LIKE DNA

00:05:08.174 --> 00:05:10.676
OR DISCOVER AN ANCIENT DRAGON?

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:11.677
DRAGON.

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:12.679
YEAH? YEAH.

00:05:19.218 --> 00:05:21.553
YOU'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENT
THAT-- THAT KIDS

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:26.859
WHO ARE EDUCATED AT HOME
LACK SOCIAL SKILLS.

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:29.194
HOW DOES THAT RESONATE WITH YOU?

00:05:29.194 --> 00:05:31.797
YOU KNOW, I TRULY THINK
THAT HE HAS MORE FRIENDS NOW

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:33.599
THAN HE HAD
WHEN HE WAS IN SCHOOL.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.402
13, 14, 15...

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:38.203
TEACHER: DOES EVERYBODY
HAVE A PARTNER?

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:40.640
LUCKY: FRIENDS AT THE GYM,
FOR INSTANCE,

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.043
AND AT THE LIBRARY
IN HIS BOOK CLUB.

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.011
TEACHER: YEP.
ISN'T THAT A REAL STORY?

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.113
YOU KNOW WHAT--
WHAT HE WAS DOING?

00:05:48.113 --> 00:05:49.115
TEACHER: WHAT?

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.184
JACKSON: STICKING IT
DOWN HIS THROAT.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.952
TEACHER: DID YOU LIKE IT, OR NO?

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:55.888
LUCKY: K12
AND THE VIRTUAL ACADEMY

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:57.957
ARE NOT JUST FOR BRIGHT KIDS,

00:05:57.957 --> 00:05:59.892
BUT THEY AREN'T
FOR EVERY KID, EITHER.

00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.027
THE MORRISES
ARE NOT A TYPICAL FAMILY.

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:03.396
BRENDA IS A SINGLE MOTHER,

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:06.666
SO THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
WHO CAN STAY HOME WITH JACKSON.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:11.270
THE VIRTUAL ACADEMY IS PUBLICLY
FUNDED, SO THERE IS NO TUITION,

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.772
BUT SHE'S HAD TO MAKE
OTHER SACRIFICES.

00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:14.773
SHE QUIT HER JOB.

00:06:14.773 --> 00:06:16.609

IT'S AN INVESTMENT.

00:06:23.483 --> 00:06:26.719
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT,
I'M INVESTING IN MY KID.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:29.054
LUCKY: SHE SAYS SOME OF HER
FRIENDS THINK SHE'S CRAZY

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:30.856
TO HAVE CHOSEN TO LEAVE
THE BRICK-AND-MORTAR

00:06:32.357 --> 00:06:33.926

LUCKY: INTERESTING.

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.663
