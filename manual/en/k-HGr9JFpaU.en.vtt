00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.359
One of the neat things about having a boat
is when it's your boat. I live in Illinois

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.340
where there are horsepower restrictions, but
I don't want to be restricted by my boat.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.640
I'm able to take a smaller boat and have everything
that I would have on a big 520c and I can

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.300
do it in this small boat. We're going to take
a walk through this boat and I'm going to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.150
show you exactly how I set it up, why I set
it up it up the way I did, and some of the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.269
neat features that we've got on this boat.
Let's start at the transom. One of the things

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.640
about a little boat is you've got to be able
to get it going. One of the things I've done

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.769
is I've got a nice Mercury Outboard. I've
also got a Power Pole. Skinny water is an advantage

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.290
with a little boat. You can get in real skinny
water, put the Power Pole down, and be able

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.799
to stop and fish a fish a little bit longer
than you could otherwise. Also on this boat

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.189
I have a jack plate, which gives me 1 or 2mph
better which is really neat. Let's step down

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.479
and take a look at the console. One of the
things that is very important is you've got

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.320
to have electronics at the console level.
I happen to like the fact that you've got the capability to network

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.520
my unit from front to back. That allows me
to set a waypoint here as I side image and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.600
then be able to have that same waypoint in
the front. When I go up to the front you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.930
can see I've got a larger unit up in the front
and that's because I spend a lot of my time

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.890
up here in the front of the boat. The other
thing I really believe in is the Hydrowave.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.210
The Hydrowave whether you catch fish with it or not it's
one of those things where it's a competence

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.400
thing for me. The other thing that is very
important is you've got to have enough power

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.490
to get you around in shallow water or deep
water. That's why I like the Fortrex Trolling

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
Motor. When you look at a boat like this you've
got to have all of your controls right here

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
in the front with you. You've got controls
at the console, so you've got to have the same controls

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.830
up front. One of the very important things
about that is you want the capability to be

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.720
able to use a small boat just like you would
in a big boat. Except you don't have the affordability

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.510
issue you have with a big boat. I can take
this small boat and I can fish anywhere in the country

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.140
and be able to fish comfortably and with the
right skills, abilities, and techniques. All of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.140
the things that are important in a big boat,
except it doesn't cost as much.
