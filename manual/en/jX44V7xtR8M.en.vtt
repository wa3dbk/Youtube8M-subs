00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.580
The BMW 5 Series is currently the reigning
CarBuyer best large executive car - but now

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.140
its been updated to fight off the revised
Mercedes E-Class.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.340
Though the updates are a lot harder to spot
than on the completely facelifted Merc.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.000
Round the back there are some redesigned lights
with LED strips and a new crease in the apron.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.840
There are now indicator repeaters in the door
mirrors while at the front you get an new

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.660
grille surround, redesigned lower intake and
xenon headlamps now come as standard.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.580
In fact that brings us on to equipment as
BMW has added more kit to the 5 Series.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.640
As well as stuff like parking sensors, dual
zone climate and leather, you now get business

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.270
nav as standard and i-drive.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.489
In fact it has a new controller which can
read your finger strokes making inputting

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.180
destination to the nav is even easier.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.700
Other changes to the car's cabin are restricted
to some shiny trim round the instruments -- I'll

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.420
leave you to try and spot exactly where it
is.... and slightly bigger cupholders and

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.620
cubby holes which do help boost practicality
somewhat.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.060
In terms of how well screwed together this
car is - the pre-facelifted 5 Series ranked

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.799
3rd for build quality in the 2013 driver Power
owner satisfaction Survey and this one should

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:22.799
be no different.

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.150

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:39.130
One of the great things about the 5 Series
has always been the way it drives and there

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.870
is no change there.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.880
It still offers a great blend of fun rear-drive
handling, sharp steering, excellent comfort

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.420
and a quite drive at motorway speeds.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:01.750
You can get the 5 series with a wide range
of excellent engines but most people will

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.619
be more than satisfied with the 2.0-litre
diesel in this 520d car.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.760
There is no longer an efficient dynamics model
like before -- the 520d economical is as economical

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.750
as it gets being capable of up to 63mpg and
less than 120g/km CO2.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.900
With 181bhp it's no slouch either as 0-62mph
takes a little over 8 seconds while in gear

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.129
shove is even more impressive.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.250
If there is a problem with the engine it's
that it's a bit rattly at low speeds.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.090
Also it's not quite as efficient in M Sport
model on account of that cars slightly different

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.860
front bumper and larger wheels.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:50.580
M Sport also features this multifunction steering
wheel and firmer suspension which does makes

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:58.480
ride harder, though if you buy this car you
really should spend an extra £1K for the

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.180
adjustable suspension as without it the 5
series doesn't drive as well as it can.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.760
In fact BMW doesn't have a normally sprung
car on its press fleet.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.670
I'm surprised they sent us one with a manual
gearbox too.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:22.140
The six speed manual isn't exactly the slickest
and the pedals are offset whereas the 8 speed

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.070
auto is among the best in the business -- but
yeah, once again it's gonna cost you extra

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.800
-- only this time £1,700 extra.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.170
BMW and their must-have options....

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.510
Drives you mad...

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.099
So too will the fact you even have to pay
extra for fold down rear seats.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:43.230
They are standard on an Audi A6 which incidentally
has a slightly bigger boot, though to be fair,

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.230
not by much.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.709
And then there is the space in the back.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:59.600
It's really good with sufficient head and
legroom, but it still doesn't feel quite as

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.480
comfy as a Mercedes E-Class back here.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.790
The transmission tunnel does reduce the usefulness
of the middle seat though that's a problem

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.900
on all these executive cars anyway.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.949
And out of all the Executive cars, while it
may not be perfect the BMW 5 Series is still

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:24.720
the boss - though its rivals do run it very
close.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.860
In fact you can see a review of the new Mercedes
E-Class here and one of the Audi A6 here.
