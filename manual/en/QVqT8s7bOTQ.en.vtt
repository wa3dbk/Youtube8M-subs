00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.940
["Penguin Cap" - CarboHydroM]

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.540
All right, on to the second half of the Hero's Journey.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.900
Picking up the reins this week is our dear friend, Gab,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.980
and we couldn't be happier having you back on the show.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.900
If you missed last week's episode, we covered what the Hero's Journey is,

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.180
and started looking at the various stages as they are portrayed in the game "Journey".

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.140
Today, we're going to start with the third stage of "Journey", and see if we can power all the way through.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.300
All right, so the third stage is called Supernatural Aid,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.080
which is the moment when our hero gears up,

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.360
when they get some device or power that lets them face the trials ahead.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.020
It's where they get their lucky charm or a magic sword or giant mech, so what is it in "Journey"?

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.860
Yep, it's the moment you get the scarf.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.540
This is the very archetypical supernatural aid moment.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.720
The key that many creators often forget is that the Supernatural Aid, as Campbell discusses it,

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.040
is something you hold on to that gives you, the hero, the strength to do what you need to.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.560
While these items play a very literal role in the story,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.460
they lose their efficacy in delivering a heroic narrative if they don't have meaning within the world

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.120
they're presented in and to the character they're presented to.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.920
A giant robot built of your mother crafted by your father,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.700
the scarf of your lost people so out of place in the desert,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.300
or perhaps, a sword from your mentor in an age of guns,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.520
an elegant weapon from a more civilized age.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.860
All tell us about the characters they're bestowed to,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.500
and give us a better understanding of the world they're bestowed in.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.280
They also help us to understand the deeper narrative, the personal non-heroic narrative

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.000
within these stories that helps us to better understand ourselves.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.100
This aid doesn't have to be an object. It can be Athena's protection of Odysseus,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.100
or the assistance of Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, and Sha Wujing in "Journey to the West".

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.160
But however we portray these moments in games,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.140
it's essential that this supernatural aid isn't simply a plot device, but rather helps us to understand the story,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.480
character, and the world the story takes place in, in some meaningful way.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.460
Too often in games, this is simply delivered as,

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.000
"You got an awesome sword! Now you can fight all the things!",

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.060
which means that even though they are following the structure of the Hero's Journey,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
it tends to fall flat because it doesn't utilize the actual power of the structure.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.180
The fourth stage is Crossing the Threshold,

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.900
the point at which the hero truly moves from their ordinary world to the more magical realm of adventure.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.640
Usually, this act has a certain amount of finality about it.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.100
Once they've crossed the threshold, the hero usually can't return

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.320
to the ordinary world until their journey's complete.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.040
In "Journey", the game, this is arguably one of two points:

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.540
If you're looking for a very literal crossing of the threshold,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.140
it's when you pass through the first gate after you get the scarf.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.620
This moment separates the tutorial from the game proper,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.640
and is what separates us from the last and, arguably, most complicated mechanic in the game, other people.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.320
But I lean a little bit more towards the second interpretation,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.200
that the crossing of the threshold is the moment when you first get to meet the being in white.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.480
Often, Campbell talks about the threshold guardian, the entity which both ties the world together

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.200
and separates the world of adventure from our everyday world.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.760
Journey's being in white certainly accomplishes that.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.700
The lesson here for games is simply that crossing the threshold has a great deal more impact

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.100
when it happens not only to the character in the game, but to the player themselves.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.140
A good example of this is "Silent Hill 3", where after running down the alley in the mist,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.060
the player enters the world of Silent Hill and now has to deal with monsters, combat,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.360
and real in-game threats for the first time.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.960
In general, this may be a phenomenal place to end the tutorial segment of the game,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.620
and begin the game proper as that way the player experience

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.940
coincides with what they're supposed to be feeling narratively.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.760
Then there's the fifth stage, the Belly of the Whale.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.560
This is the chthonic part of the narrative.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.420
It's where the hero must face inward before they're ready to overcome the trials in front of them.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.200
This is often represented by a descent, a moving away from the sun towards our more CG in beginnings.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.940
In "Journey", this is very clearly the underground segment where you first meet the dragons.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.560
This is where you must confront the former status of your civilization and understand your own origins.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.020
In well-constructed games, you'll see the inherent power

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.880
of this ascent/descent metaphor, used to help reinforce the narrative.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.460
Going under the lake in "Silent Hill 2", or going up the tower in "Xenogears".

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.140
This trope has been with us so long that we can't help but subconsciously be affected by it,

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.100
even if it does seem a little cliche.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.460
The sixth stage is the Road of Trials.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.980
We've now passed into the second phase of the Hero's Journey: Initiation.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.780
Initiation's the section when the hero has accepted their role,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.160
and now has to prepare themselves for the final goal,

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.420
and this section begins with the Road of Trials.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.520
These are the labors of Hercules, or the Summoner's Pilgrimage in "Final Fantasy X".

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.780
Here, in "Journey", it's the entrance to the mountains, which forms a very literal Road of Trials.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.180
This is what the player has to endure and overcome before they're ready for the conclusion of their journey.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.640
The next two stages, the Meeting with the Goddess and Woman as Temptress,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.400
"Journey" skips past and jumps right to Atonement with the Father,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.100
but I'll mention them in passing anyway.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.080
The first of these, the Meeting with the Goddess,

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.080
is the point at which the hero comes to understand love, either romantic or maternal.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.080
This is often a necessary step in growth towards the apotheosis.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.240
The second one is Woman as Temptress.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.400
Despite the name, I interpret this one more as "Physical as Temptress",

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.320
than specifically Woman as Temptress.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.240
It can be the allure of money, fame, sex, or power that derails our hero from their quest,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.140
which is something they have to overcome before they can reach their final goal.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.440
"Gawain and the Green Knight" is a good example of this.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.480
Next, we get the ninth stage: Atonement with the Father.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.440
This title is also a little bit misleading, as the father really just means "supremely powerful entity".

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.420
Confronting and reconciling with this entity is the penultimate step

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.260
before the hero can complete their journey.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.280
This is an act of faith, and usually happens when the hero's other resources have failed them.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.780
Arguably, they touch on this in "Journey" when they show the group of entities in white at the end of the mountain.

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.820
Although equally arguably, they skip this step and that moment's the Meeting with the Goddess.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.020
I think it could go either way. The only reason I see it as Atonement with the Father

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.180
is its proximity to physical death, which in a much more detailed explanation in his book,

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.200
Campbell links to Atonement with the Father.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.620
The tenth stage is Apotheosis, the total abandonment of the physical world the ascension to something more.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.760
This is the step that finally allows the hero to achieve their goal.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.960
This is often represented by death and rebirth,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.560
which means you can probably guess what moment it is in "Journey."

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.940
After coming back from the dead, the hero is a perfected being, able to see things as they are,

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.220
rather than through the illusions of id and ego.

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:42.600
In games, this often the moment where your character changes from their normal state

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.940
to having powers orders of magnitude greater.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.220
The problems and distractions that were barriers to your progress fall away

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.080
and become trivial and now you can charge straight to the final obstacle

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.900
that stands between you and your goal.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.380
Then comes the final stage: The Return.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.440
There are many different archetypical returns laid out in the Hero's Journey,

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.080
but to save time, we'll just go over the one that's used in the game.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.700
It's one of the most common anyway.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.880
This is the crossing of the return threshold,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.460
which is the hero returning to society and bringing back

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.700
whatever knowledge or wisdom they found in their journey for the good of mankind.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.780
And here is where "Journey" really shines!

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.320
Here, you get the backwards journey,

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.320
the return of the star, and then...

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:19.240
then many of us start the game over, but this time it's different.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.940
If your playthroughs were anything like mine,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.660
the first time through, people helped you and showed you the way.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.220
The second time YOU are that person, guiding people on their journey.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.320
Over time, you build up a longer scarf, representing this gained wisdom and ability,

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.320
but really what makes this incredible is that they deliver the metaphor directly through play.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.200
That's you, yourself as a player bring back to the world what you've learned on your journey,

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.320
and give that knowledge over to the next generation of players trying to make it through their own journey.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.380
I should point out that this is just one interpretation of the Hero's Journey.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.900
This is how we see it and how we use it, but even with a two parter, we really aren't able to justice.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.180
I'd recommend "The Hero with a Thousand Faces" to any student of media.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.340
The original's going to be a much better source than us.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:01.200
If you take one thing away from this, I hope it's that the Hero's Journey is, in some way, intended as a parable.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200
Too many works today simply cut and paste the literal steps,

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.240
but the steps by themselves aren't interesting.

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.120
It's how they let us imbue meaning into our work that gives the Hero's Journey its power,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.200
so don't just stick a threshold or a Road of Trials into your story.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.400
Look at the meaning of those events and how it might strengthen your work.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.600
The Hero's Journey is a powerful tool, but it's not a formula.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.780
All right, thanks everybody for indulging us in that,

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.420
and thank you again, Gab, for your help.

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:24.200
See you next week.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.760
