00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.059
You know, it's a great program for a lot
of restaurants that have been involved

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.980
for many years or for new restaurants that want to

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.950
get involved with the program. The
public knows about it, there's a lot of

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:18.710
publicity

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.770
so it is a great way to draw customers
through your doors

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.930
but you also have to know if it meets
the criteria

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.790
of your business. The price points, if your
restaurant is already packed during these

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.509
 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.910
times and dates, it may not be the best
but if you're looking to draw business

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.510
if you're

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.570
a more upscale restaurant looking
introduce a little bit

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.829
less expensive menu that you know, allows people

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.089
may otherwise eat at your restaurant, try a

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:50.440
prix fixe menu, it can be great.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.780
Valentine's Day any type of holiday is
usually

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.530
pretty good for the most part for the
restaurant industry in the spring if you

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.179
have a nice

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:01.769
spring when you can have sidewalk cafes
out if you're a restaurant with one

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.190
that can also be great. You know,
it also depends on the neighborhood

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.000
and on the time the year. Some places have large outdoor space

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.290
people love it during the summer.
Some places are really cozy during the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.899
winter.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.329
So it really is about a restaurant knowing

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.500
what their concept is, what they are at their core,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.899
because then they'll find guests to come
back hopefully multiple times

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:30.899
Additional minimum wage increase right
now can be a huge addition of labor cost.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.710
You're talking about thirteen dollars an
hour

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.780
and for tipped employees who are currently
paid up five dollars an hour

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.210
but when you calculate their tips they
often earn many multiples

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.829
of the minimum wage. You know bring
that up to thirteen dollars eliminating

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.890
a tip credit could be a 130% labor increase so that's a lot 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.170
of money for the restaurant industry who
relies heavily on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.490
waiters and waitresses and
bartenders and then just general

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.310
businesses.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.700
A couple dollars per an hour through the
week for each employee,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.479
it really adds up. At the same time they
understand there's a need but

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.179
there's only so much the businesses can
afford.
