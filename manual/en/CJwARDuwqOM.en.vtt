Hello, my name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter and today I represent

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.430
expertvillage.com. Okay, now we're going to
talk about pressure washing a jalousie window.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.019
Now, this is one of the most difficult things
to pressure wash on a house. This one is even

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:22.949
harder it doesn't have a screen on it and
it will leak water. Prepare your client for

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.359
the fact that a little water may come through,
but there is a way to save a lot of damage.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.550
Now remember you want to work this frame all
the way around so that we clean all of that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.810
up. Now we want to wipe down the glass, don't
get in tight on that glass, you'll break it,

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.210
it'll be a mess and then you're going to have
water all inside the house. So be very careful

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.200
that you stay way back from your work, something
like this, get your fin going first, then

00:00:48.200 --> 00:01:13.680
put it on the work. Now by shooting down on
the jalousie, it's going to work like rainwater

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.480
does when it hits it, it'll clean up the jalousie's
and it'll also clean up the area. Now that

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.409
we've cleaned up all of the glass and we've
gotten that all swept down, we can begin to

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.560
work on the edges, the wood and the seal that
is connected to the window. Remember when

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.210
you're in close, don't get too close with
your water stream, you don't want any of that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:50.969
flying in the house.
