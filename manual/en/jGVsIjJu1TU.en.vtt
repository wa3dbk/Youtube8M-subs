Hi, I'm Theresa Mattioli. I manage the
Graphic Arts Experience Center.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.025
We have over 60,000 square feet that cover

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.500
the Graphic Arts Experience Center
as well as the Scitex Training Center.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.075
We have over 25 printers. We have a full
range of Scitex products,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.000
Indigo products, both on the commercial
Indigo side as well as labels and pack.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:30.525
We just added the new T300, and the SPS
products, the Specialty Printing Products,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.050
as well as the Designjet product line.
The Graphic Arts Experience Center are

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:38.075
really two things: to help our sales reps
sell not only the HP portfolio,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
but complete end to end solutions that
help our customers be successful

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:45.025
and we want to show them the breadth of the
HP Graphic Arts portfolio.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.050
I'm Paul DeSantis and I work for an
organization called ANRO.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:55.075
We are a commercial printer that has a
significant digital component.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
We are not a national conglomerate, and I
don't have anyone that can cover for me

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:03.925
in another plant or anything like that, so
when I leave the facility, it is important

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.050
that our mission is accomplished in as
quickly, as short a window as possible.

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:11.975
You want to see your solution the way you
invision it and I think HP's Center is

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
unique in that I was able to get all of my
pieces to my solution here.

00:01:17.025 --> 00:01:21.125
Making a critical buying decision at this
level, I think you really want to be

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.050
on a one on one basis, you know, with your
vendor, in a way that you can ask the

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:32.175
questions that you need to, that you may
not want to ask in a group environment.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
I have an excellent group of solution
architects here on staff at the

00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:39.025
Graphic Arts Experience Center. All of
them come directly from the industry,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.050
so they understand files and how to get
files to presses efficiently,

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:47.075
but they also understand the 
equipment and they can relate

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.000
and very much connect with where the
customers are coming from.

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:56.025
We did a lot of output demonstrations down
here, so we brought files down,

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.950
we brought some team members here that
I wouldn't take to a show.

00:01:59.975 --> 00:02:04.075
They allowed us to, you know, get to the
RIPs, bring files in,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.000
produce those files on the machine, and
take that output home with us,

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:13.925
which I think is a unique senario in that
I have my production staff here with me

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.950
doing it, not me bringing back the answers,
saying, "Yeah, it's going to work,

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:18.975
it's going to be fine."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
We focus on not only displays 
that look at equipment,

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:24.025
but really focus on application displays.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.050
We have a commercial printing display 
in the Indigo area.

00:02:28.075 --> 00:02:30.075
We have a photo display, 
and then back in signage,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.000
a lot of point of purchase displays, a lot
of wall coverings.

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:38.025
We are looking to give them examples of how
our customers are using

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.050
the products in those application areas.

00:02:41.075 --> 00:02:44.075
They really did it right. They took their
time, they build it out,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.000
and it not only demonstrates the HP pieces,
but much more of the solution

00:02:50.025 --> 00:02:54.025
that you can see, and not just software
and the output device,

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.050
but finishing equipment and the different
things that you are going to be required

00:02:57.075 --> 00:02:59.075
to purchase to be successful.
