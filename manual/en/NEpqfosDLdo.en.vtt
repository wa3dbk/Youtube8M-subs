00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.040
Bone Dusters Paleo Ale is beer made from a
35 million year old whale fossil.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.070
And this face aging progression uses thousands
of online photos of people the same age to

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.999
show you what your toddler will look like
in 80 years.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.999
Vsauce!

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.530
Kevin here.... this is Mind Blow.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.540
Three London design students have created
edible water bottles.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.230
The blobs called Ooho cost only two cents
to make are hygienic and biodegradable.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.680
The water is held inside a double membrane
made from algae and calcium chloride that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.800
works similar to an egg yolk.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.410
The hopes are that this can one day be a substitute
for the large amount of water bottles thrown

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.510
away every year but packaging is currently
a challenge.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.110
Zuta labs is creating a miniature mobile printer.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.800
They shrunk the size of a traditional printer
by moving the printhead onto a small omni

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.719
wheel system that runs across the page.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.610
It's battery charged, connects directly to
a smart device or PC and prints on any size

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.610
paper.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.182
Each ink cartridge can print 1,000 pages and
you simply line up the corner of the device

00:01:10.182 --> 00:01:13.610
to the corner of the paper to ensure that
the print is straight.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.810
Biomedical Engineers at Duke have grown living
skeletal muscles that heal themselves.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.150
It's the first time that engineered muscle
has been able to contract as strongly as native

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.590
skeletal muscle.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.020
Native muscles have stem cells known as satellite
cells on reserve to start regenerating muscle

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.200
as soon as an injury happens.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.659
The key to this latest success was creating
micro environments where the satellite cells

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.140
could sit and wait until they were needed.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.250
To prove the engineered muscles' ability,
they injected it with snake venom to see if

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.020
the satellite cells would activate and repair
the damaged muscle.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.580
And they're looking to discover if this new
technology can repair actual muscle injuries

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.920
and disease.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.840
Stanford Engineers are creating a video game
controller that senses emotions and adjusts

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.549
the gameplay depending on how you feeling.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.540
They measure pulse and respiration rate as
well how much the players hands are moving.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.009
So for instance if your heart rate goes down
the game could send in more zombies to make

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.590
it more exciting or if parents worried their
kids are getting too amped up they can have

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.530
the game set to slow it down in that instance.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.910
The body dryer is a bacteria-free drying system
that eliminates the need for towels.

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.300
After choosing between hot or cold air, It
takes only 30 seconds to fully dry by forcing

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.819
super compressed ionized air up and the water
down off your body.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.770
Reza Montazami of Iowa State is developing
dissolvable electronics.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.010
He and his team have created a degradable
antenna that is capable of data transmission.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.750
And they hope this technology could lead to
future medical devices that melt inside the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.489
body or military devices that dissolve if
information gets into the wrong hands.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:01.330
This urban vegetable garden can grow 970 sq
meters worth of produce in only 16 sq meters.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.530
The LED lights help grow plants faster using
a system that can control the illumination

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.810
strength depending on the stage of the plant
reducing an average two and a half month growing

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.410
period down to only one month.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.629
And the technology has been in place since
2010 but is now being installed regularly

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:18.730
in Japan.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.690
The PL01 is a tank concept that can turn invisible
to infrared detection.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.150
Using hexagonal plates that cover the exterior
they control the temperature of the tank to

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.520
match the surrounding heat signature.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.170
This way the tank seems invisible to infrared
targeting sensors that are often mounted on

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.989
drones and missiles.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.629
And the functional prototype is due in 2016.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.959
A 23 hour surgery resulted in a woman receiving
a 3D printed plastic skull.

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.290
It was the first time an entire cranium was
replaced with a plastic skull - implants were

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.390
previously made by hand using a cement-like
material.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.580
But 3D printing allows surgeons to make more
precise prosthetics that can be designed down

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.960
to the cellular level which significantly
lowers the risk of the body rejecting them.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.960
.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.870
Finally, Slow Life by Daniel Stoupin speeds
up the constant, but unnoticed movement of

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.989
coral and sponge marine life.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:44.659
I'm going to leave you with a dynamic, machine-driven
shape display that visualizes streams of data.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:05:01.710
