I looked actually at a few different companies
that build auto belays

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.830
and the TRUBLUEs are the quietest that I've
seen

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.020
they look nice

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.920
they're very user friendly

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.400
I'm Will Russ, owner of Santa Barbara Rock
Gym and this is how we TRUBLUE

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.619
we use the TRUBLUE auto belays here at our
facility

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.529
because of the clientele that we bring in
and because of the location of our facility

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.499
being right downtown

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.450
it allows for allot of our customers coming
in on their lunch breaks and

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.050
you know to spend an hour, 45 minutes just
climbing laps

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.290
and they don't necessarily have a partner
to come with them

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.770
the auto belays are a simple clip and climb

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.620
they have a tether to ground anchors

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.860
simple clipping into the harness

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.860
and as you climb it retracts and when you
come down

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.309
it gives you a set rate that is safe, fun,
comfortable

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.860
no matter how much you weigh, body size, you
always get to safe decent rate

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.290
because it's so quick and easy

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.880
that you can just clip and go

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.000
it just allows for maximum number of routes
that you can climb

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.640
kids love the auto belays

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.850
they just come in and clip in and they're
climbing all over the place

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.400
as well as we've had adults set with a high
climbing level

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:38.580
we have one auto belay set up on 5-10 to a
5-12 route and they're using them

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.360
they love them

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.540
we're definitely going to pick up more auto
belays

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.799
the popularity of them so far has been huge

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.940
everyone loves them

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.140
we're probably going to maybe double the number
we have in the gym over the next year

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.799
we're probably get to about ten auto belays
