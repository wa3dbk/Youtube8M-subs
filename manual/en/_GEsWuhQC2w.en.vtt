00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.020
Happy holidays everybody, tis the season for
old stereotypes about how men are terrible

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:20.260
at gift-giving. Whomp-whomp-whomp-whahwhahwhan.
Fellas, I might be your Santa Claus this year

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.360
and give you the gift of empirically backed
redemption. What?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.500
So the old stereotype goes, or maybe it's
just something that women talk about amongst

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.010
themselves--men are not so great at gift-giving.
I went on the internet and was like 'Worst

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.299
Gifts for Women'. Pedometers. Scales. A vacuum
cleaner. Oooh. Santa themed lingerie. Box

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:58.299
of chocolates and a teddy bear. Let me illustrate.
It's a microphone inside of a coozie. You

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.119
just said you didn't want a digital scale.
So I did a little holiday-themed research

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:08.890
to find out whether or not men really are
all that bad at gift-giving and what the research

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.420
bares out is that it's not necessarily that
men are worse at gift-giving, they simply

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.220
tend to buy gits differently than we ladies
usually do. Generally speaking men are more

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.530
practical and price-conscious whereas women
tend to be more emotionally driven in terms

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.950
of thinking of more of a sentimental kind
of gift, something that the recipient will

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.780
really appreciate on multiple levels. But
there was a study that looked at gender differences

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:45.780
in memorable gift experiences, whether it
was buying a gift or receiving a gift. Women

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.659
tended to have stronger, more emotional memories
with receiving particular gifts. The men tended

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:02.600
to remember more the process of searching
for gifts, giving a gift to somebody else.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.409
So guys it's not so much that you are necessarily
bad gift givers but perhaps with the whole

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.250
question of whether it is better to give than
to receive maybe women actually think in our

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.810
heart of hearts it's better to receive or
at least more emotionally evocative. Yes there

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:24.530
are some absolutely lousy gift givers out
there but the lousiness of the gift giving

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.930
it probably not as determined as to whether
one is male or female as stereotype would

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.959
have us believe. But if you've gotten a lousy
gift, I want to hear about it so please leave

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.370
it in the comments below, let's all commiserate
over the terrible gifts that we have been

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.810
given and hopefully then have re-gifted in
this most complicated buying period of the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.879
year. Happy holidays.
