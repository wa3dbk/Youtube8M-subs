00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.160
HIV is the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.060
If you have HIV, you
have an infection

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.570
that damages your immune system
over time, and causes AIDS.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.930
AIDS stands for Acquired
Immunodeficiency Syndrome.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.260
It is the final stage of
an HIV infection, when

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.060
your immune system is
damaged and too weak

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.700
to fight off
ordinary infections.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.270
When foreign invaders, such
as bacteria and viruses,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.400
get into your body, they
can cause infections.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.560
These events activate
your body's defenses.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.470
The white blood cells
of your immune system

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.320
are part of your
body's defenses.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.450
One type of white
blood cell, called

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.650
helper T lymphocytes,
or helper T cells,

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.570
strengthen your immune
system's response to infection

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.980
in two ways.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.130
First, helper T cells
release chemicals

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.987
that attract other
white blood cells

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:21.100
to the site of the infection.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.910
These additional
white blood cells

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.760
attack the invading bacteria
or virus, as well as

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.410
other infected cells.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.120
Second, helper T cells
release chemicals

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.300
that cause other white
blood cells to multiply.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.930
These new white blood
cells create markers,

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.370
called antibodies,
which can identify

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.700
the same foreign invader
throughout your body.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.250
Antibodies attach to
the bacteria or virus,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:08.100
marking them as targets for your
immune system to destroy them.

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.690
If you have HIV, it
travels through your blood

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.000
and other body fluids to infect
and kill certain white blood cells.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.300
The virus enters helper T cells,
which are the primary target.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:34.400
Once inside, the virus
makes many copies of itself.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360
As these virus
particles are made,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.900
they leave the damaged helper
T cell to infect other cells.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.620
The T cell loses its
ability to protect the body

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.900
from the ongoing
infection and dies.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.700
In this way, HIV
spreads and kills

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.600
more of your helper T cells,
weakening your immune system.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.120
As a result, other
types of infections

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.910
are able to take advantage
of your body's inability

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.730
to defend itself.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.600
These infections are called
opportunistic infections.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.320
If you have an HIV
infection, and one or more

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.800
opportunistic infections,
you have AIDS.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.720
Some of the common AIDS-related
opportunistic infections

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.120
are inflammation of the tissues
covering your brain and spinal

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.040
cord, called meningitis,
inflammation of your brain,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.150
called encephalitis.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.300
Respiratory illnesses, such
as pneumonia and tuberculosis.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.110
Intestinal illnesses,
such as chronic diarrhea

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.700
caused by infectious parasites.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.790
And cancers, such
as Kaposi's sarcoma

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.200
and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.570
HIV passes from person to person
through infected body fluids.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.700
HIV can enter your body during
unprotected sex, while sharing

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.200
drug injection needles,
during your own childbirth,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.430
while breastfeeding
from your mother,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.530
or from contaminated
blood or blood products.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.790
Although there is
no cure for HIV,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.800
drugs called
antiretroviral medications

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.100
can reduce the amount
of HIV in your body.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.510
One class of
antiretroviral medication,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.160
called entry or
fusion inhibitors,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.880
disrupts the HIV
infection process

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.500
by preventing the virus from
attaching to your cells.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.580
Other classes of
antiretroviral medications

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.330
include reverse
transcriptase inhibitors,

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.530
protease inhibitors, and
integrase inhibitors.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.450
These drugs prevent the
creation, assembly, and spread

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.970
of new viruses.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.760
Your doctor may prescribe
a combination of these drug

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.960
classes, known as highly
active antiretroviral therapy,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.030
or HAART.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.790
Antiretroviral medication
doesn't completely

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.700
remove HIV from your body,
but slows it down enough

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.190
to enable your immune
system to fight infections.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.180
Regular blood tests
will let your doctor

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.870
know how effective your
antiretroviral medication is

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.090
in controlling HIV.

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.350
If the number of helper T cells
is high enough in your blood

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.400
sample, your
medication is working.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.350
Treatments for the
opportunistic infections of AIDS

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.790
are medications specific
for each type of infection.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.160
For example, your doctor
may prescribe antibiotics

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.900
if you have pneumonia
or tuberculosis.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.520
To avoid getting or
spreading an HIV infection,

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.700
know your HIV status and
your partner's status

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.260
by getting tested regularly.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:13.410
The most effective way
to prevent HIV infection

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:17.220
is to avoid vaginal
and anal sex.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.500
When engaging in
sexual activity,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.040
you will be less
likely to contract HIV

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.230
if you only have sex with
one uninfected partner,

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.090
or use latex condoms
for protection.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.210
Avoid using injectable illegal
drugs, or sharing drug needles,

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.050
because the needles may
have the virus on them.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.250
Avoid intoxication
from drugs or alcohol,

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.570
because you will be
more likely to engage

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.670
in unsafe sexual behavior.
