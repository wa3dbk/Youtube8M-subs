00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:01.586
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Shaun

00:00:01.586 --> 00:00:03.566
In this video, I'm
going to go over how

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:05.356
to get these arms moving

00:00:05.356 --> 00:00:09.446
in a nice dynamic way
using hair curves.

00:00:09.796 --> 00:00:14.606
So first of all, let's get this
thing aligned back up on the --

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:16.986
so its tentacles are
right along the axis.

00:00:17.026 --> 00:00:22.316
So we need to go in and rotate
it on the y 20 point 5 degrees.

00:00:23.086 --> 00:00:25.856
And I'm just going
to start off on this.

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:29.126
And we'll create a CV curve.

00:00:30.706 --> 00:00:32.956
And snapping along the grid.

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:38.546
[ Background Sounds ]

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:41.736
And by making these
arms exactly 10 units,

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:47.116
it's really to make sure that
my control points are right

00:00:47.116 --> 00:00:50.696
at the area where there's
geometry for it deform.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:52.336
So that's also worth noting.

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.456
And I'm going to -- the other
thing is I want to nudge

00:00:56.306 --> 00:01:00.966
that control, that curve
into the center of the arm.

00:01:01.516 --> 00:01:05.936
And so now I want to get
-- duplicate special those,

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:10.426
that curve and so edit,
duplicate, special.

00:01:10.946 --> 00:01:15.966
And we want it to be every
45 degrees and we want 7 just

00:01:15.966 --> 00:01:17.226
like we did with the arms.

00:01:17.896 --> 00:01:19.636
I'm going to hit apply.

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:24.156
And so now I'm going to middle
mouse, drag this into the group

00:01:24.156 --> 00:01:29.506
and we'll call this like
octo control curves.

00:01:29.546 --> 00:01:36.406
Great. And we want those
in dynamic air curves.

00:01:36.686 --> 00:01:42.286
So under the in dynamics
tab, in hair we want

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:43.946
to make those curves dynamic.

00:01:44.916 --> 00:01:47.876
So as opposed to
the other process

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.086
which is just creating hair.

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:52.866
So we will look down here
and say make dynamic,

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:55.216
make selected curves dynamic.

00:01:55.756 --> 00:01:59.596
So now that we've done that
we do a test play and it looks

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:05.176
like they're attached on the
start and the end depending

00:02:05.176 --> 00:02:07.486
on how you created the curve,
that's how it's declared.

00:02:08.906 --> 00:02:10.936
So let's find out
where that parameter.

00:02:10.936 --> 00:02:16.656
In the -- and it's
really in the follicles.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:22.866
So if we open up the
octo control curves,

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:24.736
now you can see we've
got all these follicles.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:29.206
And so now if we want to
look in the follicle shape,

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:30.816
I'm just selecting all of these.

00:02:31.306 --> 00:02:34.046
In the follicle shape,
there's --

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:38.966
it specifies how it's attached
by the point lock so it's

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.386
by default set to both
ends but really we want

00:02:41.386 --> 00:02:44.186
to just make sure it's
attached at the base.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:49.696
So it will free up the end here.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:53.356
And so now we can see the
curves are swinging free

00:02:53.806 --> 00:02:55.766
but they're not deforming
the arms and that's one

00:02:55.766 --> 00:02:57.246
of the things that we want next.

00:02:57.276 --> 00:03:04.106
So we need to figure out a
way that will allow wires

00:03:04.106 --> 00:03:05.786
to deform this topology.

00:03:06.216 --> 00:03:10.936
And that's under the animation
set here under create formers.

00:03:11.906 --> 00:03:13.866
And we want the wire tool.

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:18.086
And so if we go create
deformers, wire tool,

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:23.636
it will ask you to select the
shape to deform and press enter.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:27.456
So we want to select the
octopus geometry and hit enter.

00:03:28.406 --> 00:03:31.066
And now it says select
the curves

00:03:31.226 --> 00:03:32.986
that you want to deform it with.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:36.516
So the hair system output curves
is what you're looking for.

00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:40.136
So I'm going to shift slight
these curves and hit enter.

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:45.426
And so now if we do a
test, we should be able

00:03:45.846 --> 00:03:50.136
to see the geometry is
playing and is looking good.

00:03:51.246 --> 00:03:56.486
So I'm going to -- yeah
he's looking pretty nice.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:59.206
So what else can we do now

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:00.886
that we've got this
all up and running?

00:04:01.316 --> 00:04:05.316
Well, we want to add some
nice movement and we also want

00:04:05.316 --> 00:04:08.846
to stop these from the
geometry from inner penetrating.

00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:15.816
So that's really in some of the
parameters of the hair system.

00:04:16.426 --> 00:04:20.636
You can adjust.

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:24.576
Let's just open this up.

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.816
So we're looking in the hair
system and let's just look

00:04:28.816 --> 00:04:35.336
like all of these
attributes for the shape.

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.396
And let's close some
of these windows here.

00:04:41.456 --> 00:04:45.086
So the first one might be
collisions that you'd look at

00:04:45.826 --> 00:04:51.046
and so really we
want these to collide

00:04:51.046 --> 00:04:52.806
with other dynamic objects

00:04:52.806 --> 00:04:57.516
but we also want
them to self collide.

00:04:57.516 --> 00:05:00.526
And we can adjust the collision
with offset just a little bit

00:05:00.526 --> 00:05:03.966
because by default, we've got
this thick piece of geometry

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:08.056
and we want just to make
sure that there's some offset

00:05:08.316 --> 00:05:10.316
between the collisions.

00:05:10.656 --> 00:05:13.306
And so now that looks
-- nailed it.

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.686
So that's good.

00:05:15.686 --> 00:05:19.126
We can -- you know if you want
to play with this, you can sort

00:05:19.126 --> 00:05:24.316
of play with their being some
static cling between the legs

00:05:24.906 --> 00:05:29.306
and then, you know, they would
stick together a little bit.

00:05:30.816 --> 00:05:34.666
You could also sort
of push them apart

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:40.336
by having a negative value.

00:05:40.336 --> 00:05:42.966
So now they'll come close
to each other but push apart

00:05:43.706 --> 00:05:46.126
by using that static
cling parameter.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:50.596
But we want -- we'll just
sort of set that to 0 for now.

00:05:51.906 --> 00:05:55.966
And really going to the dynamics
properties under like turbulence

00:05:56.816 --> 00:06:03.256
and so if we just wanted this to
randomly flap his arms around,

00:06:04.566 --> 00:06:07.226
let's find the under forces.

00:06:07.286 --> 00:06:10.226
So we could adjust like the
mass, how heavy those are

00:06:10.226 --> 00:06:16.086
to other objects and also like
the intensity of the turbulence.

00:06:17.506 --> 00:06:21.556
So now we've got this octopus,
you know, whipping its legs

00:06:21.556 --> 00:06:22.976
around in a frenzy, right?

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:26.566
[ Background Sounds ]

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:32.216
So do you want to overdo it
but it's starting to get there.

00:06:32.446 --> 00:06:33.696
Awesome. Looking.

00:06:34.136 --> 00:06:37.976
So the final thing that
you might animate or play

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:43.306
with adjusting the start
curve attract parameters.

00:06:43.886 --> 00:06:46.546
And these are the start
curves right here.

00:06:47.716 --> 00:06:52.146
And so after creating this all,
you can bend these start curves

00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:57.766
to be -- look like they're
wrapped around some object

00:06:57.766 --> 00:07:00.986
if you want like the
octopus to catch a fish

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:03.086
or drag a boat into the ocean.

00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:07.006
You could animate the start
curve by tract parameter.

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:09.316
And so right now these
start curves are just sort

00:07:09.316 --> 00:07:14.436
of still splayed
out but you know,

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:17.646
by moving these curves you
could sort of get some really --

00:07:17.826 --> 00:07:21.766
he's look likes he's doing
some dancing but anyways.

00:07:22.236 --> 00:07:24.436
That's a really great start

00:07:24.546 --> 00:07:26.446
and I think this is a good
place to end the video.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.626
Thanks so much for watching.
