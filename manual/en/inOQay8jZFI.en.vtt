00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.051
- [Voiceover] This bone is the radius.

00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:08.518
A dead giveaway is this nice
flat round head of the radius,

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.333
the nice flat round head of the radius.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.911
Pick it up and you can
kinda see how it's rounded.

00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:20.364
Now, this nice flat round
head is just proximal

00:00:20.364 --> 00:00:23.373
to the neck of the radius, the neck.

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.738
While this bump you see down here,

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:31.000
that bump is going to be
the radial tuberosity.

00:00:32.144 --> 00:00:36.178
So, it goes head, neck, radial tuberosity.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:40.189
If you continue down the bone,

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:42.978
you get down to this point.

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:46.676
That point is going to
be the styloid process,

00:00:47.807 --> 00:00:49.438
the styloid process.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.571
Since we had a radial notch on the ulna,

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:58.057
we should have an ulnar
notch on the radius.

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:03.494
This smoothish portion right here,

00:01:03.494 --> 00:01:07.086
that is going to be the ulnar notch.

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:10.756
You can see it articulates the ulna.

00:01:10.756 --> 00:01:13.361
So, the head of the radius
goes to the radial notch;

00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.970
the head of the ulna
goes to the ulnar notch,

00:01:16.857 --> 00:01:19.953
forming the two bones of your forearm.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.832
So, this is going to be your radius.

00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:30.046
We need to figure out
is it a right or a left?

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.265
We know the head has to be proximal,

00:01:35.265 --> 00:01:37.924
because the head articulates with what?

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:41.261
It articulates with the
ulna at the radial notch,

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.904
but it could also be
right at the capitulum,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.409
right at the capitulum of the humerus.

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:55.329
So, we have the head proximal.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.909
We need to have the
styloid process distal,

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.992
but also lateral.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.884
How do we know if it goes
like this on the right side,

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:07.808
or like this on the left side?

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:12.947
Notice that there's a
shallow scoop right here.

00:02:12.947 --> 00:02:17.209
This shallow scoop has to face anterior.

00:02:18.169 --> 00:02:22.557
That makes this a right radius,

00:02:22.557 --> 00:02:27.468
head proximal, styloid process lateral,

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:29.790
and the shallow scoop, or shallow indent,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.590
is going to be facing anterior,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.715
a right radius.
