Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today, I'm going to show you

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.630
a really nice, quick, easy way to make cannelloni.
Okay, so I just made six, I didn't really

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.690
feel the need to make more than that. And
also I started running out of mixture. So,

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.830
we're just going to take a ladle here, and
go right across the center. Try to evenly

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.461
distribute this as best you can when you do
it. And what you--you don't really want to

00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:34.960
leave a whole lot exposed on these, you know,
just a tiny bit on the ends, because what

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.469
will happen is the pasta will get crunchy
in the oven, and that's not what you want.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.309
So, and you'll see about leaving this really
thick and pasty, how it stands up on top--that's

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.679
exactly what we want it to look like. We want
it to have its own body so it stands up there.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:57.600
Just a little more here. You want to make
sure it's even too. That's another key thing.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.409
So you can just use the bottom of your ladle,
do little circles like this--oops, a spot

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.060
that isn't so even. And that's pretty much
your top layer. Now I know a lot of people,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.009
what they'll do is, just to be on the safe
side, they'll add a couple of tablespoons

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.409
of water here in the bottom. I do it too.
It just helps when it starts rolling off,

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.369
it'll help kind of steam up a little bit,
so just a last little final step. Also, the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.340
last thing we're going to do before we chuck
this in the oven, got all of our sauce on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.729
there, now comes that fresh-grated parmesan
cheese I told you about. So we're just going

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:46.799
sprinkle that all over the top, once again
nice and evenly, and you can even use shredded

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.950
parmesan, but the grated stuff really forms
a nice, like a non-gooey kind of a topping

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.900
on here. So I think our oven is probably hot
enough now, let's go ahead and toss this in

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.411
the oven. Like I said, we're going to go for
about 22 to 25 minutes, depending on your

00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:07.659
oven, at 400 degrees, because this is really
pretty much cooked, all we're doing is really

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.860
warming it all the way through. So let's go
ahead and get this in the oven, and we'll

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.840
check it out when it's done.
