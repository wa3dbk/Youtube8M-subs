00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:04.006
The day that started with good times ends in what's behind you.

00:01:04.048 --> 00:01:15.157
Yes the day started really well, had to overtake a lot of cars.

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:24.935
Everything went really well, also is a very long dune section.

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:29.830
We were stuck for only 5 minutes.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:37.698
So after passing CP2 we were heading to the finish.

00:01:38.251 --> 00:01:45.181
And then on 12 kms before the finish we rolled the car, about 5 times.

00:01:45.725 --> 00:01:54.462
In the roadbook there was no danger, just a slight step.

00:01:55.088 --> 00:02:08.396
After going trough a ditch I thought I could move on but as a big surprise there was another ditch.

00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:14.067
The back of the car jumped high up and I couldn't save it anymore.

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:23.046
Rolled on the right side of the car and it looked really bad.

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:32.963
Now back in the bivouac it seems it is not that bad. So we will try to start on Tuesday.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.123
Tom, how was your day despite the crash of Peter?

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:58.864
Our day was much better then Peter Junior. Again had a puncture that cost us about 4/5 minutes.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.743
We had a good drive, didn't take any risks in the dunes.

00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:09.781
That's good. What are the expectations for the rest of the rally?

00:03:09.974 --> 00:03:13.893
We are now at position 12, I think that is were we belong. 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.727
We hope to move a bit up because people are making mistakes.

00:03:18.754 --> 00:03:24.003
We are not driving on safe, but on 80/90% and continue what we are doing.
