00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:08.670
Hi, I'm Olga and I'm Rotem. We're former professional
swimmers and we're here on behalf of Expert

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.320
Village. Okay so now we're going to show you
how the kick is done. We're going to start

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:27.550
outside of the water using a kick board that
you can get at any swimming pool that you're

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:42.873
going to and then we're going to get in the
water and show you how it is done inside the

00:00:42.873 --> 00:00:43.873
water. So if you're parent trying to teach
your child how to swim or an adult trying

00:00:43.873 --> 00:00:44.873
to learn how to swim for the first time, it's
a good tool to use. Okay, so we're going to

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:45.873
put this kick board on the floor and lay with
your stomach on the kick board. The feet are

00:00:45.873 --> 00:00:48.930
close together when you start the stroke.
Alright, you open slightly your knees and

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:55.472
bend your knees towards your body as much
as possible. It's real important that it be

00:00:55.472 --> 00:01:03.870
as close as possible cause you want to get
a strong kick. Then you open your legs, the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.020
knees don't move they stay in the same position.
In a circular motion you bring the feet back

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:18.180
to the same position you started from. Okay,
so one more time, you bring your feet close

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.824
to your body with your knees slightly open,
you circle the knees outside and bring it

00:01:23.824 --> 00:01:30.560
back. Make sure you don't do this and this,
because you're not going to get any kicks

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:54.040
out of it. Now, we're going to show you the
same thing but in a different angle so you

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.040
can see how it works. In the breaststroke
kicks simulates to the frog, okay in the water.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.060
If you ever see a frog in the water, how a
frog swims. So the same thing one more time,

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.710
you start with your feet, you're bending from
your knees, both feet together and make sure

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.370
the knees are slightly open. Okay, then you
circle the knees outside of your body and

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.269
bring it back straight from the position you
started from.
