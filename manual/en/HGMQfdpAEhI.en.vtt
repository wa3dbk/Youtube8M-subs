00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.800
G'day everyone, Ian Fieggen here,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.700
also known as "Professor Shoelace".

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.500
Today's shoe-lacing tutorial

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.700
is about "Gap Lacing".

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now this method has a couple of uses.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.700
The most common use is for

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.800
runners and so forth who suffer pain

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.500
on the upper ridge, or "instep", of the foot.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.200
"Gap Lacing" obviously has a gap there

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.500
at the ... painful area.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
Firstly it stops the laces

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.000
from pressing down into it.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000
And secondly it allows the shoe

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200
to open up at that point there.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.200
The second use for "Gap Lacing"

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.600
is when you've got high boots

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.200
you can actually put a gap

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200
at the ankle area

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.800
and that will allow the ankle

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.200
area to flex a bit more,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.400
especially if you have like

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.300
hard leather boots and so forth.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.200
Now here's how "Gap Lacing" looks

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200
on my "Ian's Shoelace Site",

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
which, if I animate,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.000
you'll see it's just basically

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
criss-crossing up the shoe,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.200
at the middle there's a "gap",

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.200
continuing the criss-crossing

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.000
to the top of the shoe.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now let's look at that on a real shoe.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.500
I've started this with the lacing

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.000
already coming out the bottom eyelets.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.000
Now we... make... our first crossover

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
by going under the sides

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and out through the next eyelets.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.400
Again, crossing under

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.000
and out through the next eyelets.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.600
And here we've already hit

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
the middle of the shoe,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.300
and this is where we create the "gap".

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600
Simply go... across... the top

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.000
and in through the next eyelet pair

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.400
before continuing... to the other side.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.000
Again, we go... up

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
and in through the next eyelet pair

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.400
before continuing across the shoe.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
And then we finish as normal.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.400
At the top, tie your laces;

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.400
I'm using my world's fastest "Ian Knot",

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.000
and that's it!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.400
You will notice because

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.200
we haven't gone across the shoe

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200
at one point, we've actually used up

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.200
a tiny bit less shoelace,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000
and you'll end up with slightly longer ends

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.600
on the shoe than you would...

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.600
with... normal... shoelacing.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
So that's it, that's "Gap Lacing".

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Hope you enjoyed it!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.000
