[MUSIC - "LOVE AT HOME"]

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.600
(SINGING) There is
beauty all around

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:29.700
when there's love at home;
there is joy in ev'ry sound

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.400
when there's love at home.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Peace and plenty here abide,
smiling sweet on ev'ry side.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:57.000
Time doth softly, sweetly glide
when there's love at home.

00:01:09.217 --> 00:01:10.800
[MUSIC "LET US OFT SPEAK KIND
 WORDS"]

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.800
(SINGING) Let us oft speak
kind words to each other

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.600
at home or where'er we
may be; like the warblings

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.500
of birds on the heather, the
tones will be welcome and free.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.200
They'll gladden the
heart that's repining,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.500
give courage and
hope from above,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.200
and where the dark
clouds hide the shining,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.484
let in the sunlight of love.

00:01:56.484 --> 00:01:58.775
[MUSIC "LOVE AT HOME" AND
"LET US OFT SPEAK KIND WORDS"

MEDLEY]

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:24.900
(SINGING) Like the sunbeams of
morn on the mountains, the soul

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.900
they awake to good
cheer; like the murmur

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.300
of cool, pleasant fountains,
they fall in sweet cadences

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.700
near.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.700
Let's oft, then, in
kindly toned voices,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:55.200
our mutual friendship
renew, till heart

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:06.000
meets with heart and rejoices
in friendship that ever is true.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.700
Oh, the kind words we give shall
in memory live and sunshine

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.800
forever impart.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.000
Let us oft speak kind
words to each other;

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.700
kind words are sweet
tones of the heart.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:56.400
Kindly heaven smiles above; all
the world is filled with love.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:08.700
Sweeter sings the brooklet by;
brighter beams the azure sky.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:31.250
Oh, there's One who smiles on
high when there's love at home.
