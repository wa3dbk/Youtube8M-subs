00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.650
Albino lobsters — the rarest of all the
crustacean’s color mutations — are believed

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.270
to be about one in 100 million.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.830
So, what are the odds of two midcoast lobstermen
catching two albino lobsters within a week

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.960
for same lobster pound?

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.300
Maybe too unlikely to be true.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.650
On Thursday, lobsterman Bert Philbrick caught
a white lobster off Owls Head, less than a

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.119
week after Joe Bates caught one about a mile
off the Rockland breakwater.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.000
The pair look ghostly compared to the greenish-brown
lobsters that normally come up in traps along

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
the coast.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.840
The white shells naturally led to the conclusion
that the lobsters were ultra-rare albinos.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.609
But Bob Bayer, executive director of the University
of Maine’s Lobster Institute, isn’t so

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:46.609
sure.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.300
Bayer said he’s only seen a couple of albino
lobsters in his lifetime.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.410
“We get blues (and) we get red ones every
summer.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.660
That’s not a big deal.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.519
This is,” he said, if they’re actually
albino.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.820
Looking at a picture, however, Bayer said,
it seemed at least one, if not both, have

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.820
a blueish hue.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.689
“I don’t think they’re albinos.

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.310
It looks like there’s some pigmentation
there,” he said.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.120
Still, whatever they are is highly unusual,
said Bayer.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.520
“It’s nothing I’ve seen before.”

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.479
Neither has Bates, who has 300 traps off Rockland
and has been lobstering since 1990.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.240
He also caught a yellow lobster Monday, estimated
to be one in 30 million, but that wasn’t

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.240
a first.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.260
“I was surprised.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.680
Shocked, actually,” he said about the seeing
the white lobster in his trap.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.579
Both white lobsters were under legal size
— about 5 or 6 years old, estimated Terry

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.720
Watkinson, owner of the Owls Head Lobster
Co., where the fishermen brought their rare

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.720
catches.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.190
Normally, that would mean they’d have to
be thrown back into the ocean to mature for

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.430
another year or two.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.930
But the Maine Marine Patrol occasionally makes
exceptions.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.509
On Friday, they were still floating in a crate
at the Owls Head lobster pound.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.380
They wouldn’t be for long.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.910
One was claimed by Brooks Trap Mill, a Thomaston
lobstering supply store with a tank full of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.160
marine life.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.260
The other is destined for the Maine State
Aquarium in Boothbay Harbor, adding to the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.061
spectrum of colored lobsters already on display
there.

00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:28.070
That’s where a blue lobster caught two weeks
ago off Pine Point in Scarborough was taken.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.130
Blue lobsters are estimated by the Lobster
Institute to be one in 2 million.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.040
Earlier this year, a lobsterman pulled a one-in-30
million , sporting patches of orange and dark

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.520
blue on its shell, out of a trap in New Hampshire.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.940
It was sent to a Hampton aquarium.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.170
In late July, a bright yellow lobster of unknown
origin ended up in a supermarket tank in Florida,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.770
where a customer bought it and sent it to
an aquarium in Rye, New Hampshire.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.780
But all of those colorful catches would pale
in comparison to coming across an elusive

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.480
albino, let alone two.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.370
That’s even considering that the estimates
of how rare each color is are “an absolute

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.470
guess,” Bayer admitted.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.370
If more similar-looking lobsters are caught
in the area, he said, there’s probably been

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.940
“some sort of unusual breeding.”

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.780
As for the lobsters caught this week, Bayer
said he would like to see them stay around

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.130
for a while and get fed food high in carotenoids,
like crab and periwinkles.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.070
Such food will darken the shell, if they’re
not albino.

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.350
A quicker test would be to cook them.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.840
True albinos would stay white, Bayer said.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.151
But no one’s suggesting that.
