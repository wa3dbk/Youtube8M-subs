00:00:07.976 --> 00:00:10.646
&gt;&gt;Gus: Today, you're gonna bring
all the work that you've done

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:15.146
to the cafeteria for
the culminating event.

00:00:15.496 --> 00:00:19.146
&gt;&gt;And I think each of us are
gonna describe what you need.

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:22.796
For tech ed obviously, you
need your kinetic sculpture.

00:00:23.296 --> 00:00:27.626
I think it's best that each
person brings their own sculpture

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:33.996
down there, because we don't
want any accidents to happen.

00:00:33.996 --> 00:00:36.686
&gt;&gt;Paul: Also, we don't want you to
forget those two guiding questions:

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:38.926
how does art reflect the community?

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:41.016
And the other one is,
how does science,

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:43.396
math and engineering connect to art?

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:47.656
And also you're gonna wanna
show them your Google Maps

00:00:48.136 --> 00:00:49.846
on the public art sites, okay?

00:00:50.226 --> 00:00:53.426
And all of those things, you have
to be prepared to talk about.

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:54.196
And also, you don't wanna--

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:55.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The eighty plus students

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.116
in King Middle School's
York House embarked

00:00:58.116 --> 00:01:02.166
on a twelve week learning
expedition in the fall of 2009.

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:05.236
They researched and
photographed public art sites,

00:01:05.776 --> 00:01:09.926
produced a Google Maps walking
tour and created a model

00:01:09.926 --> 00:01:14.296
of an original kinetic sculpture,
and a proposal to install it.

00:01:14.636 --> 00:01:17.596
&gt;&gt;Paul: I think it's fine tuning a
product to a certain extent and--

00:01:17.596 --> 00:01:18.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The project began

00:01:18.546 --> 00:01:21.026
with a teacher planning
session over the summer.

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:24.506
&gt;&gt;It's very difficult to have a
really deep, meaningful conversation

00:01:24.706 --> 00:01:26.686
around curriculum and how
that's all gonna fit together

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:30.316
if you don't actually have the
thing made and can connect the kind

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:31.646
of learning that's most important.

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:35.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Once the goals were
set, tech ed teacher, Gus Goodwin,

00:01:35.496 --> 00:01:38.446
took up the challenge of
building a model prototype.

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:40.606
&gt;&gt;Gus: So I decided I'd
take a sculpture course,

00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:43.476
and so this is what I
made in that course.

00:01:43.476 --> 00:01:48.986
So I brought this in and the kids
right away pointed out, "Well,

00:01:48.986 --> 00:01:52.636
it doesn't work Mr.
Goodwin," or, "This is bent

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:55.706
and you need to fix that and that."

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:58.436
It was pretty funny.

00:02:00.046 --> 00:02:03.476
&gt;&gt;That's pretty, yeah, Okay,
try to get one with the sun.

00:02:04.106 --> 00:02:07.296
&gt;&gt;Sarah: Today we're out here taking
photos of already existing public art

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:09.976
that we're studying
in social studies.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:13.896
&gt;&gt;Sarah: We're gonna make a virtual
tour where if you click on the piece

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:20.836
of art, it will come up with
information that we've found

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:21.976
and written about the
statue or piece of art.

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:25.926
&gt;&gt;Paul: Log in using this
address right there under Google

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:27.706
and then we go to my maps.

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:31.366
Students are working with Google
Maps and they are identifying all

00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:33.886
of the public art pieces that
exist in the city of Portland.

00:02:34.246 --> 00:02:39.316
And then all of our kids have created
a description of different art pieces

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:42.706
out there, so that these different
public art sites can be connected

00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:43.436
as a walking tour.

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:44.156
&gt;&gt;Student: I know how to get there.

00:02:44.396 --> 00:02:45.136
&gt;&gt;You know how to get there?

00:02:45.276 --> 00:02:46.366
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So if we
went to the other map,

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:47.306
would you be able to get us there?

00:02:47.706 --> 00:02:49.916
&gt;&gt;Paul: So basically, everything
that anybody would want to know

00:02:49.916 --> 00:02:51.576
about that public art
piece will be here,

00:02:51.576 --> 00:02:53.086
and it's designed by our students.

00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:55.906
So it's sort of a public
art public service.

00:02:56.296 --> 00:02:59.156
&gt;&gt;Asiya: This is called Art
Underfoot, because they got

00:02:59.156 --> 00:03:03.506
like leaves, feathers, like anything
that you can find on the ground,

00:03:03.596 --> 00:03:06.446
and they've made it out of
like bronze bricks and stuff.

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:10.476
And I found out that Art Underfoot
wasn't made by one artist.

00:03:10.476 --> 00:03:12.596
It was like a community of people.

00:03:12.596 --> 00:03:17.556
It kinda shows our community can
come together with different people

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:24.896
and how they can help each
other make one piece of art.

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:29.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In language arts
class, students wrote letters

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.266
to Portland city officials
and created proposals

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:40.376
for the installation of their
original works of public art.

00:03:40.376 --> 00:03:42.166
&gt;&gt;Gus: I loved shop
when I was in school,

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:47.346
but the big difference is the teacher
had a plan and said, "Okay, kids,

00:03:47.346 --> 00:03:51.446
we're making this pump handle lamp
and if you follow the directions,

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:53.576
it'll come out just like
mine and that's great."

00:03:53.976 --> 00:03:56.866
That was good for those
times, but times have changed,

00:03:57.276 --> 00:04:00.406
so the focus is more on the
kids inventing their own stuff.

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:01.956
&gt;&gt;Student: And if the wind
is blowing hard enough,

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:04.676
then it'll make this spin
around, and the weight

00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:06.146
from this guy makes
him come back down.

00:04:06.206 --> 00:04:10.146
&gt;&gt;Nesser: This class is like fun
because like the teacher help

00:04:10.146 --> 00:04:12.696
to be creative and to
make our own designs.

00:04:13.106 --> 00:04:15.556
So like we will have that
experience as we go along.

00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:19.876
&gt;&gt;Gus: Well, I think kids have
the opportunity to kinda tinker.

00:04:20.246 --> 00:04:24.096
They get to think about something,
but then also actually build it,

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:28.466
create it, and in that process,
fix it when things go wrong.

00:04:29.786 --> 00:04:32.646
It's an incredible value
that I think is lacking,

00:04:32.836 --> 00:04:36.496
where they don't have a class like
this or like an art class or music

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:38.576
or something where the kids
actually have to do something,

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:41.106
get their hands dirty and make stuff.

00:04:41.106 --> 00:04:45.616
&gt;&gt;Excellent, Last night,
when I put all the sculptures

00:04:45.616 --> 00:04:48.146
&gt;&gt;So there's like eighty
sculptures in the front of my room

00:04:48.536 --> 00:04:51.726
and it was really amazing,
thinking of where we started

00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:54.676
and where we ended up,
just the variety of ideas

00:04:54.676 --> 00:04:56.276
and the ingenuity you had.

00:04:56.276 --> 00:04:57.466
Well, you should be really proud.

00:04:57.466 --> 00:04:59.996
It's just so cool to look
at them all together,

00:05:00.126 --> 00:05:01.366
because it's really very cool.

00:05:04.746 --> 00:05:06.666
&gt;&gt;Student: It's kinetic
because it moves

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:07.706
on its own, so it blows in the wind.

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:12.056
&gt;&gt;These things blow in the
wind, and this is how it works.

00:05:12.056 --> 00:05:14.096
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On a Friday after school,

00:05:14.396 --> 00:05:16.606
students displayed
their model sculptures

00:05:16.936 --> 00:05:19.866
and discussed their installation
proposals with parents

00:05:19.966 --> 00:05:20.976
and members of the community.

00:05:21.236 --> 00:05:23.626
&gt;&gt;David: What do you mean, you did
the math to figure out the balance?

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:25.646
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, this
one, which is two inches

00:05:26.006 --> 00:05:29.246
by two inches, so I did half of that.

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:32.706
&gt;&gt;David: It's pretty exciting to
see the kids get engaged in the work

00:05:32.706 --> 00:05:35.266
that they're doing, to take
ownership of the work they're doing,

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:38.116
feel responsible for it
and then be able to talk

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:39.246
about the things that
they're learning.

00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:41.846
&gt;&gt;So you had this side
balancing this side.

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:46.036
&gt;&gt;David: Sometimes, I think we get
too concerned about the standards.

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:47.916
And there's an assumption
behind a lotta

00:05:47.916 --> 00:05:50.586
that that we actually know what our
kids are gonna face in the future.

00:05:51.256 --> 00:05:52.876
And I'm not very convinced of that.

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:58.406
And so the pieces about creativity,
cooperation, problem solving,

00:05:58.406 --> 00:06:01.686
those are gonna be there, and so the
kids getting those here is crucial

00:06:01.806 --> 00:06:01.976
and key.

00:06:02.706 --> 00:06:05.476
&gt;&gt;Adne: It's a weeping willow and
it's called the Miss Lincoln Tree.

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:09.416
The name was named after Lincoln
Park, where I wanna put this.

00:06:09.596 --> 00:06:10.626
&gt;&gt;And these will blow in the wind?

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:12.736
&gt;&gt;Yeah, it has a little bit of
aesthetics, and it's three based--

00:06:12.736 --> 00:06:14.536
&gt;&gt;It's got a lot of aesthetics.

00:06:15.206 --> 00:06:15.376
&gt;&gt;Adne: Yeah.

00:06:15.776 --> 00:06:18.536
&gt;&gt;Well, I think you
just got my first vote.

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:19.966
&gt;&gt;Adne: Oh, thank you.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:25.856
