Transcription by Minty Root

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.070
Wha ...

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.000
What is going on?

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.000
Princess Luna

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.150
What is going on?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.100
Luna ...

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Dinky? Are you alright?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I’m sorry ... I didn’t mean to …

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I just wanted to grab it with my magic

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I didn’t mean to break it Ö

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You can hardly tie a bow, sweetie.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Your magic isn't mature enough yet

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.500
Now, tell me little filly

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.000
Is this your worst fear?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Or is it that you feel your destiny

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Has been taken from you?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
What a shame, that a unicorn full of magic like you

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Had to have a horn that doesn’t work right

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Princess Luna?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.500
Were you really Nightmare Moon?

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.000
In a night when I find a pony whose dreams are filled with turmoil

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.500
I reach into their memories or nightmares in the hopes of teaching them

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.000
But I’m afraid …

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
That in your case

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.500
Your own past isn’t quite enough.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.500
As for your future, this isn’t for me

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.000
That realm is my sister’s

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.500
But she’s not here to talk

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Is this a plane of existence

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Between reality and imagination?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Celestial plane?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The plane where I enter dreams.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.500
I brought you here because you have a bright mind that will bloom with time

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.000
I deeply regret that you have forgotten your potential and you feel cursed by your destiny

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And I won’t let these fears fester within you

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.500
We have much in common

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.000
We both feel misunderstood

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.500
You, with your clockwise horn

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.500
And I, as the bringer of the night

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:54.500
We don’t get to see our world like other ponies

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I can’t let you end with the same fate as I once did

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.500
Though other ponies may not see it

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.000
You were blessed with an uncommon gift

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But in order to get you to see it, I will need to go deeper

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And take you into my own story

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Prepare to see Equestria as it was a millennium ago

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
You have a lot ahead of you Dinky Doo

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And you’re on a journey to find who you truly are.
