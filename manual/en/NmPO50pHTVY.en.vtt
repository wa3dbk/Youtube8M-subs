00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.270
Hey guys so this time I got a

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.160
New jig it's a signmaker jig that I picked

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.070
Up at Rockler and I actually got it

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.410
On a black Friday sale so I got it

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.980
For pretty cheap and I tried once

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.820
Before actually using a sign jig and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.289
I have this mess of a product and I'm

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.240
Not going to talk to much about it because

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.839
Just thinking about it gets me angry again

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:33.630
And how well that did not turn out so I'm

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.320
Sure there are some of you out here who

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.200
Have this one like it good for you I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.870
Had a horrible time with it so I'm

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.440
Going to give this one a shot and do a

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.340
Review of how well it goes and hopefully

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.579
This one goes a lot better

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.239
Okay so here is the deluxe kit from Rockler

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.690
That I got and in it it has all the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.690
With the deluxe kit you actually get

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.350
All the letters as well as all the numbers

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.071
And symbols and you know it's about as

00:01:07.071 --> 00:01:09.930
Straight forward as from what I can tell

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.730
As it looks you simply snap them all

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.380
Together and lay them out one thing it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.850
Does include is this plastic bushing it's

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.260
Like a guide for the router when it actually

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.700
Gets on there you move the router and it

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.120
Kind of follows it the problem is when I

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.631
Actually Used a plastic guide bushing thing

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:37.390
Once before and the bit got so hot that it

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.400
Actually starts to melt the plastic and I

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.560
Don't know if maybe I wasn't using it right

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.860
Or maybe it just got over used but what I

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.730
Decided to do was instead of using the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.965
Guide that came with it I decided to go

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.570
Ahead and buy a brass one and I got

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.560
This from Rockler as well and its the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.030
Same size and its supposed to be universal

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.860
And I have tested it with my router

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.770
To make sure it worked and it does it

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.320
Sits right in there and then once you get

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.860
Your letters down you just sort of follow

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.970
The template around and hopefully it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.230
Works pretty well I know on the other

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.219
Kit I had the whole thing on that was

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.780
A nightmare the whole setup the pieces

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.990
Working just trying to get everything to

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.620
Work didn't work that well this time I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.930
Really have high hopes that this one will

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.500
Do great and that we'll be able to just

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.349
Lay it down and see how it works

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.420
All right well to start I wanted to go

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.730
Ahead and make sure my guide on my router

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.069
And it actually sits in there just perfect

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.959
I think there are bases that will fit on

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.590
Most routers to make it more universal

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.019
This one works pretty well it's recessed

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.730
In and it sits in there nice and snug

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.510
And I'll just tighten this up a little bit

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.299
So there we have that

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.230
Well I've gone ahead and got my letters

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.720
Layed out and what I decided I would do

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.950
Is just make a sign for my website

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.579
And I went ahead and tried to pull out

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:11.579
As many of the letters as I could

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.020
Now some of the letters I'm going to

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.920
Need to use over and over again like

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.250
The letter O and the kit does come with

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.560
A couple of those which is great but

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.560
I can't lay out the entire pattern in

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.090
One piece I'm going to have to actually

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.959
Pull up or rout part of the sign take

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.310
Up some of my letters and lay them back down

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.489
So after you get all of the letters

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.700
Layed down really the next step is just

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.549
Some painters tape to hold it in place

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.109
So that when you rout it things aren't

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:46.109
Moving around on you

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:54.129
I just need to grab my router and go at it

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.419
So when it came to just routing

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.510
The sign really I think the secret here is

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.051
To take your time and make sure that you're

00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.560
Really looking at each letter you know

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.299
As close as you can the last thing

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.279
You want to do is sort of push down on

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.870
The plunge router and maybe not go

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.680
All the way and ruin one of your templastes

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.769
Or possbily even your bit if your not

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.590
Down far enough

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.920
So after I finished routing out the letters

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.970
On my sign I decided that I wanted to round

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.350
Over all the edges and there are a lot

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:29.670
Of options that you can do and how

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.790
You want that to look and I chose just

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.290
A simple round over for mine

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.420
So after getting everthing done I did just

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.600
A pretty standard sanding acroos the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.590
Front of the sign as well as the back

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.640
And I only did two grits of paper on this

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.000
On this one I almost always do three if its

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.840
An heirloom project this one maybe I took

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.060
A short step there but I think you can get

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.590
Away with that

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.130
Well its done I still got to paint it but

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.040
I guess I could go ahead and drill

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.630
Some holes in the back so that it can

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.280
Hang and I have this little template that

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.510
I bought from Rockler you really don't

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.580
Need this but I kind of got suckered into
it

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.150
It just looked like a good idea and it does

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.260
Work pretty well its nice that you can just

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.430
Line it up and I guess you don't have to mess

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.860
With attaching a board to use as a guide

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.333
And it's quick too ad it comes with two

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:38.300
Different slots that if you have two

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.100
That are right by and a long one

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:56.720
In the middle here we go

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:08.490
All I have left is to give it a schlack

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.960
Or maybe a lacquer and then paint it

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.830
So I'm just about done with my sign

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.270
I've got everthing carved out and last

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.360
But not least is I just need to paint it

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.430
So for my sign on the inside I'm just going

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.350
To paint it black and I actually decided to

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.890
Do a coat of lacquer before I painted it

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.050
Which I had always thought you just don't

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.460
Do that and I found a website that actually

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.520
Recommended that you apply a coat of lacquer

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.400
A single coat a light coat and then you back

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.640
And paint right on top of that you let

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.370
It sit and then you apply another coat

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.020
Of lacquer on top of that so I tried

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.241
That once before on another thing and it actually

00:07:01.241 --> 00:07:04.740
Worked and everything looked fine it wasn't

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.610
A sign that I was doing but it held together

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.580
For this one honestly I don't think I'm

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.730
Going to put another layer of lacquer on top
of it

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.501
Cause it's going to stay on the inside and

00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:17.650
I'm not going to have it on the outdoors

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.810
So I think it'll be pretty well protected

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.420
All right guys well I got my sign finished

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.250
And it turned out pretty good and I really

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.130
Can't say enough about the rockler signmaker
kit

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.211
It really was easy and compared to the

00:07:36.211 --> 00:07:40.120
Other sign making kit that I've used before

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.130
in the past this one really was simple

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.310
So I recommend it and I think my only

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.410
Criticism really is just that the guide

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:51.920
Bushing that comes with it is it's A

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.880
Plastic one and so I would definitely look

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.120
Into buying a there's a brass one that

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.241
You can buy and rockler has it too

00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:02.260
And it's pretty cheap so check it out

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.860
See if you like it and as always

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.420
