00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.410
Bender Rodriguez has a defender on him, unleashes
with his right foot!

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:14.530
Gooooooooaaaaaaallllll Bot-celona!

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.490
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.249
Artificial Intelligence is the holy grail
of computing and robotics.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.039
A machine that can intelligently analyze and
manipulate its environment to achieve a goal

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.679
is no small feat, and at first it was believed
that the ultimate challenge for AI was winning

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:29.989
a game of chess.

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.570
It makes sense at a glance: chess masters
are brilliant strategists who carefully analyze

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.180
and react to their opponents in order to win.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.950
If a computer can beat one of them, then surely
we’ve cracked this nut, right?

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.900
Well a computer has beaten a chess master.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.320
18 years ago.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.730
So why hasn’t Skynet taken over?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.600
Because chess is not the perfect problem for
AI that we once thought it was.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.920
Chess is actually relatively easy for a computer.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.940
Chess is only against one opponent, and everything
happens sequentially.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.260
A computer knows that when it makes a move,
exactly what it intended to happen will happen.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.260
And even though there are millions and millions
of possible moves, the slow pace of the game

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.619
means the computer can calculate exactly all
of them and cherry pick the best one.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.579
Basically winning chess for a computer is
less intelligence and more brute force calculations.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.329
But in 1997, the same year Deep Blue defeated
chess champion Gary Kasparov, another tournament

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.109
was started, and it involved a game much harder
for robots.

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.840
I’m talking of course, about soccer.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
Yes, soccer.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.950
The tournament is called the “Robot Soccer
World Cup,” so soccer is the correct term.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.079
Plus soccer is old British slang for “Association
Football,” so I don’t want to see a bunch

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.119
of comments about how it’s called football.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.969
Anyway, soccer poses problems for AI that
chess never could.

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:40.990
Instead of reacting to one other player, there
are entire teams.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.740
It’s not turn based, but constant and dynamic.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.170
The robot cannot predict exactly where the
ball will go when it kicks it; it could take

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.890
a strange bounce or another robot could intercept
it.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.600
That means the robots have to react to unexpected
events, and they have to do so quickly, none

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.149
of this faffing about while it decides what
to do.

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.740
Plus robot soccer is tractable; it can easily
be recreated over and over anywhere in the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.740
world.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.549
It’s not as challenging as creating a robot
that’s almost human, and it’s not too

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:05.549
expensive.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.750
It also helps that soccer is the most popular
sport in the world, so robot soccer would

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.330
probably gain some attention.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.550
And indeed it has.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.030
When the first RoboCup was held in Nagoya,
Japan, there were 38 teams from 11 countries.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.790
Last year there were 358 teams from 45 countries.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.060
The number of categories has grown immensely
too.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.790
Originally RoboCup had only 3 leagues; small
robots that used an overhead camera, medium

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.310
robots with their own sensors, and AI playing
soccer solely in a simulation.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.720
Then in 1999 RoboCup introduced the first
league with legged robots.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.250
The robots they used?

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.650
Specially programmed Sony AIBO dogs.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.350
Yes those little plastic dogs your aunt got
you for christmas because she had no idea

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.760
what to get you actually served a purpose
advancing science.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.460
Now the legged divisions are humanoid, and
can either be a standard platform or entirely

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.460
custom built.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.630
They’ve also branched away from soccer,
and have competitions for search and rescue

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.620
robots and robot dancers.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.070
Most importantly though, all the robots are
autonomous and independent.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.840
The eventual goal is to have a robot soccer
squad capable of beating the human world cup

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.290
champions by the year 2050.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.520
Watch out Messi, Robo-naldo is coming for
you.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.190
Competition is one of the best ways to drive
innovation, and when brilliant dedicated people

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.840
come together, they can achieve amazing things.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.800
In the same way the United States Air Force
is powered by Airmen and fueled by innovation,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:31.530
and we’d like to thank them for sponsoring

00:03:31.530 --> 00:04:00.150
this episode.
