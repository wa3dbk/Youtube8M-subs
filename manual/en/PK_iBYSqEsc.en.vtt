New York City. 2001.

00:00:15.676 --> 00:00:18.686
No tall building had ever
collapsed primarily due to fire

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:22.526
but that's exactly what investigators
believe happened

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:29.466
to the 47-story World Trade Center Building
7 on September 11, according to a 3-year,

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:33.776
comprehensive building and fire
safety investigation just completed

00:00:33.776 --> 00:00:37.446
by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, or NIST.

00:00:37.766 --> 00:00:40.706
World Trade Center 7 collapsed because of fires.

00:00:40.916 --> 00:00:45.136
We really have a new kind of progressive
collapse that we have discovered here,

00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:47.656
which is a fire-induced progressive collapse.

00:00:48.126 --> 00:00:52.136
In fact, we have shown for the first time
that fire can induce a progressive collapse.

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:56.336
NIST used detailed data describing
the building and its contents

00:00:56.556 --> 00:01:01.266
to create the most complex computer
simulation of a structure collapse ever made.

00:01:02.126 --> 00:01:07.086
Falling debris from Tower 1 started
fires on 10 floors in Building 7.

00:01:07.686 --> 00:01:12.346
A break in the city water main from the
collapse of the towers disabled sprinklers

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:18.546
in the lower half of WTC 7, allowing
fires on those floors to burn for 7 hours.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:24.426
The NIST computer model was validated
with evidence from videos, photos,

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:26.396
witness accounts, and other data.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:30.746
It shows that heat from fires
expanded long support beams,

00:01:30.926 --> 00:01:33.096
causing connections and floors to fail.

00:01:33.276 --> 00:01:40.406
So you look at the floors failing here and
eventually this column 79 is going to buckle.

00:01:41.016 --> 00:01:43.966
It fails, and then the entire
vertical progression takes place.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:48.596
The buckled column caused additional
collapsed floors and falling debris

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:51.806
that removed support from
adjacent interior columns.

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:57.026
A chain reaction then caused other interior
columns to fail in quick succession.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:59.426
The outside shell of the building fell.

00:02:00.316 --> 00:02:04.486
The NIST team found no evidence that
explosives were involved in the collapse.

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:11.126
Our analysis showed that even the smallest
explosive charge that was capable of bringing

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:18.346
down the critical column in the building, had it
occurred, we would have seen sound levels of 120

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:21.306
to 130 decibels about a half a mile away.

00:02:21.946 --> 00:02:26.446
That would have been an incredibly loud
sound, and that sound was not picked up by any

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:28.636
of the videos or witnesses
that we have talked to.

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:33.266
The team found that World Trade Center
7's design was generally consistent

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:35.556
with the relevant building
codes when it was built.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.416
Our high rise buildings in this
country are very, very safe.

00:02:39.926 --> 00:02:43.486
Having a collapse of this
nature is a very rare event.

00:02:43.916 --> 00:02:49.736
Nevertheless, to ensure that buildings do not
collapse in fires even when sprinklers fail

00:02:49.736 --> 00:02:54.706
or are not present, the NIST team urges
re-evaluation of the fire performance

00:02:54.706 --> 00:03:00.556
of structures with long span floors and
other design elements similar to WTC 7.

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:05.586
The team's report also calls
for stronger codes, standards,

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:09.756
and practices so that other
buildings don't suffer the same fate.
