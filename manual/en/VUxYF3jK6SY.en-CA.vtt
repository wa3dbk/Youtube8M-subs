00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:06.110
What I'd like to say today is how passionate
I see our teachers when I'm out in the schools

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.059
working with them to try to meet the needs
of students in their classrooms. Every student

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.511
is unique. Every student comes to the table
with a different learning platform. Teachers

00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:20.660
are expected and they must be able to respond
to those individual, differentiated needs

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.429
of students. Our most vulnerable learners
are students in special education, require

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:32.800
personalized and precise education that only
teachers can give if they have the time in

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.540
order to plan, to think deeply and to collaborate
with their colleagues. If our preparation

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.000
time is diminished, if it's not self-directed,
if we don't have it, we will not be able to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.750
meet those needs, and the ability for those
kids to be successful and to make achievements

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.890
will be sadly diminished.
The action next week is, I believe, is a planned

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.620
one that's probably going to help our parents
and, I hope, the government to understand

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.620
how serious we are, how passionate we are
about the learning environment in our classrooms.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.240
Because our working conditions - and I know
when we talk working conditions people tend

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.460
to think "Oh teachers just want to have better
conditions." That's not it, because those

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.860
working conditions translate directly to the
classroom for those kids. You all know how

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.500
many students we have in our system these
days that have special needs. You've all heard

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.560
it. We live it every day trying to make a
difference for those kids, and until we can

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.530
work together, plan, have the time, it's not
going to happen for them. We're not going

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.970
to see success on the faces of those kids.
We need to see that when they walk out the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.490
door in June.
The job action, actually, for kids in the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.660
classroom - the teachers are there. The teachers
are working with those kids. The teachers

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.330
are still committed, still differentiating,
still working in the classroom with those

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.210
kids.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.230
Every teacher gets an amount of preparation
time. For some teachers it's every day. And

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.659
during that preparation time we try to ensure
that we...to use that time to make sure that

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.689
our students are successful. Some of the things
that we do: we mark the assessments, we prepare

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:19.359
resources. We also make sure that we call
parents from time to time. We make sure that

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:25.200
we are ensuring that our students are safe
in the classroom. We have our one-one-talk

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.920
with our students. So it's all about our students
and our students' success, and the different

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.659
needs and abilities that our students have.
We want to make sure that we are available,

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.340
and we have enough time to make sure that
when they come to the classroom they come

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.959
to learn, which is why parents send them to
school.
