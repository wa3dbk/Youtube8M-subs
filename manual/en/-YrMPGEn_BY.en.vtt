00:00:00.654 --> 00:00:04.321
(uplifting orchestra music)

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.430
- My wife and I have always
tried to stay connected

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.054
to what our children were doing

00:00:10.054 --> 00:00:10.887
in school.

00:00:12.342 --> 00:00:15.367
- When you maintain that
communication with your children,

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:18.781
you're gonna hear the education
that they're receiving.

00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:20.046
- And I've really taken that to heart.

00:00:20.046 --> 00:00:22.150
I think that if I wanna know my child,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.305
I wanna know his world.

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:26.319
- While the best way
to get plugged into Cal

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.703
as a parent is to
participate in CalParents.

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:32.165
- Now that I've been
through it, I wanted to let

00:00:32.165 --> 00:00:36.168
other mothers and fathers to
know that this is a great place

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:37.403
for your student.

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:40.653
(uplifting horn music)

00:00:48.826 --> 00:00:50.417
- One of the things we love to do is meet

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.616
new parents at move-in day, where we also,

00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:55.532
of course, meet our new students, we see

00:00:55.532 --> 00:00:57.403
the amazing excitement that you all feel

00:00:57.403 --> 00:00:59.802
when you bring your children
here to Berkeley for their

00:00:59.802 --> 00:01:01.154
college experience.

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:04.904
- We also see the anxiety
and the nervousness

00:01:06.226 --> 00:01:10.121
about letting your children
go but they're in great hands.

00:01:10.121 --> 00:01:12.399
- We know you want to
stay with this campus

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.865
when you send your children here,

00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.622
whether they're undergraduates
or graduate students.

00:01:16.622 --> 00:01:20.296
The CalParents program provides
all kinds of opportunities

00:01:20.296 --> 00:01:22.278
for you to do that, for you to connect

00:01:22.278 --> 00:01:24.543
with the academic
programs here, as well as

00:01:24.543 --> 00:01:27.478
the extraordinary range of
opportunities that exist

00:01:27.478 --> 00:01:30.011
not only for your students
but for yourselves

00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:32.261
on this magnificent campus.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.986
- Cal is unique is
because it has everything.

00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:38.772
There are lots of schools
that are really good

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:39.802
at engineering or really good

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:42.685
at the arts but Cal is
a place where no matter

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.259
what it is you're
interested in, somebody here

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.911
is doing it really well.

00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:47.744
- Everything is so

00:01:47.744 --> 00:01:51.633
different and so good and
that's what benefits us

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.088
is that we draw from

00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:57.095
this diverse group here,
as we grow, we continue

00:01:57.095 --> 00:01:59.379
to build off that and that's
what makes it great here.

00:01:59.379 --> 00:02:02.097
- The theme of excellence
I think it definitely does

00:02:02.097 --> 00:02:03.923
encompass everything.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:06.322
It's really funny because the
thing that people always say

00:02:06.322 --> 00:02:09.432
is where you were from, you
were the best in your school,

00:02:09.432 --> 00:02:12.265
and so UC Berkeley is
kind of like that center,

00:02:12.265 --> 00:02:16.058
that epicenter of all these
excellent people coming together

00:02:16.058 --> 00:02:17.819
and so you kind of feed off that.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.050
You get the best students,
you get the best professors.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.855
You know, this is really one
of the greatest universities,

00:02:22.855 --> 00:02:25.791
not just in California, not
just in the United States,

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:28.713
but in the entire world,
routinely gets rankings

00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:32.211
in the top five for virtually every field.

00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:34.319
When we invite your children to come here

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.068
for their education, they can participate

00:02:37.068 --> 00:02:39.372
in really some of the
most cutting-edge research

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:42.532
and some of the most extraordinary
educational opportunities

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:44.979
available anywhere in the world.

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.246
- I'm a professor in
residence in Christian Hall,

00:02:47.246 --> 00:02:48.829
which is in Unit I.

00:02:50.716 --> 00:02:53.134
The faculty in residence
program is a program

00:02:53.134 --> 00:02:54.494
that brings faculty to live in

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:55.617
residence halls with

00:02:55.617 --> 00:02:59.266
undergraduate students, we
serve as mentors, guides,

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:01.037
and friends.

00:03:01.037 --> 00:03:02.835
- The professors are busy and

00:03:02.835 --> 00:03:05.060
have research, but if you
sit down with them and you go

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.130
to their office hours, they
really wanna help people learn

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.206
and they wanna make your education
as meaningful as possible

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:14.013
so every experience I've had
with going to office hours

00:03:14.013 --> 00:03:15.337
and meeting up with teachers has been

00:03:15.337 --> 00:03:17.254
beyond what I expected.

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:22.282
- [Na'ilah] The faculty at
Berkeley are phenomenal, so

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:24.382
even in a large lecture course,

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:26.885
students are getting the cutting edge of

00:03:26.885 --> 00:03:27.760
the field.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.933
- I think it's really up
to the student to search

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:32.990
out all the resources that Cal

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:36.240
has to offer, it's very easy to make Cal

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.634
kind of smaller.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.970
- It's that thing, I'm sure
you've heard it so many times,

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.870
you can make a big school
smaller but you can't make

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.703
a small school bigger.

00:03:43.703 --> 00:03:47.618
- I was an undergraduate
here, I was taking courses

00:03:47.618 --> 00:03:49.712
from faculty members who had
written the books, right,

00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:51.047
who had written the textbooks,

00:03:51.047 --> 00:03:53.732
and what that meant for me
was that I started to think,

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:56.923
wow, so creating theory
is what people do (laughs)

00:03:56.923 --> 00:03:58.553
and so it kind of in some ways

00:03:58.553 --> 00:04:01.664
humanizes the research process
and the theory-building

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:03.807
process that allows you to think,

00:04:03.807 --> 00:04:06.625
maybe I could create theory too.

00:04:06.625 --> 00:04:09.208
(bright music)

00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:13.820
- CalParents is fabulous

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.890
and I'm proud to be a part of
it because we funded so many

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:18.774
amazing things, like

00:04:18.774 --> 00:04:21.837
freshman seminars which are
this marvelous opportunity.

00:04:21.837 --> 00:04:24.044
- Freshman seminars
are 15 students getting

00:04:24.044 --> 00:04:26.065
together with a faculty
member once a week to work

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:27.452
on something interesting.

00:04:27.452 --> 00:04:30.143
So I'm teaching a freshman
seminar this semester

00:04:30.143 --> 00:04:32.035
on the physics and
technology of siege engines,

00:04:32.035 --> 00:04:34.708
things like catapults and trebuchets.

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.763
Put some minions together
to build those triangles.

00:04:37.763 --> 00:04:38.774
- [Woman With Backpack] Uh-huh.

00:04:38.774 --> 00:04:40.226
- And there're clamps
in there to clamp 'em

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:42.410
before you screw 'em in glue.

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.384
I love teaching at Cal,
I love the undergrads.

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:48.195
I love the graduate students,
I love everything about it.

00:04:48.195 --> 00:04:50.180
Seminars are not meant to be one person

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.088
talking to a bunch of
others, they are a bunch

00:04:52.088 --> 00:04:54.908
of people working together to
improve their understanding.

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:56.363
You know, we're not
gonna win a Nobel Prize

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:58.790
for freshman seminar work
but we are going to learn

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.649
something as individuals,
we're gonna learn something

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:03.649
as a team and we're gonna
teach students that curiosity

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:05.946
is a big part of learning.

00:05:05.946 --> 00:05:09.863
(uplifting instrumental music)

00:05:12.053 --> 00:05:15.804
- I've been involved with
CalParents since the year 2000.

00:05:15.804 --> 00:05:17.645
I was in Sproul Hall walking around

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:20.232
and I saw this door that said CalParents

00:05:20.232 --> 00:05:22.734
so I just thought, I'm
just gonna walk in here.

00:05:22.734 --> 00:05:24.470
- So the CalParents program is a great way

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.265
for parents to stay
connected when their child

00:05:26.265 --> 00:05:27.414
joins the university.

00:05:27.414 --> 00:05:28.323
- CalParents is a program

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:30.893
at Berkeley designed to support families

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:35.587
and have families become a
part of the Cal experience.

00:05:35.587 --> 00:05:38.317
There's resources at
the CalParents website.

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:41.884
There's a Facebook site,
there's newsletters Home.

00:05:41.884 --> 00:05:44.218
There's volunteering
opportunities that can bring

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:47.987
you to campus but you also
can volunteer in efforts

00:05:47.987 --> 00:05:50.064
that happen in southern
California and you can meet

00:05:50.064 --> 00:05:51.524
other parents that way.

00:05:51.524 --> 00:05:53.449
- I love the Discover Cal programs

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.581
because in southern
California, it connects me

00:05:55.581 --> 00:05:59.467
and I feel like I can hear
that professor talking

00:05:59.467 --> 00:06:01.941
about Egypt or talking
about this particular

00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:04.684
environmental issue that's
current in the news today.

00:06:04.684 --> 00:06:07.518
And it's not very far, I think what's nice

00:06:07.518 --> 00:06:09.950
about CalParents is that
we can respond immediately

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.241
to issues that are hot on the
table and we're very connected

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:16.523
to what's going on in campus.

00:06:16.523 --> 00:06:18.454
- I'm more engaged on
the fundraising side.

00:06:18.454 --> 00:06:20.699
I think it's very, very
important for the parents

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.597
to recognize that Cal today needs the kind

00:06:23.597 --> 00:06:25.567
of financial support that
the private schools have

00:06:25.567 --> 00:06:27.027
in order to stay competitive.

00:06:27.027 --> 00:06:29.638
- I feel like I have to fight
for what is so wonderful.

00:06:29.638 --> 00:06:32.232
I don't want it to go away.

00:06:32.232 --> 00:06:35.482
(uplifting horn music)

00:06:36.484 --> 00:06:38.437
- I've had two attend Berkeley.

00:06:38.437 --> 00:06:40.570
It's been a wonderful
experience for both of them.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:44.492
- I am a new Cal parent,
my daughter started here

00:06:44.492 --> 00:06:45.742
this spring and

00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:52.488
she is having a blast (laughs)

00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:54.469
is the only way that I can say it.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.306
- It's a marvelous
experience, and sometimes

00:06:57.306 --> 00:06:59.819
an overwhelming experience,
sometimes an experience

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.082
that makes a dad really, really nervous,

00:07:02.082 --> 00:07:03.660
when your daughter
tells you she's majoring

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:05.582
in Celtic studies, your
biggest reaction is gonna be,

00:07:05.582 --> 00:07:07.282
what the hell are you gonna do with that?

00:07:07.282 --> 00:07:10.257
- My biggest piece of
advice is to let your kids

00:07:10.257 --> 00:07:12.681
lead the process and
trust that you've done

00:07:12.681 --> 00:07:15.622
a fabulous job and they're
ready, they're ready.

00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:18.144
- Advice parent to parent,
having had one daughter graduate

00:07:18.144 --> 00:07:20.811
and another one about to, relax.

00:07:22.818 --> 00:07:25.352
It's an amazing world,
your kids are gonna go

00:07:25.352 --> 00:07:27.285
through incredible experiences

00:07:27.285 --> 00:07:29.895
that you can't conceive it, let 'em do it.

00:07:29.895 --> 00:07:31.114
It's gonna be okay.

00:07:31.114 --> 00:07:35.031
(triumphant orchestral music)
