00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:02.781
Press on.

00:00:02.781 --> 00:00:04.262
Press off.

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:04.840
Hey guys!

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.450
It's Rachel.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.770
And I decided to do
a weird beauty life

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.675
hacks every girl should know,
because I've benefited so much

00:00:10.675 --> 00:00:11.890
from knowing these things.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.370
But first off, this is
my last weekend giveaway.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.750
If this video gets
to 200,000 likes,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.140
I'll do another one next month.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.840
For now, this is my last one.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.430
And the winner of the MacBook
Air is Shenae Johnson!

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.810
Congratulations!

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.647
Here's one of your
YouTube comments.

00:00:27.647 --> 00:00:29.480
Yeah, I'm talking about
that Shenae Johnson.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.896
You know what's
really unfortunate

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:33.780
about this entire situation
is that I didn't realize

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.990
that my makeup desk is kind
of pretty until after I filmed

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.854
the entire videos.

00:00:37.854 --> 00:00:39.270
For some reason,
I filmed the rest

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.520
of this video [SNAPS FINGERS]
in front of a green screen.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.410
Good job, Rachel.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.630
Let's make it my makeup
desk again. [SNAPS FINGERS]

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.720
Let's get on with
the weird beauty life

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.265
hacks every girl should know.

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.030
OK, if you have the
world's worst dark circles,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.150
this life hack is to use red
lipstick as a concealer primer.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.530
And I saw this picture online.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.946
Shout out to this
chick over here.

00:00:58.946 --> 00:00:59.980
She invented the trick.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.855
And I tried it out to
see if it's legitimate.

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:02.717
I wore it today.

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:05.300
I'm going to show you one side
just putting on plain concealer

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.440
and then one side
doing this trick.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.939
Ready?

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.620
Don't put a lot.

00:01:14.344 --> 00:01:16.760
Blend it with your fingers to
make sure there's no excess.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.620
Now watch this.

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:23.100
Which dark circle is more even?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.000
The one that I just put
regular concealer on,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.500
or the one that I
put the red under?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.541
Another makeup life hack.

00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:29.870
I did a video on
this a while ago.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.010
So this trick basically
makes your eyelashes longer

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.300
when you put on mascara.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.600
That's regular mascara.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.150
Now this life hack
entails cotton balls.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.970
You take a single cotton ball.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.230
The trick is, you
just take this brush

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.320
and pick up some
cotton ball fibers

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.343
and put it in between every
single coat of mascara you put.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.204
Oh! [SINGING] The
story of my life!

00:01:53.204 --> 00:01:55.370
Well, that dot's gonna be
there the rest of my life.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.156
And then take this,
add another coat.

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:02.970
And then do it again.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.800
If you feel cotton ball get
into your eye, just get it out.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.370
I don't think it could be good
to have legitimate anything

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.280
in your eye for too long.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.412
Before, after.

00:02:13.412 --> 00:02:15.370
I also made a video about
this three years ago.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.578
But that was three years ago.

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:18.290
This is for if
you're ever in a rush

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.630
and you want to wear eyeshadow.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.250
You can make the
eyeshadow the day before.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.480
Do you see these foam sheets?

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.813
You can get them from Michael's.

00:02:24.813 --> 00:02:27.760
But basically take a
foam sheet like this one.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.020
Just cut two pieces
that are shaped

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.860
like an eye out of the foam
sheet and then take some water,

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.410
brush the water over it.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.460
Take some pigment
eyeshadow, paint it

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.030
wherever you want the color
to be onto the foam sheet.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.575
And then let it dry and then
you could save a bunch of these

00:02:43.575 --> 00:02:45.650
and just use them the next day.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.810
I decided to make two.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.900
Here's a smoky eye and
here's a brown smoky eye.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.360
Prime those lids first.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.150
Oh my god!

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.930
They're both for the same eye.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.294
A round of applause for me!

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:57.210
I'm gonna give you guys
five seconds to choose

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.210
which one I'm gonna use.

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.581
And if you're right, you win!

00:02:59.581 --> 00:03:00.830
Comment down below if you win.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.660
Ready?

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.760
I'm gonna do this one.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.790
Literally press it on.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.790
And then all you need
to do is blend it.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.651
Press off.

00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.150
Oh!

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.626
And now [INAUDIBLE] blending.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:13.125
Eyeshadow.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.810
If every time you tweeze your
eyebrows or your mustache

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.650
or wherever you tweeze,
it hurts really badly,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.840
take some Baby Orajel.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.950
It's for teething pain.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.402
But Orajel basically numbs it.

00:03:23.402 --> 00:03:24.860
Doesn't hurt your
skin or anything.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.760
Let it chill for a minute,
and then wipe it away.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.760
And tweeze without
feeling any pain.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.280
If you have the problem where
your lips are always chapped,

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.420
no matter how much water I
drink, take a green tea bag

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.000
and then wet it in the sink.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.540
Squeeze out any excess water.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.800
Take the bag and put it on your
lips for about five minutes

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.152
and they will not be chapped.

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:47.860
I don't know why this
works, but it does.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.500
This next trick is how to get
a nice nail design easily.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.510
Just take the nail polish you
want and draw whatever design

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.350
you want on a
sandwich bag, and then

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.900
set it aside to let it dry.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.994
Once it's dry, place it on your
nail and push it really hard.

00:04:02.994 --> 00:04:04.410
The nail design
will just peel off

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.910
when you peel the
sandwich bag off.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.940
And then bam, heart nail design!

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.290
If you have dark
armpits-- I did.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.210
I saw a YouTube
video two years ago

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.720
on how to get rid
of dark underarms

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.590
from [? Andrew's ?]
Choice, and I never

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.279
tried the method 'cause I
didn't think it would work.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.779
Two weeks ago, I
started using it

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.487
and now my armpits
are pretty much white.

00:04:20.487 --> 00:04:21.320
Take a potato.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.631
A potato-- yeah.

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.756
You could cut in half, but
I literally usually just

00:04:24.756 --> 00:04:25.602
go like this.

00:04:25.602 --> 00:04:26.780
[CRUNCH]

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.000
Rub it on your armpit.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.500
It's OK.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.550
No one's going to judge you if
they can't see you doing it.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.240
This next life hack
is so ridiculous.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.010
But if you're clumsy
and get bruises

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.727
all the time everywhere--
here's a bruise right here.

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:39.060
I don't even know what happened.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.000
Somehow it's somewhere
that people would see

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.300
and you don't want to be there.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.970
Put some mouthwash
on a cotton ball.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.900
Yeah, I said mouthwash.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.554
This is my bruise.

00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:51.450
[CLUNK]

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:52.800
Where did it go?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.370
If your hair has refused
to retain volume.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:56.540
This is my hair natural.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.199
Notice how up here it
is stuck to my head.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.490
You guys already know this
'cause of my prom life hacks

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.989
video.

00:05:01.989 --> 00:05:05.060
But white powder can
be used as dry shampoo.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.340
And dry shampoo usually
makes my hair actually

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.490
flatter for some reason.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.920
Most people it's the opposite.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.080
I'll do it on this side.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.230
Just play around with it.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.920
Legitimately
nothing in the world

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.597
gives me volume except for this.

00:05:18.597 --> 00:05:20.180
So I hope you guys
enjoyed this video.
