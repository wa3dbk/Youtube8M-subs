Anson Belt and Buckle - Men's Belt Video Review
- ansonbeltandbuckle.com

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:03.199
Hi.

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:05.390
Iím Antonio Centeno with RealMenRealStyle.com.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.089
And today Iím going to be doing a product
review on Anson Belt and Buckle.

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.769
Now, David and Frank had contacted me over
at Anson Belt and Buckle.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.550
And we had spoken about this product review.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.760
So, I did receive this product for free.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.360
But I felt good taking this product because
I had already heard from a friend that this

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.900
was a great product.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:34.370
Itís father-son, American small business
great little story.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.450
And theyíre really bringing a very innovative
technology with their belt and buckle system

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.460
that the men over at Anson Belt and Buckle
had done a great job with coming up with a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.600
product that is both innovative and stylish.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.160
So, without further ado, let me go ahead and
show you.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.510
This is the box that the product came in.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.730
Very nice.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.929
And when I opened it up, everything was wrapped
in this nice tissue paper with their logo

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:14.819
right there ñ the A. And inside were three
buckles, two belt straps, and instructions

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:19.439
on exactly how to ñ how to cut the strap.

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.380
So, here are the instructions.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.780
This is the black belt strap.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.789
This is a good quality leather.

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:33.390
And a friend of mine George Zaharoff, he has
owned and worn one of these belts for a period

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.890
of months and he compares the quality to ñ
usually, $500-belts that this man owns.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.020
And heís a designer.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.159
Heís in that industry.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.289
And if George, you know, whoís worn this
for months ñ I have to admit, as you can

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.349
see, these are still out of the box.

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:50.799
I do not have experience of wearing them.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.259
So, Iíll give you a one year report.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.259
I promise.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.689
You know, after a year, Iím going to come
back and give you a deeper report.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.390
Right now though, I can just feel in this
leather, itís very nice.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.259
Now, youíll notice this is really long.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.099
You can open this up here and just pop this
open.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.670
And youíll be cutting it straight across
and you can adjust it to exactly how long

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.670
you want it.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.620
Now, so what is this innovative technology
Iíve been talking about ñ this micro-adjust

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.620
technology?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.210
Basically, if you look at the back of the
belt, youíre going to notice there are no

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.510
ñ or I mean, look at the front.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.099
There are no holes.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.980
And thatís because theyíve got these little
catches right here.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.701
And so as I thread the belt through, you can
just hear it.

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:41.540
Basically, it is caught.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:52.700
And so, weíve really got something that adjusts,
basically, every quarter of an inch.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.819
So, you can get a much more exacting fit.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:04.310
What I also like about this is that it makes
sure that you wear the belt at the right length.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.489
So, it wonít let it catch until it looks
like about close to three inches, which should

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.959
be about right on most menís trousers.

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.819
And there is ñ it looks like a pretty extensive
range here.

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.290
Iíll have to measure that again.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.450
But right off the top of my head, that looks
like around eight inches that youíll have

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.049
of play there.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.430
I really like the system.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.900
In a sense, theyíve got three buckles and
theyíve got two belt straps.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.329
So, if you think about it, you have, instead
of just two belts, you actually have three

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.670
times two ñ you have six belt combinations
that depending on what type of shoes youíre

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:42.670
wearing.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.959
You know, usually you want to match leather
with leather.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.280
Youíre going to be able to do that.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.170
Now, the brown is a darker brown.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.950
I probably am going to suggest to the company
that they consider going with something lighter

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.579
as well and offering three belt straps.

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.730
By doing that, theyíre going to, in my opinion,
really notch up.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.659
I mean, all of a sudden you slip six combinations.

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.780
Youíre going to have nine combinations.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.410
And for those of us that like lighter brown
shoes, itís going to match a bit better.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.760
And it has this little release right here,
which is pretty simple.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.389
Iíll just turn it right there.

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.890
It looks like this is going to last.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.330
I donít see a lot of moving parts.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.410
Itís a very simple design.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.910
Iím really surprised that I havenít seen
this before.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.560
This belt buckle is substantial.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.930
Itís nice.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.450
Itís very well put together.

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:31.730
Very well polished.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.100
I mean, this is something that you can wear
as a dress belt with a suit.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.450
Or you can possibly, even wear it a little
bit, you know, less casual ñ more casual

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.130
ñ Iím sorry, combination.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.830
Possibly a sports jacket and odd trouser.

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.710
Possibly, even a nice pair of Levi 501ís
and a sports jacket.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.170
I mean, I know, I would pull off that combination.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.160
Each buckle is approximately $20.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.620
Each strap is $20.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.710
So, it comes out to $40 for a complete belt
system.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:12.780
I can tell you thatís very reasonable because
youíre going to pay $25 to $30 dollars for

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.090
an inferior belt at a box store, as it ñ
again, they rarely ever go on sale.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.670
If you want to get a nice designer belt, youíre
looking at $100.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.570
So here youíre getting a belt system and
I think, part of the savings has to do with

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.460
your buying directly from Anson Belt and Buckle.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.830
And I highly advise you check out their website,
maybe give them a call.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.360
Thatís the great thing about these small
companies.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.220
You can actually talk with the founders, with
the entrepreneurs who got this thing up and

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.160
going, and ask them any questions you have.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.250
And I think youíre going to be surprised
and excited to be one of the first people,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.910
you know, sporting this technology and looking
stylish when you do it.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:56.160
