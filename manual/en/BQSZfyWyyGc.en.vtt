00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.279
I'm Glenn Needham: associate professor of
into multi a high state university

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.110
uh... working on the emerging tic
problem in ohio

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.309
hero i would really have uh... three
kinds of text

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.659
pornstars dog checks and uh...

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.130
by clicking order tex

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.750
and they each sort of live in a
different habitat

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.500
so the first thing you need to do is
become aware of

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.869
where the tix are

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.839
so you know to go we prepare before you
walk into those areas

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.880
and so uh... fear we walk into grassy
areas

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.460
uh... that's where the american doctor
clothes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.140
uh... the other tickets alone startech
and that's where we are today lone star

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.040
to cavite and southern ohio

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.390
they were the more maturity habitat

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.710
and in the new bad actor in ohio is the
non-black elated or deer tick

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.450
and is found in uh... wooded habitats

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.110
and you definitely want to use a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.020
uh... repel a possible

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.100
and also tuck your pants in your socks
we're like color clothing

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.510
this is mainly so you can visualize the
tix crawling on the clothing

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.310
and so when they get on they crawl up
until a fine exposed skin

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.770
and this is one reason people think that
text

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.620
fall out of trades cuz they find 'em on
the head all the time

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.730
so tix are rarely higher than the high
then once again on the crawl up

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:11.800
uh... what we really

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.710
uh... recommend is he not use the folk
methods that people try to do to get tix

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.810
to back off

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.540
for state they don't work

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.830
and number two they may be dangerous

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.140
and uh...

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.290
and so uh... it also be delayed removal

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.770
so it takes about of uh... twenty-four
to forty-eight hours for disease

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.850
transmission to occur so you really
shouldn't away now when the texture

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.200
found so using uh... jewelers four soak
your tweezers grabbed the tick is close

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.500
to the skin as possible pullin the
steady even pressure

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.200
is the way you remove a tech and then
save the tech

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.360
specialties are developing symptoms what
you're looking for is or uh... a rash of

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.840
bulls eye rash

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.190
because of your check

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.030
uh...

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.939
and if it's a consort was spotted rash
on your extra many sets of the first

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.390
time for rocky mountain spotted fever

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.300
and so really three disease we worry
about a high overlooking ocis

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.190
which is transmitted by a lone star's a
rocky mountain spotted fever which is

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.179
transmitted by american politics but
less than two percent of the texan ohio

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.869
or carriers of that disease

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.369
and then lyme disease associated with
uh... with the black leader check

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.629
so if there are any unusual symptoms
uh... high fever

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.409
uh... flu like symptoms then take that
equity to your health care professional

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.489
and then they'll be thinking as possibly
a check for disease and we don't do any

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.239
testing of takes an ohio really should
start treatment before any ticket is

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.199
uh... tested for hiv any disease that's
really not going to help you out there

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.769
uh... the best sources of information
are going to be on the internet if you

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.579
want to have quick access to that and
um...

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.230
and we just uh... revise the tic tac
sheet for our seeking them

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.229
obtain ad for an extension

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:50.839
and that will have information all the
ticks that we've and we've been

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.049
discussing

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.680
uh... odeon are has a lot of information
this is a great place to go

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.470
for people who are hunting now looking
for that kind of information and then a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.009
couple of websites uh... one is uh...
call tech and counter

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.299
and uh... that has uh... the seasonal

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.019
uh... activity of texans eases
transmitted by text

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.639
and then there's one you can download on
your smartphone this call tick ap

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:16.839
and it has all sorts of information on
take identification how would diseases

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:20.349
they transmit what to do about them and
that sort of thing so those are closer

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.909
good places to start

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.189
and then uh... find i guess the cdc

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:26.189
if you put cdc and

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.199
whatever disease you're interested in
ill take it to them

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.639
federal information
