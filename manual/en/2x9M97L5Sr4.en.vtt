00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.930
So the sandbox

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.370
is a new space it's about a year old in
the library and it's an experimental

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.550
technology space.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.840
the ASPSU, OIT and the library

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.090
all contributed to create a space that

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.019
has movable furniture and has technology
that can change based on what we think

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.999
students might be interested in using

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.649
So, this is our family-friendly study
room. At Portland State, we have

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.750
a lot of student parents who often need
to do their work when they're also

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.890
taking her their

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.570
young children. They can check out a key
and we can accommodate up to two family

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.500
group at a time

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.769
and there's so much fun stuff in the
room for the kids to play with

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.809
For the parents,

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.830
these computers students can sit at and
do their homework, do their reading

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.880
students can close the door and the kids
can play and have fun or

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.880
read a book or watch a movie and the
parents can get their work done...
which is great.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.619
So right now, we are and one of the
library's group study rooms. 
We have several.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.520
This one is one of our tech enabled
room so we actually have a computer that

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.570
can move around so students can

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.969
sit down, ah, with other people that
they're working in a group and use the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.780
computer.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.120
We have a lot of great stuff happening
here. We have peer to peer tutoring

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.360
Each term we help out students in about
4,000 tutoring sessions.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.580
We also offer a program called academic
coaching. So, if you have questions about

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.479
study strategies, how to juggle

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.130
the stuff that's happening in college,
and we also offer college success classes.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.229
So, if you really wanted a focus
concentrate experience you can actually

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:03.320
enroll for a class.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.420
The coaching in the tutoring are all free. 
You can sign up online for the workshops

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.010
and for the academic coaching, but you can
also sign up here too

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.220
So, we have librarians and library staff
working at the reference desk and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.390
helping students find

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.830
articles, books, data, statistics. Whatever they
need in order to write their papers 
and do their assignments.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.340
We also help students through online
chat and that's available 24/7.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.800
Something brand new that we just started
loaning out are calculators.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.630
The math department is to loan
calculators but we're doing it now

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.600
what's also great

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.950
is that students can check out laptops
from the library for use within the

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.930
library building.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.030
They are set up with the same software
in the same setup as

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.590
in a typical PSU lab computer.
