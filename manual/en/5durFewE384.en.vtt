00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.096
This is Locco

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:22.433
1st national from Brive 2010

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.784
Flown with a 10 minute lead

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.124
Last year this pigeon raced 5 long distance races and each time at the front!

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:38.643
Was also the best pigeon over 5 national long distance races from Belgium

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.765
He has just moulted his first flight feather this week

00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:59.341
Look, his form ball

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:08.032
Since last year I have applied a "three box system" with this pigeon

00:01:08.517 --> 00:01:11.340
to motivate him more

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:22.334
These three boxes are from him

00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:25.685
During the week he resides in the middle box

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.272
When I have to motivate him, and before basketting,

00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:33.830
this box is fully opened

00:01:34.767 --> 00:01:39.119
and the other two half-opened

00:01:40.084 --> 00:01:42.630
So that is three boxes, and he has three hens

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:48.666
In the winter he had eggs with all three

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.752
but he didn't "live there". He hasnâ€™t raised any youngsters

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.199
Each time the pigeon returns home from a race, his three hens are waiting for him

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:04.343
And he is shut in the box with the hen that he stays with the longest

00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:06.215
and the others are removed.

00:02:07.104 --> 00:02:11.645
Over the last four years I have had more than 100 pure first prizes

00:02:12.033 --> 00:02:21.534
Middle distance to long distance. From 340 km to 800 km

00:02:22.517 --> 00:02:31.569
Between 2000 and 2009 I had 46 classifications in provincial championships

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:39.049
Frans, it has been noticed that over the last few years a lot of people 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.440
have been successful with De Rauw-Sablon pigeons.

00:02:42.075 --> 00:02:45.419
How does it feel to see all those people enjoying success with your pigeons?

00:02:46.054 --> 00:02:53.682
It gives me an enormous amount of pleasure when I learn that there is blood in them from this sort.

00:02:54.649 --> 00:03:01.749
The best fanciers from Belgium know how to expand their breeding strategy further

00:03:02.078 --> 00:03:05.493
with their good sort, so as Johan Van Damme did,

00:03:05.775 --> 00:03:08.552
and then go back to our sort, De Rauw-Sablon.

00:03:09.003 --> 00:03:14.227
Last year I discovered that those pigeons kept striving for the top in Belgium

00:03:14.664 --> 00:03:17.335
and they will certainly keep doing so in the future.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.094
Especially by the good fanciers.

00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:28.127
Johan, what are you ambitions for the coming years?

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:33.761
I would like to carry on as I am now, so winning an important title.

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:39.640
It is not easy getting to the top, but staying at the top is much harder.

00:03:40.108 --> 00:03:43.431
But we keep doing our best, and we will see.

00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:47.602
Perfect
