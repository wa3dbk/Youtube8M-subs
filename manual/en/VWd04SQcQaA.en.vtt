00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.519
So, if you'll remember what we just did. We
attached the zipper key and then we flipped

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:10.519
the purse out to the wrong sides. We have
the lining on one side. The body of the purse

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.410
on the other side. With the zipper in the
middle. And what we're going to do now is

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.560
go ahead and create this front piece where
the zipper is. It looks like it's about an

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.280
inch and a half from the top here. And I'm
going to do the same thing over here. So let

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:31.170
me show you how to do that. And I'm going
to start on the side where the zipper has

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.090
been closed. It's just easier. And all I'm
going to do is measure from the top to the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.980
zipper. And that looks good. You can make
it. You can put the zipper in the middle if

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.079
you want. I like to keep it about an inch
and a half from the top. Let's measure that.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.511
Let me make it exactly an inch and a half
to make it easy. So I made an inch and a half

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:57.590
right in the middle of the zipper tape. And
I'm going to pin this. Keep it all in there

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.770
real tight and put a pin in there so I know
that's where I want to sew it. And I'll measure

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:10.670
the bottom in a minute just to make sure that
it's nice and even too. Okay. And I've got

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.659
three pins just to hold it down nice. And
let me flip it over on the other side. And

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.389
now I want to make sure that this, right in
the middle of this zipper tape to the very

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:27.340
top is an inch and a half also. So it will
match. See, now I wish I would have cut those

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:35.869
threads off. They're in the way. I'm going
to go ahead and cut those. Okay. So, there's

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:45.619
an inch and a half exactly right there. So
if I can just hold this. Make sure the lining

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.219
matches up with it also. There's a lot of
holding involved in making this little purse.

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:55.490
Like holding it tight. Making it do what you
want. We need to measure that one more time

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.039
to make sure that's right. Yes, it's an inch
and a half. And so what we do with the other

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.290
side of the zipper is just match it right
up with it. Because that's what it should

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.239
look like. It should match right up. I'm going
to hold that and put another pin in. Then

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:17.180
with another pin in the bottom also. Now,
the more pins you have the better your project

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.760
comes out. So I'm going to do an all over
measurement to make sure everything's matching

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:29.120
up. So this is five and a half inches from
top to bottom. And this one is five and a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.180
half inches from top to bottom. So now I know
that it's perfectly straight. And now I'm

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.769
going to go ahead and sew the sides closed.
