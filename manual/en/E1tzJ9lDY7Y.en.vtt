00:00:18.205 --> 00:00:24.516
From the monasteries of Ivgorod comes a powerful servant of the Saphtev faith…. KHARAZIM.

00:00:25.301 --> 00:00:29.380
Like all monks, he has devoted his life to serving his one thousand and one gods,

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:32.413
and their mortal representatives, the Patriarchs.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:37.415
In obeying their will, Kharazim has traveled from Sanctuary to the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.411
battlefields of the Nexus, where he now seeks to bring divine balance to the chaos.

00:00:47.502 --> 00:00:50.989
Kharazim is an aggressive and mobile hero that relies on talents

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:55.749
to enhance his capability to support his team or deal damage to enemies.

00:01:00.782 --> 00:01:03.931
Kharazim can choose his trait at the start of every match.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.804
Each will trigger a different effect every third basic attack:

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.687
IRON FISTS lands a critical hit

00:01:12.992 --> 00:01:16.534
TRANSCENDENCE heals himself or a nearby ally

00:01:17.594 --> 00:01:22.514
INSIGHT restores mana, allowing him to thrive in sustained combat.

00:01:23.944 --> 00:01:29.357
Kharazim’s first ability is RADIANT DASH, and can be used on enemies or allies.

00:01:29.903 --> 00:01:34.188
When used offensively, the monk leaps forward and strikes with a basic attack,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.069
putting him instantly in position to inflict further punishment.

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:43.542
This ability stores multiple charges, allowing it to be used in quick succession.

00:01:44.773 --> 00:01:48.758
His next ability, BREATH OF HEAVEN, grants healing and mobility.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:51.510
Kharazim, and any friendly heroes nearby,

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:56.151
will receive a moderate heal and a boost in movement speed for several seconds.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.887
Kharazim’s third ability, DEADLY REACH,

00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:02.781
is a self-buff that applies some serious pressure.

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:06.054
Once primed, it will activate on his next melee strike,

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.982
greatly increasing his attack speed and range for several seconds.

00:02:10.692 --> 00:02:15.302
Faster attacks means Kharazim’s chosen trait will trigger far more frequently.

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:20.094
Kharazim’s first Heroic ability, SEVEN SIDED STRIKE,

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.478
unleashes a punishing flurry of attacks upon nearby enemies.

00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:25.494
The monk becomes invulnerable,

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.758
and each of his seven hits land for seven percent of the enemy hero’s total health.

00:02:31.874 --> 00:02:34.576
Each strike can hit different heroes, and Kharazim will automatically

00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:37.663
target the enemy that has the most remaining health.

00:02:39.346 --> 00:02:42.102
Kharazim’s second Heroic ability is DIVINE PALM.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.335
Cast upon himself or an ally, it endures for only three seconds,

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:50.245
but if its target suffers lethal damage during that time,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.894
they will receive a massive healing effect after a short delay,

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:56.062
putting them back in the fight.

00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:03.733
When playing Kharazim, here are a few strategic tips:

00:03:04.554 --> 00:03:08.338
Remember to use your Radiant Dash for both damage and utility.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.414
Dive into battle and help secure a final blow,

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.039
or use it to evade enemies while your teammates bring the damage.

00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:17.775
Don’t be afraid to use Radiant Dash for a quick escape,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.793
as it works on minions and allied heroes.

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:24.059
Deadly Reach and Breath of Heaven can be used to help

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:26.158
vulnerable assassins chase down opponents.

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:29.447
The added movement speed and melee range allows you

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:31.614
to be at their side while dishing out damage,

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:35.807
and a well-timed Breath of Heaven can heal multiple wounded allies.

00:03:36.948 --> 00:03:39.910
Kharazim’s heroics offer an array of tactical options.

00:03:40.246 --> 00:03:41.874
Does your team need extra damage?

00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:46.406
Pick Seven-Sided Strike to soften up enemies before a major engagement.

00:03:47.115 --> 00:03:51.101
This heroic can be especially great against multiple warrior compositions,

00:03:51.714 --> 00:03:54.790
since it deals damage based on an enemy’s total health.

00:03:55.894 --> 00:04:00.390
Divine Palm is perfect when facing a team with powerful dive compositions.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:02.822
Use the heroic on a vulnerable teammate

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:05.687
just before your opponents land a finishing blow,

00:04:06.385 --> 00:04:09.765
and your ally will survive the damage and have enough health to retaliate.

00:04:10.426 --> 00:04:12.206
Keep in mind the ability’s short range;

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.886
you’ll often need to use Radiant Dash to get into position.

00:04:17.447 --> 00:04:20.991
Kharazim is relatively light on health and doesn’t put out the highest

00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:23.159
amount of damage after using his abilities.

00:04:24.505 --> 00:04:30.278
After he dives in, a quick team-focused attacked can eliminate him from the battle.

00:04:36.114 --> 00:04:39.757
