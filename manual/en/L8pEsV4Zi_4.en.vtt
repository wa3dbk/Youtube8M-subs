BRYAN BILLHIMER: Hi. I'm Bryan Billhimer and
on behalf of Expert Village, welcome to Guitar

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.760
Playing 101, The Basics. Okay. So, now we're
going to talk about a different way to play

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.770
the major scale and just get a little more
in depth. Over here to our diagram, I've drawn

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:23.170
another diagram. This diagram is out of the
major scale fingering. So, you're going to

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:31.252
read it. It's going to go in this order. Okay?
Now, we're going to start. We're going to

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:36.300
play this first dot which is the third fret
on the low E string which happens to be a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.870
G note. So, this will be a G major scale.
We're going to start with our second finger.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.440
The reason we do that is because when we get
down to this string, we have to go back a

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.499
fret. So, we're going to use our index finger
to play that note and that note. That way,

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:56.741
we limit the amount of times that we have
to shift up and down the neck. This will allow

00:00:56.741 --> 00:01:03.469
us to stay in one position. Now, I'm going
to show you. Second fret--I'm sorry, third

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:15.390
fret, second finger.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.329
That's our G major scale. Now, if we would've
started with our first finger when we got

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.820
to the second string which is the A string,
we would have to shift back, but starting

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.509
with our second finger allows us to not have
to do that. That makes you play more efficiently

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.299
and as you get further down the road, it's
going to make you a faster guitar player.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.359
Now, once you get this down, you want to practice
the scale as much as you can. You want to

00:01:48.359 --> 00:02:09.080
practice it going forward and backwards. And
you want to remember to alternate your picking.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.570
And you can also play this using this finger
pattern. You can play it anywhere as long

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.470
as you start on the low E string. So, we can
play it on the fifth--start on the fifth fret

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:34.530
and play an A scale.
Start on the eighth fret, play a C scale and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.150
so on. I would suggest playing that scale
all the way up and down the neck.
