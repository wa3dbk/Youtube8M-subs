00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
Set the ice block right in the center of the shaver.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.220
Lower the teeth plate to grip the ice block.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.980
Make sure that the knob has twisted to thin.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.660
And then turn the shaver on.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:30.140
Turn the knob to proper thickness, and the ice will start to drop.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:58.000
At this time, you can hold the sliced ice with a plate.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.040
when you finish shaving the ice, be sure to turn the knob back to thin and don’t let the ice drop. And then turn off the shaver.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.440
The tips to shave silky texture snow ice.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.580
1. Quality: The less ice crystals the better for the ice block to make a continual pile of delicate snow ice.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.380
The key point is that the ice block making machine must be a quick-freezing compressor, and you must have good quality powder which emulsifies well. (The emulsifying colloid of JK FOODS is from natural botanical composition).

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.380
In short, better quality ice blocks make the texture of snow ice silkier.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.380
2. Hardness: When shaving the ice, please choose ice blocks of appropriate hardness. Generally, the temperature must be between -19~-25℃.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.380
If the ice block isn’t hard enough, you need to twist the knob to proper thickness so that it can be shaved, but it won’t be puffy and will melt easily. If the ice block is too hard, it will be difficult to shave.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.380
Only blocks with appropriate hardness can be shaved into puffy, delicate, continual slices. The freezer is the key point. Keep the snow ice blocks with jam in the lift-up door freezer (-25℃) and keep others in glass sliding door freezer (-19℃).

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.040
3. The angle of the blade: The blade should be sharpened frequently for the shop to have a good business. The more oblique angle the blade is (the angle that has contact with the block), the easier to shave slices, but it can’t be too oblique or the block will get stuck.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.040
The blade will become shorter and shorter because of sharpening, so it needs to be set upwards so that it can be oblique. The higher the blade, the better. When the block gets stuck or can’t shave ice, that means the blade is set too high.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
4. Cut off any bumps on the ice block: When de-molding, be sure to cut off any bumps on the ice, or it won’t be easy to set in the center of the shaver- you need to twist the knob to proper thickness to shave the ice;

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040
however, the texture won’t be silky, therefore you’ll only get about 5 servings instead of 10. So, don’t be lazy about cutting off any bumps.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.040
5.Set the ice block in the center: When shaving the ice, be sure to set it in the center of the shaver. The distance between the ice and all around the plate should be the same.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040
Concentrate on the serving plate, not the ice shaver, to make sure the shaved ice is falling even on the plate. Practice makes perfect.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.040
6. The procedure of shaving ice:
Twist the knob to thin.&gt; Choose an ice block of appropriate hardness.&gt;Set the block in the center of the shaver.&gt;Lower the teeth plate to grip the ice block and turn the shaver on. &gt;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.040
Look at the rotating ice block to make sure it’s firmly in place. If it is not, turn off the shaver and reset the block right in the center. &gt;Turn the knob to proper thickness, and the ice will start to drop. Continually turn the knob to thick till the ice turns to slices which are the thinnest; at this time, you can hold the sliced ice with a plate. &gt;

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.040
when you finish shaving the ice, be sure to turn the knob back to thin and don’t let the ice drop. After that, turn off the shaver and put the ice block back in the freezer. Be sure to follow this rule so that 
the ice won’t drop just when you turn on the shaver and you can control it to shave the thinnest slices, that is, the thinner the better.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.040
7. Thick slices: When the blade can’t touch the whole surface of the ice or the ice drops too fast just when you turn the shaver on, the slices will be very thick. So don’t be lazy and be sure to make it a rule to follow procedure 6.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
8. The ice melts: If the freezer is opened frequently, the environment is too hot, or the ice is out of the freezer for too long a time, then these are the reasons why you won’t be ale to shave good quality ice. So try to install a radiator to let the hot air out or install an air-conditioner and don’t leave the freezer open or lift the door of the freezer too high.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.040
9. De-mold: Don’t de-mold till the entire surface of the ice melts. If it refreezes, the bottom of the ice will be out of shape and there will be lots of crystal ice, and even the plastic bag which is used to store the ice block will stick to it. So rinse the outside of the pots with water to de-mold right after you take the blocks out of the ice making machine. De-mold 5-10 blocks at once, cut off the bumps, put them in plastic bags and store them in the freezer.
