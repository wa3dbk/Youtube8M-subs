00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.580
Who are you?
I'm Doctor Jodie Rowley and I'm an Amphibian

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.880
Biologist
at the Australian Museum.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.390
What's with these fanged tadpoles...
first of all what are they and how big are

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.720
they?
OK, the fanged tadpoles are from the species

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.339
"Rhacophorus vampyrus"
otherwise known as the "Vampire Tree Frog".

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:25.869
Ahh... they're small tadpoles.
I've actually got some in a jar here.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.069
So, only a couple of centimetres long
and really long and really skinny.

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.810
They live in small tree holes in the forest
in Southern Viet Nam

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.680
and they have fangs
so which has what a lot of the hype has been

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.720
about.
Ah, they're not actually fangs but they are

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.600
black curved hooks
that stick out their mouth

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.504
which you can in this image here
That leads on the the big question which everyone

00:00:50.504 --> 00:00:51.504
is asking
Do they suck blood?

00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:56.170
Tell us the answer is yes!
I can't tell you the answer is "no" 100% but

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.059
it's pretty
unlikely that they do suck blood.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.010
It's probably related to the fact that they
live in such small

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.270
bodies of water in the tree
So, maybe they eat something strange

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.150
or maybe they use them for hooking onto the
tree or something like that

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.370
Going on this whole vampire myth here...
they suck blood... they fly... are they afraid

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.760
of the sunlight
or anything like this that we know of?

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.730
Well, they are nocturnal so they are only
active at night so

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.020
they are hiding during the day
so you only ever see them out at night

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.220
and that's when we go out, with head lamps
on, looking for them.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.060
The flying thing... it's quite apt that that
group of frogs they belong to are called flying

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.810
frogs.
It's not because they flap and fly off of

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.020
trees,
but they do have this webbing between their

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.190
hands and toes
and they do glide...

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.890
well they are also called parachuting frogs
so basically they can jump from branch to

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.170
branch
without having to go to the group

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.100
One big question is...how did you actually
find this frog?

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.420
Well, we tend to look for cool new species
fo frogs in mountains

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.100
so, I spend a lot of my time climbing up mountains
with my colleagues in Viet Nam

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.170
So, this was in the Southern Highlands of
Viet Nam

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.860
I fly there first obviously then we get a
car or motorbikes as

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.890
far as we can go and then it's on foot
and basically climbing mountains.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.670
This site was a little easier than most
but it usually does involve carrying everything

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.050
we need for a couple of weeks on our backs
and climbing up mountains and there is usually

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.690
no paths.
So are you saying that the life of a scientist

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.830
is not as glamorous
as it's made out to be?

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.750
I don't know, that's pretty exciting.
I mean, this part, where I sit in the chair

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.010
in the office
looking down a microscope and on a computer

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.390
is probably...
I guess it is more glamorous to the alternative

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.210
which is covered in leeches in the forest
So, and you've climbed through the mountains

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.600
and how did you find this amazing frog?
Well, we don;t know what we are looking for,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.280
so a lot of people have said
"Were you looking for this specific frog?"

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.420
Well, we don't know it's there. We've got
no idea.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.770
So, all we do is we choose usually a wet time
of year

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.610
(in these kinds of places there's usually
not a dry

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.810
time of year to be honest with you).
so, it's all cloud forest, all wet. Everything

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.470
is covered in fungus
including you.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.970
And we put headlamps on and go! And look and
see what you can see.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.220
And you can hear frogs calling, obviously
And so you can focus in on those ones and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.310
see what it is.
And you can also see the eyeballs shining

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:15.910
back at you
if you wear a headlamp on.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.511
So we spend a lot of time looking in the trees
to see

00:03:18.511 --> 00:03:20.380
if we can see any frog eyeballs staring back
at us.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.349
Well, thanks for your time'
Thank you very much
