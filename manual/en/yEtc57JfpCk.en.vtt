00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.649
know that's really why i like the pocket

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.990
are so many except also is heavy on
content and that is foot board

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.799
flip board is great for catching up with
your news hearing cover stories will

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.080
show me the top stories on these pages a
conceit all of my different channels for

on that show me every single story from

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.170
the next wed

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.599
if i go back to cover stories they see
how this works is it pulls in

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.979
maybe one or two stories from the neck
swept

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.450
maybe one or two from you know max
towards working at all

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.900

the top right i can go and add some new

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.350
topics presses for good atop tech and
science uh... there's a bunch of

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.030
different ways if about a different
channels for instance like cement i

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.930
could add that in now ill show up in my
cover stories overall if you're going to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.230

way to do it are so next act is fiscal

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.470

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.889
came in

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:21.319
you can actually see a wide view of what
i'm doing their is dean microphone

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.610
beheading tap on it

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.849
hiking even set one for exposure one for
focus but that's not the cool thing

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:27.949
about the apt

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.989
they're going to tap on a photo i can
get him edit it

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.659
great thing about this is after all
these filters i get to add if i want to

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.289
go ahead and change how strong it is

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.430
but that's not all at the school
settings wrench i can actually change

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.170
things like my exposure

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.239
uh...

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.629
is there's a bunch different things i
think we care there are up bunch of

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.309
different things you can do with the sap
in is free you can purchase more filters

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:56.649
if you would like and i actually have
and other great and they're like ninety

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.949
nine cents arts last not least is now
called fantastico

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:03.569
well fantastico is pretty fantastic

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:04.519
how it works

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.089
is basically first and foremost

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:11.459
eight is a calendar apt but the greatest
thing in my opinion about that s cal

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.920
is it's parser injured

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.320
uh... so we can go ahead in typing
details about it that immuno

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.100
automatically fill in the

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.880
all of these down here you know like the
time where it is you know how many times

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.369
we should repeat it eccentric setter so
um...

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:30.189
what we did it

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.579
interview was going to is it knows it's
on wednesday uh... it knows it's you

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.039

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:37.019
and uh... it

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:38.619
ill tell me go to the park

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.830
uh... it creates a severe it's it's
honestly pretty cool just how good it is

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.770
uh... so that is fantastic al uh... what
is the degree is part of it is it's

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.909
parser engine any it's even just great
using it as a calendar apt

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.329
you know just viewing events that's also
great at preheating effects

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:58.469
