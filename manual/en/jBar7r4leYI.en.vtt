00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.761
-Woah alright Dav, Yeah you got them both then.
-Go on, go through them, break the pads.

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:12.246
-Hello I'm Tim, this is Gendle.
-How.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:18.462
And welcome to KIT exclusively on COPA90, and don't forget to subscribe for all the very best videos.

00:00:18.462 --> 00:00:21.561
-Right Tim what are we doing in this jodo?
-Dojo.

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:26.012
-We are here Gendle because of these.
-Shin pads.

00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:30.256
They are not just any shin pads Gendle; let me refer to the press release, which is...

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:39.660
Ah there it is, this here says that these GL Sports Elite Armour shin pads are all the way from Italy.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.923
Individually made from carbon fibre, which allows them to soften and absorb blows without cracking, 

00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:49.421
and apparently they are as resistant as steel.

00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:56.469
-Phwoar, I still don't know why we are here though?
-Put them on my young grasshopper, you soon will.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.339
What hopper? What did you just call me? Grass what?

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:08.958
I'm ready.

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:12.441
Ahh yes good, you are ready. 

00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:14.607
-Why are you talking like that?
-I don't know really.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.423
-Right so you have got the shin pads on.
-Yep.

00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:21.187
Right now we are going to test these in a football situation, what happens on the football pitch?

00:01:21.187 --> 00:01:23.154
-Well kicking isn't it.
- Yeah Exactly so if I just...

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:25.389
-How is that for you?
-It's fine, yeah good.

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:29.739
-I think they work. 
-I think we need to up the intensity a little bit, where's my Kendo stick?

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.839
-Ahh there it is.
-What's that?

00:01:31.839 --> 00:01:33.895
-What this?
-Watch it. 

00:01:33.895 --> 00:01:36.562
-Don’t move.
-Watch it.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:41.306
They really work, yeah brilliant.

00:01:41.306 --> 00:01:46.697
-Well job done.
-No, no, no I think we need to up the ante a little bit, what about Dav?

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:57.232
-Dav looks busy if you ask me. 
-I'll ask him. 
*Whistle*

00:01:57.232 --> 00:02:01.256
Hey Dav, come here a sec. 

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:03.022
-Here he is look.
-Alright Dav.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:03.857
Hello.

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:09.622
See these shin pads here they claim to be as strong as steel, I just wondered if you could have a quick go on them, see if you can do any damage?

00:02:09.622 --> 00:02:12.121
-Sure man.
-I don't know if you want to use the stick or a kick?

00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:15.931
-Maybe you should lift your knee up a little bit.
-Okay, what are you doing?

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:18.098
Bit harder, bit harder.

00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:19.438
-Yep. 
-Ooh.

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:22.220
-I think that is probably enough huh?
-You have got a pretty good kick there Dav.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.073
-Harder?
-Could you do it any harder?

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:26.394
-Sure, I might break his leg though. 
-What?

00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:28.726
-Oh no don't break his leg.
-That's fine, that’s fine.

00:02:28.726 --> 00:02:31.327
-Do you want a go with the stick maybe? 
-Yeah man.

00:02:31.327 --> 00:02:33.926
-Really? Get it over and done with.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.090
-Alright Dav, yep you got them both there. 
-Go on. go through them, break the pads.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.657
*Scream*

00:02:43.657 --> 00:02:46.107
-Make him stop, make him stop.
-Aww, are you alright?

00:02:46.107 --> 00:02:49.356
-Where is my big stick? This isn't working. 
-What? What big stick?

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:52.983
-This one.
-No, no, no what is he doing with that? 

00:02:52.983 --> 00:02:55.068
-You ready?
-Your not are you?

00:02:55.068 --> 00:03:01.702
-Yeah brace yourself. 
-Woah, woah, woah I have got an idea, why don't we test them without my legs in them?

00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:04.314
-That is a great idea.
-It's a brilliant idea.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:12.592
-They won't go.
-No, nothing. 

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:15.374
Nothing.

00:03:15.374 --> 00:03:18.710
Give me the big stick. 

00:03:19.243 --> 00:03:23.541
-Woah, nice shooting Tex. 
-Dav.

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:30.973
-Woah, Go on Dav. 
-Harder.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.656
*Shouts*

00:03:39.015 --> 00:03:43.854
These are definitely the strongest Shin Pads that we have ever come across.  

00:03:43.854 --> 00:03:46.924
Easily, I can't believe they broke Dav's big stick, it's his favourite.

00:03:46.924 --> 00:03:50.395
-I know, he is not happy about it. 
-No.

00:03:52.394 --> 00:03:54.097
-Shall we go?
-Yeah I think so.

00:03:54.097 --> 00:03:58.855
