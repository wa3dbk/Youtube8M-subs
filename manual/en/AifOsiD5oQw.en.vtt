00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.720
greetings people he cheap when hackman
here AKA  Whackstar. I really appreciate you watching

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.080
a number of months ago well almost a
year ago I

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.830
hosted very basic very simple cam

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.350
corder a quality tutorials on how I
created

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.480
my raspberry PI Asterisk phone server
system

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
I have to say I'm very grateful for the
support and the people that have viewed

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.189
those half a dozen videos I do apologize
they weren't the best of quality

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.450
and I didn't know what the outcome of
the project was going to be like

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.880
almost a year later my little Raspberry PI has been working

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.780
effectively it's been great up until
couple of days ago when

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.480
I sustained equipment failure SD card
failure

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.620
So I'm gonna start again a fresh
install rebuilt my phone system

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.000
and I'm gonna try and document it step
by step so hopefully if anybody out

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.350
there would like a better quality
version one

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.700
I've put on previously this might be
helpful helpful

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.840
I am by no means an expert and I am very
appreciated

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.290
the guys that created this website
Asteerisk to Raspberry Pi

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.750
you can go to raspberrypi-asterisk.org

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.960
and you know every think I've learnt is
of this website and

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.860
you know if you find this helpful please
donate to them because they worked

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.890
really hard I would never be able to
achieve anything like this and no it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.840
down to business

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.220
obviously go to the website you gonna be
a couple things to start of for civil

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.119
you gonna go to the website click on the
download section and scroll down until

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.020
you get to the bit where you've got the
latest

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
image so you can download whatever way
that you are convenient now what I've

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.110
done is I've downloaded

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.100
and then I've placed it on my desktop
then if you're on a Mac

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.149
you gonna need to install something
called pyrite to

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.030
I search for pie writer in Google you
can download it from

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.520
SourceForge and install that and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.960
put them onto your computer I once
you've done that

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.810
the next thing that you need to do is
install

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.299
the brawls 3pi image onto the SD card

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.570
now I've got and eight gig called I'm
going to use this time

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.610
should be more should be sufficient for
what I want

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.060
to do with my PBX distribution

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.000
so what you need to do is you need to
open pyrite up so there are gonna that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.540
and it gives you some very simple
instructions on how to do this

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.129
um it best rt1 digi going to install so
I want to use

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.239
the Rosebery on distribution I've
downloaded

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.310
so you'll need to navigate wherever
you've downloaded it

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.330
and then it will say disconnect to SD
card

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.060
disconnect the SD card click OK its
gonna say

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.790
are now connected the car so I'm just
putting the the SD card into my computer

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.629
I you'll see the it appear and then you
click on

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.310
okay it will then go through the process

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.519
installing that image onto that SD card

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.019
ready for you to use okay so you've
image the SD card to put the SD card

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.250
into your pie

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.019
you plug your pie and your local network
using an Ethernet cable

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.230
and then you power up you wait for about
30 seconds to a minute for today its

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.010
first boot

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.550
and then it's ready to roll now the
beauty of this installation if you don't

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.120
need to

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.239
unless you want to plug your pie into a
computer monitor

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.750
or and a keyboard you can configure this
using any computer on the network to one

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.920
using my Mac

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.500
I and the procedure for using a PC is
very similar

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.019
sites what having up the ass tricks from
raw Ross trip I website go to the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.680
documentation section

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.150
stroll down until you find the section
of determining your hostname and IP

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.590
address I can

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.879
now I like to use a PC software
Courtland scandal I actually like to

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.200
know

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.739
the physical IP address above my rawls

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.360
repin I will at some point fix it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.099
because I need that for a fixed IP
address and

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.390
I'll go into that and some detail
perhaps in another film

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.140
I'm but you can see that Meyer Osprey
pie he is

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.379
on this address on my local network now
if I was the type that into my web

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.150
browser up

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.409
you will get the Ralph 3pi

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.190
administration however if you can't be
bothered to find it

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.540
actual physical IP address there's a
quicker way of doing it

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.759
and you can see here all the
documentation set

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:26.250
if you're using a Mac you just need to
tell I'm tight this

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.180
section here into a web browser
something a copy that

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.250
go to a blank page here gonna pop back

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.490
in that just that and what will happen
is

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.100
you will go into your free PBX
administration site

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.810
which is brilliant because if I was to
now click onto the free PBX

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:44.759
administration

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:48.470
it will asking for a username and
password and

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.759
that is very very standard you can
stroll down

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.440
and you can find that in the res Rosli
PDX it's simple it's just at man

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.389
at min i cant at now I would strongly
suggest

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.330
that you change the passwords once
you've got your system up and running

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.090
because if you're going to see configure
in a way that people can access

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.440
your pile you can access your pie over
the Internet

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.000
people will try and hack your system and
it's really important that you scroll

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.530
down

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.979
and you install this pizza software hey
call install

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.560
fail to band now the way that you gonna
do that is you're gonna need to go

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.280
through a terminal

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.380
section and the way to connect to the
terminal is very very

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.139
simple all the the command prompt
whatever you wanna call it

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.250
and it's quite simply go back up to the
section is if you're using

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.690
a Mac you tight this into

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.979
your rum you typed this into

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.070
your terminal you open up a terminal
package

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.810
and you can see that I've done that
already I'm actually using the

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:55.840
IP address here and it will take you
into the terminal so you can start

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:56.830
writing

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.870
code income moms that will configure

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.819
your PB X one it eventually loads and

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.419
bear in mind this is it's only a a basic
processor it's not gonna go to lightning

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:09.190
quick

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.160
but once eventually gives you it will
also you for the root password

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.590
which again is always roots and

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.650
the the user ID to go that is

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.460
Ralph raspberry all okay so there you go
that gives you all the basic bits and

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.169
pieces then

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:29.080
quite useful with this distribution it
also gives you basic commands if you

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.220
were to type any have

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.520
these into your terminal it will upgrade
your system you can configure your time

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:35.080
zone

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.060
you can install a fact bit I've never
used that no have not had the Neil

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.380
the need to that to do that the failed
to ban thing which is very important to

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.229
stop people from hacking your system

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.259
and also install a dull gold now I'm
gonna make a an extra video about that

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.110
to talk to you about how you can set up

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.789
GSM calling with I'm using a SIM card so
there you go

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.599
you all comfy it you all ready to go now
you can settle your configuration

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:01.470
setting up

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.259
and all sorts a bits and pieces up so
that you can start using

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:08.569
your free PBX system and thats

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:12.120
a little bit more complicated but that
is the simple way

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.889
of creating geraldo reply PBX
distribution

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:20.340
ready for you to configure for you to
use

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.599
on a personal or on a professional basis

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:27.319
I really appreciate you watching I hope
this looks a little better
