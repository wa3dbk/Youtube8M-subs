"What Diet Should 
Physicians Recommend?"

00:00:07.361 --> 00:00:14.670
In 2013, a Nutritional Update for Physicians 
was published in the official journal 
of Kaiser Permanente, 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.039
the largest managed care 
organization in the United States 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.065
which covers about nine million 
people with about 15,000 physicians, 

00:00:21.065 --> 00:00:26.763
who were told that healthy eating may be 
 best achieved with a plant-based diet, 

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:29.601
defined as a regimen that 
encourages whole, plant-based foods 

00:00:29.601 --> 00:00:34.394
and discourages meats, dairy, and eggs 
as well as all refined and processed junk. 

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:38.701
Too often, physicians ignore the 
potential benefits of good nutrition 

00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.101
and quickly prescribe medications 
instead of giving patients a chance 

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:46.970
to correct their disease through 
healthy eating and active living. 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.835
Physicians should therefore consider 
recommending a plant-based diet 
to ALL their patients, 

00:00:51.835 --> 00:00:56.854
especially those with high blood pressure, 
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or obesity. 

00:00:56.854 --> 00:01:00.369
The major downside is that it 
may work a little too well.

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.335
If people are on medications 
their blood pressure or blood sugar 

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:04.625
could actually 
drop too low, 

00:01:04.625 --> 00:01:06.648
so physicians may need 
to adjust medications 

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:09.769
or eliminate 
them altogether. 

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.419
Despite the strong body of evidence 
favoring plant-based diets, 

00:01:13.419 --> 00:01:16.827
many physicians are not stressing 
the importance of plant-based diets 

00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:19.854
as a first-line treatment 
for chronic diseases. 

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:22.502
This could be because of 
a lack of physician awareness—

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:26.636
or a lack of patient 
education resources. 

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:31.068
So Kaiser sought 
to change that. 

00:01:31.068 --> 00:01:33.553
Want to lose weight, feel better, 
improve, stabilize, 

00:01:33.553 --> 00:01:37.136
or even reverse chronic disease, 
and get off some of your medications? 

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:43.370
If you answered yes to any of these 
questions then a plant-based eating 
plan may be right for you. 

00:01:43.378 --> 00:01:47.270
Side-effects may include lower cholesterol, 
blood pressure, and blood sugar, 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:52.070
reversal or prevention of our #1 killer, 
a longer life, healthier weight, 

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:54.420
lower risk of cancer, diabetes—

00:01:54.423 --> 00:01:56.530
may even slow the progression 
of certain types of cancer, 

00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:02.040
and improve inflammatory conditions
like rheumatoid arthritis. 

00:02:02.046 --> 00:02:10.940
They offer tips to get 
started, meal plan ideas, 

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:17.530
and I'm honored to say, 
good taste in websites.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.610
The paper ends with a familiar refrain, 
"Further research is needed". 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.185
In this case, though, further research is 
needed... to find ways to make plant-based diets 

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:34.300
the new normal for our 
patients and employees.
