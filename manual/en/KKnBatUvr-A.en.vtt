00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.069
Before I came to um, UC Davis, 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.690
I was working in a clinic, a community health center clinic

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.139
 in Fresno as a case manager.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.220
for in healthcare for the
homeless program.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.740
I started searching for other programs -  for other P.A. programs at other

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.690
universities

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.880
really, um, UC Davis

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.820
caught my attention because of the 
mission. The mission is really

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.670
family orientated and community oriented
and to me that's important. It is very

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.880
interprofessional, I mean combining

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.990
experiences from physician assistants,
nurse practitioners, and medical doctors

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.550
really

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480
we learn from each other because at
the end we're gonna be working

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.210
with each other. My goal is to go back to

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.620
my community, Fresno, which is my home
now, to be able to

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.440
provide and serve the under-served.
That is the population that I can relate with.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.030
I have my first six blocks

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.609
primary-care in Fresno and

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.439
I'm excited I'm very excited to go out
to and really apply what I have

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:12.189
learned here.

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.899
I feel that with my career in what I
have learned in my profession I am gonna

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:18.770
make a difference.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.299
My plan is to, to work in under-served
communities,

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.670
under-served clinics. So five years from
now I think I'm gonna be there.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.189
I think I'm gonna be there because the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.389
under-served community, that is where I, I
feel that I belong because I grew up

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:40.319
in underserved areas and I I know that
there is a great need

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.340
and my people need me.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.930
I'm the first in my family to really
pursue this career

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.060
and to be able to graduate from college,
so being the first generation to be able

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.690
to accomplish something like this,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.659
I think is very emotional, sorry, 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.700
and it really, I am very proud.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.950
