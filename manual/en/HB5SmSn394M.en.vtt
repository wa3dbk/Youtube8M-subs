Hi this is Karen for Expert Village in this
step we'll cook and caramelize our onions

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.780
first take the 4 tablespoons of butter or
margarine and put that into your pan and melt

00:00:13.780 --> 00:01:05.509
it. You can put that on medium heat, melt
the butter, it's almost melted, okay that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:19.200
melted now we'll add our onions
and we're going to wilt those onions and we're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.240
just going to put them in the pot and cover
the pot and cook that for 20 minutes, and

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.939
we'll be stirring it occasionally and that
will wilt the onions. We don't want to brown

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.899
them to much we don't want to burn them so
we'll stir them once in a while, okay our

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:43.479
onions are wilting nicely if you notice that
the onions are browning a little bit to fast,

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.009
you should turn your heat down a little bit.
Turn that down you don't want them to burn

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:58.369
we just want them to brown so I'll tilt that
up for you to see, it's beginning to brown

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.180
and wilted nicely, okay let that cook for
another 10 minutes.
