00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.290
On this episode of China uncensored

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.090
China hacks again!

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.290
hi welcome to China uncensored I'm your host
Chris Chappell

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.929
chinese state back computer hackers have hit
the US government,

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.750
Western businesses and human rights organizations

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.449
but that was just small-time stuff

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.570
the hackers from the Chinese government have
just hit

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.900
what is clearly their greatest enemy

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.170
and the absolute biggest threat to China

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.780
pure traditional Chinese culture Shen Yun

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.881
That was a clip from Shen Yun

00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:43.590
a classical Chinese dance and music show that
travels around the world

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.790
according to their press release they were
the victims of a massive cyberattack from

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.070
China

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.960
although it's very hard to say for sure who
exactly is behind this kind of cyber assault

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.330
it does follow the pattern of previous attacks
that have been linked back to the Chinese

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.530
military

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.710
just like Ben's pattern of eating other people's
lunches in the office fridge

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.689
Ben we know it was you

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.130
so why would the Chinese authorities be targeting
a dance group?

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.840
poor risk assessment?

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.979
actually no.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.659
the Communist Party has from the very beginning
known the power of the arts

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.689
They have this pesky ability to make people
think, inspire even

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.950
that's why the party waged specific campaigns
like the cultural revolution to eradicate

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.539
traditional Chinese culture

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:33.640
burning books smashing relics banning the
teaching of traditional arts

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.590
You know generally destroying people's faith
in a traditional culture

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.409
that had lasted thousands of years

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.999
and produced one of the greatest civilizations
the world has ever seen

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.490
No big loss, only countless treasures

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.899
and thousands of years of knowledge that may
never be recovered

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.579
Now Shen Yun's mission is to revive that authentic
traditional Chinese culture

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.859
so that probably gets them on the Chinese
Communist Party's blacklist

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.600
And according to the same press release some
of the dances depict

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.079
the Communist Party's persecution of Falun
Gong practitioners inside China

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.190
and many of the performers themselves are
Falun Gong practitioners

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.920
I've talked before about how former Chinese
leader Jiang Zemin launched a campaign

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.360
to imprison and torture people who practice
Falun Gong

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.360
so if they talk about Falun Gong I wonder
if that's the reason the show was banned in

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.050
china

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.170
One thing the cyberattack tells me is that
despite Chinese leader Xi Jinping

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.750
purging members of the Jiang Zemin faction
that began the persecution of Falun Gong

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.300
it's still going pretty strong

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.730
But the hacking of Shen Yun is actually a
part of a serious problem that affects everyone

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.380
According to China cyber intelligence expert
James Mulvenon,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.870
In July 1999 the exact month when the communist
party began targeting Falun Gong on a large

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.870
scale

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.660
Two Canadian Falun Gong websites were attacked
by chinese hackers

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.070
An American one was hit shortly after

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.910
The address of the hackers was traced back
to the location of the Ministry of Public

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:03.960
Security

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.820
Mulvenon says this was likely the first public
case of direct chinese state sponsored hacking

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.210
Years later a defector from the 610 office,
the gestapo-like agency charged with eradicating

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.210
Falun Gong

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:21.290
confirmed this in an interview with China
researcher Ethan Gutmann

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.230
These chinese hackers that a congressional
advisory board called

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.100
the single greatest risk to the security of
American technologies

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.020
that have hit the New York Times US government
and defense systems

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.820
stolen the intellectual property of corporations
around the world

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.140
may have gotten their start by attacking overseas
Falun Gong websites

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.510
they just grow up so fast...

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.510
next thing you know

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.460
they'll be able to hack my second life character

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.190
Nooooo.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.680
Turns out though that many Falun Gong practitioners
are actually pretty skilled with computers

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.980
themselves

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.400
they created software called freegate that
people throughout China

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.940
used to break through the internet firewall

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.650
it's also been adopted by internet users in
other repressive regimes

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.900
around the world like Egypt Burma and to particularly
good effect

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.430
during the massive protests in Iran in 2009

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.239
Of course there are plenty of times when the
Chinese Internet overlords are not as skilled

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.530
In January last year instead of blocking the
website where you can download freegate

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:30.780
Chinese censors accidentally rerouted the
entire Chinese Internet there

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.069
Clearly the Chinese government doesn't want
us to see Shen Yun

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.759
I think i'll buy my tickets now

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:38.759
Thanks for watching this episode of China
uncensored

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.150
once again I'm Chris Chappell

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.990
see you next time
