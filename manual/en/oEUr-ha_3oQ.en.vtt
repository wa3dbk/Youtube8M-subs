Easy Pizza Recipe - How to Make a Pizza

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.800
Make family dinner fun
and interactive.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.150
Hi, I'm Cricket Azima.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.790
If you're going to plan a family night,
pizza is always popular and

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.400
enjoyed by all.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm going to show you an Extra Easy
Cheese Pizza recipe you can make with

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.950
your family, and then customize
with your favorite toppings.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.840
Now the key to great pizza is always the
crust. Making a light, flaky crust

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.150
is actually easier than
you might think.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.460
Preheat the oven to 450.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.140
Then in a large bowl, start
with the Bisquick.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.170
You simply add some really hot
water and stir it 20 times.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.750
Be careful not to overwork the dough.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.800
Now press your dough into a greased,
12 inch pizza pan.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.380
Or you can use individual pans, and each
kid can customize with their own

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.960
favorite toppings.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.330
Next, you're going to simply spread the
tomato sauce all over the crust.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.070
I'm using a jarred tomato sauce
because it was quick and easy.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.060
For a simple cheese pizza, I'm using
pre-shredded mozzarella.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.770
But if you want, you can get creative
and use whatever other types of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.140
cheeses your family enjoys.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.730
Now, we have a classic cheese pizza
that's ready for the oven.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.380
Bake your pizza for 12 to 15 minutes, or
until the crust is golden brown and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.903
the cheese is nice and bubbly.

00:01:20.903 --> 00:01:21.850
And that's it.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.910
An easy pizza your whole family
is guaranteed to love.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.950
Not only because it tastes great,
but because they helped make it.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.060
Now we're going to get a
little more creative.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.280
Here's a quick, delicious stuffed-crust

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.660
pizza that tastes amazing.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.490
Again, we're going to preheat
the oven to 450.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.570
We're going to use the same dough.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.890
But we're going to double the
recipe and add some oil.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.130
This time, when we press the dough into
the pan, we're going to leave an

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.050
extra inch over the edge so that we can
fold it over and stuff the crust.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.820
Now, we're going to lay the pepperoni
along the inside, just along the edge.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.970
After we've laid the pepperoni, we're
going to cover it with some string

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.150
cheese that I've sliced in half, so it's
easy to tuck inside our crust.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.139
After the pepperoni and cheese has been
laid, we're going to fold the

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.530
dough over and press down on the dough,
so we make sure the cheese and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.730
pepperoni is nicely tucked in.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.190
Bake the pizza for about seven minutes,
so that the crust parbaked.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.060
Now the pizza's ready to be dressed
with sauce, cheese, and toppings.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.800
After you've put the sauce on, again,
you're going to add some cheese.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.910
And then, it's time for the toppings.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.610
I'm going to use a bunch of
different vegetables.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.070
I'm also going to add some pepperoni.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.460
As soon as your pizza is fully dressed,
it goes back in the oven for

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.700
another nine to 12 minutes, until the
crust, again, is a nice golden brown

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.970
and the cheese is melted and bubbly.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.820
Ta-da!

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.990
A stuffed-crust pizza that's sure to
keep the family around the table and

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.280
asking for more.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.270
So there you have it.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.330
An easy pizza with a tender, flaky
crust and a stuffed pizza.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.670
These recipes are a great way to get
your family involved with making

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.290
dinner and get them one step closer
to all showing up at the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.650
dinner table together.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.820
