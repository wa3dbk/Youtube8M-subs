00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.980
We share this love

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.080
that has begun to fade

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.000
and loneliness

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.060
is what remains

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.240
The warmth is gone

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.080
been blend away

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.100
but the more I give

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.500
the more it seems to take

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.000
I reach out my hand

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.000
and cry for you to stay

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.680
but you slip away

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.460
I’ll let the rain come pouring down

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.580
until the memory of you has drowned

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.480
with my eyes closed

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.060
I’ll shed the pain, wash it away

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.120
in the rain

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.400
in the rain

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080
I hear your voice

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.080
through time and space

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.080
and all this noise

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.980
is cleansed away

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.160
When the clouds clear

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.140
I’ll be alone

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.360
rising from the flood

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.500
standing strong

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.080
You reach out your hand

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.780
and cry for me to stay

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.460
but I slip away

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.540
I’ll let the rain come pouring down

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.640
until the memory of you has drowned

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.420
with my eyes closed

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.920
I’ll shed the pain, wash it away

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.240
in the rain

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.360
in the rain

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.660
As love begins, to face its final sunset

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.360
I’ll escape, all regret

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.720
as I shed the pain, as it fades

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.620
in the rain

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.580
I’ll let the rain come pouring down

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.560
until the memory of you, has drowned

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.440
with my eyes closed

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.800
I’ll shed the pain, wash it away

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.060
in the rain

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.280
in the rain

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.580
I hope you want to support me through Patreon, or my own support site

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.580
Or buy something in my web shop, like my CD, or DVD

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.720
It would help me a lot to keep making music videos.
