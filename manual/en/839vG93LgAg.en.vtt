00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay, we’re over here in Mendez’ Boxing
Gym. Brand new ring, Everlast Ring. We’re

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.480
going to do step four, defense. Iran ‘Blade’
Barkley, five time World Champion, Juan ‘Magic’

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:37.790
Newbalt, future World Champion. Alright Blade,
what do we do next, defense. I want to you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.610
to get into a fight stance, now see, his style
 – if I was the type of fighter to fight

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.470
with him and he’s a tall lanky man, as I’m
boxing with him, he’s got the jab and everything,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:01:00.360
but now I can see right now, there’s a lot
of things that’s open on him that he don’t

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:07.150
even no that it’s open. You know, so if
we’re jabbing, I’m jabbing with him, it’s

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.549
going to be things like, I can show that he’s
going to miss, he’s jabbing, I’m jabbing,

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.380
he’s catching, if I took away the jab and
just went like this and stepped over here,

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.560
I take that little step over here, catch him
here, I catch him here. These are the things

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:32.249
that he’s got to be aware of. So in order
to do that, he’ll tighten his defense. Yeah

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:41.289
you’ll tighten, like I said you’re a tall,
lanky – like middler. As I’m doing those

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:47.630
things, you’re going to jab, but watch the
focus – what your hands now. You see how

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.210
he is, your defense is tight, which is good,
but you’ve got to still protect that – right.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.469
Protect that. So as you’re jabbing, you’re
catching, you’re catching, you’re catching.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.549
You know you got guys that are going to throw
things like that, you’ve got to be able

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.440
to be ready to catch that, catch it, catch
it, catch it. Throw it off, you’ve got things

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.810
that you’ve got to be ready for. So if I
come over here – boom, there you go. If

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.400
I’m over there, if I come in there again
 – now you can hook off of that, you know

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.890
what I’m saying.
