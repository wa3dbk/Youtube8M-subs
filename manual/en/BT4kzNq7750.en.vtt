00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.320
Once you've determined the type and the amount
of fertilizer that your lawn needs, we need

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.760
to get those nutrients down to the soil so
they can work their magic.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.870
The most common method of spreading fertilizer
is a broadcast spreader.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.820
To make sure that you're getting the proper
amount of fertilizer down most effectively

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.019
and efficiently, you first need to calibrate
your spreader.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.689
Here's what you'll need: a broadcast spreader,
your fertilizer, a bucket to weigh your fertilizer

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.580
in, a push broom, a measuring wheel or tape
measure, a scale, preferably accurate to the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.280
ounce, landscape flags or marking paint to
mark off your test area, and of course, a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
calculator.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.840
You'll need to determine how much fertilizer
you need to cover a 1,000 square foot area.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.690
Typically, you will find the instructions
on the manufacturer's bag.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.030
You can also check out our fertilizer calculation
video for detailed calculation instructions.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.539
It's also important to calibrate your spreader
with the actual fertilizer that you will be

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.280
using since variations in the size of the
material can effect your results.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.980
Step one in the process is to measure the
effective swath width of your spreader.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.000
Since the spreader is wheel-driven, variations
in walking speed will effect the spread of

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.320
your application.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.010
A person with a faster walking pace will have
a much wider swath then with someone with

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.040
a slower pace.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.240
The important part of this is to be consistent.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.960
You'll need a hard surface like a driveway
or a parking lot to set up your test area.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.270
Testing on a solid surface allows you to see
where the material falls and makes it easier

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.390
to clean up.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.200
It's important to sweep up the material after
you are done to prevent possible run-off into

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.390
the local water supply or staining of the
surface.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.820
Add enough fertilizer to the spreader hopper
to allow you to make a short run down the

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.220
test area.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.960
Set the spreader to the middle setting and
start spreading at your normal walking speed.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.500
You'll only need to walk a short distance
for this part of the calibration, just enough

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.720
where you can clearly see a consistent swath
on the ground.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.560
Now measure the effective width of that swath,
that's the area between the two points where

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.369
the fertilizer begins to thin out in the pattern
and make a note of that result.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.540
When you eventually spread the material the
thin areas on each side should overlap as

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.270
you make each pass.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.319
This will help prevent the striping that can
occur if this is done incorrectly.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.950
Divide 1,000 by the width of your swath, this
will give you the length of the run needed

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.329
for the next part of the test.

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:30.909
We have a 10 foot swath so for our test we'll
need a 100 foot run to equal 1,000 square

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.909
feet.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.409
To simplify our test, we'll cut that distance
in half to 50 feet and multiply our final

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.189
result by 2.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.370
Measure off your test area and mark your start
and finish lines.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.159
Now you're ready to determine how much material
the spreader puts down over a given distance.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.310
Start by weighing out a few pounds of fertilizer
using your bucket and scale, enough to fill

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.859
half the hopper should be sufficient.

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.430
Make a note of the weight and be sure to subtract
the weight of the bucket.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.640
With your spreader still on the middle setting,
begin your test run on the area that you marked

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.060
off earlier.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.579
Be sure to give yourself enough space to get
up to speed before you reach the starting

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:08.579
line.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.870
Once you hit that line open up the hopper
and continue at a consistent pace until you

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.599
reach the finish line.

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.810
Be sure to close the hopper as you pass over
that finish line.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.069
To determine how much material was distributed,
you'll need to weigh the remaining fertilizer

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.870
in the hopper and subtract that total from
the original amount.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.069
Compare this number to the manufacturer's
suggested output.

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.819
If your number was higher or lower than that
you'll need to adjust your spreader's output

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.090
and retest until you reach that desired application
rate.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.239
For example, if you spread 4 pounds of material
over a 1,000 square feet and the manufacturer

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.659
suggest 5 then you need to increase your spreader
setting on your fertilizer spreader to get

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.109
more material out over that area.

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:55.010
Now that your spreader is calibrated, you
can be confident that your turf grass is being

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.760
fertilized both effectively and efficiently.
