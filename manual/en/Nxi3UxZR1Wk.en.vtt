Hi, Wayne from Headsets Direct.  Quick video 
on why you need the Plantronics

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.939
66268-03 cable,

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.660
also known as the A10 cable.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.689
So first off,

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.000
here's the cable,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.170
and why you need this cable, when you buy
a headset, you need a bottom piece

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.339
to physically plug into your phone, so you
either need an amplifier

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:31.999
or a direct-connect cable, and that is what the 
A10 is, it's the most common direct

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.260
connect cable.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.310
And you'll still need to contact us or check
a compatibility guide to see if an

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.760
A10 cable can be used in lieu of an
amplifier. So not all phones

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.440
will support an A10 cable, and where
you run into issues, it's the volume.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.210
If a phone is made with the intent to
use headsets, and they've built some

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.010
amplification into the phone,

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.070
the A10 cable works great.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.480
If the phone manufacturer was not
planning ahead on headset use, and you try to use

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.110
the A10 cable,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.220
it will work, but your speaker volume or
microphone volume will be too low to

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.400
adequately be used for business
conversations.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.890
So the way this works,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.909
this is the modular plug that plugs into your
telephone; most phones will have a

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:15.240
headset port where this plugs into.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.540
Then you have your coiled up cord, will give you
about 8 - 10 feet of reach, so

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.700
it really gives a good distance to get away
from your desk and phone,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.600
and then you have the quick disconnect,

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.550
and the quick disconnect is what plugs
into any H-series headset.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.120
And what's nice about this quick
disconnect, when you go to the commercial

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.850
grade headsets,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.080
this quick disconnect allows you to walk
away and pull apart at this connection

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.520
and put your caller on hold, so if you
need to go grab something

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.820
for reference material, talk to a coworker,
you simply pull apart and walk away.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.910
When you walk back you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.530
plug the two back together, and you've
got your caller back; you don't need to put

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.600
them on hold through your phone.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.510
So again, this is the Plantronics

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.390
66268-03

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.540
A10 cable.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.000
It's a direct-connect cable for
compatible phones and used with any of the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.780
Plantronics H-series headsets.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.390
