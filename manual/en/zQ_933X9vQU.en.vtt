00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:05.790
So, what do you really need to know in order
to capture an image or record a video from

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.599
your screen?

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:12.780
This is Snagit, it’s powerful, versatile
and easy to use.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.859
In fact, there are only three buttons you
need to know in order to get started.

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.900
If you want to capture an image, click this
one [image]

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.759
If you want to record a video—including
audio from your microphone if you have one—click

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.460
this one [video]
For now, let’s capture an image.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.390
When you’re ready click this red capture
button.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.750
See how Snagit went away and you’ve got
these crosshair lines here?

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.879
Use them to select the thing you want to capture.

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.239
Just click or drag and click to select a portion
of your screen.

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.239
…

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.239
And when you let go?

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:47.239
Pow!

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.170
Your capture appears in the Snagit Editor.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:06.870
Now, you 
can annotate the 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:19.780
entire area, instead of having to paste together
several captures to get the whole picture.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:30.400
With all-in-one selected, you can 
also select a custom area if you need more

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.340
than just the window or toolbar.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.600
For example, maybe you want a smaller window,
with some desktop captured as well, to offer

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.600
context.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.290
Click and drag to select your capture area.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.030
Note that the dimensions of the selected area
are clearly displayed as you move your mouse.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.740
Release the mouse button when you’re ready
to capture.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.300
The Snagit editor opens, and displays your
capture.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.460
Now you’re ready to edit.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:06.290
Due to its flexibility, you may find that
the all-in-one capture is the only capture

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.399
mode you need.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.360
