In today's tutorial I'm going to show you
how to install Magic Thumb in Dreamweaver.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.700
Not only does Magic Thumb enlarge small images
to full screen. You can also have captions,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:19.500
navigational arrows to browse images without
returning to the page and also links too.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.260
To get started I'm going to download the demo
file on the product page and save it to my

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.260
computer then extract all the files. The magicthumb
folder is the folder I need. I'm working locally

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.780
on my computer so I'll copy this and save
it here. You'll need to upload the magicthumb

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.780
folder to your server. Within the folder there
are CSS and JavaScript files which I'll be

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.430
referencing soon in my Head HTML code. Go
back to the Magic Thumb product page and click

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.059
the Integration link on the left hand side.
Scroll down to the Installation section. If

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.800
you have no code in your html file then copy
all the code provided. I already have some

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.790
so I'm just going to copy the Script and Link
Rel Attribute of the Head section and paste

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.130
it into the Head section of my file. I'm using
Dreamweaver MX for this example. I'll just

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.810
tidy up my code a bit. You can see the CSS
and JavaScript files are referenced in the

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.660
Head code. If you move the files out of the
magicthumb folder for any reason, remember

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.640
to update the location references here in
the Head section otherwise Magic Thumb won't

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.640
work. Now we can go back to the Integration
page and this time I'll copy the Body code

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.630
and paste it into the Body section of my HTML
file. The href reference is my large image

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.860
which will be the enlarged expanded effect.
There's the Magic Thumb class and the Image

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:09.110
Source is the small image that will appear
on my web page. I've saved my images in an

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.110
images folder so I'm just going to reference
that too. Now if I preview my page you can

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.190
see Magic Thumb is working. You'll notice
the navigation arrows haven't appeared on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.140
the enlarged effect. This is because I'm only
using one image. As soon as you add a second

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.140
image the arrows will automatically appear.
Now that Magic Thumb is installed, I'm going

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.500
to make a couple of changes. First, I'm going
to change the expand effect from a smooth

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.670
Linear effect to a Bounce effect. Then I'll
add a background color to the enlarged effect.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:57.430
To do this we need to go back to the Integration
page. You'll notice we have anchor links at

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.430
the top, this is to make it easier to navigate
around the page. Click the Number 6 Effect

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.340
option. There are other options you can choose
from as well as Bounce and Linear which I'm

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.340
highlighting here. In the example code, copy
the rel attribute expand effect and paste

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.380
it after the Magic Thumb class. Where Bounce
is shown you can enter any of the other options

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.180
I've just highlighted in the last step. Next
I'm going to use the code in the Background

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.290
section. By default the background color is
grey, so if you want to keep this copy the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.580
rel attribute background opacity which will
allow the grey to be seen. I want to change

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.510
the color so I'll use the code below. I don't
want to change the speed so I won't copy this

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.459
code. But if you do you'll need to copy this
code too. I already have the rel text in my

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:03.459
code, so I'm just copying from background
opacity and enter a semi-colon after bounce

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.400
then paste my new background code. The opacity
is set to eighty, I'm going to change this

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.400
to sixty, and I want the color to be red.
Now if I preview, you can see my expand effect

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.380
is no longer linear, it's bounce, and my background
color is now red. If you're not sure how you

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.270
want to display your images, go to our Magic
Thumb Examples page. It's full of great ideas:

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.270
from multiple images of a product to repositioning
your caption and inserting images in it too.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.790
All the HTML code for our examples and more
can be found on the integration page. At the

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.650
top of each page on our website there's a
Contact Us link. If you have any questions

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.120
about Magic Thumb or any of our other tools,
just get in touch. If we're not online when

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.699
you send your message through, we'll get back
to you the very next day. And that brings

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.530
us to the end of this tutorial. Thanks for
