00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.740
Welcome back to fondant toppers for wedding
cakes. In the first video we looked at how

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.190
to make a fondant bride; in this video we're
going to look at how to make a bride again

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.320
but with a different haircut. I did promise
as well that we might make a groom. I'll show

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.369
you now what a groom looks like. If there
are enough responses in this video then I

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.230
will make a groom tutorial so get typing underneath
The Bristol Bakehouse and let us know if you

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.270
really want to see one. You will see in front
of me that I have three different brides,

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.100
one with long blonde hair, one with brunette
hair and one a sort of chestnut colour and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.219
she has a little tiara on top. I've done a
variety of different dresses on these ones

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.870
as you can see from the close-up and the one
that we're going to be making today is the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.399
one in the centre. So, to create the head
what I've done is I've dusted a little icing

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:04.460
sugar on top of the greaseproof paper that
we've got and we're going to take our bride

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.000
and the first thing we need to do is to secure
the head we need to have a cocktail stick

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.050
so place the cocktail stick next to your bride
and it should leave just a tiny amount above

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.470
the neck that you can secure the head on.
If it's too big just snap a piece off. So,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.300
we're going to push our neck forward just
a little bit there and then just push the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.069
cocktail stick through and it should go right
to the bottom and then we're going to do the

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:38.830
head and I've got some fondant here and if
you put it next to the body of the bride you'll

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.190
see that it is roughly the right size. What
we're going to do is we're going to pop some

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.550
eyes and a nose into the bride. So, two eyes
and a little nose and we're also going to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.380
take a tool to make a little smile. This is
called a scallop tool. Take your paintbrush,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:07.619
dab a little water into it and then we're
going to take a tiny piece of flesh-coloured

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.040
fondant for the nose and pop the nose in there
and then we're going to take some white for

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.780
the eyes and roll each piece to the same size.
Pop it in the eye socket. And then I like

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.480
the bride to be looking towards her groom
so I'm going to take my bone tool and I am

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.602
going to mark on your right hand side, my
left, and just put a little bit of water in

00:02:37.602 --> 00:02:43.110
(a bit too much there) and now we'll take
an even tinier amount of black fondant to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:54.740
put inside the white of the eyes. Just pop
that on and do it again for the other side.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:04.050
Ready to give some eyelashes. For that you'll
need some black food colouring paste. Dip

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:13.570
a cocktail stick in. Take as much off as possible
and then just test it on your hand if you

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:27.040
need to (or on a piece of kitchen towel) and
then mark three little eyelashes. You are

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.209
going to apply some blusher. Now you'll need
your paintbrush and you will need some pink

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:41.340
food powder. What I recommend is you tip a
tiny amount into the lid of the food colouring.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.671
Take a small amount of water and then (again
you can practise on your hand if you want

00:03:50.671 --> 00:04:06.020
a little bit) just two tiny blobs of pink
on the sides of her cheeks. Just gently pressing

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:14.540
down the head so that it fits nicely. We're
going to paint the bride's head with water

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.319
so that we can do the hair. We'll put our
bride to one side for the moment. I'm going

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:25.630
to take some dark brown fondant and then just
roll out over a little bit of icing sugar.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.560
Don't worry if you get icing sugar on top
because we can take that off later with a

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.950
paintbrush. I'm going to roll out an oval
shape...and so we're just going to be cutting

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:46.880
and moving round the hair. You should end
up with icing that looks like a sort of star

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.930
shape, only not quite the same. Bring your
bride back and then we're just going to fix

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.520
the hair on top like so. I'll turn the bride
round so you can see from the back how we're

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:09.440
doing this and just press down. As you press
down you can begin to curl up some of the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.220
edges if you wish. If, as I have done, you've
used icing sugar to help the fondant come

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.550
away easily from the greaseproof paper, then
you'll need to take a paintbrush now and go

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.320
over the whole of the hair so that it doesn't
look like she's got a really bad dandruff

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:33.530
problem. So, I'll show you from the back.
We're just going to go over all the hair like

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:44.020
so and do underneath her hair here. Using
a flower cutter, press in, take away the excess,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:57.699
push out the flower, paint the middle like
so, take a tiny ball of red fondant and paint

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:06.810
the part of the bride where the flower is
going to appear so paint her hands and just

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.820
do some finishing touches.
