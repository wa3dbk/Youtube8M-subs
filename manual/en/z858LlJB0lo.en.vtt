00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.300
My name is David Spivey. I’m with Spivey
Farms in Plant City, Florida.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.230
I’m a third generation strawberry grower
here.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.240
My father still works at the farm and he owns
it. He has been farming strawberries about

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.110
25 years.
My grandfather started in Wauchula, grew strawberries

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.591
in the 30s and so strawberries have been in
my blood my whole life and I don’t plan

00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:40.221
on quitting any time soon.Forty-five acres
of strawberries is what we grow here and we

00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:45.190
do it all ourselves.
We grow it. We pack it. We ship it. We sell

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.760
it.
We just try to get it all done here. We’re

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.330
a family farm and most farms around here are
family farms.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.040
I would say at least 75, 80 percent of the
industry has grown up for generations around

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.100
Plant City.
This is the strawberry capital of the world,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.079
the winter strawberry capital.
This industry has been good to Plant City

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.500
and I don’t expect it to change for many
more decades to come. What you see here

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.350
is a typical strawberry field.
All our strawberries are under a plastic mulch

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.150
and when we lay the plastic down, we fumigate
as well so we spray underneath the plastic.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.970
What we’re trying to do is sterilize the
soil because we just want the plants growing.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.750
We don’t want any weeds or any sort of bugs
to get in the plants, to hurt our yield and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.490
our harvest.
So under that plastic is completely sterile

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.799
and we have to do that generally about a month
before we plant the strawberries.Canada

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.451
is the predominant area of where we get plants
from our nurseries and we just go down and

00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:46.030
we plant one plant in each hole and then under
the plastic as well, you see this is drip

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.330
tape.
This is how we give the berries nutrients

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.510
and fertilization.
Some people use two. We happen to use one

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.960
here so that just goes all the way to the
end of the row and everyday, we give the berries

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.740
a little bit of water underneath as well as
some fertilization. It depends on the variety

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.150
but we want to keep them growing and keep
them healthy all season.The only other time

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.659
we use overhead irrigation is on a freeze
night when we have a frost or a freeze event,

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:16.650
when the temperature is below 32 degrees;
and the purpose of that is, you know, just

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.200
like your freezer at home, everything will
freeze if you don’t provide water.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.189
The water provides a sheet of ice over the
plant and the berry. It keeps everything under

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.440
that ice at 32 degrees so, while, it makes
a nice, pretty picture when the whole field

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.219
is all white. It looks like ice. It’s actually
doing a very good job of protecting.We use

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.930
the same plant all season.
So when we plant strawberries in October,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.079
that plant will continue to produce hand after
hand of strawberries until the end of the

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.419
season and when we get them in early in the
season, they’re real tiny so they grow as

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:55.059
we add fertilization and nutrients to the
plant; but if you look closer, you can see

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:59.920
that this plant here is in all different stages.
We have the initial fruit here that’s coming

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.590
on and this is what we’ll be picking very
shortly.We never truly stop picking strawberries.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.169
They are just in different stages so this
fruit will be ready in the next 10 days or

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:14.400
so then you see blooms here on the plant and
that’s the next hand of strawberries that’s

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.079
starting to come out.
The blooms are generally about one month away

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.969
once you start seeing the white flowers and
then if you look even closer inside the plant,

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.980
you can already see a new crown coming out
of the ground.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.650
So while these blooms are going to be a month
away, in a couple of months, there’s already

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.000
more strawberries coming so it’s just a
continuous cycle. The cooler it is, the slower

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.599
it is for the berries to mature but as it
warms up, they will start to produce more

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.029
and more strawberries quite rapidly and then
we’ll get to the point at the end of the

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:48.290
season where we can’t even keep up. There
are so many strawberries. There’s more red

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.799
than green and you just – at some point,
you can’t keep up as the weather gets warmer.

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.580
You also see we’ve got the new mascot
for the Florida Strawberry Growers Association

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.449
and that’s Jammer. He’s a great new marketing
tool. We’re going to promote him everywhere

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:09.361
that we can and sort of get him associated
with the Florida strawberry and it’s going

00:04:09.361 --> 00:04:10.797
to help our marketing. It’s going to help
our awareness and we feel really good and

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:19.260
confident about where we’re going with Jammer.
He’s a cute little guy.I guess in summation

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.290
I’m proud of what I do. You know, it has
been in my family forever. I’m happy. I

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.990
wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.
We’re proud to be members of the Florida

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.070
Strawberry Growers Association. They do a
lot of great work from scholarships, research,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.380
marketing, anything and everything to promote
the Florida strawberry and that’s what it’s

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.700
all about. You know, we’re trying to put
out a high quality product and I think we

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.990
do a very good job of that something that
when it gets to the house, it’s delicious.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.150
It will hold up well for many days and it’s
something that we want you to take home, enjoy

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.670
and we’ll give you something to be proud
of because we’re proud of what we’re picking

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:53.820
and what we’re producing.
