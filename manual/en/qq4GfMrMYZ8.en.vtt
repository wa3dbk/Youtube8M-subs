00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.740
Okay so now we're ready to go ahead and stuff
this pillow. We're almost done and stuffing

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.389
the pillow is one of the last steps. So remember
we left the opening. We had the little anchor

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.980
stitch that's going to help us close it. What
we need to do now is get this pillow and just

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.939
squeeze it altogether stuff it through this
opening in there. And all pillows are pretty

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.349
much this way. You leave a little opening
and then you've got to squish the pillow.

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:31.820
And kind of work the pillow around the form
itself. So if it's a little bit difficult

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.180
don't worry the pillow form will not be hurt.
Or the pillow. And that's usually why I tell

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.120
everybody to do back stitches, the reason
like this is that you don't want that to rip

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.010
and if you did back stitches then it's not
going to. Feel free just to flip it over and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.540
keep flipping it over and just working it
in. And this is true for any pillow form.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.710
You just keep working it in. Putting it in.
Then put your hand inside and put it along

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.820
the shape of the thing, of what you made.
And what I'm going to do I'm just going to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.240
kind of shake it, like that. Make everything
just go out to the edges. There we go. Let

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.229
me put my hand in there, form this up a little
bit more, there we go. Okay so now that I

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.820
have that let me go ahead and tuck the extra
thread in there, I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.140
pin this closed. And then I'll show you how
we're going to close that on the next clip.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.700
But for now remember I made my anchor stitch
and it just wants to fold over. And it's doing

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.009
really good. I want to pin that closed right
here. I might have to adjust that pin but

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.179
for now that's a good beginning to the pin.
And that anchor stitch is working really well.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.939
Because I can tell where the curve is and
it kind of pulls it in together. There we

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:10.160
go. And here's another pin. Now let's go ahead
and work on this side. Okay. And see this

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.940
is about where the anchor stitch is. It's
just folded underneath. Okay. One right there.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:31.190
There we go. I'm just laying it right on top
inside. Okay. See that's the initial pin that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.190
I had put in and I have to just relocate it
right here. Okay and I think that'll be a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.620
good curve. And what I'm going to do in the
next clip I'm going to show you how to use

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.450
your piping foot to sew on top of this and
close it. And we'll do that next.
