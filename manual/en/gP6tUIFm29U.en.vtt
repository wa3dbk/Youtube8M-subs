00:00:01.245 --> 00:00:02.565
Welcome to an example of

00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.360
a Pediatric Medication Calculation,

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.240
they'll be determined using proportions.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.467
Proportion is made when we set two ratios

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:13.134
or rates equal to each
other as we see here,

00:00:14.215 --> 00:00:16.121
where as long as the units of a and c

00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:19.201
are the same and the units
of b and d are the same,

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:22.943
then a times d must equal b times c.

00:00:22.943 --> 00:00:24.886
These are called cross products.

00:00:24.886 --> 00:00:26.774
So if we have one unknown,

00:00:26.774 --> 00:00:30.574
we can solve for the unknown
using the cross products.

00:00:30.574 --> 00:00:33.020
Here we're given a 20
pound, six ounce child

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.764
is to receive medication
ordered at 20 micrograms

00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:38.741
per kilogram of body weight.

00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:41.984
How many micrograms
should the child receive?

00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:43.577
To set up the proportion we'll begin with

00:00:43.577 --> 00:00:47.744
a known rate of 20 micrograms
per kilogram, so we can write

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.987
this as 20 micrograms per one kilogram

00:00:55.606 --> 00:00:59.263
must equal to the second rate would deal

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:01.163
with the given weight of the child.

00:01:01.163 --> 00:01:03.630
Since kilograms is weight,
the 20 pounds, six ounces

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.463
must go on the bottom.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.604
the numerator would be
the number of micrograms

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:16.015
which is unknown, so
we'll say x micrograms.

00:01:16.015 --> 00:01:19.325
Notice in this form we
cannot cross multiply

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:22.620
because our denominator
contains different units.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.839
Here we have kilograms and
here we have both pounds

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:26.756
and ounces.

00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:29.908
So first convert these
two to a common unit

00:01:29.908 --> 00:01:32.322
will convert the six ounces to pounds,

00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:34.260
and then we'll have to convert the pounds

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.773
to kilograms.

00:01:35.773 --> 00:01:37.341
So again for the first
step we're going to convert

00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.805
six ounces to pounds, and
we'll use the conversion

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:42.055
16 ounces equals one pound.

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:46.190
So these two will give us our first ratio

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.896
for the proportion.

00:01:47.896 --> 00:01:50.896
We'll have 16 ounces is to one pound

00:01:52.363 --> 00:01:55.946
as six ounces would be
to an unknown number

00:01:56.883 --> 00:02:00.435
of pounds, which we'll call y pounds.

00:02:00.435 --> 00:02:02.176
Notice we do have the same units

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:04.676
on the top, and on the bottom,

00:02:06.095 --> 00:02:09.012
so we can go ahead and cross
multiply and solve for y.

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:11.998
When cross multiplying, we
will leave off the units.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:15.831
So we'll have 16 times
y equals one times six.

00:02:17.398 --> 00:02:19.475
16 times y is 16y.

00:02:19.475 --> 00:02:22.655
Equals one times six of course is six.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:24.655
Divide both sides by 16.

00:02:26.198 --> 00:02:30.489
So we have y equals 6/16
or 3/8, that simplifies.

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.199
And we do want to convert
this to a decimal,

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.056
and then we'll round
to two decimal places.

00:02:35.056 --> 00:02:37.525
So we convert this to a decimal,

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:40.596
we'll divide three by eight.

00:02:40.596 --> 00:02:43.263
Three divided by eight is 0.375.

00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:48.533
Do a round to the hundredth
or two decimal places,

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:51.861
notice how this five
here's our decision maker.

00:02:51.861 --> 00:02:53.462
Five or more, we round up,

00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:55.318
four or less we round down.

00:02:55.318 --> 00:02:57.010
Because we have a five here.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.843
Round up by changing this to 0.38.

00:03:03.314 --> 00:03:07.860
Which means six ounces is
approximately 0.38 pounds,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.443
so now we can rewrite
this as 20.38 pounds.

00:03:15.022 --> 00:03:18.188
Notice how we still have
different units on the bottom.

00:03:18.188 --> 00:03:21.068
Here we have kilograms,
and here we have pounds.

00:03:21.068 --> 00:03:24.597
So now we'll convert
20.38 pounds to kilograms

00:03:24.597 --> 00:03:26.737
using another proportion.

00:03:26.737 --> 00:03:28.991
The conversion we'll use is 2.2 pounds

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.470
is approximately one kilogram.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.349
So this will give us our first ratio,

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.766
2.2 pounds is to one kilogram

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.276
as 20.38 pounds is to an
unknown number of kilograms,

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:48.072
we'll call it z kilograms.

00:03:50.012 --> 00:03:52.366
We have the same units on top,

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:55.038
and on the bottom, so
we can cross multiply

00:03:55.038 --> 00:03:57.334
and solve for the unknown,

00:03:57.334 --> 00:04:01.501
so we have 2.2 times z
must equal one times 20.38.

00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:05.512
So we have 2.2z equals 20.38,

00:04:08.313 --> 00:04:10.396
divide both sides by 2.2.

00:04:13.782 --> 00:04:16.626
So z will be equal to this quotient here,

00:04:16.626 --> 00:04:19.332
which we'll have to round.

00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:23.499
So 20.38 divided by 2.2 is
going to be approximately

00:04:25.587 --> 00:04:29.695
9.26 if you round this
to two decimal places.

00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:31.796
Again here we have a three to the right,

00:04:31.796 --> 00:04:34.129
keeping this a six, so 9.26.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.358
So finally we have the
proportion that we need

00:04:39.358 --> 00:04:41.133
to solve this problem.

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:45.133
We can replace 20.38
pounds with 9.26 kilograms.

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.676
So 20 micrograms is to one kilogram

00:04:54.011 --> 00:04:57.344
as x micrograms is to 9.26 kilograms.

00:05:04.656 --> 00:05:08.240
So because we have the same units on top

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.191
and on the bottom, we
can now cross multiply

00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:12.524
and solve for x.

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:17.818
One times x must equal 20 times 9.26.

00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:22.334
Well one times x is just x,

00:05:22.334 --> 00:05:24.834
and 20 times 9.26 will give us

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:30.909
the number of micrograms
needed for this child.

00:05:38.457 --> 00:05:39.874
185.2 micrograms.

00:06:04.983 --> 00:06:07.566
I hope you found this helpful.
