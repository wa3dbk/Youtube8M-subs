00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.899
BearingNet is a website designed
specifically to help bearing and power

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.099
transmission distributors trade with
each other faster and more effectively

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.899
The site is exclusively available to
bearing distributors.

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:16.630
If you are an end user or
bearing consumer and you need to

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.589
contact your local bearing distributor
who can access BearingNet.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:25.949
By the end of this tutorial you will know
about the basic search function of

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439
BearingNet.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.089
You will be able to locate obsolete,
special,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.790
and hard to find bearings.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.690
Over seven million lines of inventory means

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.950
you can always find the part you need.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.840
So lets show you how it works

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.040
Firstly, log on to BearingNet
with your user name and password.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.690
Lets assume that your customer has
requested a bearing that neither you

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.790
nor your manufacturing partners currently
have.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.300
This is where BearingNet comes in very
useful,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.230
type in the part number you are looking for

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.130
into the search box.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.490
I am looking for a 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.189
UCT316

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.430
and click OK.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.730
You are then presented with the search
results screen.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.650
This screen displays basic information
about the parts you are searching for

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.270
and the companies that have the item
available.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.759
The first thing you need to do is find out
the price.

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.880
Sending inquiries is extremely quick and
easy,

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.920
simply tick the boxes next to the parts
you want to inquire about

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.820
and then in the inquiry box

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.390
fill in the quantity delivery terms and
any additional notes you want to include.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.680
You can also look at the basic
information about the stockists to learn

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.409
more

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.380
before you buy from them.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.690
Just click on the company's name to view
their companies details page.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.750
All trade

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.770
done via BearingNet is conducted
directly between the bearing distributors.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.710
BearingNet does not charge any
commission on any of the sales you make

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.220
through BearingNet.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.679
So let's try a couple more examples

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.249
I also need a

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:15.780
HM515745,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.849
change the search criteria

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.090
and click OK

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.879
to get your new set of search results.

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:27.839
You will also see on the search results page
that they are split by region.

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:32.629
Results in the top half of the table
will be members in your region

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.449
and results in the bottom half of the
table are members that are not in your

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.279
region.

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.110
Remember to send an inquiry

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.779
just tick the boxes next to the parts
you want to inquire about

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.279
and fill in the inquiry box.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:52.259
As well as the bearings I have searched for
I also need a sprocket

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.299
scroll to the top of the page

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.299
fill in the search box I am looking for
a 06B110N.

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:04.829
I'll need to change the PT type to
sprocket

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.839
to make sure I am only shown sprockets in
the results.

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:14.040
As you can see Kavial Oy in Estonia have the
part I need

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.689
so I am going to send them an inquiry.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.129
I need 12 sprockets and need them
delivered to me in the next week.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.769
Once you have filled in the inquiries box
click OK.

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.279
As you can now see searching on BearingNet couldn't be easier

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:34.590
and with over 1.6 billion
bearings available

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.180
you are bound to find the part you need.
