00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:15.166
Welcome to Maryland’s Digital eLibrary Consortium, your library’s virtual branch where you can 
 download thousands of eBook titles for free with your Maryland library card.

00:00:15.166 --> 00:00:21.164
Books check out for up to 21 days for the Kindle, and 
 there is a limit of 4 checkouts per customer. 

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:27.538
Here is some basic information about checking out 
 eBooks from the library for your Kindle.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:44.883
Now, we will learn how to find books 
 for Kindle from Maryland’s Digital eLibrary Consortium.

00:00:51.458 --> 00:00:56.810
The first thing you should do when you 
 arrive at the Consortium website is login.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:04.001
This will allow you to see the Advantage titles available in your region 
 as well as the titles that are available from the statewide collection.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.322
Click “Login” on the banner at the top of the screen.  On the login screen, shown here, 
 you will next be prompted to choose your library, in this case Allegany County Library System.

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:23.697
Next, type in your 14 digit library card number with no spaces between the 
 numbers.  Finally, type in your PIN if prompted, and click “Sign In.”

00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:32.816
One of the easiest ways to find Kindle books is to scroll down to 
 Browse Collections in the menu on the left side of the page.

00:01:32.816 --> 00:01:41.290
From here, you can click on View all eBooks. Most of the eBooks available 
 from Maryland’s Digital eLibrary Consortium will be available as a Kindle book.

00:01:42.106 --> 00:01:49.490
A better way to search for Kindle eBooks is Advanced Search.  Click 
 Advanced Search from the banner at the top of the screen.

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:56.240
The Advanced Search page, shown here, enables users to narrow 
 search results to Kindle Book as a format.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:02:08.020
You can also narrow the results by subject.  This will allow you to look for books in 
 a particular genre, like Westerns or Mysteries, or you can pick broader categories, like fiction or nonfiction.

00:02:08.025 --> 00:02:18.200
Also, the checkbox for Only show titles with copies available can be selected so that the results 
 list will include only the Kindle books that are able to be checked out immediately. 

00:02:18.198 --> 00:02:27.330
Leave this box unchecked if you wish to see all results, regardless of availability.  In 
 this way, you would be able to place a hold for items currently checked out.

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.200
When you’ve made your choices, click the Search button.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:39.510
Regardless of which search method you choose, once you select a title you would like 
 to check out, it is easy to download the book to your Kindle.

00:02:39.513 --> 00:02:50.160
In this example, the book Okay for Now by Gary D. Schmidt has been selected for checkout.  
 To begin the checkout process, click the Add to Cart button for the Kindle Book format.

00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:54.050
The eBook has been added to your cart.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:05.590
On this screen, you can choose to click on Continue Browsing if you want to go back to the results list 
 and look for other books or Proceed to Checkout to continue.  We will click on Proceed to Checkout.

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:10.680
You can choose to check the eBook out 
 for 7, 14, or 21 days. 

00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:12.930
Then, click Confirm Checkout.

00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:18.730
Now you have successfully checked out the eBook, and it 
 is time to download it to your Kindle.

00:03:18.734 --> 00:03:20.930
Click Get for Kindle.

00:03:22.422 --> 00:03:28.700
This will open the Amazon.com website in a separate 
 window or tab on your Internet browser. 

00:03:28.698 --> 00:03:31.160
Click Get Library Book.

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:38.500
If you are not already logged in to your Amazon.com 
 account, you will be prompted to do so.

00:03:39.422 --> 00:03:47.240
If you have multiple devices registered to your Amazon account, you can change the 
 Deliver to option to send it to the device of your choice.

00:03:47.236 --> 00:03:55.610
This might be a Kindle ereader or a Kindle app on a device such as an 
 iPod or iPad.  You can also use your browser and Kindle Cloud Reader. 

00:03:55.427 --> 00:03:58.320
Click on the Continue button to download the book.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.610
A confirmation message will show on screen.

00:04:02.607 --> 00:04:11.880
If you are not located in an area with Wi-Fi, you can click on Download 
 now to download the eBook to your computer and transfer it using USB instead.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.230
Library Kindle books cannot be delivered via a 3G network.

00:04:16.538 --> 00:04:19.040
You are now ready to enjoy the book.

00:04:39.526 --> 00:04:51.580
This concludes the tutorial.  Please visit the Maryland Digital eLibrary Consortium regularly, as new titles are always 
 being added.  Also, for any additional assistance or questions, please contact your local library.
