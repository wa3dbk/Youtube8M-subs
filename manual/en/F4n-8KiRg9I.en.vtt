00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.770
remove the two screws

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.890
on the side of the cartridge

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.140
compatible cartridges made in China may be slightly different

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.640
press in on the tab and carefully pry it up

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:34.220
remove the end plate with the reset gear and the spring

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.720
remove the fill plug

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.860
original brother cartridges have the
plug in this position

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.090
on the other side, using a little screwdriver 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.880
pry up the plastic bushing of the developer roller

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.170
remove this black piece a plastic

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.130
slide the developer roller

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.220
clean out all the remaining toner from the cartridge

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.200
it's better to use compressed air

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.280
if possible use a toner workstation

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.140
getting all the toner out is very important 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.540
the toner left in the cartridge is mostly waste toner

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.360
if you have two different types of toner in the cartridge at the same time

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.620
the quality will be compromised

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.030
don't forget to clean the foam roller
inside the cartridge

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.920
you can also clean the cartridge at open air

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.920
do not breathe the toner dust

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.340
gently clean the developer roller with
isopropyl alcohol

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.180
the developer roller

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.010
carries the toners from the supply
chamber to the drum 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.980
clean and inspect the felt seals

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.480
if they are compressed rough them up
with a small screwdriver

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.610
make attention not to damage this mylar sealing blade

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.760
if this blade is bebt in any way, the cartridge will leak

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.660
using a cotton swab, clean the doctor blade 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.880
so there's no evidence of build-up along the edge

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.520
 if any build-up exists, the cartridge will streak

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.200
the doctor blade controls the amount of toner on the developer roller 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.560
make attention: these metal blades are easily bent or warped

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.900
reinstall the developer roller

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.020
reinstall the piece of plastic

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.039
install the bushing

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.520
fill the cartridge with 90 grams of black
toner and 70 grams of color toner

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.750
low-yield cartridges take 60 grams for
the black and 45 grams for the colors

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.280
do not put more toner

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:42.249
replace the fill plug and check for
leaks

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:51.059
this cartridge has no chip but has a reset gear

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.540
that must be positioned correctly

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.800
place the spring as shown

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.590
this is the reset gear

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.890
install the reset gear

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.670
place the tail the spring as shown in
the video

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.170
turn the reset gear as shown to verify if it is in correct position

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.580
started cartridges do not come with this gear

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:57.419
the reset gear must be in this position

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.820
it's possible to reset the cartridge even from the printer rmenu

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.000
you'll find the instructions
in the description of this video

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.640
reinstall the side plate with the two
screws

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.830
and the work is done

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.880
for any problem with the cartridge, here
you'll find a troubleshooting guide
