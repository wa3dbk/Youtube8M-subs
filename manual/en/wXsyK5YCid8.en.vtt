00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.200
Hey guys welcomed to Btekt, Basil here with

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.380
a second ice cube video outburst ice
cube video he posted a couple days back

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.480
made you guys comment like crazy

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.850
a lot to your comments for really really
encouraging he said you loved what we

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.449
doing

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.550
thought it was a really innovative way
to test out heat from smartphones but

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.180
many have you gave us some constructive
criticism and of course we took it all

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.879
on board

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.000
so for a second I skied video we r
individually

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.339
wrapping all our phones incoming film so
that they get the barris result possible

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:45.620
for we've also done is we have decided
to go with a 4k video recording

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.830
teen therefore funds on the market now
major plans that can record

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:54.220
4k video that LGG 3 the same thing
Galaxy Note 3 the something Galaxy S

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.180
five and assigning experience said

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.070
to the first three finds all have by
minute time is up to a maximum of five

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.500
minutes that they can record

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.039
for hey video the same experience had to
keep going until it gets to pop

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.820
so I was the first thing we found that
dictated one of the tests with inside we

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.810
had to the five minutes with ice keep

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.340
on the top of the finite on the screen
and then once we reset the 4k video

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.000
recording we

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.340
let the fines round and we put the ice
cube on the camera module the same ice

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.960
cube each

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.060
fun obviously we repeated this process
and tell

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.409
all the ice cubes had melted now our
initial

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.719
finding was that the signing experience
said to like we said can record

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.189
longer videos in the competition but it
also records big a file sizes which

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.200
means there is less compression going on

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.700
this is get it if you like less
compression it's bad because we actually

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.799
managed to fill up

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.469
the internal memory the phone quickly
and that meant that

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.450
for the very last round we just had to
leave all the screens on the home screen

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.899
to keep this is fair

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.640
as possible so which was a hot as 4k
video recorder at the bunch

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.020
well it's more like which was the
hottest 4k video recorders are the buns

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.729
because the Samsung Galaxy S five

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.049
and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 both tied
in

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.920
last place now both these have different
senses but its adjusted

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.080
plenty of them in the background
processes going on generate heat

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.030
and on top of that they both have amo
lead screen so that's an interesting one

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.470
thing that

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.530
which screen is gonna generate more heat
well this suggests that the camera lens

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.019
well

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.580
as far as second place goes this
surprise to us we expected the sign it's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.769
presented to maybe come in last after
all the rigmarole that's happened around

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:29.530
the 4k

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.540
video on that screen the tell you it's
overheating and everything

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.700
but it didn't came in second place by
quiet some

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.379
margin but the win at the very clear
winner is the L

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.900
GG three that was a big chunk a ice on
it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.310
by the time the same experience that it
had melted its I skied

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.530
what's more after the 10 minutes when up
for the screen to turn off automatically

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.560
it still had some ice on it so we left
that Mel we got on with our evening

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.060
and that we spend it all up the one
video hopefully you have

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.870
enjoyed and hopefully find it useful
that you know that LGG 3

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.060
is the coolest cat as far as 4k video
recording guys
