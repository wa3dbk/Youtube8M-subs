00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.850
(music)

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:19.190
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to whoever, happy birthday to you.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.150
Keep going.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.120
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.680
Stop!

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.700
I knew it!

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.440
(laughter)

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.250
Mine is easy, I just have to answer a question.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.210
What's my favorite place to go?

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.230
My favorite place to go, I would say, is the beach, but at night.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.260

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.270

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.030
(music)

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.670
I'm Chris Alfonso from Ablevision and I'm here with Caitlin.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.340
Hi, how are you?

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.370
Good, so what did you do today?

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.720
Today we picked up trash outside of the English School in Jamaica Plain

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.720
so we swept the fields for trash and raked stuff up

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.750
and worked together and it was really good.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.250
(music)

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.550
We picked up trash in the recreation, like in the dugout

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.220
and then we went near the pitcher's practice

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.760
and I grabbed some bottles that I was able to reach

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.630
because the fence was bent back.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.840
We grabbed bottles, we grabbed shards of glass,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.180
then we went over to, like the tennis fields and we picked some glass over there

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.490
and Jeff and Lloyd and Shaq all went up in the stands and grabbed some trash there.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.940
Why is it important to keep this park nice and clean?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.810
Because lots of different people use it

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.840
and it's always nice to come to a clean, safe place to play.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.860
(music)

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.810
Do you like being part of EPIC?

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.360
Of course, definitely I love to be part of EPIC!

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.390
I love being part of EPIC, EPIC is very epic!

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.410
Meaning it's amazing, it's a really good opportunity to get out in the community

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.450
and make a change and make a positive change.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.250
Yeah, I really do because I get to be around other people that have disabilities

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.380
because I don't get to be around other people

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.400
in my town that have disabilities because they don't go out as often.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.040
Basically what we did was we kind of we went around this,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.740
kind of baseball field to look for litter and leaves

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.950
to kind of pick up and throw out.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.770
What kind of trash did you pick up today?

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.900
Everything from like bottles and cans.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.920
Leaves. We raked up the leaves that were around the field.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.470
Paper towels, napkins, all that stuff.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.000
Why is it important to keep the park clean?

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.430
Because if we don't the trees might get sick,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.990
and it won't be safe and won't grow green, there won't be any grass.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.340
Do you like being part of EPIC, Pat?

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.540
Yeah, I like it, I mean, I always believed that, as Ghandi put it,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.250
I should be part of the change I wish to see in the world

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.830
and that the change is, that the cleaner environment,

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.040
I'm doing something for my community,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.500
it's like an honor, it's a privilege, it's... 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.080
I'm very welcomed to be into this group, yeah.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.380
Is it important to keep this park nice and clean?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.690
Yes it is, yes it is very important because it could be

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.480
good for playing and it could be good, yeah.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.500

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.540

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.950

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.970
All: EPIC!
