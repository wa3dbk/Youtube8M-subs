00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.960
Hello every one

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.600
Today from morning I have a time and I'd like show you how work my CB RADIO President Harry III

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.840
So, I will show you how works in five cars

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:19.320
First car will be Ford Focus MK2 made in 2011 with petrol engine 1.6

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.220
In this car I use really often my CB

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.140
And I have no noise, everything is OK

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.480
I don't hear air conditon, every time I use it. After a few secounds I will turn up the volume.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.340
So, I have no problem with electronic elements

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.040
Electronic windows...

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060
or other accessories

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.020
We are on free channel no. 23

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.060
We are next to old town ( city center )

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.420
in Wroclaw ( Poland )

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.440
Kosciuszki street

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.080
It's really close town center

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.100
We should have a lot of noise

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.220
Antenna is on roof of my car

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.000
Siro Omega 27

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.660
OK, I'm unlocking my radio

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:07.680
RF-GAIN is full

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.960
Let you see, all filters are off

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.680
Air Condition are not generating noise

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.780
It's really calm

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.820
filters are turn on

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.660
but in this time we don't need filters

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:09.200
Now we are in Opel Astra III made in 2011, 1.6 with petrol engine

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.180
This car is the same calm like Ford Focus

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.560
maybe is not demanding car, because here we have only air conditon and electric windows

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.120
but with petrol engine, radio is realy calm

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.920
Let you see, all filters are off

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.500
all time we are in the same city, next to old town

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.320
Radio is calm

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.220
window up and down

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.800
Antenna all time is the same ( Sirio Omega 27 )

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.380
silence and calm

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:21.000
So, now we are in Audi A6 made in 2010 with 2.0 TDI

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.680
All filters are off

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.140
When I'm adding engine speed, nothing's changed

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.620
When I'm adding engine speed, nothing's changed

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920
adjustment of air

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.540
Of course, air condition all time is working

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.760
You can feel blast, camera is next to air supply

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.940
but we have no noise from electric windows

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.160
All time I'd like remind you that we are in town center

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200
Radio is calm

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.880
We are going to other car...

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:32.860
at the moment we are in Honda Accord made in 2010 with 2.0 petrol engine

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.340
electric windows do not affect the operation of radio

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.040
When I'm adding engine speed, nothing's changed

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.260
All time we are next to old town in Wroclaw

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.240
In the same place

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.620
I have never detected this, because I use all time ASC

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.120
So, what I perceived

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.940
Someone wrote on forum, that this car likes make noise

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.560
I have never detected this

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.360
I will increase turnover of air condition

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:30.960
We can hear little whistle in radio

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.680
of course if we use ASC, we don't hear this

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.200
ASC hide it

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:50.440
but we can see this problem when we don't use filters

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.460
I have never detected this, because I use all time ASC

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.260
so, thats all about Honda Accord

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:20.200
OK, we are in Ford Mondeo made in 2011, wiht petrol engine 2.0

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.920
In this car I didn't see any noise

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.000
from electronic installation of car

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.520
Of course we can feel sough from ether

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.400
It's normal, we are in old town

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.780
Air condition is calm

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.160
I have to use air condition because is really hot

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.420
but radio is really calm

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:03.600
 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.740
engine speed doesn't affect for work of radio

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.940
electric windows

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.720
In radio all time we have silence. Of course all filters are turned off

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.680
gas

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.620
and silence

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.900
and again air condition

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:50.680
Thats All !                            I'm sorry for my english ;)
