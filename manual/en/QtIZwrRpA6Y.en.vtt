00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.470
Today, on this 2010 Honda CRV, we're going
to install part number 13555 Curb.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.450
This is what the hitch looks like once installed
in the vehicle.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.160
Next, we'll use some measurements to help
you on selecting some accessories such as

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.740
the ball mount, a bicycle rack or a cargo
carrier.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.260
On top of this opening down to the ground,
we've got 15 1/4 inches.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.060
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
edge of the bumper will be about 2 3/4 inches.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.150
Now, we'll go ahead and show you how the hitch
is installed.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.740
First thing we need to do is go ahead and
lower exhaust.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.380
There are two rubber hangers above the exhaust.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.100
Then, we'll spray on some lubricant and we'll
go ahead and pry them off.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.070
That will lower the exhaust, that way giving
us more working room.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.440
All right, next, we'll go ahead and locate
the fasteners in the frame where the hitch

00:00:41.440 --> 00:01:01.879
will 
be 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:49.109
attached to.
