00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.450
[actual lyrics - Zed's may vary]
[He mostly learned them from Drew singing it as a lullaby.]

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.000
Woke up this morning on the beach,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Started walking, it's my regular routine.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.000
I was on the search for some diamonds,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let me tell you just what I've seen.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I saw...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
a castle with a view,
fields of bamboo,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.500
guy from Kung Fu,
a giant screw,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.500
a kangaroo,
some chicken stew,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
and the woman who lived in a shoe.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
I saw...
a white whale,
the holy grail,
Pirate ships without a sail,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
air mail,
volcano fail,
pyramids not to scale,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500
and some things I should not go into detail.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.500
You never know what you will find
shaping a world that's in your mind.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
See for yourself and walk with me

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.500
A world of wonder, a land of beauty.
Across the mountains and over the sea

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.500
but I still haven't found any diamonds.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I've been walking around for miles,
still no diamonds to be found.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Maybe I should look underground.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I started digging a hole,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
drilling through dirt, then I fell through,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
landed in some water.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
What have I gotten myself into?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.500
I saw...
Lava lake near the core,
Kratos from God of War

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.000
mushroom spore,
liquor store,
statue of dumbledore.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Wooden shed with a bed,
spiders and the undead,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
arrowhead,
loaf of bread,
giant spool of golden thread.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.500
I saw a sparkle in the dark.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.000
I put my axe right through that mark.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
At last found me some diamonds.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Oh I'm so happy I could ride a pig!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[grunting pig noises]
0:01:56.000,0:02.03.000
[Applause!!]
