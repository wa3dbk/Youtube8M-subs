00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.490
Hi I'm Todd from Extang and today I'm here
to show you our latest cover, the Extang E-Max

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.490
Tonneau.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.940
This cover gives you the ultimate in versatility
that you see from a normal tri-folding truck

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.940
bed cover.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.400
But adds the ability to fold up to the cab
for maximum accessibility and the ultimate

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.590
in utility.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.700
The E-Max is Extang's most advanced soft folding
cover, but before we talk about the features,

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.650
let's talk about how it looks.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.600
The EMax sits low and looks great.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.039
It only uses the industry's best vinyl and
it has precise stitching and close attention

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.039
to detail.

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.830
The EMax is based on Extang's Trifecta Tonneau.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.350
It contains all the same superior components
that make the Trifecta the number one selling

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:40.710
tri-fold top.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.280
Just like the Trifecta, the EMax incorporates
Extang's patented speed clamps, which not

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.040
only keep your cover secure to your truck,
but are very easy to use.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.390
The EMax also incorporates our Max hinges.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.930
A double-pivot design that are made of ultra-strong,
glass-filled nylon and feature protected padding

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.989
to protect the finish of your truck.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.309
We've also used our monster I-beam style bows
which are extruded aircraft grade aluminum

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.900
and have unparalleled strength and durability.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.630
The 45 degree steel reinforced brackets make
the EMax Extang tough.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.460
The EMax also incorporates our OE quality
weather tough seals.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.909
They will not damage your truck's paint and
will keep your cargo safe and dry.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.510
Now, let's show you what makes the EMax so
cool.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.570
Say you need to make a run to your local big
box store to make a large purchase.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:59.610
The EMax will fold all the way up to the cab,
rewarding you with total accessibility 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:36.650
to the trucks bed.
