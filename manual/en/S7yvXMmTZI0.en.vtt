00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:08.880
Hi, my name is Eric Sampson and I want to
talk a little bit about how to do a split

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:09.880
squat.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.780
Split squats are a very high level exercise
used in the exercise population, as well as

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.690
the rehab population and physical therapy
clinic.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.360
It's considered a closed chain exercise, just
like your traditional squats meaning your

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.189
feet are on the ground and your ankle, hip,
knee all have to work together to complete

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.189
the task.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.170
It's a much more challenging exercise, because
it involves a lot of coordination of the three

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.379
joints, as well as your trunk and your core
to complete it.

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.350
There's a couple of things you really have
to worry about with a split squat.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.850
This is what I want to demonstrate now.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.489
So come on in to a split squat position.

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.531
Like a traditional squat, you're going to
worry about one important feature and that

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:52.289
is the knee position, as you're lowering yourself
down.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.730
The knee should not translate forward over
your toes all right, but rather stay behind

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.730
the toes.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.870
This will ensure that you're using your muscles
of your leg optimally and you're not putting

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.210
undo pressure or stress on the knee joint
itself.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.909
The other factor that you want to worry about
in a split squat is your position of your

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:08.909
trunk and shoulders.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
You want to try and stay as tall as you can
while you're completing the exercise.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.470
If you let your trunk lay too far forward,
you're going to lose one extra factor with

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.230
this stretch, and that is the ability to stretch
out your hip flexor on the leg behind you,

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.380
which is a great feature of this exercise.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.909
This is something that I recommend for the
exercise population, to do two to three sets

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.240
of ten on alternating days, but also for the
running population.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.110
It's a great way to get on with this exercise
just before running.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.700
You can accomplish a lot by doing just 10
repetitions on each side.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.149
Again, you're going to be stretching your
hip flexor, as well as strengthening and warming

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.509
up your leg muscles.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.460
So a split squat easily can be progressed
by doing it with hand weights or doing more

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.590
repetitions or holding it longer in this position.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.100
So a great high level exercise, a great closed
chain exercise.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.320
Something that you want to consider doing
though, once the pain and some of the range

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.950
of motion problems have been taken care of
already, and that's the split squat.
