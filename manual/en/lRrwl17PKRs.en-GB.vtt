00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.330
While some were clearing away the trees felled
by the worst gales to hit the UK in years,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.250
others were hoping their pheasants were going
to go with the added turbo-boost and fly like

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.639
the wind giving the guns some serious sport.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:21.710
We're back at Plumpton College's student run-shoot
day. It's been 4 years since our last visit

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.760
and we want to see how the gamekeeping course
is doing and, most importantly, whether the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.310
students are finding work. That will give
us a good idea of whether the shooting industry

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.910
has wind in its sail or if it is bobbing about
in the doldrums.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.950
Very slow start your going to a funeral yes
please. On you go Callum Wait for it. Alfie,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.910
Alfie. Too far in front. Keep tapping along
the hedge very slowly we'll hang about though

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:57.860
Come on join in well we've got to reverse
anyway. Nice and steady guys. Go on Patric.After

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.340
the first drive we catch up with course leader
Neil Bianchi as he catches up with his breath.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.789
Every pheasant you see on this shoot is one
we have reared ourselves which is quite an

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.539
accomplishment and eight years ago we had
200 pheasants and now we put 2000 down so

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.920
it's all the students work not mine. Those
that turn up today because of the half term

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.780
day, they'll be the ones that get one of the
two beaters days that we have. Then we have

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.460
two beaters days at the end of January which
all the students, you know, shoot as soon

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.499
as they got their assignments in, they got
the license and they got insurance and they

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:33.950
turn up for these days

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.520
The guns have yet to whet their appetite,
but with these conditions it's difficult to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.790
guarantee any peg will get birds coming as
you would expect.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.420
After the second drive and some truly lovely
screamers, we ask one of the guns why he comes

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.969
here and why it's sold out quicker than a
One Direction concert.

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:53.939
You get the email and you've got to frantically
see what days you can take off work because

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.050
obviously they are all Mondays and then you
need to snap up the days you can get. It's

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.109
a really nice informal atmosphere which is
great I'm not a big fan of the stuffy starchier

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:07.360
stuff I prefer the more informal, bit of banter
that sort of thing and it's a cracking price

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.350
for the day you are actually getting as well.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.280
Would you know it was a student's day?

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.180
Umm yes and no. You know because the banter
between the teacher and the students is pretty

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.020
entertaining other than that No it's just
like to turning up to day where there is a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.040
million beaters which obviously helps a lot.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.560
It's not just the current intake of students
working the day here. This doubles up as a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.629
taster day as well. Some of the these beaters
are just 14 years old and looking at gamekeeping

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.060
as a possible career.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.599
One student who graduated two years ago is
back today seeing the shoot from the other

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.599
side.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.010
I always said to James and Neil as a bit of
a wind up when I finish my course I'm going

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.870
to come back and give them some abuse, stand
on the other side of the stick and yes the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.010
season came up and James said There's a full
gun here if you want it. So I took it and

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.510
its going well at the moment. It's just different
seeing it from the other point of view. My

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.120
dad was a game keeper so it was since I can
walk I've been around pheasants and it was

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.239
always what I wanted to do. So yeah it's going
alright at the moment. Can't complain

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.989
Alex has done well - and is loving his work.
Shame about his cartridge bag! Maybe he can

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.609
go for a more solid colour. Neil shows us
a mink they caught recently. Pest management

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:20.969
is also part of the course.

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:28.499
We shot about three of these in a week . Yeah
we had a ginger one. Yeah lots of odd coloured

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.629
mink now

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.840
It has been a challenging morning with some
tricky conditions.While the chainsaws have

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.420
been working around the south of England,
let's hope a few teenagers have been inspired

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.230
to go for gamekeeping as their future career.
