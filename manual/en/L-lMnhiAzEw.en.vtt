ISABELLE OLSSON:
[? Ovah ?] came up to me

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.600
and he said, just make it
comfortable and beautiful.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.770
It freaked me out a
little bit, because what

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.650
they showed me was this.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.860
I thought, I have a big
challenge in front of me.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.920
For me, the most
important thing was,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.370
how can we really reduce
this to its very essence?

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.360
And everything that's
not necessary goes away.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.080
This is really high
tech, but my biggest goal

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.830
was to make it look simple.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.260
When you have a very
big problem to solve,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.180
you need to find
a couple of ideas,

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.450
and then really make them shine.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.580
We had the optics that
was this, and then we

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.950
had a big board like this.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.430
And I couldn't stand the idea
of some weird transition.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.390
I came up with
the idea of hiding

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.910
the board behind the frame.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.250
So from this view, it looks
like, here's the frame,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.920
and here's this thing, and
it's separated and it's clean.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.580
But the board actually goes
all the way to up to this edge.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.360
This was such a simple idea, but
it kind of defined the product.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.290
The second thing was be
really, really light.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.940
One of the goals was this needs
to weigh less than 65 grams.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.690
And I was like,
that's impossible.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.690
These were 150 grams-- and I'm
obsessed with weight by now.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.350
I'll always have a
little scale on my desk.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.815
And as soon as we have a new
prototype, I put it there.

00:01:28.815 --> 00:01:30.650
And it's like
Christmas every time,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.490
because the weight
keeps on reducing.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.160
The latest prototype
weighs 43 grams.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.130
The Nexus phone is actually
heavier than three of these.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.040
The most important part
of designing is prototype.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.540
This one was before
my time, but-- yeah.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.570
I mean, I don't know.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.660
After I had done the
design, I came up

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.420
to one of the software
engineers and showed it to him,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.030
and he was like, no way.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.680
Now I need to program,
because I want

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.330
to make an experience
as beautiful as this.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.440
It's not only the device.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.680
People charge the device.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.150
How is that experience?

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:11.820
You want to take it with you.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.650
Well, you need a case for that.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.610
How does all those
things come together?

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.620
We focus on trying to solve
problems and always simplify.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.090
And then, in the end,
you can get somewhere.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.370
But I think the most
important thing is just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.040
not to feel overwhelmed.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.794
Because if you really are
trying to do something new,

00:02:28.794 --> 00:02:30.710
it's going to be really,
really, really, hard.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.570
One of the most
important things when

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.180
designing completely new
products that people have never

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.300
seen before is, is
this really needed?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.310
Is this button really needed?

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.320
If you make it work with the
bare minimum, you're golden.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.560
That's what you have to do.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.459
