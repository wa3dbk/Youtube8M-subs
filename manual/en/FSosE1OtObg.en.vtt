Hello my name is Greg Koenig, owner of Fitness
for Life and today we are going to discuss

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.299
weight training for soccer. There are a variety
of different moves that you can do to strengthen

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.460
the muscles engaged in soccer. If you notice
most soccer players have very strong athletic

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.529
legs and that is due to the fact that they
are in a lot of diverse plays, lateral running,

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.349
forwards, backwards, so the legs are really
fully developed because of all the range of

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.400
motion that they have on the field. When you
are training you want to simulate something

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.110
a little more progressive than what they would
actually do so it is almost a sense of progressive

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.410
training to where you are working them a little
stronger than they would to make them faster

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.870
on the field. Speed is of major importance
in soccer. A few movements that we like to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.840
do are explosive dumbbell squats. Soccer is
a fast paced sport so you want to mainly focus

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.670
on fast paced activities promoting more fast
twitched fiber. If you train slow you will

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:22.741
be slow so we want to do very dynamic ballistic
fast acting movements. Today we are going

00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:32.159
to demonstrate a band resistance in what I
call four way runs. Hunter is going to demonstrate

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.830
the four way runs and we are confined as far
as space goes so it is going to be a little

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.299
bit abbreviated. We are going to start with
the lateral runs and then we will go forwards

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:50.930
and then backwards and we are going to start
now for a 10 count and begin. You can see

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.140
all the resistance coming to the left. He
is really fighting and relax it and now I'm

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.590
going to shift behind you and go forward,
begin. The resistance providing is giving

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.750
him a sense of overload, progressive overload
all muscles and relax it. We go lateral again

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.820
and then we'll go backwards. To the right,
everybody has a dominant side so you really

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.770
want to focus a little more on the weaker
side. Really big on the hip flexors, quadricep,

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.260
inner and outer thigh, calves and gluts. And
relax it. Now we'll face me and we'll do the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.740
backwards, drive those legs, knees high, here
we go. Fast pace, lean back, continue back

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:44.780
up and relax it. This is Greg Koenig with
Fitness for Life and this concludes weight

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.040
training for soccer players.
