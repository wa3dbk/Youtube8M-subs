00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.950
One of the great benefits of the Maestro C.L
dimmer

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.219
is that if you want to use it in a 3-way application—
where you can control the same light from

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.140
two different locations—
you can use your existing switch, rather than

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.960
installing a Maestro companion dimmer.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.789
Doing so will give you the ability to dim
your lights from one location

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.449
and switch your lights from the other.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.760
The first thing you'll need to do is install
your Maestro C.L dimmer.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.640
For step-by-step dimmer installation instructions,
please see the "How to Install a Maestro

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.449
Multi-Location Dimmer" video on the Lutron
website.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.970
Please note: Make sure to tag which color
wire you connect from the wallbox to the dimmer's

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.799
blue screw terminal.
You'll need to know this when you rewire

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.729
your existing switch.

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.540
After you have installed the Maestro C.L dimmer,
you can rewire your 3-way switch.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.939
First, turn off the power at the circuit breaker
- or fuse box - and test the switch

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.490
you'll be rewiring to make sure the power
is off.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.360
Then remove the switch mounting screws and
wallplate.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.940
Next, carefully pull the switch away from
the wall.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.360
You'll see three insulated wires that are
each connected to three screws,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.510
plus a bare copper wire, or green ground wire,
connected to a green ground screw.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.540
One of the insulated wires is connected to
a screw of a different color

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.540
(not the green screw), or is labeled "Common."
Use a piece of electrical tape to tag this

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.500
wire (like you did when you installed your
Maestro C.L dimmer).

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.790
Next, make sure that the bare copper wire,
or green ground wire,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.860
from the wallbox is connected to the green
ground screw on the switch.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.200
Then disconnect the other 3 wires, leaving
the bare copper,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.100
or green ground wire, attached to the green
ground screw.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.920
Now, determine which wire is the same color
as the wire you connected to the dimmer's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.330
blue screw terminal.
Then connect it to one of the two brass-colored

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.330
screw terminals.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:20.590
Using a wire connector, combine the included
jumper wire, the tagged wire, and the remaining

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.760
wire.
Make sure the wire connector is secure.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.069
Then connect the other end of the jumper wire
to the screw of a different color.

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.469
Carefully put the wires and switch back in
the wallbox,

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.829
reattach the wallplate,
and turn the power back on.

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.639
The last thing you need to do is program your
dimmer

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.980
so that it will work with your switch.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.510
To do that, hold the tap switch and the raise
button

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.439
on the dimmer until the 4th LED begins to
blink.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:53.299
Press the lower button once; the 1st LED will
blink.

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.680
Press the tap switch once to save this setting.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.319
Now your 3-way switch is ready to use!
