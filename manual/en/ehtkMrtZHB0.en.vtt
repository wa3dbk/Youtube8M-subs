00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.700
A DAY TOUR IN HANOI’S OLD QUARTER – PART 1

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.360
S-VIETNAM – FLAVORS OF LIFE

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.460
Hanoi is a city of over 1,000 years old
with long-standing and unique architectural features.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.640
The Old Quarter with 36 different streets
holds a lot of interesting things

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.300
that we cannot find in any other city of Vietnam.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.580
The streets are interlacing.
I have no idea where I should go.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.840
Today, I visit Hanoi,

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.600
and I have only one day
to discover the Old Quarter of the city.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.480
Before starting my day tour,
I’d better eat something.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.520
Hello. May I have a bowl of “pho”, please?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.840
My long, yet interesting day tour starts with this.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.340
It tastes really good.
Thank you!

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.320
What means of transport should we take
when visiting Hanoi’s Old Quarter?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.220
If you take a cyclo,
you can enjoy the beauty of the streets at a slow pace.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.420
However, it costs about VND200,000 per tour.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.420
You want to go on foot?
The long streets will tire you out.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.920
How about taxi?

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.040
You can’t feel things to the fullest
and it isn’t cheap at all to travel by taxi.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.140
Therefore, I decided to take an electric car

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.160
because it costs only VND150,000 and it’s eco-friendly.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.440
In Hanoi’s Old Quarter,
there’s a very small and narrow alley.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.140
People said that I cannot go inside that alley
because I’m too big.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.620
The small, narrow alleys
make Hanoi’s Old Quarter special.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.620
They date back to about half a century ago.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.480
Hundreds of alleys can be found in the Old Quarter,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.580
and some are even less than 60cm wide.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.020
That means overweight people will find it difficult
to walk inside these alleys.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.420
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.500
- May I go inside?
- Sure.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.360
- Can we move through?
- Let’s see!

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.760
- OK. Let’s see!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760
Oh, we can do it.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.540
- Get out of my way!
- OK.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.260
It’s too narrow.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.160
If I’m as small as Vietnamese people,
I may go inside this alley easily.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.480
Let’s see whether a fat man like me can do it.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.880
Oh, it’s very narrow,
just as people often say.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.420
Those who are a little bigger than me
cannot go inside this alley.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.300
Now, my journey will continue.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.880
Now, I’ll visit a very special place
in the Old Quarter of Hanoi.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.800
It’s an ancient house.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.200
The ancient house at 87 Ma May Street

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.860
is characterized by the typical
Vietnamese architectural style of the late 19th century.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.680
It is considered a symbol of Hanoi’s Old Quarter.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.540
With only VND10,000,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.440
you can feel free to enjoy the living space of Hanoians
hundreds of years ago.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.260
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.480
This house is so beautiful!

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.660
Hanoians were very wealthy in the past,
weren’t they?

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.480
The owner of this house was very wealthy.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.020
At that time, people didn’t have power.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.140
Hence, in the morning,
this place could serve as a classroom.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.020
Students could lie here and study,
and teacher could stand over there and give lectures.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.640
Uh-huh.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.780
You see?

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.540
Yes.

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.880
In the moonlight,
people could sit here and sing “quan ho” songs.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.840
And play chess?

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.360
Certainly.

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.620
This gift is so special for my journey today.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.620
This character means “talent”,
and the old man wishes me to better promote my talent.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.780
With a reasonable amount of money,
I’ve had a wonderful day tour in the Old Quarter of Hanoi.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.640
In the next part, let’s join me
in discovering Hanoi when the city lights up!

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.760
To be continued...
