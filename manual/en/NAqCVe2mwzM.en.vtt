00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.680
Hi guys.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.090
This is Max Happer again for How Cast.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.670
And today I'm going to show you guys how to
do a barbell shrug.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.770
Now, what shrugs are really used for is to
work your track muscles.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:15.770
Help strengthen your neck.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.770
Right?

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.779
So this is what we're going to be doing.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:18.820
Arms extended.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.890
All we're doing is lifting our shoulders up
and back.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.110
We're not trying to pull them forward.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.831
We're trying to pull them up and back.

00:00:24.831 --> 00:00:26.890
Because that's what your tracks do.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:27.980
Up and back.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.180
Elevate your scapulars.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.180
Alright?

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.190
So this is what we're looking for.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.190
Let me show you guys from the back.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.180
This is what it's going to look like.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.309
Following down.

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.540
Up, hold a couple of seconds.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.930
Back down.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.040
Up, hold a couple seconds.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.040
Okay?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.740
Now, guys, it's another one of those exercises
that I really believe to be moderate in terms

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.149
of the way there's no real need to use three
hundred pounds, four hundred pounds to get

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.149
your tracks to work.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.300
I mean, just do more repetition.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.570
You'll be a lot safer.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.060
And you'll do less damage to your neck in
the long run.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.920
So let me show you how to do it.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.920
Got to hold the weight.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.920
We're holding it in front of us.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920
Leaning on my legs.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.050
And all I'm going to do, again, is lift my
shoulders up and back.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.050
Squeeze.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.830
I like to hold for a count of five.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.830
Four.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.830
Three.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:18.830
Two.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.830
One.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.830
Allow them to drop down.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.890
Good, pinch.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.350
All the way back.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.350
Five.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.350
Four.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.350
Three.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.350
Two.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.350
One.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.350
Slow on the way down again.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.350
Back up.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.350
And pinch.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.350
Five.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.350
Four.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.350
Three.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.350
Two.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.350
One.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.350
Slow on the way down.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.350
Well these barbell shrugs are mainly used
to target your trapezius muscle.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.350
Right?

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.400
Now when you target your trapezius muscle,
you strengthen that.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.960
You also strengthen your neck, and that's
something that a lot of us are going to want

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.960
to do out there.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.020
So again, you don't need a thousand pounds
to do it.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.170
Use a little bit lighter weight, go to higher
reps.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.340
And if you know what you're doing and you
feel very comfortable doing it, by all means,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.340
do whatever you need to.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.409
But for the novices, for the people that are
a little unsure about it, use a lighter weight.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:00.409
Up.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.409
Hold.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.409
Contract.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.820
You'll get a lot more work in a hold and contract.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
And then you let it down.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.820
Alright guys?

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.350
So again, enjoy.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.350
Try it out.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.353
But be safe.
