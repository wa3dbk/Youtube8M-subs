It is gucchy of WRM

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.700
Today Table Tennis Answers
Thank you

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.700
Today's theme is here.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.500
Pendulum for Saab
And I want to do.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.000
Pendulum Serve

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:16.400
This is exactly Even what do
If you think was also I think that many.

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:21.600
Players that was called Saab virtuoso of

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:22.900
If you are mostly using

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.500
Scoring ability is the high Serve

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.600
It becomes tricks

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.700
Please by all means remember the pendulum serve.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.500
This, pendulum Saab

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.000
When you say a word

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.400
It is a fast long serve of lateral rotation.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:49.200
First, the image of the pendulum serve
Please see the video.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.600
How was? I'm fast Long Saab had come out.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.200
When put out quickly about any

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.700
And to be able to pose a threat to the other party
Very high scoring ability also

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
3 balls attempt also wait easy
You think that it is easy to hit.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.400
This time, How to put out this pendulum serve
And I would like to teach.

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.700
The procedure is one.
Who is the way that can do.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.600
Stance of the server is important.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.800
The angle of the racket at this time

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.500
Normal horizontal is such an angle.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.000
I think it's diagonal.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.600
Pendulum Saab
Angle of the racket is this.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.800
Angular to 6:00 watches

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.500
Please Toward just above the bottom of the grip.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.800
As it is an angle

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:09.000
Pendulum, like this
At this angle by utilizing the recoil

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.800
Very early
Long Saab I was put out

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.300
In stance of normal lateral rotation
The angle of the racket of the watch at 6 o'clock

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.700
I turn the bottom of the grip just above

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.600
With the image of the pendulum
To increase by issuing the Saab

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.600
With another this only

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.800
Pendulum serve you can.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.500
From behind to take the backswing

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.300
It is like this

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.200
At this time

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.000
And to fast, to have very horizontal also took
Hard to take

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.800
I'm receive is difficult Serve

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.000
Pretend about this swing is faster

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:49.600
Speed ​​is fast ball

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:51.800
Horizontal rotation will take strong.

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:53.700
Speed ​​of this pendulum

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.369
It becomes point

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.400
Who shake is those who held with two fingers

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:02.700
I is easy to put the angle of the racket

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.600
This angle is quite difficult
and also the ones wrist becomes painful

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.500
When gripped with two fingers
Is easy to do

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:17.900
When is the angle of the normal fore serve

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:22.400
I'm speed is a little slow

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.200
It is put out quickly that it is this surface

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.100
The lateral rotation takes

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.919
Fast is a must

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:41.400
This angle was at six
And put towards just above the bottom of the grip

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.000
Obviously, those who were in the direction of the 6:00
The fast and took the rotation Saab will put out.

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.300
Knack of hitting position as much as possible

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.900
When hitting a low place
I put out is fast Long Serve

00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:04.300
When he high places

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:06.800
Become a Gatan-Gatan
Slows down.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.300
Under the hitting position

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:15.700
Then the power of the pendulum is small
Even if not enough spin

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:24.000
If low only hitting position
Saab I put out at a fast rhythm

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:35.200
To drop as low as possible.
Here is the point.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.900
I drop the bound as much as possible to the front

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:45.100
Please bring the first bound.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.700
I put out a long of lateral rotation of fast rhythm

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.900
I, in the pendulum serve
The method that is quite recommended

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.700
If there rubbing how are two patterns

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:03.100
The ping-pong table in the lateral line and vertical line,

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.700
In How to cut the vertical and horizontal line
When'll put

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:09.600
This, pendulum Saab
In addition I will power up

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.100
I will intensely power up

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.600
For example, I Are You cut of this vertical line

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:22.600
Side spin of Long advance before you leave.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.000
How to cut of this side of the line

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:26.100
Here is the side

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.700
If you issue something like cut over here

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:39.400
I will bend well

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:40.900
In such feeling

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.600
I will bend in such feeling.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:49.300
The pendulum serve vertical line and horizontal line
When used properly

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.700
I put out a more effective serve

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.500
Although I think that somehow everyone understand

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.800
Sideways line is do is from the beginning this position.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.100
The bear in 6:00

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.300
At a lower position when you rub it up, in this kind of feeling

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:08.400
Please do not cause a racket

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:10.500
Remains of 6:00

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.749
It is this kind of feeling

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:16.800
But it is hard to take this rotation

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:25.100
Of also different quality, It is next to Long serve.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:31.100
Players are said to serve virtuoso of
I'm out the different pendulum serve

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:38.000
During the game, and not return hard to even think you've accustomed but I was there was this reason.

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.300
One is the procedural

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.900
First stance

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:45.600
And, although I'm that mean pendulum

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.970
Type of rotation is vertical line and horizontal line

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.800
Since there are two patterns
I can mercy of the opponent.

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:56.389
Come and high you score force
Please to challenge pendulum serve.
