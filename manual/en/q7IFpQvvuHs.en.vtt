00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.179
Here's a view of the

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.900
clean out door on the back. I made this so
that I can lift it up and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.210
and sweep out the

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.310
droppings. Just to make it easier to get it all out.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.830
It can be a second access if I need to.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.650
You can see how I secured the edges of the linoleum. I took some

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.640
I think it's 3/4" by 3/4" angle. Aluminum angle.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.810
Just some light guage stuff from Home Depot and then I

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.880
drilled some holes and put some pan head screws

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.880
to keep the sides down. I did that on both the front door and these clean out doors.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.560
Here they are in their new coop.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.800
We've got our Araucana, the 3 Partridge Rocks

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.650
and 3 Silver Laced Wyandottes. They're all grown up pretty big

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.770
and the Araucana has quite a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.010
personality. He seems to be really

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.240
interested one. He comes up to us and is really

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
watching us and stuff. I was surprised how

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.890
small the Partridge Rocks are. I thought they would grow a little faster.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.950
Here you can see that I taped the corners.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.740
So the vapor barrier is pretty

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.780
much intact.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.880
Here I am installing the double pane windows
I made.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.690
It's two pieces plexiglass with a frame

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.490
and a center piece that keeps them

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.110
apart and then I just

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.530
silicon-ed the Plexiglas in so that it doesn't move.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.840
These aren't rebuild-able.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.620
They're just Plexiglas and a piece of 2x4.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.620
So this one is going to fill this slot right here.
