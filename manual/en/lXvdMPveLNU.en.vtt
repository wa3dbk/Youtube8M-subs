00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.250
We’ve had a really good look at all those
recommendations from Mary Portas.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.700
And today what we’re saying is that we’re
not just going to accept,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.290
virtually, all of her recommendations, actually
we’ve got some ideas of our own.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.690
So it’s a sort of Portas plus response from
the government if you like.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.450
And I think this is really important.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.539
We know that the internet is not going away,

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.930
and out of town shopping centres are here
to stay.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.140
So if high streets like this one are going
to survive and thrive in the future,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.730
we’re going to have to offer something additional,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.859
do something more than just the shopping perhaps,
make it exciting and different.

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.400
And that’s actually what I think was contained
within Mary Portas’ suggestions.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.160
And today we’re coming back with a whole
bunch of additions to that.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.559
For example we think that it would be a great
idea to not just have this initial pilot

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.789
set of twelve different areas joining the
Portas pilots.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.130
Today I can announce we’re going to have
a second round,

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.770
another twelve, so we’ll have twenty four
in total.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.149
So those towns up and down the country, hundreds
of them,

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.500
who have been looking to join the Portas pilots,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.609
can now know that there will be a second round
of selection

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.390
after the first twelve, another twelve.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.030
So that’s the first thing.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.180
We’re also going to launch, what you might
describe as, an x prize

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.570
for the most improved high street in the country
in a year’s time.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.909
And that will be a million pound prize.

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.360
So everybody can apply for that,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.740
you don’t have to be in the Portas pilot
rounds for that.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.080
That’s just for the area which improves
the most.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.619
We want to make sure that this revolution
on the high street

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.850
of areas improving continues into the future.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.990
But we’re also keen to make sure that empty
shops like the one behind me

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.259
continue to get filled and we want to make
sure that local authorities, councils,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.750
town teams, and retailers, help to do that.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.509
So we’re going to launch a high street innovation
fund,

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.180
allowing people who have got new businesses
to start up to come to the high street,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.079
get some help on the rates from the government
- it’s a ten million pound fund

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.350
- but also match that with local authorities
pitching in.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.469
And in addition we want the landlords to help,

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:59.990
so perhaps a thirty million pound fund in
total,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.060
to get new, exciting, and innovative high
street businesses up and running again.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.560
And we’re backing a day, a special day,
actually extending into a fortnight as a total,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.069
for markets to come to towns to really give
people the opportunity

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.040
to start trading for the first time, bring
new people into the whole idea,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.760
the whole concept of retail and bring excitement
back to high streets like this one as well.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.920
So a whole range of different measures.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.980
Other things as well like building the night
time economy,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.580
shared space, getting rid of some of the street
clutter

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.220
and making town centres a nicer place to be,
a better environment to be in.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.870
As well as accepting almost everything that
Mary herself suggested to us.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.940
So it’s a really big day for the high street.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.050
And we don’t just want it to be a one off
announcement, we want it to continue, and

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.510
that’s why as I say the x prize for high
streets will be announced in a year’s time.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.069
Wherever you are in the country there is hope
for the future of your town centre

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.670
and your high street as a result of the government’s
response to Mary Portas today.
