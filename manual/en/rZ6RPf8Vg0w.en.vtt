Hi There. I’m Gary Nugent. 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.720
I’m the Instructional Leader here in the automotive department.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.230
The automotive department is actually made up of 3 different areas:

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.530
auto body, automotive technology, and automotive upholstery.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.840
I’d like to tell a little about the auto body program today if I could.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.870
It’s a 900-hour program.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.820
That’s about 9 months long.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.500
The classes actually run from 6:45 in the morning until 1:00.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.510
Gives you a little bit of time afterwards to go get a part-time job if need be.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.640
That class actually runs 4 days a week: Monday through Thursday.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.630
The program is made up of actually 3 different areas: modules 1, 2, and 3. 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.710
Module 1 is kind of an overview of the whole industry.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.970
That includes safety and basic things that you need to know to be an auto body or a paint and collision guy.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.000
Now module 2 gets actually into refinishing.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.470
It teaches you how to detail a car, prep it to get ready to paint it, and actually how to paint it

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.470
Now they’re entry level remember.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.470
Because it does take a long time to be a journeyman painter. 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.180
But it will get you the use of the paint gun and how to spray 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.190
and get all the 3 different coats on the car and make it look nice.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.390
The 3rd module is the module that is used to do collision work:

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.160
straightening out panels, putting on Bondo, all that kind of good stuff

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
you see when these cars are bent out there on the freeway

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.280
This class will show you how to straighten them back out.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.260
Now you have a choice. 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.710
You can either take all 900 hours of the program

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.430
or you can just take maybe the paint side or the collision side.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.870
Both of those go along with module 1.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
That shortens the program down to 600 hours.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.470
So for 600 hours you can get yourself a saleable skill.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.660
Now thinking about skills,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.510
the automotive body shop area is just screaming for people out there.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.850
They are very short on, on good technicians. 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.370
They range anywhere from the price of basically almost minimum wage for people who are just starting out

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.920
and know nothing more than how to strip bumpers off of cars

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.620
to up over $70,000, $80,000, $90,000 a year for the painter who knows what he is doing.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.330
Like all of our classes here in the automotive department, 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.530
we use national standards as criteria for the task that we teach.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.840
Many of those standards are by the ASC

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.800
that’s the Automotive Service Council and the I-car council.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.010
Now these standards will allow you to go and enter the trade with skills

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.660
that the trade recognizes and needs.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.510
So by coming down, you can get into the trade

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.840
you can get into the trade and get yourself started

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.680
and you can get out in the shops and find your niche

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.000
and then make a few bucks along the way.
