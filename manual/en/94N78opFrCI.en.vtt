00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.140
Alright, we're ready to do our tuck turn together.
So we've just done the first half of the tandem

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.809
push out and now we can join up and do our
tuck turn together. Here's what it looks like.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:18.349
Starting with the basic. Then doing the push
out. Now doing a tuck turn into an east coast

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.189
basic. Don't really worry about what's coming
after this move. I just did kind of an east

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.780
coast basic. But it really doesn't matter.
In the next clip we're going to talk about

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.910
many different things that we can do. Right
now we just want to focus on the hands working

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.250
together. Leaders, we talked about it before,
just want to remind you, here it's up. It's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.219
up at her eye level. As opposed to if we were
just doing a push out right back into tandem

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.050
it'd be low. And she just cycles right back
around. See the distinction again? Low to

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.340
go back into tandem, higher at about her eye
level, if we're going to go back into the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.769
tuck turn. And from here we can do anything
we want. Yeah. The other thing is, so if we

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.540
have it nice and high like Jason was talking
about, then we can also get that compression.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.250
And if you notice when we're saying high,
there's a specific height to the high. So,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.820
it's pretty much, maybe, the bottom of the
hands are matching my chins, something like

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.930
that. So it's going to be if it's super low,
then it's awkward for me to lean into it,

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.780
if it's high, there's no way I can use that
compression to do anything. So, leaders, make

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.360
sure you're matched up to the follower. The
other thing is to make sure that it's kind

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.890
of on our center axis. OK. If it's way over
here, it causes her to step more than I really

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.170
want. OK. So the idea is after we've done
this five, boom. Give her that compression

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.780
right away so she can sink into that. If we
wait until it's way over here, it's really

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.720
going to mess up her mechanics. So we can't
be so short or so far away. Just pretty much

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.890
right on line with one another. Yeah. We have
time for another angle? Sure, why not? From

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.950
here? Sure. OK. Let's start it from here.
OK.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:18.219
Push out. Back up. And around and then back
around. That'll do it.
