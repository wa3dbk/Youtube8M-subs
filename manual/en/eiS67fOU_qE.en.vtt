00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.779
Now that all the suspension is bolted on,
now you're going to install the tires. Lower

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.060
the vehicle, to a height that's suitable for
you so you're not going to strain your back,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:59.230
and install the rims and tires.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.530
Now that all the tires are on, secure and
tightened, we're going to lower the vehicle

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:17.220
to the ground. Now that the vehicle is dropped
on the ground, with the full weight of the

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:37.200
vehicle on the lift springs, tighten up both
the front and rear bolts for the lift springs.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:50.450
Now I repeat, by having the weight of the
vehicle on the lift springs and then tightening

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.550
the bolt allows you to get the exact right
height for the vehicle. If you would have

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.210
had the vehicle in the air, with no weight
on the springs, your accurate ride height

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.900
is not going to be right because there's going
to be no weight on the springs. Like I said,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.860
lower the vehicle down, then tighten the bolts.
Now you can see what a dramatic difference

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.330
four inches of suspension and thirty-three
inches of tires does to this little truck,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.220
it makes it big. The one thing with this kit,
you have a range of adjustment of three inches

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.000
on the front suspension by adjusting the torsion
bar. Whether it be you can raise it three

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.950
inches or lower it three inches, whether or
not, to your desired height. On this truck

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.420
right now the back sits a little higher than
the front, we'll test drive it and make sure

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.300
everything is good from the lift, bring it
back in, torque the torsion bars to either

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.540
give it a lift, whether the customer wants
it high in the front, level, or as is. This

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.239
is your lifted Colorado. SS Motor Sports.
