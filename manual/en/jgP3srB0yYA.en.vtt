00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.190
its got a nice box the phone we are unboxing is

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.890

lets open it up and see whats inside

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.050

we got the silicon case that it comes with

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:59.320
it fits pretty snuggly into the case and doesn't make the phone feel any fatter

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.340
