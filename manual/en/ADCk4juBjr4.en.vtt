of the areas with our Skill sander well we

kinda wanna leave this logo here because thats How Plasti Dip a Motorcycle
embedded underneath the clear coat so not

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.809

go ahead and try and remove that. so we might

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.570
just paint over it which is kinda cool because
wouldn't see it anyways um, its got cracks

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.820

a little bit more smooth, and then now everything

is just go ahead and spray it up were going

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.780

make sure that its nice and solid and durable How Plasti Dip a Motorcycle
