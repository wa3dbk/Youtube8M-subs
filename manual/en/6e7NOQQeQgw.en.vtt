00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.939
there were three women that were
chilling actually do sports lounge in

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:08.549
california and i don't have to have
their nice meal something

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.369
terrible happening

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:11.469
let's watch

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.639
albertville north american male

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.820
knows that one of the receipts and
admirals at first for friends assumed

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.269
she was joking house laughing and says i
can't say it's

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.089
knowing that i did let me see if she was
like airline when i was like no one

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.279
serious liquidity

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.919
to like that noril'sk like this would
happen

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.630
now i'm not going on

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.739
the promise server returned

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.770
he denied having anything to do with it
he explained that jeff the name on the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.579
receipt musta been the one who take the
words into the system but jeff was gone

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.340
so the three demanded to see a manager
let us not contest face i give it was

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.219
funny but try not to laugh

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:49.780
the manager of politics ix

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.690
but is first reaction was to offer
twenty five percent off the bill

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.990
so honestly that's rediculous and no one
should get something like that

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.990
but the same time i'm remains of this
became a news story everyone was talking

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.510
about it today how does this become a
new story uh... you know why because

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.970
there was that i can see it from a
single mom there was something about

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.329
liberals invented like

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.579
it's just that the thing that we showed
photos of it's like capitalist notes

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.870
restores the photos that just goes
beyond reading everything

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.100
and get it but

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.340
isn't always going to be a story every
time someone gets insulted now and i'm

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.649
not im not tryna defend jeff in this
case like jeff is a low some guy he

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:30.860
shouldn't have done that

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.110
yada yada yada but stuff like this
happens all the time with i consulted on

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.590
a freakin hourly basis and have you know
and i mean like someone's insulting me

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.729
right now this very moment i sent i
couldn't come up with what i said i

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:42.340
could

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.530
and then set

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.710
look i i generally have very low like
low threshold how much i care about

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.510
somebody being offended offended doesn't
actually mean anything it doesn't

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.390
actually do anything to you either are
fat or you're not that somebody pointing

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.049
that out

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.330
it's not baloney

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.160
you don't do it we live in a society we
live in a civilization try to keep it

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.900
going to be polite each other

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.210
but the same time

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.100
it's the fact that book your you
shouldn't worry more about your health i

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.929
would imagine

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.769
militias haitians said this and i find
it weird

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:10.099
that somebody who

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.930
apparently has worked here like

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.650
i know what's printed

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.860
like there's some stuff like that but
that doesn't appear on the check the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.129
sons the but i think that was where for
years

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.019
that does not have enough notice what

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.000
his first day

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.689
potted plants that imagine

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.479
enabled big they were offered twenty
five percent off fifty percent off

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.019
i don't even think they should have an
offer that much

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.700
big houses not to come back you can make
that choice you're totally free did not

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.849
come back

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.979
but failed fifty percent off is enough
by one hundreds of thousands dollars

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:42.479
people decide to go over and i think i
want like if i was in uh... manager that

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:45.309
restaurant i would just let them have
the female right now i think most

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:47.209
managers working at this level

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.349
freemail michael like i think offering
twenty five percent off ten adds insult

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:55.580
to injury they want the freemen which is
given to them and move on trade

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.490
and of course uh... the manager of the
the restaurant maggie louis apologized

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.140
profusely and she felt horrible about
sicknesses horrible uh... uh... behavior

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.170
and i don't condone it nagai understand
each it's not her fault it was one of

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.629
her you know do she employees

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.469
at the same time i don't think that they
handled it right you know and i think

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.749
consumer things but i will say that as a
waiter at what you just have to accept

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:21.810
the fact that we do this but i certainly
insulting but

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.650
if i have to get a friend to bring i see
over the stable electricity which

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.529
persons i was named to suggest alma city
guide the blue shirt

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.310
the girl with the cleavage like that

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.330
it's not personal and understand that
most people that now we don't

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.300
understands it is one of the most
stressful emotionally draining and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.579
physically draining jobs

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.969
and we need to coping mechanisms if that
means

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:44.529
calling people names from time to time

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:47.019
you getting a burger ok blacks are you
giving

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.430
jeff of passing no no he should be just
the value of all anyone react berle

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.410
i'm sorry but at one point i was like
the fact that it table ten

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:00.290
all right now did upload gave me and i
mean i i thought it was the leader died

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.169
so i i i i i thought maybe his head high
school

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:04.970
and i'm

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.620
it's like because booked a fat guy and
said

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.700
there's four people table there always
be looks similar what happens is better

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.470
that's the most distinguishing
characteristic practice what they pricey

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.570
to get to the table uh... is not
possible and nothing is not i saw this

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.709
come before you can confirm the muscle
groups on campus

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:27.259
so you know it's it's what happens in
the month in union i worked on it

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.759
are all out there in hyd my first in the
case and was what he says this is good

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.639
for some of the compound multiple
receipts confident that it's a pretty

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.199
good

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.490
the florida everglades holiday

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.979
as he threatened to dilute my customers
if you have to know which are some sort

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.229
of a book by establishments of five
customers both
