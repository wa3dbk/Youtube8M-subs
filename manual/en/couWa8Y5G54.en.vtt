I was a kid are just watching your show

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.700
I can notice a little friend a

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.080
in regards to the Bible it seems like a

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.640
at will be you know 3-4 times a week
there some kinda antibiotics or

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.430

yeah CR okay he's got its nothing but

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.070
defending the car and Terry Jones yay
for putting in the jail on a course in

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.809
this press conference execution

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.160
I'm yes but case goes to jail

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.850
senator on their sticker on it so great
that I'm just wondering

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.920
what is a major difference between
across the bitwise

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.920
liberals I their religious leaders in
the garage yes let's start there

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.049
throw the Bible you liberals idea is
always very funny to me

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.580
Louis we don't defend the koran I think
that the Koran and the Bible

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.799
both are documents which have groups
that have perverted their initial

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.520
intention

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.299
I'm not a subscriber to any literal
interpretation

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.369
%uh any of these I think that the reason
there's more focus on the Bible

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.200
in the US is that we have in the US
particularly when you look at

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.799
be a most domestic terror is right-wing
non-muslim tear

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.560
most the laws that are sought to be
implemented based on religious texts

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.650
are based on the Bible not on the koran
we just happened to be in the US so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.060
that's really the dock at the sacred
document

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.159
love above most interest when it comes
to perversions of the law

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.200
yeah it's just circumstantial if we were
in Afghanistan to be a different story

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.700
in your

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.329
you know personally I don't think there
should be a Bible occur on or a torah

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.790
I anywhere in the world but down while
it it just so happens that in this

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.450
country

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.799
