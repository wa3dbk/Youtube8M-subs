Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions

00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:12.574
and proud owner of FoodChallenges.com.  If you haven't checked it out, do that!

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:23.374
I'm going for my first win in Florida.  Today is June 24, 2014 I'm 28 today, so happy birthday to me!

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:29.656
My present - I'm at the Filing Station in downtown Miami, Florida

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.440
I'm taking on Adam's 18 wheeler challenge!  It's got nine quarter-pound patties, 18 slices of cheese, 9 onion rings

00:00:42.473 --> 00:00:45.673
and then it's surrounded by a moat of tater tots.

00:00:45.673 --> 00:00:49.620
I've got one hour to do it.  I think only 1 or 2 people have been able to successfully beat the challenge

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.034
Many people have tried

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.380
If I win I'm going to get this ($40) meal free

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.200
I'm going to get a free t-shirt

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.860
and I'll be on the Wall of Fame!

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.754
Most importantly I'll have my first win in Florida!  Lets get this party started!

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:20.529
Alright lets go for win #172.  Lets get it started!

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:24.954
One, two, three!

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:27.514
Usually burgers are held together by a wooden stick, but this is actually steel.  They're not playing around!

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.540
5:15 - Got most of the burger patties done, still got over 54 minutes left.  Have ketchup to help with the flavor.

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:39.254
After 9 patties - after that much of anything, it's starting to get a little boring.

00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:42.500
Getting my flavors switched up with the lemonade and the ketchup.  So lets get the rest down!

00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:04.534
 20:00 - I'm going to get this out of the way because it's covered in grease.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.180
I'm not going to want to do that last.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.513
Using the soda to get it down.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.640
24:00 - Just have the top bun left, then the tater tots.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.633
Never said it was going to be easy, and it's not!

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:58.820
 27:00 - Still got over 30 minutes left, but we're going to stand for the remainder.  It's been a while since I've been doing challenges,

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.300
so I'm getting a bit more full faster than normal, but we still got room for all these tots, so lets get them down!

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.920
42:53 - Just found out I'm the first and only winner of that challenge.  Wow, that was hard!

00:07:31.314 --> 00:07:34.514
I got to do better tomorrow on my next challenge!

00:07:37.314 --> 00:07:43.154
Very delicious burger.  Loved the pickles, onion rings.  Awesome challenge, great win!

00:07:46.954 --> 00:07:51.274
State #19. win #172.  Free meal, free shirt, thanks for watching!
