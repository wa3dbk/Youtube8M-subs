00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.340
 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.779
Hi! welcome to spanish cooking

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.180
today we will prepare magdalenas or
Spanish Cupcakes

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.709
they are really a classic and easy to do

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.520
so: first you need to crack a couple of
eggs

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.529
and beat them with cast sugar

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.970
until its well incorporated and the
color changes to pale yellow

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.140
so it will take a couple of minutes more
or less. I decided to use an electric

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.930
whisk

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.590
but of course you can also do it by hand
It just will take

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.020
a bit longer so you mix &amp; mix

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.820
and when it's well mixed you add a bit of cold

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.530
milk. you beat for extra

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.000
thirty seconds and then you can add
slowly the oil

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.739
so I recommend you not to use olive oil

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.800
because the flavor would be too strong. I
prefer for this kind of recipe to use

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.920
sunflower seeds oil which is more delicate or

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.210
another kind of vegetable oil that is
more suitable for sweets

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.820
and for sweet recipes in general not olive
oil

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.970
right? so once who have added

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.670
all your oil you can start incorporating

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.560
your dry ingredients which are flour, a
pinch of salt

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.240
and baking powder. So, do it in batches
otherwise it could be a mess!

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.490
now a key point:

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.370
keep mixing for at least 3 complete
minutes

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.670
we want to developed the gluten just the
contrary compared with

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.460
usual cupcake recipes because

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.420
it will provide a special texture of
Spanish magdalenas

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.770
right? so keep mixing for at least three
minutes

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.160
it's a key point. And now for the traditional
flavor

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.940
you can add some lemon zest. If you don't
like it

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.920
just skip this step but I really think
it provides

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.629
a fresh touch to the dough so I really
like it

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.969
mix also for

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.469
an extra minute or thirty seconds
until it's well incorporated

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.060
and now a key point: let it sit in the
fridge for

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.879
30 minutes. Then

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.040
in the meantime

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.819
preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.099
and line a cupcake tray with paper cups

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.180
and then you fill it with the mixture

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.689
until its filled like three quarters of
the caps not more

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:49.569
remember that it will grow in the oven
; so as

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.109
I messed up the tray had to clean it to
avoid these

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.569
dots of dough to burn in the oven. And
another important step

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.010
just add finally some cast sugar

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.079
as shown, before baking to get a nice crispy
crust on the cupcakes

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.389
and now you can put them in the oven, lower
the heat to 160º celsius

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.840
bake for about 20 minutes

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.629
or until they get nice golden brown
color like this

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.950
Voilà! now let them cool for some minutes

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.409
and now they're ready to serve and course:
don't forget to enjoy them! see you soon!

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.909
 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.129
