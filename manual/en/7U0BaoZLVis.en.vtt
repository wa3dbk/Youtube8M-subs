00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:20.337
Today we're opening 12 of the 24 bags

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:23.593

00:00:23.593 --> 00:00:25.793
Before we get started,
here's a closer look at

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:28.613

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:29.850
- [Man] I think I'd most like to see

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.416

and there are 24 to collect.

00:01:15.488 --> 00:01:16.573
And we were really hoping,

00:01:16.573 --> 00:01:18.780
since we have a full case,
that we'll able to collect

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.222
