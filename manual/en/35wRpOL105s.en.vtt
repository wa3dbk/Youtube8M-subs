00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi I'm Tricia an organic gardener I grow
organically

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.330
for a healthy and safe food supply for,
a clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.690
for an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.320
Kombucha is a fermented sweet tea.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.619
This beverage has been enjoyed for
centuries in China, Japan and Russia.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.460
It's teaming with probiotics. We're going
to whip up a batch today and I'll show you

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.150
how to do it.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.250
We will be using this Kombucha kit which
contains everything you'll need to brew.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.820
It contains the SCOBY, the sugar, the tea,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.150
the food grade glass jar organic, cotton
cloth,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.870
rubber band and temperature strip. Very
important to sterilize and clean

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.160
everything that's going to come in
contact with the Kombucha. I'm using

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.180
this Star San sanitizer.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.710
Like with any fermented product it's
critical for food safety

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.350
to make sure that no alien bacteria
contaminate your tea.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:01.350
Now we're going to boil two cups of water.
It's recommended to use distilled or

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.890
reverse osmosis purified water if you
have chlorinated water

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.030
allow the tea too steep twenty minutes. The
most popular teas are green teas or

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.020
black teas,

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.050
but you can also use Oolong teas, white teas

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.600
or Yerba Mate, just avoid flavored teas
or any

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.900
herbal teas that contain oil. The
fermenting Kombucha will create a

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.890
very acidic environment from a pH of three point zero up to four point five.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.560
That's why it's very important to use
only a glass jar for fermentation.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.790
While we're waiting for the tea to steep I'm
gonna add the temperatures strip to the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:37.780
fermenting jar.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.530
Just remove the tea bag

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.329
and add the tea to the fermenting jar and then

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.430
add the sugar. You can use white sugar or
cane sugar.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.680
This is going to be food for the yeast to
eat and it's an important part of what makes

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.100
your Kombucha safe,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.350
so don't use less or make any
substitutions.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.210
Don't use sweeteners like Stevia or xylitol 
because they're inedible to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.850
yeast.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.520
Avoid honey which contains its own set
of microorganisms

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.120
and can retard the growth of the other
microbes. Also avoid brown sugar

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.200
which will give the tea an off flavor. Now
add four cups of cold water.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.109
Once the temperature strip reads
below ninety degrees you can add your SCOBY

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:23.359
and starter culture.

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.739
SCOBY stands for symbiotic colony of
bacteria and yeast

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.850
and this disk contains all the
microorganisms that are gonna be used to

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.820
ferment the tea.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.739
Again make sure everything that touches
your scoby is sterile

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.280
to avoid contaminating your tea. Add the cotton cloth

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.630
over the top of the jar and secure it with
a rubber band, and then set the jar in

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.949
a warm location,

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:55.949
out of the direct sunlight for about a
week.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.550
You'll see a new scoby form on the top of
your jar

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.440
be on the alert for mold growth on the
SCOBY if you do get mold

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.610
you should throw the tea out and try again
with a new SCOBY.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.780
Using a sterilized straw you can taste
your Kombucha

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.270
Just put the straw in, put your finger
over it,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.350
get a little bit of your tea out.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.690
Time to taste. Remember if your kombucha
looks,

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.650
tastes or smells bad throw it out. An
important home preservation maxim is

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.120
when in doubt throw it out.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.500
Younger Kombucha is sweeter,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.640
fermentation is generally seven to ten
days but you can go as long as three to

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.420
five weeks.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.840
When the Kombucha is to your liking
lift out your new SCOBY

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.110
and place it in a sterilized, clean
sealed jar

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.310
with three-quarters cup of kombucha and
it will be ready for you next brew.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.580
Remember everything that touches your
kombucha should be sterilized

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.820
Next you can flavor up your kombucha

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.830
or you can bottle it as is. Check out
our blog for some flavoring ideas.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.380
Here are some kombucha guidelines:

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.870
store your kombucha in a refrigerator,
if you're not used to drinking kombucha

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.750
it's a good idea to acclimate yourself
to it gradually.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.590
It's a good idea not to drink more than
eight ounces of kombucha a day

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.170
because of its acidity.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.030
 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.710
Brew some kombucha

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.400
and grow organic for life!

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.420
 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.920
