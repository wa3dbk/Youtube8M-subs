00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.680
Here's an idea--
"Adventure Time" is

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.820
popular because of nostalgia.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.755
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.640
"Adventure Time"-- come
on and grab your friends--

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.100
is a kids' television show
on the Cartoon Network.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.070
It stars Jake the Dog
and Finn the Human

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.770
and was created by bearded
human Pendleton Ward,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.072
pictured here wearing
some awesome glasses.

00:00:19.072 --> 00:00:20.530
It's set in the
magical land of Ooo

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.590
and its many kingdoms which are
home to Candy People, animals,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.110
and a whole cast of
generally weird but also

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.340
adorable characters.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.310
My personal favorite
is the Shnow Golem.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.080
As one might suspect,
the general thrust

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.060
of "Adventure Time"
is adventures.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.890
Finn and Jake are
best buds who go

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.800
on all manner of moral,
ethical, and totally

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.110
mathematical escapades.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.014
Finn, you're terrible at math.

00:00:41.014 --> 00:00:41.970
Aww.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.290
They rescue princesses,
fight giant monsters,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.970
protect the innocent, and have
a strong dislike of evil dudes.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.210
And they are very popular,
amongst not only kids, but also

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.310
a huge contingent of
honest-to-Glob growed-up

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.140
adults.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.690
Now if you're a kid,
"Adventure Time"

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.340
probably looks a lot like
the inside of your head--

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.050
exciting sights, magical
objects, and impossibly

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.054
terrifying things.

00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:06.720
But if you're an
adult, "Adventure Time"

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720
is like remembering
your childhood.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.420
Fighting to be taken
seriously, constant

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.690
encounters with new and
unfamiliar challenges,

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.230
grappling with a
deer that has hands.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.730
Creepy.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.170
For many adults, the core
appeal of "Adventure Time"

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.470
is its nostalgia.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.080
Not like Instagram filters
or cassette tapes post-irony

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.565
nostalgia, but more like
classical nostalgia,

00:01:24.565 --> 00:01:28.232
a pain of an ache for a time
past that you can't recreate.

00:01:28.232 --> 00:01:29.690
While we usually
think of its roots

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.500
as in culture or
the arts, nostalgia

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.560
was actually born in 1688
as a medical diagnosis

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.440
for Swiss soldiers
wishing to return home.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.004
It's this wily emotion
that's a mix of good and bad.

00:01:40.004 --> 00:01:42.420
At the same time that you're
fondly remembering something,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.290
you're also confronted
with the fact

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.660
that it's gone, or unattainable.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.830
From its origins,
nostalgia weaseled its way

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.207
into everything from art to
politics to industrial design.

00:01:52.207 --> 00:01:54.790
You name it, someone thinks that
the thing that came before it

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.360
was better.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.330
Along the way, it transformed
from medical nostalgia

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.590
into poetic or
romantic nostalgia,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.970
from a disease that could
be cured with leeches

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.170
to a feeling that
could be evoked--

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.460
by a young kid in an animal hat.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.590
In "Nostalgia of the Future,"
Svetlana Boym writes,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.070
"The object of
romantic nostalgia

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.520
must be beyond the present
space of our experience,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.930
somewhere in the twilight of the
past or on an island of Utopia,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.070
where time has happily stopped,
as on an antique clock."

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.920
I can definitely
remember a twilight

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.830
of the past with
imaginary friends,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.530
treehouses, magical weapons,
and if given the chance,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.140
I'd happily stop there.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.900
"Adventure Time" is perfectly,
romantically nostalgic

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.744
for childhood.

00:02:34.744 --> 00:02:36.910
But so are a lot of other
shows, like "Foster's Home

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.409
for Imaginary Friends," "The
Amazing Adventures of Gumball,"

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.665
and even "Rugrats," sort of.

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:43.040
What is it about
"Adventure Time"

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.941
that makes it so well-liked,
especially by not-kids?

00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:47.690
Here's where it gets
a little complicated.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.440
It's because at the same time
we the audience are experiencing

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.570
nostalgia, so too are the
characters in "Adventure Time."

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.920
It's nostalgia within nostalgia.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.680
It's a "nostalgia-ception."

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.150
Take a look at
some of the clues.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.342
There was a mysterious
devastating mushroom war.

00:03:04.342 --> 00:03:05.800
A lot of the
characters, especially

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.530
Marceline and the Ice King,
have this unexplained evolving

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.530
"wish it were still the
good old days" past.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.749
The landscape is littered with
human remains and technology.

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.290
And in certain
episodes, you can even

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.550
see a partially destroyed
planet Earth in the sky.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.220
I mean, Finn is the last
human, for Glob's sake.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.040
That is, unless Susan
Strong isn't a fish,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.970
and you count the Ice King
as-- uh, uh, never mind.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.260
"Adventure Time" is a fun,
adventurous kids' show

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.485
with a history, a potentially
very dark history.

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:38.100
Pen Ward has even said his
favorite emotion is feeling

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.620
simultaneously happy and sad.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.320
So that's a reaction he tries
to elicit in "Adventure Time."

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.819
This is called
ambivalence, and it's

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.160
what's at the root of nostalgia.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.990
It means you're holding onto
two usually conflicting emotions

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.260
at the same time.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.440
And "Adventure Time"
does it on two levels.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.781
So that's four total emotions,
for the folks keeping track

00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.280
at home.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.321
You see it in the settings
and the relationships,

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.380
but also in the cute but
disturbing creatures,

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.340
the comedic but dire
situations, the childlike

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.930
but nonetheless
high-stakes situations.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.510
It's in the show, but it's also
experienced by the audience.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.950
All these things contribute
to capital-D Drama.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.529
Not like lowercase-D drama,
which is what LSP gets

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:16.362
herself involved in.

00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:17.450
Yo, guess what?

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.560
Slime Princess is in the
park, and she's, like,

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.010
talking to a new Nice King.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.590
Uh, and he's like,
totally single.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.950
Which by itself definitely
doesn't make a good show,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.170
but combined with the
creator's amazing imagination

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.731
and character design, makes
maybe the best animated show

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:33.230
ever.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.839
I'm biased.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.130
I really like "Adventure Time."

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.740
But seriously, I
know more adults

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.740
than kids who watch "Adventure
Time," including my mom.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.480
So that has to mean something.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.820
Yes, adults watch
cartoons, but that's not

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.890
the interesting part.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.223
The interesting part is that
most of the cartoons adults

00:04:47.223 --> 00:04:48.460
watch are made for adults.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.960
"The Simpsons," "Bob's Burgers,"
"Family Guy," "South Park,"

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.460
even most anime-- adult
situations, adult humor,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.560
and maybe with the exception
of anime, very little emotional

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.250
depth.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.730
But man, when Finn hugs the
Flame Princess wrapped up

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.770
in a tin-foil burrito?

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.670
It's too much.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.240
It's just-- it's just too much.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.960
"My Little Pony" is maybe the
only other close comparison,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.404
but its popularity is because
of a whole other thing--

00:05:11.404 --> 00:05:13.570
that we talk about in a
video that you should watch.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.570
"Adventure Time" is maybe
the closest television

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.465
comes to classic fairy tales,
exhibiting a combo of terror

00:05:19.465 --> 00:05:21.520
and humor, excitement
and fear, that

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.250
are the very hallmarks
of childhood.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.170
Or maybe I just have a
playground crush on Marceline.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.140
What do you guys think?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.630
Does "Adventure Time"
make you kind of sad,

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.080
and is that why you like it?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.420
Let us know in the comments.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.610
And if you're feeling
ambivalent about subscribing,

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.120
you could just subscribe.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.280
Or not.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.780
Whatever.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.814
Yes, I grew a silly mustache.

00:05:42.814 --> 00:05:44.230
Let's see what you
guys had to say

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.440
about YouTube and education.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.440
We were really lucky to hear
from Brady of Periodic Videos

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.810
fame about last week's episode.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.012
He sent us this clip.

00:05:51.012 --> 00:05:51.720
Hey there, Mike.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.520
I saw your video.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.790
It's so hard to measure
or not whether YouTube

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.580
is making people smarter.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.700
We all drown in
viewing statistics,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.870
but what do they tell us?

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.570
I'd like to show
you some photos.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.580
This is Eddie from Arkansas,
and his Christmas present

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.540
was a signed photo from the
scientists on the Periodic

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.530
Videos channel.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.510
And this is Eduardo from Italy.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.870
His 10th birthday
wish was to come

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.710
to the University of
Nottingham in England

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.335
and meet his YouTube heroes.

00:06:19.335 --> 00:06:22.400
And we seem to have countless
stories like this, new things

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.870
coming up all the time.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.960
Now, this shows that these
people are listening,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.710
they're really engaged.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.260
And if they're
listening this closely,

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.500
they must at least be on
their way to learning.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.020
Thanks so much, Brady, for
sending us that awesome clip.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.160
Mc7738 is a high-school
biology teacher

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.740
who says that YouTube is
indispensable in the classroom,

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.430
especially considering how dry
a lot of the textbooks are.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.840
If my high school experience
is any indication,

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.762
that sounds-- that
sounds about right.

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:48.470
EuclidsParadox makes
a really good point,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.110
that YouTube allows you
to introduce yourself

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.630
to a lot of different ideas
without getting super invested

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.402
in spending a lot of time,
which is really interesting,

00:06:56.402 --> 00:06:57.110
and a good point.

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.360
To all of our Lithuanian
fans, a big lavas.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.349
Did I do OK?

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:02.140
Did I do all right?

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:02.990
Let me know.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.920
To Chris Chance,
I think if anybody

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.474
should be thanking anybody,
it should be us to you.

00:07:07.474 --> 00:07:09.390
But it's good to know
that you enjoy the show,

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.723
and that you find YouTube a
great resource for learning.

00:07:11.723 --> 00:07:14.760
To Jill Suda, I was in college
before YouTube was a thing,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.380
and it was probably
pretty similar.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.970
Far fewer cat videos,
though, which is, I imagine,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.930
a huge part of the
college experience now.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.930
And if you're curious
about the music

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.388
that you've been
listening to, this

00:07:25.388 --> 00:07:28.140
is GraveArcadeOfficial's remake
of the five-minute-long video

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.649
where all I said
was "GIF" and "JIF."

00:07:30.649 --> 00:07:32.690
If you would like to listen
to it or download it,

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:34.022
click on my face.

00:07:35.006 --> 00:07:36.482
While I move it back and forth.

00:07:36.482 --> 00:07:37.466
Click my face.

00:07:37.466 --> 00:07:38.942
Click it.
