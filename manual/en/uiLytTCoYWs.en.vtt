Hi and welcome back to Kat’s Closet.

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:17.500
Now it’s the end of November and Christmas is nearly upon us once again.

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:24.500
So to get us in the festive spirit, we launched a competition to give one family a Christmas home and wardrobe makeover.

00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:28.500
And I’ve got the lucky winners, the Barlow family in with me in the closet today!

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:37.500
So tell me about your Christmas for this year. What are you doing?

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:43.500
&gt;&gt;DAD: Well, we have the whole family coming on over to our new house. 15 people, so it’s going to be a busy old affair.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:48.500
Lots of children running around. Lots of excitement in the air before the big dinner later on.

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:53.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: I understand that Darren came to you the other day and had a festive overhaul of your house.

00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: He did and it was amazing!

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Was it?

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:57.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: Yep! Absolutely fantastic! 

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:02.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: So you got your festive house sorted, now we just need to sort out your Christmas day wardrobe.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Wow! Very Christmassy! What do you think?

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:17.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: I love it Kat! I love the colour, I think it’s really practical as well so a great Christmas dress that I can wear throughout the day.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:24.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: So I chose this because it’s really functional but still fashionable. It’s a 
classic cut and it’s going to be so easy to wear.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:30.500
I’ve put it with these flat shoes because on a busy day like that, you don’t to be tottering around in heels.

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.500
These have got a gorgeous little bit of bling with the jewels on the toe. 

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:40.500
It really suits you and it should be something that you can through on on Christmas day and look fantastic and forget about everything else.

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:45.500
Do you want to step out Daisy?

00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:50.500
Look at you! You look gorgeous! What do you think?

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.500
&gt;&gt;DASIY: It’s lovely. It’s got beads on it and I love beads!

00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:58.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Have you noticed that you’ve got some sparkles on the top?

00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:59.500
&gt;&gt;DASIY: Yep!

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:02.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: And look at the shoes! 

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:05.500
&gt;&gt;DASIY:  They are really sparkly and I like bows. 

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:07.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: So do you think we should see what daddy’s wearing?

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:08.500
&gt;&gt;DASIY:  Yeah.

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:11.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: I don’t think we should put sparkles on daddy though. No! Let’s go and find him.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Looking very dapper! What do you think?

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:27.500
&gt;&gt;DAD: It’s a really good kit on the shirt. The whole outfit has got a 2012 Christmas, meets 1970s disco feel to it.

00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: So is that a good thing?

00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:33.500
&gt;&gt;DAD: Oh yeah! How can 1970s disco not be?! Very stylish for Christmas day! 

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:43.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Now I’ve gone for a slim cut because you can really take it! Spots are a much cooler option than stripes so it gives that modern vibe and I’ve gone for some contrast, real suede brogue shoes. 

00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:47.500
The great thing about these is that you can wear them with jeans, really easily.

00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.500
Now I think you look wicked and I think we should get you all together and see what you look like as a family.

00:02:56.501 --> 00:02:58.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Well I think you all look fabulously festive! 

00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:03.500
What do you think Maya? This is very cute! And what about these shoes?

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:11.500
So with Maya, we went for something that’s really cute and easy for her to run around. 

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:12.500
And she seems to love the shoes.

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:16.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: She does, yes. She keeps saying “shoes” so I think that’s a good sign.

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:22.500
&gt;&gt;KAT: Well I think the Barlow’s look absolutely fantastic! 

00:03:22.501 --> 00:03:28.500
