Hi, my name is Rachel Youens and I'm the owner
of the site Austinstylewatch.com and a freelance

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.549
fashion journalist. Today we are going to
talk about how to tell real pearls from fake

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.610
pearls. Now I'm going to preface this by saying
if you're planning on buying some bajillion

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.179
dollar set of pearls your going to want to
go ahead and have some more scientific tests.

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.350
And there's some laser tests and other more
scientific ways they can tell but, the techniques

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.249
were going to show today are really good if
you're traveling to Mexico, you kind of impulse

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.360
want to buy some nice pearls so we're going
to talk about some on the street techniques

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.660
that you could do. Now we think about pearls
as being perfectly round and sculpted inside

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.039
of oysters but, they're actually full of imperfections
and they're very subtle but, that's one of

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.180
the first places we are going to look at telling
real pearls from fake pearls. So first test

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.500
we are going to do is we are going to take
it and just look up at the light with it and,

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.270
on a fake pearl your going to see just a perfectly
round pearl but, on a real pearl you're going

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:09.380
to see differences in the iridescence of it
and maybe even slight little divots and imperfections

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.110
where the pearl isn't perfectly round. Some
people take this test to the next level and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.210
they actually put the pearl in their mouth.
And you're supposed to be able to feel a grittiness

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.829
of the pearl up against your teeth and your
also supposed to feel the imperfections with

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:30.800
your tongue. I wouldn't necessarily advocate
putting most jewelry into your mouth. Another

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.810
way on strands of pearls you can tell a real
from a fake, is and clearly these are not

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.939
real pearls but, the size will help us demonstrate.
On real pearls usually the holes are driven

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.469
very very small so that most of the pearl
is preserved and a lot of times on fake strands

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:57.549
of pearls you see just very carelessly drilled
large holes. So just take a look between the

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.030
threading and see if you have a large or small
hole. Small more likely to be real, large

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:10.140
hole more likely to be fake. This has been
how to tell real pearls from fake out on the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.170
street.
