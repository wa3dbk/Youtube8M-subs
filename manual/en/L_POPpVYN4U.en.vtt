00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
 

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:11.841
This project is going to change the way we commute here in Central Florida. 

00:00:12.753 --> 00:00:17.913
I-4 is the backbone of Central Florida for transportation.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:23.485
Nobody travels to Orlando without using I-4.

00:00:25.176 --> 00:00:28.076
We have begun building a better I-4.

00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:34.981
Interstate 4 will be completely transformed along a 21-mile stretch from Kirkman Road to State Road 434.

00:00:34.994 --> 00:00:38.354
This much needed makeover will include adding Express Lanes,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.360
reconstructing 15 interchanges,

00:00:41.365 --> 00:00:43.765
building dozens of new bridges

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.609
and improving safety to create a signature corridor.

00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:54.296
I-4 was built in the early 60's. It wasn't built to handle the volume of traffic that it handles today.

00:00:54.308 --> 00:01:02.828
So, what we're going to do is not just add the Express Lanes, we're going to reconstruct the entire I-4 corridor.

00:01:02.844 --> 00:01:05.664
The interchanges will be wider.

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.889
There will be more lanes within the interchanges.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:11.895
The curves will be softer or gentler.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.580
It will be just an easier ride, a more smooth ride.

00:01:15.587 --> 00:01:19.667
This is an improvement that's going to be here for the next 50-60 years.

00:01:19.674 --> 00:01:26.214
And it's going to be a long term improvement and you're going to see it, once we're completed with construction,

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:30.746
you're going to immediately see the improvements, but they're going to be around for decades to come.

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:38.454
All regular lanes will remain open during peak travel times. But now is your time to prepare because I-4 will be changing.

00:01:38.468 --> 00:01:42.988
Stay informed about the project by logging onto I4Ultimate.com.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:48.136
The website has information about the entire 21 mile corridor and what changes will be made.

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:54.945
On the website, sign up for route-specific text &amp; email alerts. Text or email alerts will notify you of construction impacts

00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:57.778
that will change your regular I-4 drive.

00:01:57.783 --> 00:02:01.783
And sign up for the e-newsletter to get up-to-date info on the project.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.270
Because I-4 Ultimate construction may affect your daily commute, look at alternative ways to get to work

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.140
like ride sharing, SunRail or LYNX. Find out how I-4 Ultimate construction will affect you.

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:17.709
They're keeping lanes open as they are now. There'll be a lot of night work, which will be good,

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:24.259
but it's still going to be a little painful. But 6 and a half years for this size project, 21 miles, is not that bad.

00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:30.291
Our commitment is to maintain the traveling public's safety and mobility as our primary focus.

00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:34.861
And we're going to be communicating with the traveling public as much and whenever possible

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.850
to tell them exactly what we're doing and then actually execute what we told them we were going to do.

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:44.339
We're doing everything we can to make sure they're safe. And if they pay attention and follow

00:02:44.347 --> 00:02:48.527
the rules of the road, they'll make sure that we're safe. And together we can get through this.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:54.994
When we're done, it's really going to make a big difference in how we travel through Central Florida.
