Hello Friends! Today we will make a rice, but rice with soy milk [soy]

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.169
This is a dessert that is very typical in virtually all countries of Latin America and actually

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.199
worldwide

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.439
each country has its own recipe, I'm going to present my recipe

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.020
the result is going to surprise you  because it was very very rich

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.300
So let's go with the ingredients and then the method

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.240
The ingredients are:

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:40.540
1 cloves, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 lemon peel rather large

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.000
600 ml of boiled water

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.800
400 ml soy milk [soy]

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.210
180 grams of rice

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.840
4 tablespoons white sugar

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.530
and we will occuppy  ground cinnamon for dusting 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.350
The preparation is as follows

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.160
in a pot, we will place the boiling water, let's put the rice

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:12.600
let's wait for this to take temperature to boil, and let's count there 10 minutes

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.120
when 10 minutes have passed, we will place soymilk

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.280
it will be at room temperature or cold

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.540
let to fit to the pot, let's wait to boil, hence, we will place the clove

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.780
cinnamon, lemon and 4 tablespoons of white sugar 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.630
let's stir and let's wait within 10 minutes, or may be 15 minutes

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.620
it depends on the rice you using and the type of pot you have

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.660
past those 10 minutes, remove from heat and serve

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.960
and to serve, we can sprinkle with ground cinnamon and enjoy

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.290
Well friends, I hope you liked the recipe, this, as you can see, is a light dessert

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:04.200
so I can eat people who are dieting, and is a dessert that is served hot

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.679
