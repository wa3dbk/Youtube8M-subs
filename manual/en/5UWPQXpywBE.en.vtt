00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.750
A lot of my spirited runs as everybody knows
are all basically in southern California in

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.720
and around the mountain roads, within a two,
three hundred mile range of downtown L.A.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.990
Generally that whole environment is high desert,
dry, arid. Here in Raleigh, North Carolina,

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.610
everything's undulating, everything is amazingly
lush and green. We're here in mid October,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.710
the leaves are starting to change and it's
one of those, being out in California for

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.380
so long, in southern California, you really
lose track of time. Because it is somewhat

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.420
of a season-less environment, where it's pretty
much the sun shines most of the time. There's

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.950
not a really tremendous amount of difference
whether you go for a drive in February or

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.979
you go for a drive in September. Maybe it's
a little bit hotter but the environment is

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.060
the same. The landscape is the same. Been
a long, long time since I've been in a green.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:12.060
Lush environment, driving a car. It's just
amazing how green it is here.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.560
Basically I'm on what I like to call my southern
charm and hospitality road trip where for

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.560
the first time I'm actually driving my favorite
1971 911T car number 277 on some really exciting

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.480
fresh new roads in a new environment that
I've never driven on before.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.430
I actually got to drive my favorite car, number
277 on VIR, which I believe is a 1.6 mile

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.090
tight twisty track. It was just great to experience
a different track in a different environment.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.120
The majority of tracks that I've driven, they're
all essentially tracks that are out in the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.060
desert, the high desert, dry and dusty environment.
VIR is a complete opposite. It's in a completely

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.060
tranquil setting, very lush, rolling hillside
and the track is phenomenal.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:52.500
I'm also here to attend the first time of
the North Carolina museum of all Porsche By

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.359
Design seducing speed event. I've never seen
Porsches in a museum. The last car I saw in

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.310
a museum, ironically, was an E type Jag and
that was in London. I think having an environment

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.590
like the North Carolina Museum of Art where
Porsche was on hand to display a lot of their

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:15.590
historic cars enabled people like myself that
don't really visit museums to actually see

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.269
an environment that is not a traditional museum
environment. Obviously I often talk about

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.370
Porsche is its own design aesthetic, especially
the 911, an iconic car that's really not changed

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.130
much of its DNA in fifty years. It was just
like the perfect setting of car design in

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.130
an art museum.
It's not very often I drive this car in the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.139
rain. It's been slightly drizzly and damp
all day. I actually bolted on a set of windshield

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.110
wipers that I happened to have in the trunk
of my car. It's just been a great, great change

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.210
of pace. I'm so glad that I'm here with my
car, as opposed to driving around in a rental

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.759
car. Just to be at one with my favorite car
on these open roads which are new to me and

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:16.759
just the whole landscape of old, old buildings.
You see these great old decaying farm houses

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:23.430
and barns, that some are abandoned. There
seems to be a lake on every property. It's

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.169
just a really different landscape that is
fresh and exciting. It's a landscape that

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:31.879
you don't see in California or at least in
southern California. That's the great thing

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.479
about North Carolina. It's really just a great
place to be.
