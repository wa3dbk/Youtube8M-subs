00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.290
Hi it's Camille with POSGuys.com. Today we're
taking a look at two barcode scanners. We

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.290
have the Honeywell 1250g and the Honeywell
1200g. They are both laser scanners and they're

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.520
based off some of the older Voyager models
that are actually really good as well but

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.860
these are the latest and greatest.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.860
So the 1250g here was, it's not officially
an upgrade but it's kind of the next step

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.879
up from the Voyager GS. So if you have one
of these it's a good step up to move to the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.179
1250g.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:51.179
And the Voyager just the original Voyager
is continued on by the Voyager 1200.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.829
Really quickly we're going to compare the
Voyager and the Voyager 1200. So this is the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.829
original. A little bit larger, this one is
a bit more ergonomic, fits easily in my hand.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.490
The button itself is rubberized, a bit more
comfortable because of the texture and its

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:14.260
even got a bit of grip which this one doesn't
have any grip. And you can see the bar from

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.260
the original Voyager is much thinner than
the bar from the current Voyager 1200g which

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.640
will give you a better read when you are scanning
barcodes.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.640
Now we'll take a look at the 1250g versus
the Voyager GS. So they're... scanners, the

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.080
1250g is a little bit thicker and when you
do the comparison of how well they scan you

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.930
can tell pretty quickly

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.930
that the 1250g has a much faster scan rate
and a much higher, er larger range.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:04.190
It just takes longer for it to scan and it
can't scan much further than this right now.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.640
Taking a look at the two new scanners and
their depth of field.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.640
This is the 1200g.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:26.049
So it has a decent range for a laser scanner.
That's about it.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.400
And then for the 1250 it should have a slightly
larger depth of field. And you can see it's

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.980
a bit faster from the higher ranges of it's
depth of field.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:01.299
For the light testing, these are laser scanners
so laser scanners are not recommended for

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.889
gardens centers, places where there would
be a lot of bright light. So maybe outdoors

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:11.260
you probably wouldn't want to go with a laser
scanner because

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.749
the laser beam just disapears in the light
because it is light itself.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.769
We're going to do a really quick scratch test.
Soo

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.769
We'll just run a pen through this really fast.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.879
No problem reading it for the 1250 and no
problem for the 1200. I'm just going to put

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:49.650
a lot of scratches on this to really reduce
the contrast on this barcode. Make it really

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.790
messy and scan with the 1200. It still has
no problem, it has like a 10% minimum contrast

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.620
which is pretty good and the 1250g has 
a 20% which is still having no problem.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.620
I'm gonna run some lines there vertically
and see how it does.

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:15.269
Yeah, that got it. For the 1250g. Let's try
it with the 1200. Yeah 1200 is still reading

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.959
it even with the vertical lines.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.270
Both of these barcode scanners are great for
retail. You have a good depth of field which

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.300
makes it easier on your employees because
they can scan from really close or further

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.340
away. You do still have to line up the barcode
with the laser, so you do have to be a bit

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.000
more precise with the laser scanner.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.410
The main difference between the two, because
they are very similar, is the stand and the

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.720
design. So this one has the trigger on the
top and it always comes with a stand which

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.270
is great for just running items in front of
but this one has an optional stand which you

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.270
can configure to do presentation mode. It's
great for scanning items off of shelves, doing

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:12.520
inventory. It is a little bit more comfortable.
I have wrists that get tired easily and so

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.389
I prefer this one because of the ergonomic
design.

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.720
The GS which is the earlier version of the
1250g is still available for sale if you'd

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.889
like however we think that this one is probably
going to replace it due to the similarity

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:34.849
and the upgrades that have been incorporated
into this scanner.

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:38.300
The original Voyager is no longer available.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.280
The interfaces are all the standard ones.
It comes with a five year warranty

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:50.099
and if you'd like to buy either of these barcode
scanners, the Voyager 1200g or the Voyager

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:54.580
