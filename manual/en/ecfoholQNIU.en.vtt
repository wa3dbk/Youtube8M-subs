Using Photoshop projects in Final Cut Pro
is a great workflow, because Final Cut will

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.399
allow you to use the Photoshop layers independently.

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:14.039
In Photoshop I am going to start with a 1920
by 1080 Film and Video project preset.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.780
The First step will be to use the rectangle
tool to create the lower third box at the

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.420
bottom of the screen.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.660
Next drop the opacity to 50%, and rasterize
the layer.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.900
Now it is time to add a text layer. The biggest
reason I use Photoshop for creating titles

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.599
is because I like the look of beveled text
in Photoshop.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.329
Once the text layer is complete, you will
want to duplicate it, so all the attributes

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.250
carry over from the first text layer. In this
case we will reduce the size of the font for

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.089
the second text layer.

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.719
I have a football graphic open in Photoshop,
that I will move it into my lower third project.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.899
After I get the graphic the way I want it,
I will reposition the text, and rectangle,

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.780
so the lower third looks good as a whole.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.859
Before saving the project turn off the background
layer, and convert each text layer to a smart

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.420
object. Converting to smart object will preserve
the bevel and emboss.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.979
Save the Photohop project to your Final Cut
project folder.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.990
When you bring the Photoshop project into
Final Cut Pro it will have a sequence icon,

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.990
more on that in a second.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.789
After you bring the Photoshop project into
your Final Cut project, you will need to reset

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.490
the distortion.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.500
Now double click on the Photoshop project
in the Timeline. Remember how the Photoshop

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.750
project showed a sequence icon in the Browser,
well that’s because it is it’s own sequence.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.770
Within this sequence, we can see the various
layers that were created in Photoshop, and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:38.240
we can now manipulate them independently.
I am now keyframing the four layers so that

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.060
the rectangle, the graphic, and the text all
move on to the screen one at a time from different

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.100
directions.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.439
Back in our master sequence the changes we
made to the Photoshop project sequence are

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.400
updated into the master sequence. Anything
we do to the Photoshop project in Final Cut

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.409
Pro, such as apply a transition, apples to
the Photoshop project as a whole.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:07.210
This is a great workflow. At GeniusDV we teach
workflows like this in all our classes. Sign
