00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.379
With a little bit of trial and error, I've
learned how to preserve my wash and gos for

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:15.120
days. In this video, my hair is 5 days old
and I still feel comfortable wearing it out

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.150
of the house. The secret is in the nighttime
routine.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.150
To start, grab your satin scarf and begin
wrapping it around the base of your head.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.149
Push the hair up as you begin to cover the
back of your head. Be sure that you're stretching

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.360
the hair up as opposed to just smooshing it
under the scarf. The stretch overnight, will

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.989
give you some hang time the next morning.

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.989
Tie the scarf in the front.  caught

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.580
At this point I always check to make sure I haven't hair in the knot. That's a great wear
to break your off and we definitely don't

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.729
want that.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:16.729
Finish it up by securing it in the back.

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:26.899
Gently pull the hair on top to slightly stretch
it out. And with that, you should be ready

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.520
for bed.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.520
The next morning, take down your scarf .. and
you might see something similar to this.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.880
Loosen up the stiff hair by lacing your fingers
through your hair on to your scalp and shake

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.880
it out.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.460
Use your fingers to shape and mold your hair
back to something that resembles an actual

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.910
afro.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.269
Here's a look with some light. You can see in this
view, that some frizz is beginning to come

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.290
in, but to be honest, it doesn't bother
me. It helps to fill out my hair and doesn't

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.739
really detract from the style.

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.560
Let me know in the comment section below how
you preserve your wash and gos at night.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.840
Thanks for watching and until next timeï¿½.
