00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.840
Here we are in step number four of the Ghana
braids hairstyle it in this that I will show

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.020
you how easy and simple it is to take down
and remove your braid extensions so what you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.950
want to do and taking down your braids is
simply use your hands to unravel your braids

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.400
on the bottom all the way up to you work your
way to the top to take down your extensions

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.620
you can also take down by using hair cutting
scissors cutting off the braid length that

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.120
youâ€™re comfortable with and then continuing
to take them down by when taking down your

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.399
Ghana braid extensions of course you are going
to do the same process to take down all of

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:50.720
your braids so you can take them all down
by hand or if it's comfortable for you can

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.840
cut off a portion of the break and take it
down as well so I'm going to do is demonstrate

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.170
on the braid here on the right side of my
head when I locate the bottom of that braid

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.350
and I'm going to cut the break off so you
can just cut the very end if you want or if

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.030
you're very comfortable to wear the length
of your hair is you can cut where ever you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
would like someone want to do is just cut
right here whether braid starts to become

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.369
take just so it's very easy for me to take
down the Ghana so I am just going to use my

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:33.759
scissors to cut that off then I am just going
simply continue to unravel and take it down

00:01:33.759 --> 00:03:54.310
by hand so as you can see it's very easy taking
down your Ghana braid extensions because you

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.870
start off with such a small amount of extension
at the beginning of your braid it's very useful

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.261
to use the end of your rat tail comb to help
you further take down and remove your extension

00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:10.880
hair so in this style I taught you plenty
of techniques and tips that you want to incorporate

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.470
to make this look very beautiful I taught
you how to off your extension hair to feed

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.860
into your braid also shown you how to do the
Ghana braid technique as well as other temps

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.030

results as well as the take down so now that
