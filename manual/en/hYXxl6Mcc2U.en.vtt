00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:14.709
For the last 15 years at least, I would say
one of the most sought out hair color icons

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.040
have been Jennifer Aniston.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.130
She always has such a beautiful contrast.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.310
There's always a lot of color, a lot of movement.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:33.040
I've seen over the years, Jennifer go from
very blonde looks into very brown looks.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.820
But she's never really came out with that
dark solid or that solid light.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.579
It's just always very attractive.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.510
Whenever she moves her hair, she always has
a movement of her darker, natural tones.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.270
Right now, I believe her highlights are a
very rich honey color.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:05.579
So, mixed with Jennifer Aniston's natural
light brown hair, these honey highlights take

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:11.369
over just such a wonderful hue of brightness
for her.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.399
I've also seen Jennifer Aniston wear a beautiful,
beautiful platinum blonde.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:24.829
Even when Jennifer goes platinum, she's always
leaving a little bit of her natural undertones.

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:28.420
So, Jennifer's hair is just always believable.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.479
It always looks shiny.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.490
It always looks well-quaff.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.999
It's always maintained.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:40.750
One of the things I rarely see Jennifer do
is leave her roots.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.590
I feel like even when you think she has roots,
it's not really roots.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.329
It's maybe her little transition into toning
it down from very blonde to brown.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.789
I just think Jennifer maintains her hair color
very, very often and when clients approach

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.700
me and say, "Can I have a hair color like
that?" of course you can.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.599
But are you ready to do what she does and
just always maintain it?

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:13.340
Something I definitely can't picture is Jennifer
Aniston in the bathroom doing her own color.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.160
So I have to say that this is definitely a
look that gets done in the hair salon.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.760
I actually don't even think that Jennifer
is getting your typical foil highlight.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.930
A lot of the work that I see in print that
I see her have is the balayage technique.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.650
We do the balayage technique in the hair salon,
and I think that if you're going to go for

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.140
a look like Jennifer, you should come into
the hair salon and do it there.
