00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.187
Hi! As you read on the title today I'm going to try some takoyaki flavored chips, here they are.

00:00:06.187 --> 00:00:14.200
If you don’t know what takoyaki is, they’re basically balls that are made with a flour based dough and inside they have octopus.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:22.125
And they’re very traditional in Japan, sadly I’ve never tried them but id’ love too.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.089
Hope I can try them soon.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.862
But even so I wanted to make this video to show this snack.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.315
As always I’ll show you a close-up of the packaging how they look and then I’ll try them, tell you how they are and my opinion.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:41.806
Here you can see the packaging it’s super funny and it has some a cute octopus on it.

00:00:41.806 --> 00:00:46.370
And this would be how the real takoyaki dish looks.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.534
But our chips are going to look like these.

00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:57.345
In the back there’s a small drawing of the same octopus and I think it says that you can eat them with mayonnaise.

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:04.228
And it supposedly makes them taste better. I don’t read Japanese I’m just making up and idea.

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:07.234
But it may be something like that.

00:01:07.234 --> 00:01:09.246
I’m going to open them and I’ll show you.

00:01:09.246 --> 00:01:12.467
These are our “takoyaki balls”.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:16.747
They’re really airy and here you can see one.

00:01:16.747 --> 00:01:19.788
So I’ll try them and see how they are.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:23.333
You just saw the package and I think the design is super cute with that octopus.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:26.539
Really really cute so now I’ll try them.

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.782
They smell really good, I don’t really know how to describe the smell.

00:01:30.782 --> 00:01:39.376
But they smell amazing, there’s a slight hint of nori seaweed and octopus but you can’t really tell and also smells a lot like spices.

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:42.860
So I’m going to try one and I’ll tell you how they are.

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:53.610
The chips are super crunchy really good the texture reminds me of Cheetos.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:02:01.380
Really crunchy again, and the flavor I don’t know why but it reminds me of BBQ sauce.

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:07.030
But it’s not strong flavors just that touch of spices, really nice.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.858
They remind me of some Cheetos but I don’t know exactly what kind.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:15.768
But they’re amazing I didn’t think they would be so good.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:26.787
In fact is the real takoyaki taste that good I’m going to get addicted to it first time I try it because oh my god.

00:02:26.787 --> 00:02:28.995
Really good.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:36.900
And what I told you about putting mayo on them I’m not going to do that.

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:43.350
But that’s because Japanese mayo is really different from what we have here.

00:02:43.354 --> 00:02:47.667
So the flavor won’t be the same and I don’t know how they will taste with the one that I have.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:53.180
But sincerely I don’t think it’s a really crazy idea, in fact I think that they may taste good.

00:02:53.185 --> 00:03:01.387
So in general I loved this snack, really good.

00:03:01.387 --> 00:03:05.388
Amazing flavor.

00:03:05.388 --> 00:03:08.300
And I totally recommend it if you can get it.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.128
It may a little bit difficult because well it’s from Japan.

00:03:14.128 --> 00:03:19.100
And if you aren’t there or you can’t buy them online well.

00:03:19.101 --> 00:03:23.380
If you have the opportunity go for it I recommend it a lot.

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:29.257
In my case I got them in a subscription box from the website Freedom Japanese Market.

00:03:29.257 --> 00:03:31.900
That I totally recommend too because they’re amazing.

00:03:31.905 --> 00:03:34.500
And I’m going to leave as always the link in the description box.

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:39.340
I’d love to know in the comments if you’ve ever tried real takoyaki.

00:03:39.343 --> 00:03:43.067
If so did you like it or if not do you want to try it?

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:45.870
And also if you’d try this chips here.

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.246
I did it and loved them.

00:03:48.246 --> 00:03:51.257
So nothing else to say about this.

00:03:51.257 --> 00:03:53.447
Thank you very much for watching as always.

00:03:53.447 --> 00:03:57.090
And I hope to see you in me next Candy Time video, bye!
