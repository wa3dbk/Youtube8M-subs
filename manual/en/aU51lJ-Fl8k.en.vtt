00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.580
This decidedly R-rated comedy from director
Nicholas Stoller was produced on an $18 million

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.969
dollar budget, and is well on its way to earning
ten times that amount at the box office.

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.140
Perpetually stoner Seth Rogan stars as a young
family mad, struggle to raise a newborn baby

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.689
with his sexy Australian wife Rose Byrne after
a rowdy fraternity move in to the house next

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.689
door.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.909
All grown up from his 'High School Musical'
days, the ridiculously toned Zac Efron is

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.740
featured opposite as the vengeful leader of
the frat, hell bent on making the wholesome

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.070
family's life a living hell after they were
forced to file a noise-complaint against him,

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.140
and his rambunctious college friends.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.140
Rogan is, well...

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.840
Rogan... as charming and funny as ever, but
still extremely limited and predictable in

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.620
the acting category, showing us the exact
same beats and dramatic turns we've seen from

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.070
him dozens of times before.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.400
Efron plays a more nuanced role, and the 97-minute
plot eventually hints that there's more to

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.380
his motivation than endless partying, sadly,
this thread is left without a really strong

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.380
resolution.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.110
Byrne however is easily the strongest member
of this picture, really showcasing a depth

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.440
and perseverance to her character that anchors
the nonsense on screen.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.960
She later defends her decisions by saying,
"Just because I'm a mom doesn't mean I know

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.960
what's best."

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.670
Although the movie is actually funnier during
the quieter moments, it's the blitzkrieg-like

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.700
editing during the party sequences where it
really shines.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.580
Frantically cutting between dozens of interestingly
shot angles, all beautifully lit with neon

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.700
colors and black lights, these montages are
perhaps the most visually interesting and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.060
hypnotic parties ever produced on film.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.259
When it comes time for actual substance though,
the well-paced experience thankfully does

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.639
a good job establishing the characters, and
importance of their goals: it's just unfortunate

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:32.929
everything is a bit familiar.

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.479
Well, with one exception...

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.810
I can't recall ever seeing a couple of dudes
swordfight with foot-long dildos before, so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.439
the movie's got that going for it.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.469
Fans of gross-out humor and sophomoric jokes,
or just Seth Rogan will be right at home with

00:01:44.469 --> 00:02:03.780
this picture: a capable and hilarious modern-day
college comedy.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:24.030
An amoral and forgettable experience saved
by its talented and attractive cast, this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.830
is an enjoyable, if somewhat pointless and
unrealistic experience I probably won't need

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.320
to watch again for years.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.380
"Neighbors", "Fleeting tomfoolery with raunchy
laughs."

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:46.420
Here's what you had to say in the YouTube
comments.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.670
Our scores for "Neighbors", two SEVENs.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.930
Recognizing its flaws and familiarity, you
still enjoyed the adult-humor enough to score

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.290
this a COOL.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.420
Believable characters in some less-than-believable
situations made this an entertaining picture,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.180
but I can't help but wonder: is the PG-13
rated comedy dead?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.700
Sure, watching a toddler mistakenly eat a
condom is funny... but is grossing-out audiences

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.910
the only way to score laughs these days?

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.280
I certainly hope not.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.120
Anyway, I thought this movie was COOL too.
