00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.609
&gt;&gt; Court: This is the Pedego
Interceptor. It's one of the more powerful

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.440
Pedego Cruiser style bikes, it's kind of an
update from the Cruiser and where it's updated

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.609
is really in the motor. We've got a nice 500
watt geared rear hub motor. The gearing makes

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.660
it a little smaller, a littler lighter but
you're still getting that extra power and

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.080
then the battery pack. So that's actually
a 48 volt 10 amp hour pack and its been redesigned

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.509
so this is actually the newer model for 2014
and its got quite a few little updates. I'm

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.940
just going to cruise right through and call
those out. So you'll notice this rear rack

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.519
now fully encloses the battery pack and it's
this nice plastic design with a built in rear

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.179
light. It's super cool, you can actually see
how much battery is left and turn on the rear

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:53.449
light directly on the battery pack, that's
awesome. Also, you'll notice there's this

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.329
beautiful front LED light so if you're cruising
around and you want to light it up, just press

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.219
this top button here and it lights up the
front and it turns on the backlight display

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:09.450
which is really nice if it's evening or whatnot.
And they've added this cool little bell. I

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.469
really like that, it's just, you know, a super
clean cockpit on this bike. All in all it's

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.429
a fun bike to ride and actually, the seating
position is such that, you know, it's a cruiser

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.939
style. The handles are swept back, really
easy to grab.You're upright and your head

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.170
is looking up. You've got that big seat so
it's soft, and its actually got a little shock

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.159
built in and these little rubber bumpers.
So when you add those to these nice big Schwalbe

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.850
tires right here, Fat Franks, you've actually
got a really smooth ride. And, I love the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.829
fact that these come with pre-Slimed tubes
and the tires themselves are Kevlar lined

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.229
because, you know, when you're riding something
like this around, it's no fun to get a flat

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.289
and these are actually really puncture resistant
and if they do get the flat you know you've

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.319
got the Slime to kind of keep you, tide you
over for a little while. So this is a seven

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.359
speed, which is kind of nice. You've got seven
speeds to choose from there in the rear. Twist

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:08.359
right here, you just change gears. derailleur,
Shimano Acera. So, pretty standard equipment,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.230
kind of functions like a regular bike that
way and love that they've included the, you've

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.819
got the little chain guard, keeps your pants
and everything clean if you're cruising around.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.239
So this has a lot of the same benefits as
the standard Cruiser bikes from Pedego but

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.340
the other big upgrade that you're looking
at here is it offers pedal assist and twist

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.379
throttle mode. On a lot of the other cruiser
bikes, you know you've got the twist throttle,

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.180
and you know, that's nice because you're cruising
around like a, kind of like a scooter, you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.909
know it's relaxing, pedal if you want to.
With this one they've kind of upgraded it

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.420
so you've also got pedal assist and that's
going to help extend your range or if you're

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.299
climbing a hill or something like that. And
to activate that, if you can see back here,

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.390
there's these little metal dots. It uses a
pedelec sensor so as the crank arms turn like

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.230
this it activates the motor and that's where
you get the boost. And there are five levels.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.840
So let me just pull this up, you press the
power button. It kind of lights up and you

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.920
can actually see your speed here, its got
an odometer, a trip odometer and overall life

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.250
odometer. Your power level on the battery
pack symbol there and then five levels. So

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.610
to use the twist throttle you leave it in
zero. Otherwise you kind of use the plus button

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.019
and get it up to five. The higher it goes,
of course the more power you're going to get

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.209
but you're also going to drain the battery
a little bit quicker. And when you're cruising

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.870
along at that top speed it's awesome to have
big disc brakes. So this has these nice big

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.870
180mm discs right here, front and rear, Avid,
pretty solid stuff. So this is a fun bike,

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.159
again for someone who's maybe a little bit
bigger, enjoys kind of that relaxed seating

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.510
position and cruising along. Maybe you're
at the beach like today and you know, you

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.359
just want to hang loose, but you like that
extra little boost. This is going to be perfect

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.650
for you. And then the fact that it's upgraded
to a 48 volt battery, 10 amp hour. That's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.109
just going to give you even more torque, even
more power than one of the 36 volt batteries

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:13.349
on the standard Cruisers. So, let's hop on
and take it for a test ride. I've actually

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.220
got it in pedal assist mode here. There we
go, we're going to go to three. I'm going

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.220
to hold the camera back there, you can kind
of listen for the motor. [motor sounds] This

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:34.780
bike just takes off and again that's because
of that giant 500 watt geared hub motor combined

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.790
with a 48 volt pack. Now you can see the display
a little bit better. Let's actually take it

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:50.790
to five. Woo! And it just gets you going,
super fast. There's those brakes. So that's

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.680
it, this is a really well rounded bike. Um,
beyond the technology itself, Pedego is really

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.230
well known for supporting their dealers. If
any problems happen with the bike they swap

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:15.230
it out really quick for you. Um, just offer
a lot of, I don't know, it's a great brand.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.440
One that feels fun, you get to pick the colors
you want and kind of have your bike custom

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.750
made. So the frame, the rims, everything.
And, the way that they've been innovating

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.880
on their products by adding that new rack,
kind of updating the kickstand. I didn't mention

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.960
that before but this is an improvement in
my mind over the last one. And just fine tuning

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.760
this thing. Its not just once a year, they
actually, on the fly, are kind of updating

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.760
everything and adding that little bell. Yeah,
and that is the new Pedego Interceptor II.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:52.330
Wow! For the full written review on this and
other electric bikes, check out ElectricBikeReview.com

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.530
and I've got to say, I love the fact that
they've got the bottle cage mounts right here

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.590
too, so it's a pretty complete bike. I'll
see you there.
