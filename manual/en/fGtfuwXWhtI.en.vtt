00:00:08.033 --> 00:00:11.066
Mr. Carney:
Dobro pozhalovat
to West Wing Week.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.400
Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.734
your guide to everything
that's happening

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:17.266
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue --
and points east.

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.567
This week the President
represented the United States

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:22.500
at the G20 Summit in
St. Petersburg, Russia.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.133
He addressed the nation on
the ongoing crisis in Syria

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.667
and marked the 12th anniversary
of September 11th

00:00:27.667 --> 00:00:28.934
at the Pentagon,

00:00:28.934 --> 00:00:30.233
while the Vice President highlighted

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:31.967
infrastructure improvements

00:00:31.967 --> 00:00:34.233
and the First Lady traveled
to Watertown, Wisconsin,

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.433
to ask Americans
to drink more water.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.200
That's September 6th
to September 12th, or...

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.533
"My Fellow Americans."

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.100
The President started off
this West Wing Week

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.033
at his seventh G20 meeting,

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.400
this one being held
in St. Petersburg,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.934
where leaders of the world's
largest economies converged

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.533
and consulted on their
shared interests in growth,

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.233
job creation,
and financial stability.

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.500
The President met separately
for bilateral meetings

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.233
with President Xi of China and
President Hollande of France.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.633
Then, he made his way
to briefing hall 5.3

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:07.600
to hold a news conference and
take questions from journalists,

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.367
and discuss the work
of this year's summit.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:14.300
The President:
There are times where
we have to make hard choices

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.000
if we're going to stand up
for the things we care about.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.333
Narrator:
Then, before leaving Russia,

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.166
the President sat
down for a round table

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.433
with an august group 
of community organizers,

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:24.100
who are advocates
for civil rights

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.233
and democracy
in their home country.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:28.567
The President:
Good government is making
sure that we're creating

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:31.834
a space for civil society
to function effectively.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:34.533
Narrator:
Meanwhile, eight time zones
away in Washington, D.C.,

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.433
school was back in session.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:38.667
The First Lady joined
athletes Shaquille O'Neal,

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.667
Allyson Felix,
and Dominique Dawes

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:43.633
to highlight the Let's Move
Active Schools Program,

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:46.133
which incorporates
physical activity before,

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:50.166
during, and after school for
at least 60 minutes a day.

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:51.934
On Monday the
Vice President traveled

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:53.266
to the Port of Baltimore

00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:56.500
to highlight a $10 million
TIGER Grant to expand the port

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.934
and deepen a key
navigation channel.

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:01.000
Infrastructure improvements
like this are all part

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.233
of the President's Better
Bargain for the Middle Class,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:05.033
and this one takes
advantage of the new,

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.867
larger container ships that
will soon be passing through

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:10.900
the Panama Canal that will
ultimately improve productivity,

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.133
increase cargo storage capacity,

00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:15.400
and create jobs
for American workers.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.300
The Vice President:
Manufacturing is coming
back to the United States.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.600
Narrator:
Back in the Blue Room,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.033
the President sat down
for interviews with anchors

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:22.834
from six television networks:

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:31.133
NBC, CNN, CBS,
Fox, ABC, and PBS.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:33.233
On Tuesday, the President
traveled to the Capitol

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.367
to meet with
the Senate Democratic Caucus

00:02:35.367 --> 00:02:37.633
and the Senate
Republican Conference.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:41.967
Then, that evening at
precisely 9:01 and 30 seconds,

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:43.567
the President went on the air

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:46.233
to address the nation about 
the debate that's been taking place

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:49.133
in Congress and across
the country about Syria,

00:02:49.133 --> 00:02:51.834
why it matters,
and where we go from here.

00:02:51.834 --> 00:02:54.934
The President:
America is not
the world's policeman.

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:57.567
Terrible things
happen across the globe

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:01.834
and it is beyond our means
to right every wrong,

00:03:01.834 --> 00:03:05.000
but when with modest
effort and risk

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.333
we can stop children
from being gassed to death,

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.467
and thereby make
our own children safer

00:03:10.467 --> 00:03:12.100
over the long run,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.667
I believe we should act.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.633
Narrator:
On Wednesday the President,
the Vice President,

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:21.066
the First Lady, Dr. Jill Biden,
and White House staff

00:03:21.066 --> 00:03:23.266
observed a moment of
silence on the South Lawn

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:26.333
to mark the 12th anniversary
of the 9/11 attacks.

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:27.800
Then, the President attended

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.700
a September 11th
observance ceremony

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.400
at the Pentagon Memorial.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.233
The President:
They left this earth,

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:34.700
they slipped from our grasp,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.300
but it was written,

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.667
"What the heart has once owned
and had, it shall never lose."

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:43.033
Narrator:
The President then traveled
to the Northeast DC headquarters

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:44.467
of Food and Friends,

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:47.567
which provides meals to
people with serious illnesses.

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:50.200
He volunteered to help bag some
groceries and commemorated

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.800
the September 11th National Day
of Service and Remembrance.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.900
The President:
I'm apples and bread.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.200
I can handle that.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.967
Narrator:
Meanwhile, the First Lady
traveled to Fort Belvoir,

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.834
where she visited
with military families

00:04:00.834 --> 00:04:03.433
at the new USO
Warrior and Family Center.

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.900
The largest center
in USO history,

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.800
it supports wounded,
ill, and injured troops

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.734
as well as their families.

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:11.700
She also visited
Intrepid Spirit I,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.667
the first of nine
satellite centers

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.934
of the National Intrepid
Center of Excellence,

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:18.333
which provides care
to service members and veterans

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:22.633
who suffer from TBI, PTSD,
and other related conditions.

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:24.266
That evening
at the Naval Observatory

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:26.734
the Vice President and Dr. Biden 
hosted a barbeque

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.767
to honor wounded warriors
and their families.

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:31.867
On Thursday, the President
convened a cabinet meeting

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:33.066
to receive an update

00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:34.700
on the second term
domestic policy agenda,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.867
including issues such
as immigration reform,

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:39.900
the Affordable Care Act,
and his climate action plan.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.100
Meanwhile,
the First Lady traveled

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.433
to Watertown, Wisconsin,

00:04:42.433 --> 00:04:44.400
where she launched
a new nation-wide effort

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.500
to encourage Americans
to drink more water.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.633
She's bringing together leaders
from industry, entertainment,

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:52.567
media, and government under
the simple message that water

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:54.400
is one of the best
and easiest choices

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.500
every one of us
can make every day.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.233
To find out more information
on any of these topics,

00:04:58.233 --> 00:04:59.533

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.934
- Do we get one
without the hairnet?

00:05:07.934 --> 00:05:10.166
[laughter]

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:13.767
Okay, one without the hairnet.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:15.867
I'm a whiner, I know.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.000
The President:
That's a reasonable request.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.433
- You'll send us the one
with the hairnet.
