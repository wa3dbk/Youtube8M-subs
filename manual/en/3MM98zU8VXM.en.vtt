Hey guys, today I am two years post Top surgery

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.450
I have not made a top surgery update since my last year my first year post-op last year, whatever

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.090
Because I mean there's nothing really to say I mean

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
I'm not that's not sure I made like a nip update like two months ago. That was good

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
I guess I didn't make an update because really like nothing has changed in my opinion

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.279
I maybe my scars have faded more, but let's put the camera down and have a look-see all right so once again

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.579
You're gonna get a great view of like the litter box and like the TV and stuff, but yeah

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.520
So this is my chest two years post-op. I had a chest surgery Top surgery with

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.189
Dr. Garramone in Florida

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.980
on may 30th

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:42.969
2013

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.969
To be honest it doesn't feel like it's been

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.730
two years it feels like maybe

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.968
Maybe a year, maybe six months like it's very weird my five years on T is actually coming up in like two weeks

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.530
And that's just insane to me

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
It does not feel like it's been five years. Transition wise it's weird the time is going by so quickly, but yeah

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.239
So this is my chest here. I'm happy with it. I I definitely said in the past videos for my like the first year of

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.379
Healing that I wish that my scars had been just a little bit higher

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.790
But that's just because I'm like super picky and I don't know that that's how I had imagined it

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.669
But I like my chest I have I don't have any complaints

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.299
I'm lying when I say that obviously but I'm you know it's all about being positive. I wish that my scars here would have

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.489
Stretched out as much as they did, but I am right-handed and they did use this side a lot even though

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.430
I was really careful

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.499
I'm not gonna go into like what I did in my first year because you guys can look at the first video for that

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.430
But in the last year. I don't think that nothing really has changed

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.849
I have lost some weight, so I think that there's just a little bit of extra skin

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.610
but with some working out, I will definitely be able to

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.869
tighten them up

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.430
I don't have any dog ears

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.939
I know that it may be in this angle this might look like dog ears just as the cameras like very it's like a weird

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.689
Weird the angles yes if you wanted like a side

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.349
This is like the worst time ever to make a video about top surgery because if I show you my stomach

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.390
I just I just ate like the biggest meal ever oh my god. Yes. Oh my chest super fly super

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.920
Happy in the last year

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.929
I think the only thing that I've noticed is the sensitivity

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.929
Under here has gotten like it's increased like crazy and by that I mean like it's really really sensitive

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.140
Sometimes it hurts to touch, but I mean I guess its normal

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.560
It's weird my nipples

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.929
It's weird also, I don't know that explain the feeling it's like if you know what

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.340
I don't know if anybody else feels it like this like I feel it, or I feel the stitches

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.259
But I don't know it's like I would have to take something else that's not part of my body to touch it just to see

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.000
If it was actually different or not, but yeah

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.130
So instead of this being more like a two year update video on my chest. I really just wanted to talk about

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.769
the freedom I've

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.499
gained from having top surgery

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.369
And I know it's hard to talk about this or to hear this if you haven't had Top surgery

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.939
And I do feel really bad sometimes when I talk about it

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.889
But I do want to talk about my own experiences with top surgery it took me a long time to get here

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.010
I

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.420
Had actually scheduled my top surgery for 2012 but ended up deciding to wait a year which I don't regret

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.649
I very happy that I did do that, but I do feel that because I've had Top surgery

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.589
I am extremely lucky, and I know this I know that I'm lucky

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.929
I know this and I'm very I have a privilege to be able to have money to

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.869
Go to Florida and have my own surgery, but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.849
It's weird because you come to a point where you don't think about it anymore

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:41.199
And it's really weird cuz I don't remember what it's like to have chests. Boobs. Titties. like it's I don't

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.369
Like I remember it and I look at old pictures of me in like a binder, and it's like

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:47.446
how weird

00:03:47.446 --> 00:03:48.190
is that

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.050
Like I don't know. It's just very strange. I just feel a lot better about my body honestly

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.330
This doesn't really have to do a top surgery

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.880
But I did gain a lot of weight last semester and by last semester I guess two semesters ago now. In the fall

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.869
A lot of weight and that made me really self-conscious about my chest not because like my chest was getting bigger

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.240
But like I could feel that there was fat going around here, and my stomach was getting bigger

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.249
And I just did not feel comfortable or confident at all and I started running and in my videos

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.359
I mean I feel like I'm repeating myself, but I did really like, not conquer dysphoria

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.220
but it helped my dysphoria like crazy to start running and it also helped my

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.090
How I feel about my chest and about my body

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.170
And it's like I'm so much more comfortable now that I don't have to think about Top surgery

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.319
I'm able to or like my chest or anything like that

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.480
I'm able to concentrate on other things that are not trans related to make my body feel better

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.709
So it's not dysphoria anymore, chest wise. It's just

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.769
Feeling like my body is my own

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.730
And I've never felt like my body is my own more than I have since I've had Top surgery

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:01.000
I feel like I have complete control over this physical being. Emotional, that's another story, but physical

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.500
It's me and I feel like I finally like my authentic body like

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.520
Top surgery I'm talking about. Bottom surgery and bottom dysphoria

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.020
is like a different topic right now

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:17.979
but top wise, I feel like I'm finally living the top that I was supposed to have. I know that sounds ridiculous

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.580
but that's all that I

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.999
you know, that's all that I feel and this video is really not like those other like this is my five year and like my

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.120
My like three year

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.850
on T or when you're post op. Like, my one year post-op video is really great compared to this

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.029
Boring video where I'm just talking, but I do feel

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.810
Like with top surgery it

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.540
it equalled freedom to me

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:47.260
and it's great because a lot of people that I know right now are getting top surgery. My roommate just got Top surgery and

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.200
by Garamone also. Like last week, it's great, and I do feel bad for people who haven't had Top surgery yet

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.529
But it will happen one day. I waited a long time

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.660
I did wait one year because when I said like I scheduled in 2012 that's not how long I waited

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.419
I knew I was trans since I was like 15 and wanted it so

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.580
And I got it when I was like 22

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.030
So it does it took me a long time some people it doesn't even take him that long

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.269
but that's my story we all have a different story and

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.750
That's all so yeah. This is my chest two years post up

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:22.750
I don't know if I have anything else to say I feel really boring and like all you could really talk about it like

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.669
Sensation nipples and stars right I have I used anything else on my scars. I use the Alex Haney's

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.630
Scar cream stuff. I'll post a link. I made a video about it a while ago, but its like on sale again and

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:42.910
Yeah, I'm happy. My nipple. This one is still to me the most beautiful nipple that I've ever liked it to me

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.320
It's my it looks like my favorite nipple right so let me just like get that down so you I don't know

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.529
I just like it cuz it pops out I always talk about this nipple

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.720
It's the left nip it's the good nip and apparently if you know me

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.829
there's the curse of the bad nip so you're gonna end up having a bad nip if you know me like it doesn't matter if

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.450
You're trans or anything this one. It's my bad

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.260
Nip just cuz it's a little flat, but I've learned to like accept. It learn to embrace it. I actually wanted to have surgery to

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.200
I told myself in the future

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:08.940
actually

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.850
I think I said after two years post-op or

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:16.539
five years.If I feel dysphoric about my nipple cuz it doesn't pop out as much as I'd like it then I would get

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:20.979
A revision, but then I heard I know somebody who had a revision on the nipple to get it popped out

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:24.279
And it still didn't work as well, so you know what I'm just going to learn to accept

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.829
It learn to embrace my body. This is the body that I

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:33.369
I'm okay with now and that's great, and we're just talking about the top go ahead - yawn there. That was rude anyways

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.560
That's all I have to say if you have any questions about my top surgery. I will

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.959
Definitely answer them if you want to know how much it cost in u.s.. Dollars for me

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:45.700
It was $5,900 because I had scheduled it before they changed the price

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:50.369
I think the price may now be $6,500 American dollars, though

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.540
And the Canadian dollars are really low right now, so that ends up being like something like $8,000 or just insane

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.800
We have any questions about my top surgery. Go ahead and ask I don't mind and don't forget to

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:07.890
Yeah, I don't know what am I saying? I like doing this because it looks like it's a happy face like hi. I'm happy
