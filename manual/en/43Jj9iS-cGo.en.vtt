Stephanie Manley: Hi!

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.460
This is Stephanie Manley and you know me from
Copykat.com.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.380
But today I'm working my way through my old
Home Economics book from junior high school

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.830
to where I can teach you how to cook just
how I was taught how to cook.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.050
And today we're making French Toast, and it's
very very easy to make.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.579
And everyone, or practically everyone has
some left over bread and an egg and some milk.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.579
And guess what!

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.390
That's all you need to make a nice breakfast,
or lunch, doesn't matter.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.620
Okay, so I'm using a griddle here.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.350
Now, if you don't have one you can use a skillet,
that's going to work just as well.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.679
But I'm using my griddle, because I love being
able to make so many pieces at once.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.840
This is really really easy to do, you need
a few ingredients, not too many.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.570
You need bread, we're going to use a quarter
cup of milk.

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.200
Now, ideally you should try to measure liquid
ingredients in a liquid measuring cup because

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.130
they're more accurate this way.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.210
If you don't have one, that's okay, but if
you do, grab that one.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.070
We're going to use one egg.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.869
Now, I'm using a large egg, if you only have
small eggs, you might want to use a couple,

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:32.899
but just one egg.

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.190
We need just a little bit of salt because
that helps everything taste a little bit better.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.330
We're going to use sugar because this recipe
was developed a long time ago when we used

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.680
to stick sugar in everything.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.939
No, actually sugar is pretty good in here.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.540
And, just a sprinkle of cinnamon if you like,
that's going to add some great flavor.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.200
So, let me tell you what we're going to do.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.329
We're simply going to take our egg, we're
going to crack it in our bowl and we're just

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.770
going to beat it up.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:11.110
Then, we're going to add in our milk and we're
going to continue to beat this all together.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:18.660
And you want to beat it until it's all nice
and creamy and yellow.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:28.330
And at this point, we're going to add one
tablespoon of sugar, this makes it taste really

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.330
good.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.250
And we're going to add just a little bit of
salt.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.860
If you have a measuring thing, you might want
to use about a quarter of teaspoon of salt,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.050
you don't need hardly any at all.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.740
And then we need just a sprinkle of cinnamon.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.130
And if you want to measure it, about a quarter
of a teaspoon of cinnamon should be plenty.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.850
All right, and we're just going to continue
to whisk this in here together.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.620
Now, before I cook anything on the griddle,
I'm just going to put down a little bit of

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:03.620
butter.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.570
If you have non-stick spray, that'll also
work.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:16.030
And we're just going to put our butter on
the griddle, so our bread won't stick.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:26.350
Then all you need to do is take your bread
and dip it in, then dip it in, you don't need

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.860
for it to soak in or anything like that.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.400
And you're just going to put it on the griddle,
just like that.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:45.700
Okay, and you're just going to let these cook
for about two, two and a half minutes on each

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.590
side, they'll get nice and golden brown.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.600
Now, if it's cooking faster than that, turn
down your heat because it's up too high.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.680
If you're using just a regular electric stove
or a gas stove, I would put it on between

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.090
low and medium, so it doesn't cook too fast,
nobody likes burnt French toast.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.060
So after about another minute or so, we're
going to flip these over and let them cook

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.700
on the other side.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.489
So we flipped over our French toast and it's
cooked now on the second side for a couple

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.489
of minutes.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.930
And now I'm just going to go ahead and take
these off.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:30.810
And here you go, you have a great big stack
of French toast, and wasn't that easy to make!

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.750
So please give this video a big thumbs up.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.970
And if you're learning how to cook, maybe
a comment down below and tell me what you'd

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.480
like to cook and I will help you learn how
to cook that recipe.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.100
Thanks for watching!
