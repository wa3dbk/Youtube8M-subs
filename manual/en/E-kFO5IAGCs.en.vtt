Please make sure that your TV is unplugged,
and that you are protected from static electricity.

There are various ways to eliminate static
electricity,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.470

wrist strap.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.470

the location and orientation of the parts

this tutorial as much as needed.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.470
materials:
A pair of latex gloves.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.470
Your ShopJimmy.com replacement Main Board.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.470
A pair of needle-nose pliers.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.470

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.470
And a cup to hold all screws, clips, and any
other small items.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.470
So let's get to it shall we?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.500
Locate your TVs identification label and take
note of the brand name model number, serial

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.840

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.750

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.730

inputs and outputs and houses the TV tuner.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.620

by hand.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.100
Using your finger, flip up the tab on the
ribbon connector and gently remove the ribbon.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.590
Please do not use a screwdriver to open ribbon
connectors as it can cause damage to the pins.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:27.390

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.390
