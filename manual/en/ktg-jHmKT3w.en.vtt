00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.400
The moon is burning in the sky 
And I am burning with love

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.340
The fire that is consumed 
Like my heart

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.540
My soul cry, painfully

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.060
I'm not at peace 
What a terrible night

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.320
The time passes, but there is no dawn

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.200
There is no sunshine, if she doesn't return

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.440
My earth is burning and my heart is burning

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.860
What she thirsts for water
I thirst for love

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.280
Who will I sing 
My song to

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.580
If there is no one 
Who shows herself 
On the balcony
