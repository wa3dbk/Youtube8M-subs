Hi everyone, Gio here, and as promised

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:03.920
and as promised we're back to gaming.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.720
This time Top 5 Puzzle Games!

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.050
1010! is a Tetris-wannabe that delivers just
one straight-forward, but nevertheless entertaining

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.329
experience.
The concept is still the same from the original

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.829
russian game from 1984: you have to manipulate
colored blocks to fill an entire row or column.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.559
As soon as you fill one, it disappears. Go
out of space, and you lose the game.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.969
However, differing from the original title,
you dispose of three pieces at a time, and

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.680
there are no time limits.
Variety is close to nothing, but at least

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.600
for me the game has really been fun.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.829
If you've tried its predecessor, Two Dots
won't disappoint. The mechanics of the game

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.229
are still the same, but this time you'll have
to complete different tasks and configurations

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.200
to go on with the levels. The graphics are
overall more captivating, and I'm really loving

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.289
the sound of this game.
The gameplay is once again really basic: you

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.389
can link dots both horizontally and vertically,
plus some little extras that happen when you

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:24.520
complete a square, but nothing more.
The difficulty progresses together with the

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.179
levels, but you'll get some help here and
there, so totally recommended to everyone.

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.340
If you play this game and you constantly think
about 2048, you're not alone.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.380
However, I've found it actually more difficult
than 2048: the point is to re-unite tiles

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.289
that share the same number to make the next
one, and repeat until you get ten.

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.700
Here more than elsewhere you'll probably regret
bad decisions, as they tend to add up pretty

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.380
fast.
Again, variability is close to none, but it's

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.200
an entertaining game if you need something
quick.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.520
Think what you want about the graphics, but
I love Flow.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.429
Let me explain how this works: in every scenario
you have 5 or more couples of dots of the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.439
same color, and you have to link them while
filling up the whole screen. Also, don't cross

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:17.180
the streams. *Ghost-Busters*
The levels become pretty complex pretty soon,

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.650
and the cool thing is you have literally tons
of them.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.120
Besides the standard mode, you also have a
Time Trial mode that is especially enjoyable

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.709
once you've reached some level of expertise.
At least for me, this game has revealed addicting,

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.180
so be careful.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.829
This is probably the most original of the
bunch.

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.840
In every level you start with a single colored
tile at the top-left corner, and you then

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.379
have to conquer the whole setup with one color,
using one at a time.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.299
Besides having different scenarios, you also
have different modes like the Daily Challenge

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.159
and the Multiplayer mode, both against the
AI and a human counterpart.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.519
If I had to pick just one among these five,
this would probably be it.
