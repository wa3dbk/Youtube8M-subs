Hey everyone, welcome to the Patch Preview. It’s been a busy patch for us here at Riot, so Tamat and Morello can’t make it out this time, but I wanted to give you all a taste of what’s in store.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
First up, we’ve completed the Alistar remake. We’re updating his Headbutt and Pulverize to have level-up incentives other than just damage.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Also, he had a lot of problems farming and was a little too reliant on Flash and Ghost to get anything done, so we are fixing those issues, too.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We are increasing his base movement speed and mana in exchange for a little bit of health and attack damage.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He also has a new passive, Trample. Every time he casts an ability, he starts Trampling for a few seconds.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
While Trampling he walks through units and deals damage every second to nearby enemies.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:55.500
Headbutt and Pulverize now scale their cooldowns on level-up. Pulverize specifically has its stun shortened by a half second but the spell’s radius is increased to compensate.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.500
Meanwhile, Headbutt can now target minions as well as champions.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Ultimately, Alistar can farm and gank a bit better, but doesn’t lock up entire teams for quite as long.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Fiddlesticks is also receiving some pretty big changes. He was too dependent on lucky Dark Wind bounces and Drain, so we are moving around some of his power to make him more consistent.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.500
First, his armor, movement speed, and Terrify’s cast range are increasing.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.000
For Drain, the amount of healing he receives at early levels is going down so players can harass him, but with the armor buff, his jungle should still be fine.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Dark Wind is getting a more significant tweak. Now it bounces 5 times at all levels, but the damage and cooldown scale with level. Additionally, the silence duration and AP ratio are going up.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Crowstorm’s base damage is going down by 25 at all ranks but gets an increased AP ratio, and now the cooldown gets better with level.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Gangplank has a big face-lift in store as well. We have a few different goals here.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:58.000
First, we want to completely remove the deny mechanic from Raise Morale, so it no longer targets a minion at all. To compensate, the Raise Morale buff itself is a lot stronger.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.500
Second, Parrrley wasn’t enough of a consistent damage tool and too much of a burst nuke, so the cooldown and base damage are lower, with the mana cost and bonus gold on kill modified to compensate.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Cannon Barrage was the last pain point, where the ability was either a huge success or a total flop.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.500
The area where cannonballs can fall is smaller and the entire zone slows now, regardless of whether enemies get hit at all.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.000
To compensate for this increased consistency, the slow and damage are going down little bit.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It’s now really good at blowing up enemies when your teammates can keep them in place for part of the duration.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We made a few changes to Xin Zhao as well. Ultimately, he was a bit too good of a duelist but died too quickly in larger fights. 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So we made the armor and magic resist buff on his ultimate scale with the number of enemy champions hit.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.500
This should give single opponents the ability to fight him while keeping him from melting in late-game fights.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:58.000
We also buffed up his base damage and the attack speed on Battle Cry plus making the passive component stay active while on cooldown so that he can jungle a bit faster as well.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Hopefully these changes should make him more consistent throughout the game.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
