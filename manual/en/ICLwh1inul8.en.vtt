Hey I’m Mridu Parikh. Welcome to LIO TV 
- the place to live a simple and happy life.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.720
And today we’re talkin kitchen hacks.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.460
I have five simple and cool ways for you to use ordinary items in extraordinary ways.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.380
It’s very fun - so lets get going.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:32.160
Awight, #1:The Lazy Susan. Which first of
all, can I just say, who named this thing?

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.800
Easy access to all your stuff does not sound
like much of all slacker or lazy to me?

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.360
But anyway, you probably know it can be used for spices or in a corner in your pantry for hard to reach stuff.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.780
But what about using it in your fridge?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.460
Ingenious right?!

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.160
You can use it for all your condiments or
even fruit or just things that you don’t want to get lost or forgotten about in the back of the fridge.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.600
I love it!

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
#2: Tension Rods.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.660
 I know you’re thinking like, 
what are these doing in the kitchen?

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.700
Let me show you couple cool ways you can use these.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.780
My favorito is under the sink so you can hang
your cleaners on it.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.500
Isn’t that a great idea?

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.880
I also love that in this photo, you’ll see
how tension rods were used to create compartments in this shelf

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.160
to separate lids, baking dishes
or cutting boards.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.560
Awesome!

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:34.120
#3: The Under Shelf Bin. I loves me these
babies because you can just slide them under a shelf where you’re wasting space.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.600
And you can use one of these and double your
space and storage. Like look at this.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.340
Wasted space. The double storage is the bomb!

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.220
Moving on to hack #4: Magnetic Holders.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
A great use for these is to put your spices
on them and then here’s the kicker,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.040
since they’re magnetic, you can stick them
to the side of your fridge.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.380
I know!!

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.900
So they save you tons of space in your drawers or cabinets, where ever you’d typically store your spices.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.980
And they’re convenient and accessible and
they look pretty cool too.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.340
And lastly #5: Use your everyday Magazine
Holders. But not for your magazines…

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.520
But for your foil and saran wrap and plastic
bags.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.280
I don’t know about you, but these things
are always falling over in my pantry - and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.220
if you have limited space - you can’t always
dedicate a whole drawer for them.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.660
So this is a really great way to keep them
from falling over and KEEP them contained and organized.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.100
Alrighty, so what did you think.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.860
Could you use any of these hacks in your kitchen?

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.460
Let me know because that is this weeks challenge
my friend!

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.900
AND I also know there are a million other
cool hacks you could be using

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.600
- so don’t keep all the awesomeness to yourself.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.040
Share the love in the comments and give me
and others some great ideas.
