00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.070
I'm going to blow your mind and the DNewsing
hasn't even DNewsed yet.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.599
Cashews are a fruit and peanuts are not even
nuts!

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:09.599
BOOOM.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:18.600
So what about all those other things we call
nuts?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.500
Sometimes you feel like DNews, sometimes not
so much.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
Hopefully today it's the former.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.170
I'm Trace, thanks for coming back!

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.040
According to botany, a TRUE nut is a shelled
pod containing a single edible kernel.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.460
So what is a true botanical nut, and what
isn't?

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.430
Have we been doing this all wrong?!

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.850
Okay, so, nuts are single seeds.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.950
Then there are drupes, which are like pits
or stones -- that thing at the center of a

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.260
peach.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.410
And then there are legumes… which are edible
seeds inside of seedpods -- think beans, peas,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.770
lentils and so on.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.230
So, armed with this knowledge, let's crack
this thing wide open!

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.690
My favorite alleged nut, is the cashew.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.350
The cashew is originally from Brazil, but
has spread to India, Vietnam and parts of

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.350
Africa.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.770
These delicious snacks are actually the seeds
of the cashew tree, which are attached to

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.460
the bottom of a fruit called a cashew apple!

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.680
Its the seed in the center of a fruit and
is therefore not a true nut, but a DRUPE!

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.150
Cashews grow inside a shell which contains
a very potent poison that causes rashes on

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.060
skin contact because the cashew tree is in
same botanical family as poison ivy and oak.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.500
This is why they're served shucked and roasted,
to get rid of that oil before people handle

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.500
them.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.799
Cashews aren't the only false nut; peanuts
account for 67 percent of all nut consumption

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.729
in the U.S. and they aren't even NUTS, they're
definitely a POD of SEEDS and thus a legume!

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.970
Peanuts are native to South America, though
have spread across the globe.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.540
The pod is the ovary of an 18 inch-tall oval-leaved
flowering plant; and it grows horizontally

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.270
underground.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.909
If cashews are fruit drupes, and peanuts are
legumes…

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.479
WHAT OTHER DELECTABLE LIES HAVE I BEEN FED?!

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.560
Almonds are seeds of the almond tree, and
are related to the peach and apricot.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.700
It grows at the center of a fruit: DRUPE.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.860
Coconuts are drupes!

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.319
Walnuts are drupes!

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.900
Chestnuts, *breathe* are nuts.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.700
Pecans are also nuts! native to Mexico and
the southern United States but it's now raised

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.440
in Israel, South Africa, Brazil, and Australia.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.060
It's a hickory fruit from a pecan tree and
wasn't commercially grown until the 1880s,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.170
making it a relatively new domesticated crop!

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.860
And so are hazelnuts.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.220
Hazelnuts also known as filberts or Kentish
cobnuts, ARE actually nuts and originate along

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.730
the Mediterranean stretching from Turkey to
Spain!

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.930
Nutella uses more than a quarter of the world
hazelnut supply annually; because of course

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.360
it does.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.320
In the end, it doesn't REALLY matter, though,
does it.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.190
The key difference between nuts, seeds, legumes
and drupes -- is legumes commonly come from

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.650
the fabaceae or leguminosae family.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.120
Brazil NUTS are part of the same family as
blueberries, cranberries and persimmons, and

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.849
grow in a giant fleshy pod… but they're
not of the legume family… so I don't actually

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.620
know WHAT athey are, but we know they're not
nuts.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.670
what a nut REALLY is, scientifically, is just
what I said at the top, a hard-coated seed

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.030
that usually grows alone...

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.800
Legumes come in groups, and drupes live in
the middle of fleshy fruits...

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.670
But let's be honest, Taxonomy and classification
was made up by humans, but we didn't name

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.629
things very consistently in english; and it's
made things even more complicated because

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:41.310
there's a culinary definition of "nut" too
-- which is why a package of peanuts will

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.300
say, "may contain nuts," when scientifically,
it doesn't contain a single one.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.950
Do you have a favorite nut?

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.700
Is your brain driving you nuts like mine is
after researching all this?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.190
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A BRAZIL NUT IS?!

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.140
