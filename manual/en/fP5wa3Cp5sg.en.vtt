00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.062
- Hey guys, so today you're being invited

00:00:02.062 --> 00:00:06.083
to a "digital" baby shower
for Joy Cho of Oh Joy!

00:00:06.083 --> 00:00:07.451
If you're not familiar with Joy,

00:00:07.451 --> 00:00:09.868
she is a fantastic lifestyle blogger,

00:00:09.868 --> 00:00:12.084
who also has a channel here on YouTube.

00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:13.795
So I encourage you to subscribe.

00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:15.235
You will love her videos.

00:00:15.235 --> 00:00:17.748
They are beautiful,
and she is so talented,

00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:20.716
and does all kinds of
things around DIY and home,

00:00:20.716 --> 00:00:22.801
and food as well as fashion.

00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:24.747
So she is expecting her second baby.

00:00:24.747 --> 00:00:27.189
So a few of my favorite
YouTube channels and I

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.601
decided to get together and
throw her a digital baby shower.

00:00:30.601 --> 00:00:31.945
So if you're expecting a baby,

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:33.537
or if you know somebody who is,

00:00:33.537 --> 00:00:34.514
you are in luck

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:36.604
because you're gonna
get some fantastic ideas

00:00:36.604 --> 00:00:37.982
from some of my favorite channels,

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:41.150
all around how to make a
baby shower extra special.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.983
So far my part,

00:00:41.983 --> 00:00:44.540
I'm gonna show you how
to create a very festive,

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.467
fancy fruit punch.

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.387
So here's the thing about baby showers.

00:00:48.387 --> 00:00:50.939
They can be a little
bit of a chaotic affair,

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:52.035
and here's why.

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.643
You have a bunch of guests
arriving at the same time,

00:00:54.643 --> 00:00:56.035
laden down with packages.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:57.723
Mixed with the fact that
a lot of these women

00:00:57.723 --> 00:00:59.259
may not know each other well.

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:01.187
Because you typically have coworkers,

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:02.458
mixed with family members,

00:01:02.458 --> 00:01:04.195
mixed with the occasional neighbor.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:06.123
They sort of arrive,
laden down with packages,

00:01:06.123 --> 00:01:07.268
they don't know what to do.

00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:09.331
And your job as hostess, I believe,

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.923
is to make everybody feel
comfortable right away.

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:13.667
That's why I am a firm believer

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.883
in the present, punch station.

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:16.859
Because what that does,

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.585
is it allows people to come in,

00:01:18.585 --> 00:01:19.969
set their present down,

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:21.361
get themselves a drink,

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:23.085
and immediately feel at home.

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:24.193
Everybody feels more comfortable

00:01:24.193 --> 00:01:26.019
with a drink in their hand, right?

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:26.924
And then as the host,

00:01:26.924 --> 00:01:29.098
you don't have to go around
making everybody drinks.

00:01:29.098 --> 00:01:31.803
You can actually spend your
time introducing everybody.

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:33.498
So it's really the way to go.

00:01:33.498 --> 00:01:36.339
So the first thing we're gonna
do is select a punch bowl.

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:39.226
Now I have this cake stand
that I have had for years,

00:01:39.226 --> 00:01:42.066
that actually doubles as a
punch bowl believe it or not.

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:42.981
It's the coolest thing.

00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:45.603
You take the pedestal,
it flips upside down,

00:01:45.603 --> 00:01:47.322
then you take the top to the cake stand,

00:01:47.322 --> 00:01:48.410
and it has a little knob.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.886
You flip that upside down,

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:51.917
and then it turns into a punch bowl.

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:53.197
This isn't something that I designed,

00:01:53.197 --> 00:01:54.912
it actually was made to do that.

00:01:54.912 --> 00:01:56.236
So if you're in the
market for a punch bowl,

00:01:56.236 --> 00:01:58.113
I've put the link in the description.

00:01:58.113 --> 00:02:00.041
Then you're gonna take out a Bundt pan

00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:01.937
that fits into the punch bowl.

00:02:01.937 --> 00:02:04.351
You wanna make sure that you
figure this out ahead of time.

00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:06.769
Because the Bundt pan is
what is going to create

00:02:06.769 --> 00:02:08.211
our block of ice that we are going

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.574
to put in the center of the punch bowl.

00:02:10.574 --> 00:02:11.902
So, whenever I serve punch,

00:02:11.902 --> 00:02:13.567
I wanna make sure that it's kept cold

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:15.214
throughout the duration of the party.

00:02:15.214 --> 00:02:16.953
And if you actually have
to run around and get ice

00:02:16.953 --> 00:02:18.885
for your punch, it just
is like one more step

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:20.805
that a busy hostess doesn't have time for.

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.397
So I love the ice block.

00:02:22.397 --> 00:02:24.797
Oftentimes you'll find ice
blocks made out of water,

00:02:24.797 --> 00:02:27.082
and that's fun, you know you
can do that too with ice.

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:29.001
But I find that then
waters down the punch.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:32.362
So we are gonna create our
ice block out of juice.

00:02:32.362 --> 00:02:34.628
So once you get a Bundt pan
that fits into your punch bowl,

00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:36.057
and you know you're good to go,

00:02:36.057 --> 00:02:38.515
we're gonna fill that up
three quarters of the way

00:02:38.515 --> 00:02:40.562
with grapefruit juice.

00:02:40.562 --> 00:02:43.080
Then to make our ice block a
little bit more decorative,

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.072
we are gonna place some herbs
and fruit into the juice,

00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:48.761
which will actually freeze
when the ice block forms,

00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:51.696
and will create a really
nice decorative effect.

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:55.768
So you can go ahead and add
four sprigs of fresh mint,

00:02:55.768 --> 00:02:58.425
about five or six whole strawberries.

00:02:58.425 --> 00:02:59.619
I like to keep the strawberries whole

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.925
because I think their
little green tops are pretty

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.619
shining through the ice
once it's actually formed.

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:05.452
And then you could also throw in

00:03:05.452 --> 00:03:08.666
about five to six fresh raspberries.

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:09.499
And at this point,

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:10.352
this all gonna be floating around

00:03:10.352 --> 00:03:11.530
and look like kind of a mess.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.442
That is okay.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:13.931
Because we are gonna take this whole thing

00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.570
and pop it in our freezer.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.066
Then once you get it in the freezer,

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:18.578
and the juice sort of settles down,

00:03:18.578 --> 00:03:19.649
and nothing's moving anymore,

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:21.031
you can go in with your hands

00:03:21.031 --> 00:03:23.247
and just reposition
the fruit and the herbs

00:03:23.247 --> 00:03:25.215
just to make sure that
it's well distributed.

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:27.152
'Cause remember it's
going to freeze this way.

00:03:27.152 --> 00:03:29.032
So if everything starts
to gather on one side,

00:03:29.032 --> 00:03:30.455
you're gonna end up with an ice block

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:31.652
with a bunch of fruit on one side.

00:03:31.652 --> 00:03:34.179
So just go ahead and spread it out evenly.

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:36.555
Now this does need to freeze overnight.

00:03:36.555 --> 00:03:38.851
So you do need to plan ahead.

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.029
This is a big block of ice,

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:42.731
and it's just gonna take
at least eight to 10 hours.

00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:45.835
So you're better off doing
it the day before the party.

00:03:45.835 --> 00:03:48.771
Then you wanna put your
punch bowl in position.

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:51.069
So wherever you're going
to place this punch

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.650
and present table, that's
where you wanna put this bowl.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.011
Because once you start
to put all the juice

00:03:55.011 --> 00:03:55.938
and the ice block in it,

00:03:55.938 --> 00:03:57.329
you don't wanna move it.

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.328
So make sure you do that first.

00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:01.425
Then you're gonna prepare a large bowl

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:03.613
with some warm water.

00:04:03.613 --> 00:04:05.897
Take your Bundt pan out of the freezer,

00:04:05.897 --> 00:04:07.992
and just place it resting in the water

00:04:07.992 --> 00:04:09.720
for about two to three minutes.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.585
Basically what that's gonna do

00:04:10.585 --> 00:04:12.408
is warm the bottom of this pan,

00:04:12.408 --> 00:04:14.608
and allow you to release this juice block.

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:16.755
It's gonna be a lot easier
to actually remove it

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:18.401
if it's a little bit loose.

00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:20.409
Then you can go ahead
and remove the ice ring

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.145
out of the Bundt pan,
into your punch bowl.

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:25.018
And you'll see all of that beautiful fruit

00:04:25.018 --> 00:04:27.696
and mint has frozen right inside.

00:04:27.696 --> 00:04:31.376
Then you're gonna add four
cups of fresh orange juice,

00:04:31.376 --> 00:04:35.638
and about a cup and a half of
lime flavored sparkling water.

00:04:35.638 --> 00:04:37.457
Now if you weren't doing
this punch for a baby shower,

00:04:37.457 --> 00:04:39.342
and you wanted to make
this punch alcoholic,

00:04:39.342 --> 00:04:41.904
you could add a cup and
a half of champagne.

00:04:41.904 --> 00:04:45.158
That would be really
fun for a bridal shower.

00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:46.486
There's something really
elegant and festive

00:04:46.486 --> 00:04:49.362
about drinking a punch out
of some type of stemware.

00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:50.784
And it also just feels really girly.

00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:53.376
I think baby showers bring out
the girliness in all of us,

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.167
so it just sort of adds to the fun.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:56.847
You could use margarita glasses,

00:04:56.847 --> 00:04:59.280
you could use a martini
glass, a wine glass,

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.528
even a champagne glass.

00:05:00.528 --> 00:05:01.670
It just makes everything feel a little bit

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.873
more ladylike and elegant.

00:05:03.873 --> 00:05:05.767
And then as the party wears on,

00:05:05.767 --> 00:05:07.552
the ice block will start to melt,

00:05:07.552 --> 00:05:09.392
that orange juice will become infused

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:11.711
with the grapefruit juice
coming from the ice block.

00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:15.231
It'll stay pretty much cold
for about two, three hours.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.623
So it does last a little bit of time.

00:05:17.623 --> 00:05:19.840
And if you find that the punch
is getting too watered down

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.690
from the juice and you wanna add

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.242
a little bit more zing to it,

00:05:22.242 --> 00:05:24.490
just go ahead and add
some more sparkling water.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.491
So there you have it,

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.167
a self-serve, stress-free party punch

00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:29.983
that I think you guys will love.

00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:33.279
And to Joy, who I hear you
are also having a second girl,

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:34.692
I wish you all the best.

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:37.149
I can only tell you as
the mother of two girls,

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:38.704
giving my eldest daughter a sister,

00:05:38.704 --> 00:05:40.597
was one of the best things we ever did.

00:05:40.597 --> 00:05:41.616
They are best buds,

00:05:41.616 --> 00:05:44.349
and there is nothing
quite like sisterly love.

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.634
So I wish you all the best,

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:47.334
and hopefully one day
when that baby is older,

00:05:47.334 --> 00:05:49.734
we can get all these girls
together for a play date.

00:05:49.734 --> 00:05:50.567
Alright you guys,

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:52.026
I hope you stick around to watch the rest

00:05:52.026 --> 00:05:53.746
of the videos in this playlist.

00:05:53.746 --> 00:05:55.780
There are some terrific baby shower ideas

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.263
that I know you all will love.

00:05:57.263 --> 00:05:58.631
Okay, I will see you next time.

00:05:58.631 --> 00:05:59.751
Bye.

00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:03.418
(upbeat instrumental music)
