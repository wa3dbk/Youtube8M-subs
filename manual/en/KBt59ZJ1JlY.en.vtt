Hi. My name is Melissa Powell and I'm with
Expert Village. In talking about Blackjack

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.160
and how to play, one of the most commonly
misunderstood concepts is that of insurance.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.840
So we're going to show an example of insurance,
that you have a better understanding of what

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.249
that means. After each Player has placed a
bet, let's say each Player has put down two

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:26.789
chips, let's go ahead and do that just for
the sake of example. Each Player has bet two

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.940
for their hand. So they keep these chips to
themselves, and these cards, these chips out

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.339
here rather, are for their bet. Now we go
ahead and deal two cards to each Player as

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:52.379
you would see in a typical game. Aha! I've
turned myself over an Ace. Only when the Dealer

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.699
turns over an Ace will she offer insurance
for the table. Insurance essentially is two

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.860
to one odds. The chances of my having a ten
underneath the ace or a Blackjack natural,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:14.030
are fairly high. So I offer insurance to everybody
else at the table. However, insurance very

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.200
often doesn't pay out. So it's not always
a good option unless you're very confident

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.670
about the hand that you have. So let's say
for example, the Queen and the five wanted

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.770
to take insurance because they thought that
I probably had a twenty-one. They will pay

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:38.130
half of the amount that they have out. One
chip. They have two chips out. Their insurance

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.500
bet will be one. So if I do have a Blackjack,
they'd get their insurance back. If I do not

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.280
have a Blackjack, I take their insurance money.
So let's see what we have. I do indeed have

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.990
a Blackjack. So they get to keep their insurance.
And now we go along and see who wins the game.
