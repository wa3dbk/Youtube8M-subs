00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.959
Now to insert the leg and tighten the leg
into the space we've allowed in our apron,

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:16.269
we're going to need our drill bit and again
switch out the Phillips head to a drill bit.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:25.130
Now, what I'm going to use is these 5/16 lag
screws. So what I want in drilling I need

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:31.330
to drill a pilot hole. So I want to make sure
my drill bit is a smaller diameter than the

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:39.220
screw that way it locks itself in place. Now
it's always a good idea to try to get it centered

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:50.790
as you can with your drill bit. Now it's not
imperative, so you just get an eye ball center.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:16.070
Alight, now what I've done is I drilled all
the way through this piece and just tagged

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.020
the table leg. The only difficult part about
this is you want to tag right into the corner

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.330
which makes it really difficult. So normally
what I do is just with the drill I just tag

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.200
it, just hit it make a mark with the drill
bit so I'll know at least the height. Then

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.729
I take my table leg out, hold it up as best
as I can, drill right into that hole I started.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:54.020
Alright, boom then I have a hole that goes
right in the corner nice and neatly.
