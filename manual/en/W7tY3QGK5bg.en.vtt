Hi, guys.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.670
In this video, I will show you the easiest
possible way to create a little bow accent

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.790
using your own hair.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.510
It's actually surprisingly simple, and it's
a great way to spice up any hairstyle.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.300
I'm starting with second-day curls as I find
it easier to style and work with, so to make

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.259
sure my hair looks and feels fresh, I'm just
going to spray my hair lightly with the TRESemmé

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.729
Fresh Start Volumizing Dry Shampoo, and then
just kind of brushing it out with my fingers

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.309
to make sure it's evenly distributed.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.140
Allow the product to settle for a couple of
seconds, and then just flip your head right

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.200
side up again.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:44.720
I'm grabbing the upper crown section of my
hair, twisting it slightly, pushing it forwards,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.160
and bobby pinning it down in place.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.530
To form the bow, pull your hair back as if
you're creating a half-up ponytail.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.829
Tie it together with an elastic, except either
on the second or the last loop make sure you

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.400
don't pull your hair all the way through.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.210
You'll have a little hanging loop as well
as a tail at the very bottom.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.479
Fan out the looped section and just try to
make sure it's as even as possible.

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.799
Carefully divide the tail section in half,
and from underneath the base of the ponytail,

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.860
you want to grab a tiny section of hair.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.039
Pull this up over the middle, and try to divide
the loop in half as well as you pull the section

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.889
of hair right over it.

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:38.460
This part can be a little bit tricky, so take
extra time and try to do it as carefully as

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.460
possible.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.069
Basically, you want to take this thin section
of hair up and over the middle, and pull it

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.750
right the way under the base of the ponytail.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.979
Secure this in place with one or two bobby
pins.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.130
At this point, the bow should kind of already
be taking shape.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.799
To make it more defined, just take half of
the bow at a time, loosen it up as necessary,

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.200
and just kind of fluff it up until you're
happy with the size.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.640
Take a couple of bobby pins, and secure it
from inside the loop.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.770
Do the exact same thing for the other side,
and just make sure the two sides look even.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.770
To set the bow and to minimize any frizz or
flyaways just spray your hair lightly with

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.670
the TRESemmé 24 Hour Body Finishing Spray.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.880
Here again is the final look.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.480
Obviously, I used this to create a half up
do, but you could do a large one in the back

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.610
of your head, one at the top of your head,
or even on the side just as a minor detail.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.000
Feel free to take this technique and apply
it however you'd like.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.230
Thank you so much for watching, and I hope
to see you in my next video.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.730
Bye, guys.
