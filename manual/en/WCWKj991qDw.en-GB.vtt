00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:14.952
Continue working on your scene from the last movie or use the scene named CP-09_bridge-end-caps.max

00:00:15.514 --> 00:00:21.879
Consider the sloped surfaces around the bridge ends. Select one and Isolate it.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.087
It is only displayed from top. The surface doesn't wrap into an enclosed poly object.

00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:34.924
It's missing "caps" at the bottom, on the left, and most importantly on the right side.

00:00:35.374 --> 00:00:43.239
The bottom and left areas matter less in the context of the scene, but the right side, leaves a big hole that needs to be addressed.

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:51.024
There are various ways you could tackle this: Potentially, you could start with a simple box and poly-model it into the shape you need.

00:00:51.832 --> 00:00:55.939
Personally, I always try to use existing geometry as a base.

00:00:55.939 --> 00:01:04.112
With the surface selected, apply an Edit Poly modifier. This is just temporary so you can extract the data that you need.

00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:13.645
At this point, you may want to activate Edged Faces mode (F4) to see the geometry better. You can always toggle it off when you're done.

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:16.821
Enter Edge mode, 

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:23.340
and select these two "ground" edges at the right end of the model.

00:01:25.258 --> 00:01:29.408
Bridge the two edges to create a horizontal surface between them.

00:01:31.373 --> 00:01:37.431
This is so you can use the Border tool to select the right perimeter, the area you're really interested in.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.138
Once it is selected, then you can simply use the Cap method to create a surface to fill the hole.

00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:54.320
In Poly mode, select the new surface and then click the small button next to Detach. A dialog appears.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.350
Name the new object: "Bridge End W - Wall" and make sure all options are disabled.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.030
Click OK to extract the geometry from the current object to a new one.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.870
The new object will be your base to build a wall.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.220
In fact, you can delete the Edit Poly modifier from the original surface; this takes it back to its original state.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.130
Now you have a new independent surface that you can adjust to your liking.

00:02:22.464 --> 00:02:30.904
Make sure the new surface is selected and note that its pivot point is a bit off, because it is based on the original surface.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:38.814
In the Hierarchy panel, you can re-center it using Affect Pivot Only, then Center to Object.

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:44.636
If you look at it from top, the pivot point is not oriented with the normal of the surface.

00:02:45.292 --> 00:02:52.821
Instead of fiddling with rotation angle values, here's a quick way to align the pivot point to the normal of the surface:

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:59.999
Create a temporary box using AutoGrid mode and align it to the surface.

00:03:04.647 --> 00:03:14.209
Go back to the hierarchy panel and in Affect Pivot Only mode, verify that the new box has the orientation you need.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.900
Select your surface again and still in Affect Pivot Only mode, use the Align tool, 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.780
to align the XYZ rotations of the surface to the box.

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:37.968
You don't need to align the positions, just the XYZ rotations, pivot-to-pivot.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.311
Once that is done, you can exit Affect Pivot Only mode and delete the temporary box.

00:03:49.013 --> 00:03:54.925
To give the surface a bit of depth, go to the Modify panel and enter Polygon mode.

00:03:56.721 --> 00:04:02.788
Make sure the polygon that makes the surface is selected and extrude it a bit.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.730
Have a little fun with it, perhaps move that bottom edge further out to make a thicker base.

00:04:11.133 --> 00:04:18.581
For that, you will need to set the coordinate system to Parent, so that the edge conforms to the orientation of the new wall.

00:04:25.096 --> 00:04:35.101
Similarly, you may consider a slight relative X-Displacement of the sloped polygons so that they are not flush with the grassy part.

00:04:40.214 --> 00:04:48.404
In fact, take a look from the other side; the left side. Because of how it was built, the new wall is not capped from the left.

00:04:48.893 --> 00:04:52.277
This means you would have to select that border again, 

00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:55.912
and cap it as you have done before.

00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:08.143
The geometry is pretty much in place but you need to adjust the mapping. There are currently pixel streaks everywhere.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.200
Apply a UVW Map modifier in box mode, 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.087
and disable Real-World Map Size.

00:05:17.801 --> 00:05:21.485
Adjust the gizmo size to values that work better. 

00:05:22.416 --> 00:05:25.130
Try 40x40x40.

00:05:25.805 --> 00:05:33.305
Ultimately, you may also consider a different material for the wall; perhaps use the same material you created for the pillars.

00:05:33.706 --> 00:05:39.946
For that, you'll need to temporarily exit Isolate mode so that you can see the pillars,

00:05:40.658 --> 00:05:47.815
and go to the Material Editor and sample their material, so that you can use it on other objects.

00:05:49.618 --> 00:05:55.673
Once that is done, you can concentrate on the wall again and apply the new material to it.

00:05:57.015 --> 00:06:02.863
When you're satisfied with the results, you can collapse the object down to an Editable Poly again.

00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:11.503
Exit Isolate mode and take a look at the scene. You can also exit Edged Faces mode if you want to (F4).

00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:19.615
You may notice some flicker where the top of the wall meets the bridge surface.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.820
In that case, you may consider bringing some of these top polygons down a notch.

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:28.806
Simply isolate the wall again, 

00:06:33.378 --> 00:06:36.436
and make the necessary adjustments. 

00:06:50.783 --> 00:06:54.698
You only need to bring the selected polygons down about 5cm.

00:06:57.335 --> 00:07:03.778
Once you have exited Isolate mode, verify no more flicker is taking place.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:18.887
Test render the scene and verify there are no more gaps under the bridge, not on this shore anyway.

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.720
You still need to repeat the procedure on the other side of the bridge.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:26.810
It is exactly the same procedure, so consider it your homework.

00:07:27.347 --> 00:07:33.413
In the next movie, you go back to experimenting in Civil View by adding buildings in the background.
