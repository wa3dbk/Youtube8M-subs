00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.000
with genetics and also said the
surrounding the environment did that

I'm actually going to share with you the
top skincare secret

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.440
which is actually very simple cleansing

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.950
now cleansing as you might know by now
is the very first step %uh

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.719
any skin care routine whether it's
anti-aging whether it's acne

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.039
whether it's white mean whatever
skincare routine you have

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.820
it stops the cleansing cleansing is
pretty much common sense

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.880
think about as the removing the surface
layer of the skin

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.310
if you're not living that barry of
doesn't matter if you're using a two

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.229
thousand dollar serum or a two-dollar

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.509
moisturiser it's not gonna penetrate
through your skin because you have that

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.990
all basically a got our offense of so
today I'm very excited to finally show

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.340

this is for when you're traveling cuz

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.500
I find that this is so convenient I V
neck to putting this

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.200
in I'll look my gym bag but also when
I'm going away

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.160
you get basically just around case like
that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.310
and also comes with a by inside and then
you can

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.069
have the bathroom like this when you're
traveling so it's like a soap tray

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.930
like this so all the water will actually
drained it wouldn't fit

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.349
in underneath the bottle and they want
to try a contest

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.500
Kloza case any does produce new bag and
you could just trouble with this

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.680
how convenient it is to have a cleanser
exfoliator toner

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.599
old just someone little case it's just
its online black

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.730
so let me show you how to use a fast
first I would whip my face with warm

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.440
water and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.730
and then went to bob with warm water and
rub it in my hands until i'm satisfied

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.890
with the latter

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.450
a place that bob back into the tray and
then rub my hands together

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.290
to take in the latter this will activate
all the ingredients in the back

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.680
and then I apply evenly all over the
face and neck

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.470
as I would be applying a Mac it is
suggested to leave it undisturbed for

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.820
about two minutes a side

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.240
so i sat at the time and I usually brush
my teeth to save time

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.360
I love multitasking you can also leave
it on for more than two minutes

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.130
the longer you leave it all the more
benefits there is once the timer runs

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.789
out

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.010
I rinse my face again with warm water
and then tallied drive

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.889
in about a motion this Lease my face
billing so clean and refreshed

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.240
and you know what the college thing
about the East King Cab I N

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.910
it actually has a built-in base mapping
app yes

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.130
oh my god so if you remember my face
mapping video that I did

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.210
where i stand. pimples pop up on Sun
places on your face

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.110
correlates to the inside the body so
that's why it's very important to take

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.690
care

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.889
of the body as a whole as opposed to
just the face

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.910
with the if think about want to apply
the latter to your face

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.490
anyway for two minutes you can action
notice certain parts

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.340
all the latter will absorb into just get
a lot faster than other parts

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.289
so for me but to kill out the side to my
cheeks tend to absorb a lot faster than

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.300
the best my face

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.619
for this one ahead that I have

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:33.169
a poor diet and bad sleeping habits so
this way on a daily basis

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.029
you able to notice which part everybody
needs a little TLC

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.669
so you also notice for example if you be
eating junk have recently

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.369
but they haven't been sleeping early
enough and maybe the fort area will

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:46.819
attend absolved allowed a lot faster
than a message via

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:50.080
base I've tried so many clans a market
I've tried

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.199
clattered gel lotion milk oil

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.479
you name it I've tried it to the best
kind of flash skin care product

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.959
that I have noticed a huge drastic
change to my car skin condition

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:05.219
it also light in my pigmentation I have
noticed the

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:08.419
all the part of that put on afterwards
have been working better

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.449
by this point probably wondering where I
can get this product

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.080
I love this product so much that I
actually approached the owners David M

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.689
call

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.490
and I have some very nicely to give me a
promo code for my subscribers

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.080
so I will list it here and also in the
discussion by be low

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.639
and they also do well why shipping so
yes for anyone

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.559
around the world which get your hands on
and Eve skin care but because

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.800
this is the one part that police
recommend to anyone

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.719
and everyone whether you have dry skin
oily skin combination

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:42.539
whether you're young hold male-female
anyone can use this and you definitely

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:43.610
say was I'll

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.959
is also a sport a virgin for you men out
there

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:50.789
it's exactly the same as the skin
rejuvenation kid but is just packaged

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.389
for something more manly so this is a
great gift idea

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.749
but also if you have your boyfriend's
dad's on Cole's

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.529
whatever this is definitely something or
even like guys who are a sport in

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:02.829
general cuz I think this is such a good
thing in the gym

00:07:02.829 --> 00:07:06.389
because I've the more product inaction
relaxes the muscles

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.759
so a lot of the Act lactic acid that
gets accumulated when your muscles and

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:15.199
aching and sore from doing a workout
this actually helps to calm the muscles

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.869
so when you do apply this all over your
body after a huge work at

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:23.550
you actually find that you don't get a
sore and as painful the next day as you

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.999
would

00:07:23.999 --> 00:07:28.009
so this is it's just like a really
amazing product I think or visit here

00:07:28.009 --> 00:07:30.479
for days and talk about how amazing this
is but

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:34.529
I'll let you guys experience yourself so
as it should be have any questions leave

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.620
your comments below and I'll try to get
back to you

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.780

lovely weekend I was the my next video
