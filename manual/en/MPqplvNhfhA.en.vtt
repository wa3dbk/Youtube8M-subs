00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.000
over sixty six years of F series gave it 
experience

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.630
32 years as America's best-selling
vehicle gave it a reputation

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.740
and thirty-seven years of america's best selling truck makes a legend

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.170
its been tested harder push further and had
more expected of it than ever before

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.890
here at RichmondFord we are happy to
introduce the completely redesigned

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.020
all-new 2015 F 150 hi my name is Phil
Noel from RichmondFord

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.739
once again is my pleasure to
introduce you to the all-new 2000

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.160
and 15 Ford F 150 Ford did not spare

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.199
any expense when it came to making their
Truck number one once again

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.960
Dodge Chevy I know you guys are hating
right now but hey

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.370
we've always been number one and will
continue to be number one

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.089
you can see let's take a look at the
vehicle 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:54.579
this vehicle is aluminum now 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.769
yes I said Alumnium  700 rounds

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.850
lighter which means you can tow more you
can hall more

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.089
is just a more reliable vehicle is just
just

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.670
taking out the competition when it comes
to what it does and thats just being ford tough

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.280
Dont think aluminum means made from tin
cans

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.420
its a military grade compound that is used
in aerospace equipment

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.930
as mentioned less weight means more capability the new truck

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.119
offers a best in class towing and payload Thanks to lighter aluminium combined with 24% more 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:26.479
more high strength steel

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.560
it tow 12200 and haul 3300

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.590
just like the interoir the exterior has

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.820
upgrades that out of this world in your
tailgate box you have

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.170
LED lighting who else does that but us
Ford you have rear-view cameras

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.409
you have LED lighting on the exterior
you have

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.350
reverse sensing system and if your
hands are full when you walked up to the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.759
vehicle guess what happened you can push a button

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.360
and that'll happen for you power assist 
tailgate also you have a

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.799
tailgate step that In there, this 
vehicle is equipped with the fx4

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.860
offroad package which measn you can take it offroad and not worry about 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.390
puncturing any type of 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.630
really important thing underneath the
vehicle

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.209
I like it let's go off road together
sometimes this vehicle is equipped with

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.130
twenty inch chrome wheels

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.410
gorgeous so you can play hard and
look good at the same time

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.120
who doesn't want to do that you have
chrome running boards this vehicle is a

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.829
crew cab which mean you can get your whole crew in here

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.590
without even open up your door Come on
get in crew 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.959
so chrome door handles this is Lariat

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.299
edition which means you get leather
interior your geting heated seats your getting

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.380
air conditioned seats

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.680
ur getting it all people when you look at this Ford F 150

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.040
Larry edition with the fx4 offroad package 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.579
I'm getting excited because I'm just
lovin this vehicle, (lovin (x3) it

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.079
let me show you some more things in
interior ford has come out with a few

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.049
different things in the interior of this
vehicle

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.469
that will be friendly, driver friendly 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.500
passengers friendly  one thing I like
to point out

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.140
of course would be heated/ air
conditioned seats now ford has multi

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.060
contour seats 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.280
which means they can actually massage you as you drive

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.480
what more can you ask for in a Ford F
150 tough truck being messaged 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.560
okay another thing I like is the 110 volt outlet right here in the front

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.439
if your rushing to work and need to shave plug your shaver in and shave while your going  

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:25.700
I dont suggest you do that

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.010
but if you have to you can is capable
of happening another thing I like to point out

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.329
is push button start Ford is up scaling there vehicle's their trucks their cars

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.750
and that's one thing I like about him
that now you can have the key in your

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.900
pocket not to worry about bringing out a
key

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.159
starting as long as you have it in your
pocket just 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.230
push button start it and go another
thing I like to point out

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.500
is you have a lighting that comes out of
the side's of ur side view mirrors 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.739
so if you pulling up in a place in a
dark you can actually see what's going

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:56.069
on

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.189
outside before you get out there to really  see what's going on outside 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.370
So Ford has done it again, so people 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.280
come take a look at this truck you
gotta come you owe it to yourself

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.799
if your a truck driver if you are 
someone that huals/pulls things

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.010
If your someone that just wants to look good in a nice truck 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.299
come see me here phill noel at Richmondford 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.959
 before we sign off we gotta mention the brand new

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.889
2.7 ecoboost secrettly tested at the grueling baja  1000

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.800
is a the first gas engine to use a compact
graphite iron cylinder block

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.930
technology carried over from ford's  reputable monster, its 6.7 diesel

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.009
its super tough yet lightweight, powerful
yet efficient 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.509
the F 150's biggest competition has become itself making each truck that much harder to beat then the last 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:42.800
find out why the F150 remains the champ at and buy from RichmondFord 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.180
life time state inspection 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.440
Richmond Ford 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.910
 spend less love your drive 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.910
