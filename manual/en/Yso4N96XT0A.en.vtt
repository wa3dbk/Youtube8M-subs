00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.440
Hi, I'm Clayton

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.000
and today I'm going to show you how easy it
is to install a Lomanco WhirlyBird®

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.759
turbine vent.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.460
 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.140
now remember the Lomanco Whirlybird® is an
exhaust vent

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.640
and as an exhaust vent it's only half
your ventilation system

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.620
the other half consists of intake and
this needs to be balanced 50/50

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.329
for a proper ventilation system. So you
want to make certain

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.000
that in your lower attic area, you have
enough intake,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
proper intake, to match your exhaust
vents. To determine how many Whirlybirds you need,

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.780
just use the chart on top of the box, to
help with proper emplacement use the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.000
included instructions

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and if you don't know the pitch of your roof

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.630
first thing you need to do is determine
that, one way to do that is with the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.960
included pitch gauge

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.439
that's in the Whirlybird® box, to use the pitch
gauge simply put the roof peak

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.560
mark at the roof's peak, use a straight
edge

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.689
and simply read the gauge

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.630
on the bottom of the straight edge we
can see that this is a 5/12 pitch roof

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.900
 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.650
Next, we're going to align that pitch number on the Whirlybird® elbow

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.110
with the mark on the base flashing

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.590
now we're going to
use the screws to screw the elbow

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.619
on to the base while lining up the pre-drilled

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.649
holes. Next, we need to decide the placement of the Whirlybird®

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.229
from the roof peak. We want the Whirlybird® as close to the roof peak as possible,

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.649
but far enough down to where it's not noticeable
from the front. When you decide

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.200
how far down you want to place it you want
to make sure

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.329
where you're going to place the hole,

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.290
there's not a rafter

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.920
you can do that by tapping and finding where the rafters are

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.140
and making sure you put the turbine
hole in the middle

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.930
to mark the hole, use the base as a
template,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.620
the marker,

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.220
and mark your hole, using the base

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.330
as your template

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.330
Now we just have to cut the hole

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.940
after your hole is cut out

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.160
you may have to loosen the shingles
and also make sure that there's no nails

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.190
that would get in the way of sliding
the base

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.190
into place

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.330
take your base make sure the bottom
is pointing toward the bottom

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.629
 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.040
and slide the Whirlybird® base

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.190
into place

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.370
you get in place you want to secured it at
the top, bottom, and sides

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.440
with roofing nails

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.069
with the base installed you will now
level the top of the elbow

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:44.069
by turning it counterclockwise

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.430
with the Whirlybird® elbow in place, take
the locking clamp

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.430
and screw and lock the elbow in place. This
next step is very important,

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:59.739
before installing the Whirlybird® head

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.700
you want to seal the adjusting seam on
the elbow

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.849
the seam between the base and elbow on the
inside

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.900
and also the locking clamp

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.700
then on the outside you want to seal each
nail head

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.549
that's exposed. Alright, all that's left
is to install the Whirlybird® head

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.530
using the screws and lining up

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.000
through the pre-drilled holes.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.400
Well, that's how easy it is to install your Lomanco Whirlybird®. Remember to match your intake's Net Free Area to your exhaust vents

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.690
Lomanco has a complete line of intake vents

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.970
that will help yo do just that. If you need more information about Lomanco
