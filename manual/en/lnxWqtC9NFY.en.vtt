00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.372
Hi, I'm Danielle with Weissman's Design's for Dance. 

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.907
Today we are going to show you

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:09.710
how to create and three different styles with only one top.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.278
I don't know about you but

00:00:11.278 --> 00:00:12.513
I absolutely love this top, 

00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:14.396
and have a lot of questions on how I can wear it. 

00:00:14.396 --> 00:00:17.417
Take a few minutes to watch one of our top designers

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:20.287
demonstrate how to create and wear this unique multi-wrap top.

00:00:29.164 --> 00:00:30.764
Hi, I'm Kristin and this is Holly, 

00:00:30.764 --> 00:00:34.644
and today we are going to start with the cap-sleeve wrap top.

00:00:34.644 --> 00:00:38.238
So, we're gonna grab the sleeve

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:40.707
just above where the liner ends,

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:44.945
and the trick is fold it together.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:49.830
Fold it together like this, and then start your twisting.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.152
You want to twist away from the body, 

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:58.959
you can twist two or three times, whatever works best for 
 you depending on the size of the model. 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.183
or dancer.

00:01:02.183 --> 00:01:06.633
Twist it pretty tight, and then pull it back around.

00:01:07.384 --> 00:01:09.703
Holly's going to grab it for me to hold

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:15.108
and then you want to do the exact 
 same thing on the other side. 

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:21.038
Grab your tie, fold it in, at the top edge of the liner,

00:01:21.038 --> 00:01:24.939
and then start twisting outward. 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.191
Twist, twist, twist. Bring it around the shoulder

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:36.456
and then, you've got your ties hanging like this,

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:43.280
wrap it underneath the arm, both sides, and criss-cross in front.

00:01:43.282 --> 00:01:45.440
It comes around the back like this

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.900
So, So Holly's going to hold this one for me

00:01:48.902 --> 00:01:54.050
Take your end, pull it up and criss-cross the back

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:58.680
And then you can just go ahead and wrap it around the shoulder

00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:05.250
just like this, tie a little square knot

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.140
Shouldn't go anywhere, everthing's pretty tight on here

00:02:05.248 --> 00:02:13.750
pull it really tight, and then tuck the little tail up under the sleeve.

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:21.710
and then, just repeat on the other side.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:28.080
Tuck your tails underneath the sleave to hide them
36
00:02:28,081 --&gt; 00:02:32,22
So, there we go

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:38.990
You might want to fix the sleeves just a little bit 
 to get them to the width that you like. 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.300
There it is, the cap-sleeve wrap!

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.610
Now we are going to show you the cross front halter. 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:03:02.820
First, grab one side, straighten it out so its nice and smooth, 

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:08.410
bring it across the body, and wrap it around the neck. 

00:03:08.407 --> 00:03:13.230
Holly's going to grab it from behind and keep it nice and tight

00:03:13.227 --> 00:03:19.400
and do the same thing with the opposite side. 

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:27.110
Bring both ties to the back. You want to 
 make sure it's nice and tight. 

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:31.510
Cross the back, bring it around to the front

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:39.200
cross again, then bring it back to tie in the back

00:03:39.196 --> 00:03:45.630
There you go. So you want to open up your straps a little bit

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:51.700
So pretty, and there you have it: the cross front halter.

00:03:55.702 --> 00:03:57.700
Now we are going to show you the one shoulder twist. 

00:03:57.704 --> 00:04:00.610
So you want to grab the opposite side

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.220
and the trick is to kind of clump it 
 together and then begin twisting on its own.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.320
We are going to twist about two or three times

00:04:15.322 --> 00:04:20.560
and now we are going to have Holly 
 hold it for us because it's slippery.

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.600
I'm going to take the opposite side

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:32.670
grab it and maybe give it a little twist, and what 
 you want to do is just twist them together, 

00:04:32.673 --> 00:04:35.540
keeping everything really nice and tight. 

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:45.320
Twist, twist, twist. You can twist it down as far as you like

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:48.290
 we are going to go about half way down your shoulder

00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:55.200
grab the ties, wrap them around to the front, cross in front

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:58.190
and bring them back to the center back

00:04:58.191 --> 00:05:03.240
and tie your knot.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:10.380
There you go: the one shoulder wrap.

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:17.220
