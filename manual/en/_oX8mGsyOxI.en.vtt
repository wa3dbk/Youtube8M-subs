Hello. This is J.B. and I'm with Austin Homebrew
supply here in Austin, Texas and today we

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.900
are talking a little bit about wine making
equipment. Now exclusively in this section

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.300
I want to talk about floor corkers. These
guys are great. Once your wine is completely

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.130
fermented you need to figure out how you're
going to get the cork into the bottle. I find

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.619
that these floor corkers are just the easiest
way to do it. The negative thing is they're

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.430
the most expensive corkers we carry but there
you go. We carry two different models. This

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.890
one is a Portuguese floor corker. We also
have one from Italy. I don't have one of those

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.210
in stock. Generally the one that we carry
from Italy will also do champagne bottles.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.550
It has a special iris or apparatus on the
top of it that really compresses those champagne

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:00.480
corks so. Right now we're going to talk about
just traditional corking. This is like I said

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.479
the Portuguese floor corker and I'll just
show you real quickly how it works. First

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.770
you would take the lever and open it all the
way up. Then you would take your cork. And

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.490
this guy will fit any of the different corks
that we carry. Take your cork and make sure

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.420
it's sanitized. Drop it in there and then
with this guy here you would push down and

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:32.460
then you simply, you would center the bottle
inside of this guide up underneath here. And

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.569
now what happens is a spring loaded bottom
allows the different lengths or different

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.439
size of the bottles, say you had a really
tall bottle you could fit it in there, or

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.399
even a really short bottle, the base would
come up. Now as soon as you start to pull

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:54.049
the lever forward like so it locks the base
in the spot so that when the cork is inserted

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.159
the base wont drop down. So it locks the base
and then you would simply immerse or insert

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:06.009
the cork under pressure, like so, into the
bottle. Once you're done you take it out and

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:12.780
remove the bottle off the corker. So this
is a little bit about how to use one of these

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.450
floor corkers.
