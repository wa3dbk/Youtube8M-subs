awhile now in the united states and some

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.200
of the rom countries that are on our own
a very good story dot referred bomb and

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.450

bags and yemen somalia someplace that

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.549
we've used

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.319
uh... drones but

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.079
and we are by late there

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:19.980
sovereignty a little bit well as a sad
day for them

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.999
and sometimes of executed uh... people
that

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:27.050
we're probably legitimately terrace i
soon so i can gambling that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.829
everything was a mistake right

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.199
uh... another and we do know there was a
tremendous number of mistakes at in the

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.310
ballpark bout three thousand civilians
killed

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.970
in all those uh... draws her struggles
different countries and some u_s_

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.940
citizens excuse well without a truck

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.560
turns out we're not alone

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.100
the chinese also have probes

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.980
now we reported at before but what we
didn't know is that they were this close

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.640
to using one of them

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.999
to excuse someone

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.740
in a different country

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.930
groups

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.330
if we can do it

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.970
they can do it too

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.710
so now the new york times a story
explain china concern using a drone

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.450
strike them out this region of southeast
asia to kill me and marred rug lord

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.159
wanted in the killings of thirteen
chinese sailors

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.280
now look

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.150
that that killings were role in a moment
it looked like they were actually on the

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.650
spot their hands rebound

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.220
and they might've been tortured and that
chinese public was

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.400
outraged by this they said we have a
have justice

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.550
and they couldn't get the guy and so
they were thinking

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.190
disney and of by the way is

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.970
time now com

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.830
and uh... so they were thinking well

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.610
why don't we go get the guy

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.810
if they're the u_s_ and i dont so a let
me tell you about their para que

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.479
melodies of terms withdraws this to
chinese rose apparently modeled

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.920
on the american reaper and predator on
many real big vehicles

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.860

exercises before they also have a larger
drone that's akin to our american are q

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.239

they're not short on her own sp

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:22.219

little embarrassing for us

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:41.389
so they showed up a little bit more
strength than we do

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:44.459
they actually use troops from thailand
myanmar

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.269
china etcetera

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.810

situation by using our military we
actually do the job right

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.079
with china's got a ton of problems

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:34.869
