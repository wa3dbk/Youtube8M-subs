00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.049
a woman from Tennessee fastened her
one-month-old baby

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.320
onto the train up her wedding dress now
a lot of people were upset when

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.530
Shana Carter Brooks did this she does
have an older daughter but people are

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.390
completely freaking out about it she has
defended her decision on a Facebook post

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.470
I'm going to attempt to read it to you
with all its grammatical

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.590
errors so here we go out ap

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.230
so to the media and of course is
responding to the media radio news and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.960
whoever else want to talk about what we
do here

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.329
you go media media I see how it works
regardless the situation or purpose

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.579
people gone have something negative to
say

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.300
the answer is we do what we what when we
want as long as Jesus on our side

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.030
everything worked out fine and gone
continue to work out fine

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.579
or to be fine our one month old was
awake and well secured on my train most

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.149
important while y'all got

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.770
ya few things enough we had are

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.480
hearts in Christ which covers all I just
wanna read it as accurately as possible

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.129
so anyway I want to know what you guys
think about this a scandalous the event

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.479
that happened in a small town in
Tennessee Cara make your point my point

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.119
is that you can just cover every
decision you make it the G this is not

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:11.590
my

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.240
I it doesn't work that way also babies
are an accessory

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.720
that like really embarrassing
embarrassing for her thank

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.640
you feel the attention she got in that
photograph that is my new Halloween

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.869
costume yeah

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.659
I am playing r-ball at belligerent
Christian one man with a baby tied to

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.750
her wedding down and I need a best
friend to play my social workers so

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.170
yeah she kept making the point that
nothing bad happened to the baby just

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.950
because nothing bad happened this time
around doesn't make it right

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.180
and also you could've if you really want
the baby part the wedding

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.970
you could hold the baby as you're going
down the aisle and said having a bouquet

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.820
of flowers there so many other options

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.430
super questionable to put a baby on your
train especially since so it's a

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.189
one-month-old

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.579
arm so here's the big question for this
story what's the most questionable thing

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:56.939
you've done or said

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.950
that cause other people to freak out
hank I want to start with you

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.280
or I i'm going back to the classic
coming out freaked

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.280
my parents our and they were they were
like take down your video clip came out

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.239

ok see you are right before all good
carry out but I am

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.590
so questionable decision I've ever made
questionable fashion decisions like

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.269
though maybe not with the baby tied to
my train but I would say

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.379
Olive high school with a questionable
fashion decision and I'm gonna show you

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.300
guys what I mean right now

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.379

thank you so much I have like 14 in this
picture

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.220
and not making very good decision well I
think I'm actually answer the same

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.170
question the care answered and its you
know what's most questionable fashion

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.690
choice that you made an

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.819
of course I went through a phase for
like two years when I had like

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.200
pencil on eyebrows and dark lip liner
and I look ridiculous

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.110
and in the meantime I was pertain to be
a badass but behind closed doors I was

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.920
like I gotta read for my psychology test

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.400

the worst fashion mistake and I i post

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.720
