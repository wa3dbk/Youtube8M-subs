Hi.

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.080
I am Shawna Coronado and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.270
Today I am going to be talking about a really
cool compost tool.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.420
You know, I am always telling you how you
need to get out and get the compost bin.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.170
And here is a really easy way to do it.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.910
Gaiam.com set me this really cool composter.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.470
It is stainless steel and I have been testing
it out.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.650
I have used it for about two months now and
really love it.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.650
I think it is a great tool.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.230
Now the cool thing about the compost keeper
is because it sits right here on my counter,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.379
it is really easy to toss in all my extra
vegetable products, paper, egg shells, anything

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.170
that I would normally compost.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.960
And I can take it right out to the big composter
outside.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.539
Now the real surprise – ta-da! – is the
inside of the lid.

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:58.910
It has a charcoal filter so it helps to filter
out any of ucky smells that might come from

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.940
this product.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.180
And as you can tell, I fill it all the way
up to the top.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.610
And because the stainless steal handle, it
is so strong, it is really easy to carry out

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.610
and dump.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.580
Now, I keep my cutting board and my compost
keeper really close together.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:28.680
And the reason that I do that is all I have
to do is slice some veggie material – this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.430
lovely tomato which came from my garden by
the way.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.100
Another reason I really like this Norpro stainless
steel compost keeper is because it is so attractive.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.100
Look.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.100
It matches my stainless steel kitchen accessories.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.680
And that way it blends in with everything.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.060
It does not look like this horrible pile of
material sitting on the counter.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.090
So my review for this product – Gaiam, you
got it right.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.200
And best yet, it is green and good for the
environment.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.200
Come on people.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.480
Get out there and compost.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.390
It is the right thing to do.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.340
You can make a difference.
