00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:07.859
Hello everyone. Last week we showed you a video showing the new Entervan XT, and how

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.059
it’s better suited for taller customers.
A dealer asked me a question on why do we

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.490
need to offer both, and I thought I would
put this video together with Burnie’s help

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.759
showing how a regular Entervan is better suited
for somebody of Burnie’s height and how

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.400
the XT itself just really would not work very well for Burnie. Right now we are looking

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.160
at the Entervan. This is actually Burnie’s
Entervan and he’s driving into his usual position. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.060
And I’m sure if the camera wasn't rolling,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.370
he would roll right on in with no problems.
Alright, so this is Burnie. This is your actual

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.920
driving position. Burnie, this is the height
you normally sit at?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.240
Correct. Okay. And very, I would say very close to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:06.240
normal OEM height in the vehicle so you have no limits on your visibility or anything like that?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.700
It’s about the same height as the rear-view mirror.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.080
Okay, I think, let’s go over the Entervan XT and we’ll see the difference.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.140
Okay, so we’re going into the XT here.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.080
Right away, you’ll see the extra head room on Burnie right there, Quite a difference.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.460
Okay, so Burnie is in position. I’m going
to cut and go to a different angle so we can

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.720
see this just a little bit better. Okay, I’m looking in through the passenger

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.420
window here. What do you think Burnie?
Well I can, my eye line is just above the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.180
top of the steering wheel, and I’m sure
that there are some really short people that

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.180
drive under these circumstances, but I wouldn’t feel comfortable driving from this position.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.999
Maybe just because, you know, for the last hundred years I’ve been sitting several

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:16.599
inches higher. Okay, we’re rolling here, and I’m just

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.760
showing the difference in height from the
back here. Obviously you can see that Burnie

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.489
is sitting quite a bit lower, and his eye
line is just over the top of the steering

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.999
wheel and the dashboard. So what’s your
final thought on this Burnie?

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:37.999
My impression is that, I would prefer building as few different models as possible just for

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.200
the simplicity for the maintaining of the,
competitive pricing. But in this case, this

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:54.149
van is truly you know, has too deep of a floor for me to be comfortable with visibility.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.150
I feel like that probably eighty percent of
our customers, potential customers, could

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:06.459
better be served with our regular Entervan, but the other twenty percent who need the

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:13.459
additional headroom could well be served by the XT.

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.269
Alright, thanks a lot Burnie. Good, thank you.
