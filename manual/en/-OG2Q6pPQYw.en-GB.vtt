00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:01.947
Reading aloud with your child 

00:00:01.947 --> 00:00:03.333
is an important part 

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.333
of their education. 

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.200
It teaches them how to speak 
fluently...

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.683
listen carefully...

00:00:09.683 --> 00:00:10.800
and eventually...

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.883
the ability to read by 
themselves. 

00:00:13.883 --> 00:00:15.580
Here are 5 tips 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.000
to make the time you spend 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.484
reading with your child 

00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.367
more effective.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:22.400
Number 1.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.444
Show them the cover 

00:00:24.444 --> 00:00:25.868
Before reading to your child

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:27.660
show them the cover of the book

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.100
and ask them questions about it.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.433
This is a great way to engage 
their interest

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:37.267
and work their imagination.

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:38.267
Number 2.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:41.772
Test your childâ€™s interest and 
progress.

00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:44.767
Children can be easily 
distracted.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:46.367
To keep them focused 

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:47.733
ask questions such as 

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.133
how they think the characters 
are feeling? 

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.000
What do they think 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.667
will happen next? 

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:55.000
This helps to keep them 
interested 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
and tests their predictive 
skills.

00:00:58.233 --> 00:00:59.267
Number 3.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:01.800
Check newly acquired skills.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.367
Stories contain diversified 
vocabulary. 

00:01:05.367 --> 00:01:07.133
Whenever new words pop up

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.667
make them guess the meaning 

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.000
by using picture clues. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.367
Break down sentences 

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:14.167
they do not understand 

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:18.267
and constantly ask simple 
question.

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:19.333
Number 4.

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.267
Make it engaging.

00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:23.333
Children tend to be more 
attentive 

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.894
when the story comes to life. 

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:28.700
They need to differentiate 
between characters 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.867
to follow the plot

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.702
So using separate voices 

00:01:32.702 --> 00:01:34.033
and nuancing lines 

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:35.700
is a good trick. 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.767
Number 5.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:39.233
Get feedback from your child.

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:40.467
At the end of the book 

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.333
ask your child what they enjoyed

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:44.431
or disliked about the story 

00:01:44.431 --> 00:01:46.667
and explain why. 

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:48.567
Asking these types of questions 

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.933
improves their oral fluency.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:53.775
It also encourages them to form 
opinions

00:01:53.775 --> 00:01:55.267
and gives them the confidence 

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:58.267
to express their preferences 
more. 

00:01:58.267 --> 00:01:59.247
Any one of these 5 tips 

00:01:59.247 --> 00:02:02.033
should engage your child with 
reading 

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.067
and hopefully start them on a 
journey 

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:06.233
of being a lifelong reader. 

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:07.867
