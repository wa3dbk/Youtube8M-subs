Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.280
[pause]

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.280
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:11.590
This is the third episode in our series for
the bride-to-be on how she can

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.670
have perfect skin on her special day. Today
we’re going to talk about the

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.819
third and second months before the actual
wedding. The things we want to

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:24.710
emphasize during this time is continuing to
perfect that glowing clear

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.439
complexion and to make sure all of the acne
blemishes and breakouts are

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:32.850
completely controlled as we’ve been working
on them for the past few

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.800
months. But even brides-to-be can have issues
with some lines and wrinkles

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.100
or even some acne scars. To control these
problems and fix them, we use

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.730
Botox and fillers, so it’s time now for
a visit to your dermatologist.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.409
Botox is used in brides-to-be mostly for frown
lines between the eyes and

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:00.670
occasionally for horizontal forehead lines.
The best time to do this is in

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.699
the second month before the wedding because
the Botox takes a week or two

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.420
to kick in, will last at least three months,
and this way, it’s set and

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.159
stable long before the special day. The other
thing you want to do in these

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.090
two months is use any filler treatments like
collagen or Restalyn because

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.530
there can be fine smile lines and even some
fine lines next to the eyes in

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.270
brides-to-be. Also, and very importantly,
sometimes there are some acne

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.130
scars, and acne scars respond very well to
fillers but, again, you want to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.189
do it in the second or third month before
the wedding because it may

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.050
require a second treatment, and we want everything
to be set and stable at

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.770
this point. In the last episode, we will discuss
what to do in the last

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.950
month before the wedding, and you’ll be
very surprised to hear what you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.729
need to attend to and what you don’t, so
tune in for the next episode.
