My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show how to make

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:13.140
Irish soda bread. Alright now we are going
to make our big bowl here and our product.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.660
Let's take that flour from here, pour that
all in here and we are also going to take

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.429
our egg. Crack it. Well we are using a plastic
bowl it is hard to crack the egg on the edge

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:36.930
of it. We are going to drop our egg down in
there. Let's see, in goes the butter milk,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.430
notice that we are leaving out all the other
ingredients until this is all mixed up. Let's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.399
get all out of there. I think butter milk
is only good for one thing and that is cooking.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.879
I'm not sure why you want to drink the nasty
stuff. Go ahead and take my whisk here and

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.059
smash my egg. I'm not going to whisk this
whole thing cause it is going to get to. We

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.989
are going to use the whisk here in the second,
so I'm just going to use the whisk to kind

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:08.282
of get the egg in there. Try to work out some
of the lumps. I'm going to make sure I try

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:12.700
to get all the way in the bottom and the flour
off the side onto the bottom. Like I said

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.990
this whisk is only going to be used for a
couple of minutes cause as you can see it

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.600
is already getting too thick that I can not
really do anymore. It is time to put the whisk

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:30.479
away. I'm sorry shake all the dough off of
it.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:39.110
So now I'm going to add in other ingredients,
here I got the melted butter. Make sure you

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.610
get all that out of there. You want to use
melted butter but not hot butter cause hot

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.730
butter would have an effect in the agents.
I'm going to take a wooden spoon here and

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.530
mix that in. The idea here is to mix everything
up except for the lavender and throw that

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:09.040
in in the very last second. Okay mix everything
up. A nice pastry substance now which we have.
