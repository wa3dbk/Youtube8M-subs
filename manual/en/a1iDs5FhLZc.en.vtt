00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.400
And push that button and you're all set.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.400
Perfect.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.950
Hey, I can't help noticing these new batteries,
what are those?

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.180
These are Hobbio's new LifeSource battery
packs.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.279
They are lithium iron phosphate batteries.

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.300
Typically just called lithium iron or just
life.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
Gotcha.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.230
They are a neat, new power source.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.230
How are they better than other lithium packs?

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.940
The cool thing about these are is that they
have a lower voltage per cell, they're 3.3

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.829
volts per cell nominal.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:37.829
Okay.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.430
These are two cell packs with makes them 6.6
volts nominal.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.430
Okay.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.840
And the other thing is that in comparing them
to all other receiver packs, these have extremely

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.620
high energy density.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.610
What that means is it's a very lightweight
pack with a lot of energy packed into it.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:04.330
Just as an example if you hold this one which
is our bigger pack and then pick this up which

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.880
is a similarly sized nickel metal hydride
pack and you'll see that these are have the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.080
weight for the same amount of energy.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.360
What about capacities?

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.860
Capacities, we have 1100 mAh, 1800 mAh, or
2100 and all of the way up to 3200 so they'll

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.220
handle almost any aircraft you could possibly
want to fly.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.759
The other thing is is that these will go a
1,000 cycles in other words thousand charge

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.710
discharge cycles with absolutely no change
in performance.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.670
More than twice as much as my NiCads or NiMhs.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.869
Absolutely it is, yes.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.420
Tell me about the leads, too.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.909
That's a litle different.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:47.909
It is.

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.299
What we have here is is two universal connectors
just like you'd normally plug into a receiver

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.299
and so in normal installations where you don't
have a real high current draw you can put

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.240
this one in just like you would any other
battery back.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.900
However if you get into an aircraft with a
lot more current draw you can actually plug

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.729
both of these leads directly into your receiver.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.910
Typically you'd plug one in each side of the
power bus.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.050
And that evenly distributes the power.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.769
And having two sets of wires going in is acting
like a one larger wire.

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.209
In other systems where you might have some
sort of power expander things like that are

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.090
set up for Deans connectors, we have a Deans
Ultra Connector already put on it and so you

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.620
can just use that if you want.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.330
It's a very universal way of seting it up,
you know it's really convenient for the modeler.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.340
And then of course we have a balance connector
here for charging.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.680
So no matter what power system I'm using it
seems that there's a LifeSource battery for

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.680
me.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680
Absolutely.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.019
Like from your smallest application to basically
your largest application these packs will

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.269
fill the Bill.

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.129
Anything else I should know?

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.129
There is.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.800
These packs are very environmentally friendly,
there's no cadmium, no cobalt in them.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.159
The other thing that makes that sets them
apart from other lithium technology battery

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.900
packs is that these have extreme resistantance
to heating.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.560
So there's no fire or explosion hazards with
them.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560
Great, great.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.940
Well, Steve I think you've sold me on these
LifeSource packs.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.940
Good deal.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.260
I've really been enjoying them and I think
you will too.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.670
I think I'm going to put some in my plane.
