This is us having a good time at Christmas.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.200
This is our first Christmas party ever.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.100
We don't normally have a Christmas party

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.953
... but this year is an exception.

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:23.108
Yeah.

00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:25.092
We just don't have enough money to pay for heat.

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:27.540
Four guys.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.466
Body heat, man.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.700
We tried decorating the place.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.740
I bought a tree.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.730
Tree's a little bit small

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.805
... but it's perfect for our setting.

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:38.185
... because we only have 4 guys together.

00:00:38.573 --> 00:00:40.673
So my girlfriend wanted a cat or a dog...

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.154
...but that's way too expensive

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.020
So I gave her the next best thing... 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.020
I made her a handcrafted gift.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.140
Seriously, what the fk do you do with a SOCK PUPPET?

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.560
A SOCK PUPPET!

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.260
That's amazing and great...

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.380
...for a 4 year old.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.580
I got my girlfriend something so practical.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.300
What can I really say about that Swiffer?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.340
He's only used it 2 or 3 times.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.380
This is disgusting.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.820
My girlfriend is really health conscious...

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.740
...so I got her a box of my favourite goodies.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.360
Every year!

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.520
What about you Bri?

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:13.546
I got her a DVD.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.880
DVD?

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.960
That's the worst present ever.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.020
Might as well give her like a floppy disk.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.420
But not like a normal DVD...

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.420
... I burned all my YouTube videos onto it.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.480
I don't want to watch this sh!t. Oh my god.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.240
He's gonna lose his girlfriend for sure.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.340
We have a gift exchange...

00:01:29.503 --> 00:01:31.060
...and our maximum dollar value is $5.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.480
Oh wow. Sausages man!

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.920
So yummy!

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.880
He seemed to like the sausages.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.800
Aw, batteries!

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.340
Saving money on electricity bills. Score!

00:01:44.753 --> 00:01:48.433
...at least there's a few left over in here. It's great.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.340
I got the LIFE OF BRI Season 1 DVD.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Yay.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.200
I don't even know what I'm going to do with it.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.540
I don't even have a DVD player.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.640
Hey guys!

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.418
Merry Christmas!

00:02:21.418 --> 00:02:23.066
Thanks for watching the video.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:25.420
We want to know what is the worst Christmas present...

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.440
... you guys have gotten.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.660
Let us know in the comments below.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.640
Best christmas gift, I ever got...

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.320
...was a box of icecream.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.720
So good. I ate that thing all day.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.780
Put more water in...

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.580
...freeze it, unlimited ice-cream.
