What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.370
Buzzwords are great.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.220
They make us feel like we're all a part of
a community, speaking the same language.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.230
And when it comes to working out there's definitely
a lot of them.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.410
Today I'm going to cover the 6 biggest fitness
buzzwords and how quick the cool factor can

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.140
wear off if we start to misuse them.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.400
So let's get started right away.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.600
We'll go through each one, one by one.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.619
Alright let's start it all off here with one
of my favorite, right off the bat, Functional

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.619
Training.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:37.540
You see as a Physical Therapist sometimes
we get accused of being Functional Trainers.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.610
Well take a look at this clip here.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:40.890
Is this Functional Training?

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.580
So someone said yes.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.890
I'll tell you, yes it is too.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.740
Especially if you're looking to compete in
the Bosu Balls Olympics and win a gold medal.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.820
Where that gold medal is given out to the
person that looks the most like a monkey f***ing

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.300
a football.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.550
You see Functional Training is never defined
by the activity that you're doing, it should

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.330
be determined by the purpose of that activity
for you.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.140
See if you're a Bodybuilder then doing bodybuilding
workouts is functional for you.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.110
If you're a Powerlifter doing powerlifting
movements is functional for you.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.350
Here at ATHLEANX what's functional for us
is to function like athletes.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.000
So we're going to have to do speed training.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.690
We're going to have to do agility training.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.360
We're going to do classic strength training.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.541
We're going to build our power.

00:01:19.541 --> 00:01:23.690
All these things get wrapped up together so
that not only do we look more athletic, but

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.960
we can function like one as well.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.350
It will never by about trading in our barbells,
and our benches and our dumbbells for Bosu

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.220
Balls and Stability Balls.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.030
Purpose will always dictate your function.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.140
Next up, CNS Burnout.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.240
Look I get it, we love our acronyms here in
fitness.That's what I mean, let me give you

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.240
an example.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.562
You see, if you're 1RM ATG Squats from your
W.O.D. are giving you DOMS maybe you should

00:01:48.562 --> 00:01:51.350
start doing AMRAP workouts or a little bit
of H.I.I.T.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.350
Cardio,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.790
and then make sure you get enough BCAA'S and
MRP'S to avoid total CNS Burnout.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.150
See what I mean.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.820
Oh yeah you'll hear a lot about CNS Burnout
these days.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.030
If you head to the gym you'll hear pretty
much everyone talking about it, everyone's

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.100
suffering from it.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.280
You get 22 minutes on that Cardio instead
of 25, it's because of CNS Burnout, Bro.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.819
If you get maybe 12 reps instead of 15, it's
because that CNS is sizzling and you just

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.819
can't get anything else.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.630
Anybody that show up to the gym tired, CNS.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.520
Now we all know, overtraining is a very real
phenomena.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.940
We talk about it many times here on this channel.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.980
And there's real value to the fact that people
who train, following programs that don't vary

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.000
your volumes in a systematic way, will eventually
lead to overtraining.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.700
Especially if you're not sleeping properly
and eating right.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.610
But, blaming everything on CNS Burnout as
a convenient excuse to not workout hard, is

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.950
not the right answer.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.010
So ease up a little bit on this and push a
little bit more in the gym.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.900
You're likely going to be able to push right
through that normal fatigue that we all feel

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.140
from time to time.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.849
Next up, another favorite of mine as a Physical
Therapist is Mobility.

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.239
See these days Physical Therapists are of
course the Mobility specialists and everybody

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.260
know that they need Mobility Drills, or do
they?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.819
You see, a mobile joint is always going to
be sandwiched between two stable joints.

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.120
In the case of your hips, that's a more mobile
joint that people like to address through

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.790
mobility drills.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.569
But your low back better be stable and your
knee below better be stable in order to support

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.430
the mobility that's going on in the middle.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.860
People get carried away.

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.090
Everything becomes more mobile.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.311
They're working on mobility drills for their
fingers, their wrist, their elbows, their

00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:32.569
shoulders, their scapula, it's not the case.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.040
You don't need mobility everywhere and even
in the cases where some joints are supposed

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.440
to be mobile, people will be hypermobile already.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.250
In that case, they don't need mobility drills.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.300
So it's not a one size fits all solution.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.590
You can look at an Ass to Grass Squat, people
think that, that is a great symbol of mobility.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.629
But if you're getting there by sacrificing
mobility in a joint that's supposed to be

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.130
stable and you're not getting it through a
joint that supposed to be mobile,

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.239
then that's just one bad squat!

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.849
Guys, let's start using this buzzword right
or we're going to start hurting ourselves

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.640
pretty bad in the gyms.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.480
Mobility is needed for some and it's certainly
not needed for all.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.879
And especially not needed for all joints and
everybody.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.159
Next up number 4, another one of my favorites,
Clean Eating.

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.690
Look, if you have to tell people that you
eat clean, you don't.

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.610
See people that eat clean don't say that,
they just eat right.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.810
And they eat the way they eat.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.840
And if you Eat Clean then that means there's
times when you don't Eat Clean.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.470
It's like I say all the time, if you're on
a diet eventually you're going to be off a

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:33.470
diet.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.600
So we have to start trading in the use of
clean eating for the way we eat with a lifestyle

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.100
plan and a lifestyle approach to eating.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.361
Eat healthily all year round and you won't
be eating clean or dieting at any point in

00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.361
your year.

00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:50.550
You'll be eating right all 365 days out of
the year.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.710
Next up, one that's became pretty popular
of late your W.O.D, your Workout Of the Day.

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.500
You see, I don't know at what point working
out became Pot Luck Dinner.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.800
But for me, the next workout for me is the
next workout in my program.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.710
The Workout Of the Day implies that today
this is what I'm doing.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.810
Not any relevance to what I did yesterday,
no relevance to what I do tomorrow.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.240
And if that is your approach to working out,
then you're just exercising.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.730
You see, if you go at your workouts with a
plan that systematically builds on what you

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.800
did yesterday

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.390
and sets you up to become better at what you're
going to do tomorrow, then that's training.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.120
I think it's time that we start doing a little
bit more training and a little bit less of

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.120
these W.O.D.'s

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.900
and you'll be a lot further on down that path
of what you want to be and look like and function

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.820
like by doing so.

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.680
Last but not least and one of the ones that's
been bothering me now for years, it's Core

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680
Training.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.160
You see guys all the time walking around the
gym saying, hold on, I've got to do a little

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.260
bit of core training, I've got to get a little
bit of core workout.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.620
Before I leave let's do a couple core exercises
and they always point right here to their

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.620
Abs.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.620
What does that mean?

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.080
Does it mean that it's just right here in
your Abs, a lot of people think that.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.170
That's not the case guys, if you realize that
all those muscles that we focus on,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.370
the rectus abdominis, and our obliques and
all the other muscles that actually have attachments

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.180
to our pelvis and back through our spine.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.620
We realize that the core is about much more
than just your Abs.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.240
Matter of fact, even movement in our peripheral
joints, like our arms and our legs can start

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.240
influencing our core.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.130
If you're going to start pointing to your
core, you better start learning to point all

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.220
over your body because your core can be influenced
by every single move you do.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.289
And here at ATHLEANX, I always say, we put
the core back at the core of every exercise.

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:31.990
Everything we do, every way we train you in
all of our workouts, there's a heavy involvement

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.990
of core

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.100
because we realize that the core is going
to basically involve all of your muscles in

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.290
your body, especially if you train athletically.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.430
In the meantime, if you're looking for a training
program that teaches you not just the buzzwords

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.020
but how to use them and how to use them the
right way,

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:52.289
then head to ATHLEANX.COM, ASAP, and get the
ATHLEANX Training System.

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.070

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.000
Alright guys, in the meantime, TTYL.
