Hi, I'm Tim Phang.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.520
I'm 23 years old.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.480
I've been skating for about 12 years.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.430
I'm from Arlington, Virginia which is right
outside of Washington, D.C.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:19.240
I'm now sponsored by Universal Skate Design,
and I'm going to be talking to you about rollerblading.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.900
Learning to aggressive skate, I recommend
that you make sure that you have a good pair

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.380
of aggressive skates uh skates that are made
for trying tricks.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.949
Generally they have a larger space uh in-between
the central wheels that will give you more

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.110
room to grind, they also won't have a brake
uh brakes are pretty dangerous when you are

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.090
learning to aggressive skate, uh they tend
to get in your way, they can get stuck on

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.180
things and force you essentially to fall pretty
hard, also if you just learning how to skate,

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.970
you might want to consider using small wheels
in the center of your frame that will give

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.100
you a little bit of extra room here uh that
way you don't have to worry about them catching

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.010
when you are trying to grind something.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.600
Uh when you come to a skating park you want
to be sure that you are courteous to other

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.450
people uh you know, if you give respect you
give respect and uh in a skate part taking

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.030
turns uh just understanding sort of where
other people are in the park and knowing what

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.630
their general lines are that they take through
the park.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.289
If lot of people are skating in one direction
you generally don't want to skate uh in the

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:23.000
opposite direction uh you don't want to be
in everybody's way.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.700
Of course I always wearer the correct safety
gear, uh some of the best advice I can give

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.369
is make sure that you have the basics down
before you come out to a skate park uh and

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.929
trying to do something that is sort of above
your skill level.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.409
It is really, really important if you want
to prevent injury and continue, and continue

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.100
to able to skate that you uh that you learn
the basics first, that you gradually work

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.100
your way up to the harder stuff.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.780
You should always skate in a location where
you know it is safe to skate.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.079
Uh for aggressive skating you should always
have the permission to skate the area that

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.950
you and do tricks on that area that you are
skating, there is lot of liabilities involved

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
and uh you could get in lot of trouble for
skating in places that you are not suppose

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.050
to, so I definitely recommend coming out to
some place of a skate park if there is one

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.500
close to, if not you can always build your
own obstacles you can build small rails and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.150
things about nature and set them up around
your house.
