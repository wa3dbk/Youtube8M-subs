00:00:00.272 --> 00:00:05.085
(quiet music)

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.479
- [Voiceover] I said I was sorry, okay?

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.779
- No worries, I can
just get more tomorrow.

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.519
- [Voiceover] You need
to label your stuff.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.739
- Okay, totally.

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:14.958
Alright, will do.

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.239
Goodnight.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.235
Actually I think what you said was

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:21.313
"I'm sorry you're so pissed off."

00:00:21.313 --> 00:00:25.132
So like, technically, not an apology.

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:28.240
Also Bridget, why do I
need to label something

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.022
that you didn't buy?

00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:32.931
Like, how do you function
at the grocery store?

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:36.495
Just walk in, "Oh my
god, is this all for me?"

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:37.686
No.

00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:39.850
Hey girl, it's me.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.916
Um, new Bridget story.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:44.309
Today I walked home and right when I,

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.435
oh, you know what?

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:48.693
Too long for voicemail, okay
call me when you get this.

00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:50.063
I love you.

00:00:50.063 --> 00:00:51.149
Bye.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.694
Okay, what's happened in the
world of Instagram today?

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.424
Oh, that's why you couldn't answer.

00:00:59.424 --> 00:01:03.660
You are adorably riding
bikes with your new friends.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.351
Okay, I can Instagram too.

00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.333
Yeah, let's see.

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:17.510
I will call this one
"Friday Night with Bay".

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:20.112
Perfect.

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:25.042
We'll just go with "LOL,
finally started drinking alone."

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.104
TBT to when I had friends.

00:01:29.104 --> 00:01:31.344
Okay, it'll be fine,

00:01:31.344 --> 00:01:34.677
when I make my hilarious
group of new friends.

00:01:34.677 --> 00:01:39.677
So long as they like "Toddlers
and Tiaras" we will be great.

00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:45.951
Because that is the only thing
I have going on right now.

00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:52.830
Should I just move home? (scoffs)

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.120
It'll get better, I mean, it has to.

00:01:58.924 --> 00:02:03.924
Here we go, on the upside
got some extra fried rice.

00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:05.176
Yay.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:08.376
It's good,

00:02:08.376 --> 00:02:13.108
extra fried rice, yay!

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.202
(sighs)

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:24.878
Yay.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:29.830
(vintage film reel and modem sounds)
