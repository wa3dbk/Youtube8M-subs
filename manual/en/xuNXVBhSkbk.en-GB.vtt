00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.690
We have six videos to shoot here in Germany.
A lot of them are going to be pretty tough

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.430
and tricks we’ve never done before. So we
are kind of stretching ourselves and

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.640
stretching our techniques. But we are excited, because we have a great crew and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.599
a lot of people willing to help us out.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.599
We are trying to get the car to drift right
now. So we are doing a lot of practice runs,

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.000
going around and round. Trying to get the
right momentum and speed.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.469
Vines are really cool for me, because you
get to tell a story in seven seconds with

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.000
the beginning, middle and end.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.630
So right now I am going to do the extra splashes, splashing me from the ground.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.920
Right now we are putting the camera up
on a higher place, so we can get the angle

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.070
that we need. And we are trying to show this other SUV and then the ADAM ROCKS is coming in

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.000
and I am grabbing it and it becomes a fabric picture.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.500
Yeah, vines and the process to make a vine totally changes every single time, even like today.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.530
Sometimes we use green screens, sometimes we freeze in the positions. So there is totally

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.500
tons of techniques that we are doing to make these videos.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You know, when we plan it, we have to map our storyboard how it’s going to look on camera

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.180
and then when we go to shoot it in production, we got to make sure that’s one hundred percent right,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.640
whether we are using green screen
or getting the right angle and perspective.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.819
Yeah, I always say to people who want to get into vines for the first time, make content

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.770
you love to make. Because if it takes off, that’s the kind of content people are going to expect you to make.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.870
And so I love what I do and that’s
why I have been able to continue to make it successful.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.310
Because I put my heart in every
video. I am not just doing it because a lot

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.430
of people are seeing it. I do it just because
I love doing it.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.040
A lot of random things happened since I’ve
been on Vine. Like for example Opel contacting me

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.190
to come to Germany. That’s crazy! So,
we have had so much fun just from the opportunities

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.840
that have come, because of making these seven second videos. Like who would have thought that! 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.610
Yeah, very cool car. I like the color too!
