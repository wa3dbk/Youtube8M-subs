00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm measuring my inside height of the jamb,
of the screen door from the sill to the inside of the brickmould.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.520
Also measuring inside of
brickmould to inside of brickmould, make sure

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.000
my door will fit.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.500
The legs on your screen
door will be longer for different sized jambs. You will have to cut them.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700
Before I cut I'm going to clamp the side to the jamb to the

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.500
door to alleviate the bounce back. Now I'm
going to take my sawzall (reciprocating saw) with a metal cutting

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.600
blade and cut my leg where I previously marked.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.600
I've made my cuts on the frame, now I'm going

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:16.800
to prefit it into the door. Bottom will go
in first. Then I'll slightly tip the top in.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.500
Now that I have my door in the openings, I'm
going to predrill my jamb screws.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.580
Starting at the top corner on the hinge side.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.700
Now that I've predrilled my hinge side hole locations,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.230
I'm going to use the colored screws supplied
in the kit. Do not over tighten these screws,

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:56.140
it will bind the hinge side of the frame.
Now that I have the screws in on the hinge

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.000
side, now I'm going to go to the knob side.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.500
Now that I have the knob side tightened with

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.510
two screws I will remove the shipping clips
that come with the pre-hung.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.100
Now that I've removed the clips, I will predrill

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.140
and screw in the knob side frame.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.200
Now that I've predrilled the hinge side jamb I will be fastening.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.200
Now I'm going to set the sweep and the threshold on the bottom of the door.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.170
This here will move up and down. I'm going to set that roughly 1/8" from the bottom of the sill.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.000
That will allow for compression on your sweep.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.600
Now coming outside, since we've adjusted our

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.620
threshold and sweep on our door, we are going to put the set screw in.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.500
I have predrilled it, in the middle of the slotted area for future adjustment.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.400
With the door closed I'm going to take the instructions

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.569
that are in with the windstrap, I'm going
to fold it in half along the dotted line,

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:00.569
I'm going to place it in the corner and go
over and mark my holes.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:10.400
I've attached my windstrap in the holes that were predrilled.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.500
Now I'm attaching it to the header with the flat part being to the outside.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.400
Now installing the closer.
I took my door bracket, installed that in

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.190
the predrilled holes, measured from the sill
to the center of the bracket to determine

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:58.100
my jamb bracket. I installed my jamb bracket
with an arrow pointing to the door, 1/4 to

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.150
1/2 inch back from my door. I'm putting the
spring on the closer with the stop. Installing

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:16.000
it into the jamb bracket. Installing it into
the door bracket.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.700
Installing the handle set,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:38.300
we'll take the pieces out of the package,
we'll put the spring, the inside handle set,

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.000
and the two screws.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:54.300
Open up the door, apply
the outside handle set, the inside handle

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:01.320
set you'll have to fit the fitting on there
and turn it. You'll be lining this up with

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.000
the outside handle.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.700
With the door closed,
I marked the top, bottom of my strike plate,

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:20.790
and the center of the hole locations to predrill
the holes, which I've already done.

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.810
Now that I've installed the strike plate, bottom will
be for the dead bolt, the top will be for

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:41.000
the latch. Now I've installed the screen retainer
clips. I'll be putting in the screen, tightening

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.040
the clips, hand tighten.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:55.900
Now that everything's installed, just making one last check.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.800
And that's an Acclimated Storm Door from Bayer Built.
