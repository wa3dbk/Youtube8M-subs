00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.170
[Music Playing] In todays episode, I am going to show you
how to alter the sound of cymbals just by

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.370
a simple microphone adjustment.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
You would be surprised that with subtle adjustments
of where you place the overhead mic and how

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.049
it can shape the sound of your cymbals.

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.730
Not only can it change the attack of the cymbal,
it also is a great trick for sculpting the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.500
high end of cymbals especially when working
with budget cymbals or when tone crafting

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.140
your mixes ahead of time so you do not have
to use EQ when you mix.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.839
I am Ryan and you are watching Creative
Sound Lab. It is a weekly recording show with

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:35.920
recording tips, pointers, and off the wall
recording tips.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.649
I would like to present to you
a new idea today and it is about the idea of

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.309
tuning the sound of your cymbals.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.989
Cymbals are actually pretty expensive. Most
drummers really do not have any extra money

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.600
to buy tons of extra cymbals so really when
you are recording a band sometimes your just

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.829
stuck with whatever the drummer brought in
that day. You typically do not have any options

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.080
to swipe out various cymbals for a better
set, if whatever you have is not working for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.810
you.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.920
And so I would like to suggest that by using
a method I am going to show you today, you

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
can actually tune and kind of scoop out certain
frequencies that may be harsh on the ears.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.100
Let us check it out.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.689
We are going to start off with a budget ride
cymbal, the Sabian B8.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.689
This is with the microphone over the bell.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.229
Over the floor tom.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.920
Over the drummers shoulder.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:15.220
Here is all three positions back-to-back.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.310
Next we are going to hear a K Zildjian Ride.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.720
Next we are going to hear a K Custom Dark
Ride.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.620
This was just with one mic and
if you add a second mic it is a bonus

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.120
idea is that you have now two positions. You
have two different angles of attack on these

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.460
cymbals. So one microphone may be getting
a little bit more character of one cymbal

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.850
and as that cymbal is swaying the other mic
is getting a slightly different character

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.650
of that cymbal at a different time. As the
cymbal rocks it kind of makes a little bit

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.570
of a swirling sound.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:53.150
Now we had talked in a previous issue about
the Glyn Johns Method about how there is actually

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.810
a null at the edge of that cymbal and if you
go to the extreme where a mic is so far down

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.490
so far low there is actually this void of
sound and it creates this cancellation where

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.760
the cymbal actually jumps. This is not that.
This is more of a subtle effect. If you are

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.310
hard panning a spaced pair of overheads. Just
by having two different angles of attack on

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.270
the cymbals there actually is a slight swirling
sound that you get that is actually pretty

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.580
cool. I actually find it pretty pleasing when
it comes to mix the tracks.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.120
Now if you found this helpful today, there
is actually a ton that I had to leave out

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:36.020
for the sake of time. I have a free downloadable
PDF guide that covers drum stick types such

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:43.020
as barrel tips, round tips, even nylon tips.
I also cover how to select cymbals. So the

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.360
make and model for certain different genres
and when they would be appropriate for those

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.570
genres.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.370
So I really hope to see you over at CreativeSoundLab.TV.
I will see you next week.
