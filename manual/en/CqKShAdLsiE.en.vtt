00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.075
(pleasant music)

00:00:03.075 --> 00:00:03.908
- Hi, I'm Lance Armstrong.

00:00:03.908 --> 00:00:05.750
7-time winner of the Tour De France.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.810
(dinging)

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.690
Hey, I didn't write the script.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.490
And today I'm gonna teach you
how to change a flat tire.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.310
Alright, so first you
release the quick release.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.383
Take the tire out of the bike.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.020
Couple tire irons here, sometimes you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050
need two, sometimes you
can get away with one.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.940
Some tires are a little harder to get off.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.640
This one actually seems like...

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.490
Thank goodness was easy.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.780
Run it all the way around and
got the little thing here...

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.828
Take that off.

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:35.600
(popping)

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.470
I'm doing pretty good for a guy

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.010
that just learned how to do this.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.823
Take out the punctured tube.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.750
What sometimes people always forget to do

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.620
is to check the tire, because obviously

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.910
you got a flat tire for some reason

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.560
unless you had some sort of a pinch,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560
but a lot of times you'll have a piece

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.690
of glass or a thorn in there.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.160
So you just run your hand through there

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.250
and hope that that piece of glass

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.963
or thorn doesn't cut you.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.550
Take your new tube...

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.750
Take all this stuff off.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.810
See this little black thing?

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.590
Don't put that back on when you're done.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.980
Never.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.140
What I like to do is, if you had a pump,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.180
a lot of times you can just blow into it.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.280
I like to put a little air into it.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.113
So just...

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.090
It'll go back in easier.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.033
Tube back in there.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.534
The key here is to make
sure that the tube itself

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:32.071
is totally inside the casing of the tire.

00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:32.904
Take it...

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:35.923
And just roll it on there.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.050
All right.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.286
If you're at home, just
take your floor pump.

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:45.060
(air pumping)

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.893
And there ya go!

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.340
Just like new!

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.782
And then, make sure that's on.

00:01:52.782 --> 00:01:53.714
There ya go.

00:01:53.714 --> 00:01:54.547
Off ya go.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.863
Broke a sweat doing that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.750
(pleasant music)
