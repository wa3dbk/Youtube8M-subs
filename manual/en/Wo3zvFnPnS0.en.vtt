DIXON GILLETTE: Welcome back to Expert Village,
my name is Dixon Gillette and let's continue

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.170
our tutorial on Microsoft Flight Simulator
X. All right, time to talk a little bit about

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.400
how to make an aircraft stall, and how to
recover from a stall. Another one of those

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.460
great myths is that when an aircraft stalls,
you usually think it has something to do with

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.340
the aircraft's engine; it has nothing to do
with the aircraft's engine. It has everything

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.220
to do with the amount of lift that that wing
is currently producing, or in the case of

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.820
a stall not producing. A stall happens when
your aircraft reaches a critical angle of

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.829
attack, and does foils any airflow able to
come over that wing resulting in a loss of

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.420
lift and a severe sudden drop in altitude
with your aircraft. These are extremely dangerous

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.960
especially on approach to landings and directly
after take off. Keep in mind, every wing at

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.109
a given configuration will stall at the same
angle of attack. Now, keep in mind the angle

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.949
of attack at which your wing stalls is not
the same thing as the angle of your pitch.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:09.310
A lot of pilots will confuse this factor and
get themselves into a lot of trouble. Generally,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.290
you can tell the onset of a stall by having
a high angle of attack and soon your aircraft

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.160
will begin buffeting or shaking a little bit.
If your aircraft is equipped with a warning

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.780
buzzer or a stall horn, this stall buzzer
will go off, just moments before your aircraft's

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.350
nose drop sharply sending you either into
a spin, or a direct nose-down maneuver straight

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.810
to the ground. To recover from a stall you
simply nose over your aircraft, decreasing

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.490
its angle of attack to the relative wing.
Now, keep in mind, all aircraft lose different

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.770
amounts of altitude, so when you're practicing
your stall recovery, make sure you have quite

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.000
a bit of altitude underneath you. Now, you
can see why this will be important, because

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.020
when you do practice this, you'll notice how
much altitude your aircraft will lose. So,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.360
it makes it especially critical to always
pay attention to your angle of attack on landing

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.350
and take offs.
