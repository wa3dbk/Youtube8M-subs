00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:09.019
 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.139
Hi everyone. This is Warframe a PlayStation 4, free to play title

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.250
and it first came out on PC last year I
think

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.789
and it's actually really good fun. Now
it's effectively a multiplayer game

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.490
and it's kind of a co-op game so it's you and
your friends versus the computer

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.859
and each stage as it were, each level,

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.759
has various missions you have to
complete. Now it might be

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.160
trying to kidnap somebody, it might be to
terminate a particular target,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.969
or find a particular set of information or help your computer guide

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.180
to hack in. Now the graphics

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.410
like I say are absolutely fantastic. It's using the Unreal Engine to really good effect here

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.399
and everything about this game does
scream quality. It's a AAA

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.750
title even though it's free to play. The

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.109
dynamic between the guns and the blade
play work

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.590
really really well. At range you're going to be
wanting to rely on those guns

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.730
and up-close you're going to need your blade. At times the game can be be quite

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.710
overwhelming with how many enemies it's
throwing at you even when you've got three of your mates

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.659
helping you out. Overall the progression system in this game

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.930
works really well. It is a free to play
title, that means that

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.409
you know, there is the in-app purchases
there but you don't particularly

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.640
have to go with them. The in-app purchases basically are for extra weaponry

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.659
and so on and yes, it is a little bit of a

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.950
pay to win formula going on here but
because it's not

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.000
an NMO style game as such, it's not player versus player it

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.310
doesn't really matter quite so much. Think of this as more of kind like a Diablo 3

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399
style game but obviously in the third person.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.590
It works incredibly well and there's a lot
of fun here.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.860
My only criticism and this is really more of a choice of the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.290
designers when they were creating the worlds, things can feel a little dark at times.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.079
It is quite a dark game, but that said
with

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.659
some flashes of light from the weaponry it
does happen to create a

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.240
great sci-fi environment. You do get a
certain Gears of War vibe going on with this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.659
game

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.240
but that's not a bad thing. It's a very
well executed game.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720
