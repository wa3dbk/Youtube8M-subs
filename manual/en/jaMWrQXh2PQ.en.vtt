00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.280
SPEAKER 1: Schiphol Amsterdam
International Airport, one of the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.440
world's largest airports.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.150
Here over 50 million passengers are
handled on a yearly basis, almost

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.360
three times the entire
Dutch population.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.360
These numbers show that air transport
has become fully integrated in the

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.205
modern society.

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:42.660

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.850
SPEAKER 1: Things have not
always been like this.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.260
JACCO HOEKSTRA: At the end of the Middle
Ages, we already knew a lot.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.370
Christian Huygens was already laying the
foundation for the general theory

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.120
of relativity, and Leonardo da
Vinci even tried to design

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.184
and understand airplanes.

00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:05.670
Still, actually flying remained beyond
the capabilities of mankind for

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.300
another 300 years, until the Wright
brothers were able to take off in the

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.490
first powered aircraft
to carry one person.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.680
And then, enormous progress
in the 20th century.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.980
Imagine the astonishment of the Wright
brothers, if they would be able to see

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.030
what we can do today.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.520
SPEAKER 1: Now there are loads
of questions to be answered.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.250
JACCO HOEKSTRA: Why did it take
so long for mankind to fly?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.960
What were the difficulties?

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.675
What are the basic principles?

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:40.990
And what were the technological
breakthroughs which caused this rapid

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.980
increase of our capabilities
in the 20th century?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.780
SPEAKER 1: These and many other issues
which must intrigue you will be

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.850
addressed in Introduction to
Aeronautical Engineering, given by

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.630
Delft University of Technology.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.650
JACCO HOEKSTRA: So enroll this course,
because if you board this course, your

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.840
knowledge in aeronautics
will truly take off.
