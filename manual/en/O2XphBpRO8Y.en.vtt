00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:43.800
Youíll have to pardon my lack of enthusiasm
here.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.320
Because itís not at all about the quality
of this game.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.280
Iím not telling you this is a bad video gameóalthough
I have a slight argument over the application

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.329
of the term video game.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.429
This is more like a video.

00:00:55.429 --> 00:01:11.920
Stop there, and youíd be more accurate.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.980
I used to really like this game, but I donít
anymore.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.090
And I think I should make this abundantly
clearójust because I donít like something

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.280
doesnít mean I think it sucks.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.220
People get inexplicably defensive about things
like this, and the last thing I want to initiate

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.180
here is some kind of idiotic flame war.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.060
Bloated, boring, all words Iíd use to describe
Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.390
But wait, waitóbecause, my personal views
on a game that only lets you grab a backpack

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.950
within its first 40 minutes aside, Iíd also
call it an amazing 3DS game.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700
That is, if youíre into this kind of thing.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.030
And call it a hunch, but Iím assuming a vast
majority of gamers are.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.030
And thatís fine.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.850
In fact, I wish I still had the patience for
this.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.710
Snake Eater is a phenomenal experience as
a whole, provided youíre willing to invest

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:19.519
a substantial amount of time into what is
largely a passive interactive experience.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.640
I know Iíve been doing more editorializing
up to this point than reviewing, and thatís

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.730
because I made this major realization about
the evolution of my tastes in gaming when

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.390
returning to Snake Eater on the 3DS.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.300
That said, if you want a full review of Metal
Gear Solid 3...we have that here on CGRundertow.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.530
And it should also please you to hear Snakeís
first mission on a Nintendo system in nearly

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.150
a decade is a great one.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:03:02.609
I just wish I still liked playing it.

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:08.310
If youíve never played the game, the storyóand
believe me, thereís a lot of storyóis about

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.769
a CIA operative codenamed Naked Snake.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.920
His mission is to take down a major nuclear
threat in the Soviet Union, and of course,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.719
he does that...by sneaking through forests
and stuff.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:26.439
This is a very smart and very slow stealth
game predicated upon immersion, deliberateness

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.489
and ultimately, patience.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.760
But speaking more specifically about this
3DS version, this is a fantastic port.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.999
Snake Eater looks incredible on Nintendoís
portable, and its implementation of 3D visuals

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:41.139
is among the best weíve seen.

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:47.290
The problem, of course, is that the 3DS doesnít
have a second analog stickóat least, not

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.290
standard.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.310
And Snake Eater was designed to be played
with one.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.999
So unless youíre playing with an ugly plastic
tumor attached to your system, it takes some

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.189
time to get used to the controls on the 3DS.

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.290
You move the camera with the face buttons
and crouch with the d-pad, neither of which

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.540
feels quite right.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.439
Fortunately, you can actually walk while crouching
in this 3DS version, which is a nice addiction

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.310
from prior versions of the game that compensates
for some of the awkwardness.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.240
But apart from that, Snake Eater 3D is, in
most ways, an improvement.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.650
Itís just that, I donít know...I guess Iím
at a point in my life where games with such

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.900
an overwhelming emphasis on story just arenít
my thing anymore.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.360
But if youíre fortunate enough to still be
interested in watching Snakeís story unfold

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.530
and occasionally being asked to participate,
the legendary Snake Eater is even better in

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.000
3D.
