My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.019
to shuck an oyster and how to prepare them
a couple of different ways. Okay, so I'm going

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:18.310
to turn on our burner here. Turn it down to
about an eight, it's a nice like medium high.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.050
And so the first thing we're going to do is
we're going to throw our butter in there.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.220
So you want that to melt. And you can actually
speed this process up by, you can cut your

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.649
butter into smaller pieces if you want, or
you can actually soften your butter at room

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.890
temperature, which is what I did with it.
You can see how soft it is, it is nice and

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.489
mushy. So what we're going to do is melt our
butter first. Then we're going to saute our

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.890
onions just for a little bit. You don't want
to cook all the, you don't want to cook them

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.620
until they're brown. Something else you can
do at this point, which is optional, some

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.910
people add bacon at this point and do bacon
instead of butter. That's a nice way of doing

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.579
it too. The traditional way though is butter.
The traditional way also has Pernell in it,

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.430
which I'm not going to use. The traditional
way also doesn't have spinach in it. The traditional

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.619
way actually has watercress and parsley which,
in my opinion, don't work out nearly as well.

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.329
But that's just my opinion. Alright, so my
butter is melting, so this is a good time

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:34.200
to add my onions right in, make sure I get
all of them. So if your butter gets too hot,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.810
all that's going to happen is you're going
to actually start really cooking your onions

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.500
and that's not what you really want to do
here. You just want to get some color out

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:55.729
of them, kind of a just soften them up, we're
not trying to turn them all brown. So, we'll

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.200
come back to this, well actually we'll let
this go for probably about two minutes. So,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.090
if you want, you can be like, set your timer
and we'll come back in two minutes.
