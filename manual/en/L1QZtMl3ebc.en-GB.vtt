00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.300
10) The McGurk Effect
What you see can override what you hear. In

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:40.379
a study, people viewing a crime scene confused
the phrase ""He's got your boot"" with ""He's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.460
gonna shoot”.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:01:09.160
9) Change Blindness
You can miss changes before your eyes as the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:24.930
brain doesn't take in all visual stimuli.
In a study 50% of people didn’t notice that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.930
the person they were giving directions to
became someone else mid-conversation.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:26.930
8) The Size-Weight Illusion
The brain can confuse the size of an object

00:01:26.930 --> 00:02:07.450
and it's expected weight. Thus a large box
will feel lighter than a small box of equal

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.599
weight.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:43.230
7) Inattentional Blindness
The inability to see something in plain sight

00:02:43.230 --> 00:03:27.939
as you are focused on something else. A cop,
Kenny Conley, lost his job after he was so

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:32.542
focused on chasing a suspect that he failed
to notice a violent attack.

00:03:32.542 --> 00:03:33.542
6) Sniff and Spend
Shops use certain scents to create an emotional

00:03:33.542 --> 00:03:34.542
connection with customers.
Researchers found that shoppers in the presence

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:35.650
of an orange scent spent on average 20% more.

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.203
5) Pinocchio Illusion
Our ability to sense the position of our body

00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:38.203
parts can be confused by stimulating muscles.
Touching your nose while stimulating arm muscles

00:03:38.203 --> 00:03:39.203
creates a false sensation that your nose is
growing.

00:03:39.203 --> 00:03:40.203
4) Eyes Change The Taste Of Food
The color of food affects how we taste it.

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:41.203
Scientists tricked wine experts into thinking
white wine tasted like red wine, just by changing

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:42.203
the liquid's color.

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:43.203
3) Nonconscious Process
30 areas in our brain process vision. Mistakes

00:03:43.203 --> 00:03:44.203
occur when a pattern associated with danger
is recognised before we consciously process

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:45.203
it. e.g. we can mistake a clump of hair for
a spider.

00:03:45.203 --> 00:03:46.203
2) The Rubber Hand Illusion
Scientists placed a rubber hand in front of

00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:47.203
participants &amp; stroked it simultaneously to
their real hand.

00:03:47.203 --> 00:03:48.203
The rubber hand felt like it belonged to their
body &amp; the temperature of their real hand

00:03:48.203 --> 00:03:49.203
dropped.

00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:50.203
1) Saccadic Masking
During eye movements the brain ignores what

00:03:50.203 --> 00:03:51.203
we see so we don’t experience motion blur.
Cumulatively this means we are temporarily

00:03:51.203 --> 00:03:51.212
blind 30-45 mins a day - 2% of our lives.
