00:00:01.622 --> 00:00:02.803
Voiceover: Today we're gonna talk about

00:00:02.803 --> 00:00:05.740
Michaelis-Menten kinetics
and the steady-state.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.608
First, let's review the idea

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:10.430
that enzymes make reactions go faster

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.279
and that we can divide
the enzymes catalysis

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.647
into two steps.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:15.916
First the binding of enzyme to substrate

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:18.385
and second the formation of products.

00:00:18.385 --> 00:00:21.121
Each of these reactions has its own rate.

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:22.522
Let's also review the idea

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:25.527
that if we keep the
concentration of enzyme constant

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:27.628
then a really high
substrate concentrations

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.953
will hit the maximum speed for a reaction

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:31.932
which we call Vmax.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.735
First we'll talk about the
Steady-State Assumption

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.169
and what that means.

00:00:36.169 --> 00:00:37.904
Like I said before there are two steps

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.973
to an enzyme's catalysis.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.942
Now when we use the term steady-state

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:43.210
what we mean is that we're at a point

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.845
where the concentration of ES

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:47.347
or enzyme substrate complex is constant

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:48.996
which means that the formation of ES

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:51.718
is equal to the loss
or dissociation of ES.

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:54.121
Now notice that I've
used equilibrium arrows

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:55.155
between these steps

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:56.223
and that was to show the idea

00:00:56.223 --> 00:00:58.359
that these reactions like any reaction

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.795
can go forwards or backwards.

00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:02.229
Our enzyme substrate complex

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.231
doesn't have to form products.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.465
It could just as easily dissociate

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.701
back to an enzyme and
a substrate molecule.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.617
I'll call these reverse
reactions minus one

00:01:10.617 --> 00:01:12.172
and minus two.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:13.774
If we look at that in terms of our rates

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:16.310
we can say that the
rate of formation of ES

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.120
would be the sum of rate
one and rate minus two

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.315
since both of these reactions lead to ES

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:24.309
and the rate of loss of ES

00:01:24.309 --> 00:01:27.588
is equal to the sum of
rates minus one and two

00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:30.426
since both of these lead away from ES.

00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:32.393
Now I also remember that
products very rarely

00:01:32.393 --> 00:01:33.727
go back to reactants

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:36.930
since these reactions are
usually thermodynamically stable.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.366
Rate minus two is going to be so small

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:40.701
in comparison to rate one

00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:42.737
that we can really just cross it out.

00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:43.904
Which means that we can swap out

00:01:43.904 --> 00:01:47.341
that second double headed
for a single headed arrow.

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:49.947
Using this information let's do some math.

00:01:49.947 --> 00:01:51.871
Now I'm going to be
deriving a new equation.

00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:53.180
This can get a bit confusing

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.002
so don't worry if you have
a little trouble with this.

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:56.316
Just rewind the video

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.783
and try watching it a couple
more times if you need to.

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:02.155
I'll start up by drawing the
same sequence I did before

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:03.690
with the three different reactions,

00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:04.825
and I'll also write out

00:02:04.825 --> 00:02:07.427
that steady-state equation
I mentioned before

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.764
where we have rates
forming ES equal to rates

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:11.398
taking away ES.

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:14.003
Now first thing I'll do is
swap out those rate values

00:02:14.003 --> 00:02:15.402
for their rate constants

00:02:15.402 --> 00:02:17.671
times the reactants for those reactions.

00:02:17.671 --> 00:02:21.375
Rate one will be equal
to K one times E times S

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:23.144
and so on for the other two.

00:02:23.144 --> 00:02:24.979
Next I'll introduce a new idea

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.314
and say that the total
amount of enzyme available

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.283
which we'll call ET or E total

00:02:29.283 --> 00:02:31.418
is equal to the free enzyme E

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.755
plus the enzyme bound to substrate or ES.

00:02:34.755 --> 00:02:38.325
Using this equation I'm
going to rewrite the E

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.827
on the left side of our equation

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:42.229
as the total E minus the ES

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:44.565
which would be equal to
the E we had there before.

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.266
On the right side of the equation

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.874
I just factored out the common term ES.

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:50.804
Next I'm just going to expand

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:52.172
the left side of the equation

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:54.234
so take a moment to look at that.

00:02:54.742 --> 00:02:55.937
Now what I'm going to do

00:02:55.937 --> 00:02:59.547
is I'm going to divide both
sides of the equation by K one.

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:01.915
K one will disappear on our left side

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.884
and on our right side I've put K one in

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:05.835
with all the other rate constants.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.923
Now since all these rate
constant are constant values

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:11.221
I'm going to combine
them in this expression

00:03:11.221 --> 00:03:14.195
of K minus one plus K two over K one

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:16.619
into a new term KM

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.232
which I'm going to talk a
little bit more about later.

00:03:19.232 --> 00:03:21.702
In this next line I've done two things.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.364
First I've thrown in that KM value

00:03:23.364 --> 00:03:24.157
that I just mentioned,

00:03:24.157 --> 00:03:27.107
but I've also added ES times S

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:28.601
to both sides of the equations

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.578
and thus moved it from the
left side to the right.

00:03:31.578 --> 00:03:33.880
In the next line I've done two things.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.282
First I switched the left sides

00:03:35.282 --> 00:03:36.617
and right sides of the equation

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:38.096
just to keep things clear,

00:03:38.096 --> 00:03:40.787
but I've also factored
out the common term ES

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.555
on our new left side.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:43.891
Then what I'm gonna do

00:03:43.891 --> 00:03:45.926
is I'm gonna divide both
sides of the equation

00:03:45.926 --> 00:03:47.945
by KM plus S

00:03:47.945 --> 00:03:50.564
so I can move that term to the right side.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.998
I'll make some more room over here

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:53.301
and now what I'm gonna do is remind you

00:03:53.301 --> 00:03:54.968
that the speed of our whole process

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.436
which I'll call Vo

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.905
is equal to the rate of
formation of our product

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:00.874
which we called rate two before

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.844
which is also equal to K two times ES.

00:04:03.844 --> 00:04:05.479
Now using our equation over here

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.347
I'm gonna multiply both
sides of the equation

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.882
by K two.

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.750
Here's where it gets really tricky.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.753
Remember that if we're if at our max speed

00:04:12.753 --> 00:04:15.655
so our reaction speed Vo is equal to Vmax

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:17.158
which happens when our
substrate concentration

00:04:17.158 --> 00:04:18.526
is really high,

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.527
then our total enzyme concentration

00:04:20.527 --> 00:04:22.396
is going to be equal to ES

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:24.832
since all of our enzyme
is saturated by substrate

00:04:24.832 --> 00:04:27.734
and there won't be any free enzyme left.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:31.138
K two times ET instead of times ES

00:04:31.138 --> 00:04:34.240
would be equal to Vmax
instead of being equal to Vo

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.777
like you see at the top.

00:04:35.777 --> 00:04:37.110
I'll make some room here

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.813
and then sub in K two ES for Vo

00:04:39.813 --> 00:04:41.927
and K two E total for Vmax

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:44.170
and then we finally
get to our end equation

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.286
which is called the
Michaelis-Menten Equation

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:47.521
and is super important

00:04:47.521 --> 00:04:49.731
when we talk about enzyme kinetics.

00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:51.958
Let's take a few steps back

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.361
and talk about the Michaelis constant.

00:04:54.361 --> 00:04:56.664
First I'll write out the
Michaelis-Menten equation

00:04:56.664 --> 00:04:58.332
and if you remember we
created this new term

00:04:58.332 --> 00:04:59.633
which I called KM,

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.902
but we never really talked
about what it meant.

00:05:01.902 --> 00:05:02.959
Let's get to that.

00:05:03.343 --> 00:05:04.950
Now if you bear with me for a moment

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.076
and pretend that KM is equal

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:08.936
to our substrate concentration

00:05:09.397 --> 00:05:10.777
then we can sub in that value

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:12.345
into our Michaelis-Menten equation

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:13.977
which would put two S on the bottom,

00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:15.532
the sum of S plus S

00:05:15.532 --> 00:05:17.280
and then the S will cancel out

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.853
and will be left with Vmax over two.

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:21.688
What this means that KM

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.490
which we call the Michaelis constant

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.793
is defined as the
concentration of substrate

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:30.798
at which our reaction
speed is half of the Vmax.

00:05:30.798 --> 00:05:34.101
When Vo is equal to 1/2 of Vmax.

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:36.437
If we look at that on a graph from before

00:05:36.437 --> 00:05:39.339
you'd see that KM is a
substrate concentration

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:41.708
specific to our circumstances.

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.444
Where our rate is at half of its max

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:45.679
and the lower our KM,

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:47.248
the better our enzyme is at working

00:05:47.248 --> 00:05:49.616
when substrate concentrations are small.

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.911
We can use this KM term to quantify

00:05:51.911 --> 00:05:54.454
an enzyme's ability to catalyze reactions

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.930
which we call Catalytic Efficiency.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.925
I'll rewrite the
Michaelis-Menten Equation.

00:05:58.925 --> 00:06:01.761
Remember we defined KM as
a substrate concentration

00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.164
where Vo is 1/2 Vmax.

00:06:04.164 --> 00:06:07.100
Since it's a concentration
it will be in units of molar

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.502
or moles per liter.

00:06:08.502 --> 00:06:10.637
Now I'm going to throw a new term at you

00:06:10.637 --> 00:06:12.205
called Kcat

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:14.507
which is equal to the
maximum speed of a reaction

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.100
divided by the total enzyme available.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.214
We call this the enzyme's turnover number.

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:23.150
All these term is, is how many substrates

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.918
and enzyme can turn into product

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:27.654
in one second at its maximum speed.

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.690
We measure it in units
of seconds minus one

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.706
or per second as in reactions per second.

00:06:34.106 --> 00:06:36.663
We can define an enzyme's
catalytic efficiency

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:39.199
as a combination of KM and Kcat,

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:42.636
and we do this by saying
it's equal to Kcat over KM.

00:06:42.636 --> 00:06:44.938
A higher Kcat or a lower KM

00:06:44.938 --> 00:06:45.991
would result in an increase

00:06:45.991 --> 00:06:48.342
in an enzyme's catalytic efficiency.

00:06:48.342 --> 00:06:50.144
Every different enzyme has a different

00:06:50.144 --> 00:06:52.812
catalytic efficiency
in certain conditions.

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.987
We can use this term to score enzymes

00:06:54.987 --> 00:06:56.503
on how good they are.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.911
We covered a lot of content in this video

00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:00.756
but the really crucial points to remember

00:07:00.756 --> 00:07:03.123
are first the idea of the
Steady-State Assumption

00:07:03.123 --> 00:07:05.391
that we make when looking
at enzyme kinetics.

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.493
This is where we assume

00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:08.695
that the ES concentration is constant.

00:07:08.695 --> 00:07:11.698
We knew that the formation
and loss of ES are equal.

00:07:11.698 --> 00:07:14.134
Second, we derived the
critically important

00:07:14.134 --> 00:07:15.137
Michaelis-Menten Equation

00:07:15.137 --> 00:07:17.570
which you should consider
committing to memory.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:20.673
Third, we talked about how you can score

00:07:20.673 --> 00:07:23.277
how good an enzyme is
at speeding up reactions

00:07:23.277 --> 00:07:26.513
