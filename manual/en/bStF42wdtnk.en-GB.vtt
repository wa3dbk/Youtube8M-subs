00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:10.019
This video describes how GP2GP works, it will
also explain how to get the most out of GP2GP.

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.669
GP2GP is a national software application that
is used to transfer a patient’s full electronic

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.830
health record from their previous GP practice
to their new one potentially within minutes

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.810
from different clinical systems.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.689
The GP2GP process starts when a practice registers
a new patient with full general medical services

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.010
(GMS) status onto their practice clinical
system. The patient is required to fill out

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.000
the relevant registration forms.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.070
Practices may wish to ask for a form of identification,
for example: Passport, birth certificate or

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.770
a utility bill for proof of address to validate
information such as full name, new and previous

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.150
address and date of birth. Practices may also
ask for the patient’s NHS number. This can

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.649
help ensure the correct patient information
is gathered and validated at the point of

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.239
registration.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.340
NHS Smartcards with relevant RBAC codes and
local permissions must always be used when

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.280
registering new patients; this enables a Personal
Demographic Service (PDS) search to be triggered.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.670
In order to trigger a GP2GP transfer, a valid
Smartcard must always be used. The patient

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.240
must be registered with full GMS status, the
patient must be matched on PDS, the previous

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.810
practice must be GP2GP enabled.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.880
Once the patient has been found on PDS and
registered at the requesting practice, a message

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.170
is sent to the sending practice via the ‘Spine’,
requesting the patient’s electronic health

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.360
record.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.969
The previous practice’s system locates the
patient’s record automatically and sends

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.619
an acknowledgement stating whether or not
it is able to provide the electronic patient

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:54.619
record.

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.520
Where possible, the patient’s electronic
health record is then securely sent to the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.930
requesting practice for integration into their
clinical system. There is no additional work

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.580
for the sending practice as the electronic
health record is sent automatically by the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:17.020
system. GP2GP transfers the patient’s full
electronic health record, this includes attachments

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.510
such as scanned letters and test results.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.720
The printing of the paper records will still
run as normal, separate from the GP2GP transfers.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.670
Future GP2GP developments will support ceasing
printing of the paper records. For patients

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.831
not matched on PDS, for example, babies, patients
previously registered outside England, or

00:02:38.831 --> 00:02:45.300
patients without a registered GP, users should
follow their local registration process.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.140
The received electronic health record should
be checked immediately against the patient’s

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.200
registration form to ensure that the correct
patient record has arrived.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.400
Incoming records must be reviewed and filed
without delay so that the patient and attending

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.060
clinicians can benefit from having access
to the record as early as possible. Filing

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.370
immediately will support ceasing printing
of the paper records in the future. This will

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.620
enable a message to be sent to the sending
practice advising whether or not the GP2GP

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.730
transfer was successfully integrated and therefore
whether paper printing is required. For more

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.860
information, please refer to the ‘Future
Developments’ section on the GP2GP website.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.840
The electronic health record will provide
details of any allergies, adverse reactions,

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.090
current and past medications and the patient’s
full medical history.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.360
Practices may want to add a note to the record
to inform staff that the patient’s electronic

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.230
health record has been received via a GP2GP
transfer.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.170
It’s important that any GP2GP error messages
are raised to your helpdesk.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.740
For clinical safety reasons medications and
allergies come across as inactive. These need

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.590
to be reviewed and if required, re-authorised
before any prescribing can take place.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.611
Patient electronic health records received
via GP2GP may show some degraded data. This

00:04:13.611 --> 00:04:18.290
will usually be because of difficulties in
matching Read Codes, other codes, measures

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.790
or text. Any data affected in this way will
be clearly highlighted. The receiving practice

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.300
should check and only amend current and clinically
relevant degraded data.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.710
The final check should take place when the
patient’s Lloyd George arrives. The main

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.940
objective should be to ensure important information
in the paper record was entered into the patient’s

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.770
electronic health record at the previous practice
and to check that all attachments listed are

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.010
present.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.090
When the patient arrives for their first appointment
at their newly registered practice, their

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.380
full patient electronic health record will
be available.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.340
The main benefits of GP2GP are:

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.410
Improved quality and continuity of care

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.730
· Full patient electronic health record available
for the patient’s first appointment, which

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.290
results in a more focused and informed consultation
· Past medical history available and information

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.630
about medication, allergies, adverse reactions,
immunisations and vaccinations.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.630
Improved safety

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:24.300
· Fewer transcribing errors and omissions,
the need to key in information from paper

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.150
records will be greatly reduced
· Allergies and adverse drug reactions are

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.330
flagged for review for new patients, resulting
in safer prescribing

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.330
Clinical time savings

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.900
· The electronic health record contains information
such as lab results and letters from specialists,

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.790
which helps in the clinical decision-making
process. This also means there are fewer requests

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.060
for unnecessary duplicate lab tests

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.460
Administrative time savings

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:57.139
· The need to key information from paper
records is greatly reduced. This results in

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.770
quicker summarisation of new patient records
· Attachments received electronically, which

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.810
results in time saved not having to re-scan
items into the patient’s electronic health

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.600
record
· Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) information

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.790
populated immediately when a patients electronic
health record is integrated

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:24.010
The GP2GP website is an important tool for
ensuring NHS organisations have access to

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.050
the latest information and guidance on GP2GP.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.670
Further information about GP2GP can also be
found in Chapter 8b of the Royal College of

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.550
General Practitioners’ Good Practice Guidelines
for GP electronic patient records.
