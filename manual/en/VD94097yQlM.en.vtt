00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.560
Have you ever wanted to just get away from
it all, leave everything behind for a week

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
or two?

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.449
Maybe find a place where you can cleanse your
body and refresh your mind?

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:12.210
Well I’ve got the place for you.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.540
Hi, I’m Amelia Armistead and today I’m
going to begin my journey to health and wellbeing

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.940
here at Tao Garden in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.280
Situated within walking distance of the southern
Himalayan foothills, Tao Garden is a tranquil

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.280
retreat.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:34.270
It is surrounded by over 80 acres of lush,
tropical gardens with walking trials, ponds

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:43.840
and streams flowing all year round.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.380
Located just 30 minutes from historic Chiang
Mai in Northern Thailand, Tao Garden was conceived

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.059
and built by Master Mantak Chia.

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.980
The health resort and universal Tao Training
Centre was developed over six years and it

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.939
was completed in December 2000, with two meditation
halls, two open-air Qigong pavilions and a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.819
Tai Chi Tao Yin and Chi Ni Sang hall.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:15.819
Tucked away amongst organic rice fields, tropical
fruit trees and over 30 acres of organic produce,

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:20.729
Tao Garden is almost fully self-sufficient.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.719
Starting with a full doctor’s consultation
and dark field blood analysis, the care and

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.680
treatment here at Tao Garden is second to
none.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.579
Whether you come here on a spiritual journey
or just to relax, there is something for everyone.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.850
Tao Garden offers packages from one day to
10 days; from relaxation and meditation to

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.539
weight loss and detoxification.

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.180
And when you’re not busy being pampered
by the wonderful staff here, you can get busy

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.499
relaxing by the pool with a fresh coconut
juice.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:55.029
There is also morning Qigong exercise and
meditation, badminton and tennis courts, a

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.219
fully equipped gym and for time out, a home
theatre.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.760
Of course the accommodation is air-conditioned
with a variety of rooms and villas, and the

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.979
best part about the whole stay, it’s the
food.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.170
It’s an all organic yin yang diet served
buffet style for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.590
This is a place where guests are able to choose
from a wide selection of disciplines and therapies.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.880
Many people who come to Tao Garden learn the
art of self-healing through the Qigong exercise,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.720
meditation and massage from Master Chia himself.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.530
Using a mixture of Thai and Chinese medicine,
Western holistic, Ayurvedic Indian and modern

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.760
science, the treatment at Tao Garden is a
system based on the fool-proof theory of clean

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.060
cells, clean blood and good chi.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.590
The feeling you have while staying at Tao
Garden is one of peace and relaxation.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.360
It’s an amazingly spiritual place.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.130
The pampering at the spa, along with the medical
treatment, make it a truly unique experience.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.990
So to soothe your soul and cleanse your body,
and also become inspired to live a happier,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.340
healthier life, visit Tao Garden in Chiang
Mai, Thailand.
