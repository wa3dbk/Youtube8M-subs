00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:16.336
In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of
operating the CS65 Digital Reporting Monitor.

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:20.786
After unpacking your equipment, be
sure to read the Operator's Manual,

00:00:21.086 --> 00:00:24.336
which contains important safety
guidelines and complete information

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:26.166
about the unit's features and operation.

00:00:27.996 --> 00:00:31.716
The CS65 can operate on a RIDGID
eighteen volt rechargeable battery.

00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:36.296
An AC adapter is also available
for indoor use and can be ordered

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:37.836
from an authorized RIDGID dealer.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:43.706
The CS65 is designed to dock with the rM200,

00:00:43.926 --> 00:00:47.616
and has latches that secure
the CS65 during transport.

00:00:47.996 --> 00:00:52.166
We're going to move our equipment to a nearby
cleanout and perform a sample inspection

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:55.346
to explore the CS65's features and operation.

00:00:56.416 --> 00:01:00.216
There's a 4' main line close
by so we'll inspect that one.

00:01:05.336 --> 00:01:08.266
The camera connects to the monitor
with the SeeSnake® System Cable,

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.166
which is stored on the camera reel.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:18.586
Line up the connector's pins with the jack, and
then tighten the locking sleeve until it's snug

00:01:18.796 --> 00:01:22.616
to ensure that you have a good electrical
connection and a watertight seal.

00:01:27.486 --> 00:01:29.626
We'll press the Power key to turn the unit on.

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:33.556
The monitor takes a few moments to start up,

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:36.366
and we'll use this time to
prepare for the inspection.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:42.706
When the red progress bar
disappears, the CS65 is ready to use.

00:01:43.806 --> 00:01:47.116
The CS65 can overlay text
onto still images and video.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.686
Press the space bar to open the text entry box.

00:01:55.216 --> 00:02:00.306
If you want to reposition the text, select
the Move icon below the text entry box,

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:05.386
then use the arrow keys on the keypad
or on the keyboard to move the text box.

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:16.386
To overlay the text onto the screen, highlight
the green checkmark icon, and then press Enter.

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:23.216
To clear text from the screen, press the space
bar and then press the Enter key to choose Yes.

00:02:25.936 --> 00:02:29.216
We'll start our inspection by grabbing
a still image of our access point.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:35.676
When we do, the CS65 will prompt us to add
media to an existing job or create a new one.

00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:38.366
We'll select the option to create a new job...

00:02:39.006 --> 00:02:40.646
And then we'll begin recording video.

00:02:45.286 --> 00:02:50.086
The CS65's PhotoTalk feature lets us capture
a still image with an audio annotation.

00:02:50.786 --> 00:02:54.916
To make a PhotoTalk recording, press
the Photo key for a couple of seconds,

00:02:55.216 --> 00:02:56.786
and begin speaking when prompted.

00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:06.586
The countdown timer gives us 90 seconds to
record, and we can extend that if we want,

00:03:07.056 --> 00:03:09.256
or stop it sooner by pressing the Select key.

00:03:12.316 --> 00:03:19.796
With the CS65, we can insert a thumb drive into
one or both USB ports while a job is in progress

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:21.276
without interrupting the video recording.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:27.876
We'll insert a drive, and select Yes
to synchronize our job to this device.

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:31.906
The CS65 will then begin copying
the media that we've already captured

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:34.946
onto this drive while we
continue with our inspection.

00:03:36.246 --> 00:03:39.736
At this point we'll stop the recording
and pull the camera out of the line.

00:03:40.906 --> 00:03:46.206
The icon next to the thumb drive shows that
the CS65 is still synchronizing our job

00:03:46.406 --> 00:03:47.926
from the internal drive to the thumb drives.

00:03:48.276 --> 00:03:52.406
When the job is synchronized you'll see
a green check mark next to the thumb drive.

00:03:53.376 --> 00:03:57.906
To avoid data loss, never remove a
drive until you see the green check mark.

00:03:59.296 --> 00:04:05.476
The CS65 has a full job reporting interface,
and we'll press the Edit Job key open it.

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:12.236
We'll use the Arrow, Enter, and Escape keys
to navigate, open, and exit report screens.

00:04:13.056 --> 00:04:16.846
We'll navigate to the Contact screen
and open the Company information page.

00:04:20.836 --> 00:04:24.296
The Contact screen also has pages
for Customer and Job information.

00:04:29.916 --> 00:04:31.846
Next we'll review our captured media.

00:04:33.256 --> 00:04:37.486
We can view still images and play
video clips and PhotoTalk recordings.

00:04:46.896 --> 00:04:50.296
If we want to add notes to any of
our media we can do that as well.

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:06.016
The CS65 also lets us preview the final
report before we give it to customers.

00:05:07.166 --> 00:05:12.726
We can't open images or play video clips in
the Report Preview screen, but we can make sure

00:05:12.926 --> 00:05:15.986
that the report contains the information
we want to share with our customer.

00:05:17.196 --> 00:05:19.496
When we're done, we'll close the report...

00:05:19.796 --> 00:05:21.366
And exit the Job Review screen.

00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:30.046
The USB status icon shows a green check mark,
so we can safely remove the thumb drive.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:37.316
To avoid damaging your media files, never remove
the thumb drive until the green check mark is led.

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:44.496
In the past few minutes, we've seen
how the PhotoTalk feature works,

00:05:45.306 --> 00:05:49.436
learned how to synchronize an open job to
a thumb drive, and we've used the keyboard

00:05:50.136 --> 00:05:53.156
to create a text overlay and
add notes to the job report.

00:05:54.016 --> 00:06:04.200
On behalf of the entire RIDGID team, thank
you for buying SeeSnake® diagnostic equipment.
