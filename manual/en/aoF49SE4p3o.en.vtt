Hi everyone, Melissa here, CloudMom.com.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.810
This is show number two in a series we're
running on the site this month about family

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.810
dining.

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.850
And this show is about newborns, about something
I wish I had known before I had my first baby,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.470
which is that newborns make the ideal dining
partners.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.189
I'd rather be out to eat with a newborn than
with my husband, nagging me about the credit

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.269
card bill.

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:24.269
Sorry honey.

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.329
But in all seriousness, you might think that
getting a baby out of the house is like climbing

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.329
Mount Everest.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:31.131
You feed them, you burp them, you change them.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.000
They're all set to go in the carseat and then
poof!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.050
It all falls apart.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.079
And you say to yourself, "Why should I do
this?

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.610
Why should I take the time, you know, to pack
this diaper bag?

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.610
Why should I bother?"

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.350
Well, here's the thing.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.870
Once you get the baby out of the house, going
out to eat with the baby is a can be a truly

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:50.870
enjoyable experience.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.540
It's actually quite easier and it does get
a little trickier, as your baby becomes a

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.540
toddler.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.630
So here are the top three reasons why I think
newborns are great to dine out with.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.200
Number one, they sleep all the time.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.760
They sleep all the time, and they're not on
such a set nap and bedtime schedule that you

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.360
have to go out at certain hours.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.920
And they also love the noise and busyness
of restaurants.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.070
I found that my babies slept really well in
restaurants.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.390
Number two, they're totally portable.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.270
And this is why I'm a big fan of the carseat
with the carseat carrier.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.610
You can take your carseat out of that carseat
carrier and put it in a chair or put it safely

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.120
under the table, and the carrier is very easy
to collapse making it very easy to go out

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.380
to eat.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.659
And number three, you can feed that baby when
you yourself eat.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.880
Either, you can nurse that baby, and I hope
you'll get comfortable nursing in public,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.869
or you can bottle feed the baby while you
yourself are enjoying your nice meal.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.030
So, it can be a really enjoyable thing to
do, and if you've got older kids, going out

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.250
to eat with that newborn as well can be a
really nice family experience.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.560
So I hope that this video appeals to you and
will encourage you to take your newborn out

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
to eat.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.190
If you have other tips for dining out with
a newborn, please share them on CloudMom.com.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.819
Have a great time going out to dinner, and
see you next time.
