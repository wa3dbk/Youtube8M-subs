Hi, this is Scott Vallance. I am here on behalf
of Expert Village.com. We are going to be

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:24.700
talking about tripods today. There are several
different manufacturers of tripods. Basically

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:30.900
what they do is give you firm support for
your camera so that you can do tact sharp

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.410
images. Also if you need to do long exposures
you can do that because the camera gives you

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.960
support and it won’t move as long as you
don’t bump into it or the wind does not

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.440
blow it hard. Basically what you do is there
is a platform on top of the tripod. The camera

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.500
just attaches to this usually with a thumb
screw on the very bottom of it. You have different

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:04.940
controls. A tilton control and a side by side
tilt control. The legs are extendable. Each

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.580
different type of tripod has different locking
devices on the legs. This is a collar lock.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:20.610
A good tripod should also have a center column
so that after you set your camera up and if

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.890
you need to just raise it by a foot or lower
by a foot you can do that, using the center

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.170
column and just lock it down. Once you put
your camera on here and you are doing a long

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.650
exposure, you are going to want to use a cable
release so that you don’t get vibration

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.910
from your hand pushing the shutter. Also if
your camera has a mirror lock up you might

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.260
use that if it is going to be a long exposure
say right after the sun sets or if you are

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.950
trying to shoot pictures of star trails or
something like that you would want this as

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.870
solid as possible. A lot of times when I am
on location, I will actually take my camera

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.870
bag and wrap the strap around the center column
to add weight to hold the tripod down and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:12.450
that just gives additional support. There
are carbon fiber tripods out there that are

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.310
real expensive and light weight. They are
really great if you do a lot of backpacking

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.781
and landscape type stuff. Other than those,
a good rule of thumb is heavier the tripod

00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:26.730
the more stable it is going to be. Good luck
and good photographing. Talk to you soon.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.080
Thanks.
