00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.120
here's something else i want to warn you
about family friendly cities

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.280
is family friendly city a real thing or
is it just the dog whistle for

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.070
conservatives is it just at a new
conservative scam is it a code for right

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.770
wing social agenda now allot of cities
are invoking family friendly as an

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.030
advertising strategy to make cities
appear attractive for families to move

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.480
there apparently and the question is it
what exactly is that based on is that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.630
the availability of urban amenities like
for example is a city but it still has

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.430
public pools parks

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.650
soon media is that it

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.730
is it other type of thing where the
uh...

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.450
home beholder ship in and out of

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.700
i don't know proximity to schools is
favorable

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.930
for family

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.920
or is it conservative social agenda the
reality and i asked a couple of urban

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.810
planners about this as our man planners
don't know what family-friendly city

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.940
means and therefore we need to be on the
alert that this could be either from the

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.320
get go or it could be hijacked by the
conservative social agenda to really be

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.640
code four

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.570
it's really hard to there's no abortion
clinics is a really hard to get an

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.210
abortion and it's a state where there's
no gay marriage

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.890
and uh... what else and would also make
a c whom conserve right leading asan as

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.060
far as shows social agenda goes

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.880
i mean those are the major ones i don't
know

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.720
now nombre gerchas'

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.590
allowed that the other thing of course a
lot of churches with because charges by

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.510
definition are pro-family right even if
they are wildly violently homophobic

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.840
of course churches are profitable

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.170
exhausting your children so be on the
lookout right of course and involving

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.860
cover-ups of child molestation
fascinating how one of the indicators of

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.670
a so-called family friendly city is
probably something that would make you

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.630
have your kids under very close
supervision maybe not even involved at

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.930
all

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.980
be aware family-friendly city i would be
concerned

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.280
