Hi! I’m Sarah and I’m here at Extra Care
Animal Hospital today, and on behalf of expertvillage.com

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.760
I’m going to tell you a little bit about
owning a lovebird. As far as identifying your

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.840
bird goes, your bird may or may not come with
a leg band. As far as removing the leg band

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.610
goes, that’s entirely up to you. Some people
do not like to have leg bands on their birds,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:33.370
other people do not mind. It is important
if you want your bird permanently identified,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.970
to get a microchip implanted. It’s the same
microchips that are used in dogs and cats.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:46.539
These are the only legally recognized form
of identification for animals. It’s very

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.611
important if you’re going to be doing any
traveling with your bird or anything of that

00:00:51.611 --> 00:00:58.149
nature, it would be a good idea to get your
bird a microchip. As far as the leg band goes,

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.030
sometimes the leg bands will tell what year
the bird was hatched and sometimes it won’t.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.210
It really just depends on the breeder. Generally,
it’s just information from the breeder that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.650
isn’t printed on the leg bands. Sometimes
it’s the state that the bird breeder was

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.710
located in, sometimes it’s the year that
it was hatched. There’s a lot of different

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.960
information on there. As far as whether or
not to remove a leg band goes, your veterinarian

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.560
can remove the leg band. There are several
different methods available to remove leg

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.860
bands. If you notice that your bird is fidgeting
with leg band a lot; if it seems like the

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.591
leg band is bothering your bird, you may want
to consider having it taken off. If your bird

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:47.091
leaves it alone, there’s not much of a reason
to take it off unless it really bothers you.

00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:55.230
If you’re not sure if you want to permanently
identify your bird with a microchip or have

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.990
the leg band removed, you should consult with
your qualified avian veterinarian.
