00:00:00.636 --> 00:00:02.303
[Upbeat Jazzy Music]

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:09.146
[Corks Popping]

00:00:17.887 --> 00:00:21.554
- The best of Bordeaux
have come to the Bay.

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.638
- I worked for six years as a
wine maker in Saint-Emilion,

00:00:26.638 --> 00:00:29.808
so coming back to see
old friends and taste

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:31.426
what's been going on since then

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:35.243
and quite a lot with two
vintages like 2009 and 2010

00:00:35.243 --> 00:00:37.604
in Bordeaux are phenomenal vintages

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:39.236
and there are some beautiful wines.

00:00:39.236 --> 00:00:41.896
- The Saint-Emilion out of
all the Bordeaux type wines

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:45.711
to me in terms of pleasure
and appeal to a broad spectrum

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.482
of wine drinkers is really
the name that comes first

00:00:48.482 --> 00:00:50.551
in Bordeaux, to me.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:53.918
Because of the Merlot,
the seductive quality,

00:00:53.918 --> 00:00:57.447
the aromatics, and also the balance.

00:00:57.447 --> 00:01:00.767
- The wines of Saint-Emilion
are made up of mostly Merlot

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:04.188
with just a touch of Cab Franc to add

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:05.021
a little spine to the wine.

00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.172
- I think the most important thing to know

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:08.955
is the fact that Saint-Emilion is a place

00:01:08.955 --> 00:01:10.934
where the Merlot is the king.

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:12.488
I think it's probably the best place

00:01:12.488 --> 00:01:14.197
to produce Merlot in the world.

00:01:14.197 --> 00:01:16.086
- They are much more
supple then their neighbors

00:01:16.086 --> 00:01:19.863
across the river in the
Medoc, and much more drinkable

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:22.395
and more appealing, for me.

00:01:22.395 --> 00:01:24.050
It's one of my favorites
wines in the world.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.905
- [Monique] I gotta ask you
this question only because

00:01:26.905 --> 00:01:28.817
my husband loves to tell
this story about you.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:31.471
Your wife told him that
you got into wine because

00:01:31.471 --> 00:01:33.580
you were in some trip to France.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.100
- It is a true story.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.131
I ordered a glass of milk and
the waiter looks right at me

00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:38.714
and said, "Milk is for babies".

00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:40.715
And I was nine years
old and he brought out

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:42.275
a glass of red wine.

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.016
And that's how my love affair started

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:46.131
with France and with wine.

00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:48.041
- [Monique] How do the
personalities of the people

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.354
in Saint-Emilion may be different

00:01:49.354 --> 00:01:50.635
from the personalities of people

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:53.515
of the left bank of Bordeaux
or winemakers in California?

00:01:53.515 --> 00:01:56.390
- Saint-Emilion is a
place with a small estate.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.612
So whoever the people are,
they are always very close

00:01:58.612 --> 00:02:01.726
to their earth, to their
soil, to their vineyard.

00:02:01.726 --> 00:02:05.093
And they are always very passionate.

00:02:05.093 --> 00:02:07.733
Because it's a small company,
and you have to be involved

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:09.437
in everything in the winemaking,

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:11.326
in the vineyard, in the marketing.

00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:13.244
And to do that, you have to be passionate.

00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:15.291
They are all crazy about their wine.

00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:18.284
- Anytime I talk to anybody
about Saint-Emilion,

00:02:18.284 --> 00:02:19.180
they say they love it there,

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.253
it's one of the most fabulous places

00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:21.282
and they love the wines.

00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:23.834
Why do you think the area
resonates with people so much?

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:26.551
- I'm working in Saint-Émilion
for only three years.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:30.066
- Everyday I come, everyday
it's a new experience for me.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.919
Everyday I'm in love with Saint-Emilion.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:34.750
Really I mean it, because
the place is different,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.870
the grapes and the colors
and the chateaux and people.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.159
And it's just wonderful when you get them,

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.516
you fall in love.

00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:44.342
- What I really appreciate
about wine is some people

00:02:44.342 --> 00:02:47.262
might go their whole lives
and they might never be able

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:49.349
to visit such a beautiful
area like Saint-Emilion,

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.096
but they can certainly try the wines.

00:02:51.096 --> 00:02:52.778
And sometimes when you drink the wine,

00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:54.565
it kinda transports you and
lets you travel the different

00:02:54.565 --> 00:02:57.696
regions or places of the
world you might never go to.

00:02:57.696 --> 00:03:00.307
- Exactly, you just
have to close your eyes

00:03:00.307 --> 00:03:02.582
and think deeply about it, and
you will be in Saint-Emilion.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:06.104
You know, Saint-Emilion, it's
hilly, it's a small estate

00:03:06.104 --> 00:03:09.084
with a very nice house but
nothing very pretentious.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.574
You know, always very
discreet, but very charming.

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:15.130
And I think our wines are also like that.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.734
Very approachable, but with good depth,

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:19.827
and very charming wine.

00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:21.891
- Is there something you
would want someone to know

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.949
about Saint-Emilion, and the wines there,

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:27.036
that they wouldn't necessarily
know by reading on a website

00:03:27.036 --> 00:03:28.966
or by trying the wines?

00:03:28.966 --> 00:03:31.056
- I think they should know
that in Saint-Emilion,

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:33.463
they are always welcome.

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:35.537
It's not in the books, but you know,

00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:38.557
you just have to send
a little e-mail to say,

00:03:38.557 --> 00:03:40.377
"Okay, we want to visit".

00:03:40.377 --> 00:03:42.395
And they would be very, very welcome.

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:43.228
- Santé?

00:03:43.228 --> 00:03:44.061
- Santé.

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:44.894
- Santé!
