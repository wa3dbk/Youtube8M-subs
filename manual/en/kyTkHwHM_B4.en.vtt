Hello my friends and welcome!
to another Tuesday of tutorial.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.200
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and
today we will draw a mermaid.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.170
For the profile, we start with a circle
that end extended and

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.500
we do the hair floating in the water,
the arm, the body and the tail.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.810
Now we sketch the general
shape of the fish, beginning

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.000
with the fins.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.200
The large ones on top
and on the bottom...

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.600
and then the face.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.839
Once we have a general outline,
we go over it, and we give it

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.100
a better shape.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.220
We give it some texture lines
with lose strokes,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.500
it is important that they
don´t look solid, I mean stiff.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.220
We tone with small circles
to give a feeling of the scales.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.860
That´s for the head
and the body. The fins

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.000
won´t have scales,
but they will be wavy.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.000
As you noticed I´m drawing
with a mechanical pencil

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.159
with a blue led, this helps
giving the atmosphere of underwater

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.400
and in the sea.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.000
Or so I hope [laughs].

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.500
Good!

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.000
We go over it again
for greater intensity,

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.100
and the draw other
small fins, loosely, again

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
I don´t want them to be stiff.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.300
We sketch the scales
and give it some shade to the body.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.280
We don´t want a wood
looking fished, so don´t

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.170
outline the fins, too much.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.260
If they are a little blurred
or lost, they may give

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.000
a feeling of movement.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.230
We draw a tense rope
with which the mermaid

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.020
is pulling the fish,
that´s because she is a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.400
cowboy sort of mermaid [laughs].

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.310
Good!

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.000
This is fun!

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.000
Now we do some shading
on the hair, on the neck...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
...the body.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.420
We create the volumes
with light and shadow.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.400
It´s like magic [laughs].

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.720
The list of materials
is in the description

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.400
of the video.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.000
From the waist down
she will have scales, of course.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.760
We draw the tail and a shadow,
this will make it looks as

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.200
if it is close to the bottom.

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.560
With a fine eraser or
with the corner of a regular one,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.000
we do a little circle which
will be the first of a series of bubbles.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.720
Had I thought of this earlier,
I would have left it blank

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.220
from the beginning.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.440
In the comments I would
love it, if you let me know,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.000
whether you like fantasy drawings
like these or not.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.920
And if you enjoyed it,
please give it a LIKE,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.260
share it to your friends
and subscribe to Fine Art-Tips.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.100
And I will see you
on Tuesday :)
