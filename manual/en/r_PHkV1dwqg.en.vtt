00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.144
(accoustic guitar music)

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.609
- Hi guys, how's it going?

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.162
So in today's video I
will be showing you how to

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:20.948
make this decorative
flower heart right here.

00:00:20.948 --> 00:00:22.968
You can apply this onto pillows,

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:25.789
or you can put it onto a nice canvas and

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.380
decorate your apartment with it.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.143
It's super fun and easy,

00:00:30.143 --> 00:00:32.257
I mean don't be fooled
by the way it looks,

00:00:32.257 --> 00:00:33.860
it's very easy to make.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.218
Next I will also show you
a very very simple way

00:00:37.218 --> 00:00:39.018
on how to cover a pillow.

00:00:39.018 --> 00:00:42.036
So if you have a difficult
time sewing a pillow case

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:44.695
or cutting two squares
and bonding it together,

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.340
well my friend, this is a lot easier.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.299
And you could either use it
this side as a twisty side,

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:56.999
or you can use it this side
and apply the heart onto this.

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.951
So before we get started
I also want to make

00:00:59.951 --> 00:01:02.075
a quick and special announcement.

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:05.894
I am now a part of Disney
style and I will be

00:01:05.894 --> 00:01:09.018
making Disney inspired DIY's.

00:01:09.018 --> 00:01:13.637
So anything from a Disney
movie or something like that,

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:18.271
I will be making a DIY
video once every few weeks.

00:01:18.271 --> 00:01:20.151
And if you guys want to see more of that

00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.275
then come over there and check me out.

00:01:22.275 --> 00:01:25.184
Other than that, let's get
started with this tutorial!

00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:31.587
Okay guys, so let's start with
this super easy pillow case.

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:35.151
So the first thing that you are
going to need is a big sheet

00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:39.248
of fabric and this all depends
on the size of your pillow.

00:01:39.248 --> 00:01:41.864
So what I'm doing now
is with the shorter side

00:01:41.864 --> 00:01:44.059
of the fabric I'm just
folding that inwards,

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:47.883
and now I have the longer
sides on my left and my right.

00:01:47.883 --> 00:01:51.043
Now I'm just going to twist
that and then fold it into

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.563
the center as you can see right here.

00:01:58.396 --> 00:02:01.813
Next I'm going to take the
sides and twist it together,

00:02:02.583 --> 00:02:04.032
then I'm going to take the ends and

00:02:04.032 --> 00:02:07.184
tuck it underneath the opening.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.281
See that, it's that simple!

00:02:10.284 --> 00:02:14.232
Okay as you can see, I'm using
a woven fabric right here,

00:02:14.232 --> 00:02:16.692
and it helps hold this twist in place.

00:02:16.692 --> 00:02:19.594
So if you're going to
use a satin material,

00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:22.427
something slippery then most likely your

00:02:22.427 --> 00:02:24.505
twist will go undone easily.

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:27.106
So what I suggest for you to
do is find something that has

00:02:27.106 --> 00:02:31.454
texture or a little more stiff
for this type of pillowcase.

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:35.726
Okay so onto the flower making
and the first thing I'm going

00:02:35.726 --> 00:02:40.034
to do is cut out two square
pieces from some felt material,

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:43.204
and then I'm going to just
draw a spiral to give you a

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:47.125
visual image on how I will
be cutting these squares.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.526
These squares are about
five by five I would say,

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:53.509
and it all depends on how big
you want your flowers to look.

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:56.307
So I'm just going to cut
out around the lines,

00:02:56.307 --> 00:02:59.141
usually I don't draw the
spiral because I already

00:02:59.141 --> 00:03:03.395
have a visual image in my head
on how I want this to look.

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:07.875
So after cutting out all your spirals,

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:10.112
the next thing you're going to do is

00:03:10.112 --> 00:03:12.790
take each spiral and wrap it around,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.023
forming a flower just like
how I'm doing it right here.

00:03:16.573 --> 00:03:17.861
Once you're done with each flower,

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.914
go ahead and glue the end to

00:03:19.914 --> 00:03:21.949
prevent the flower from unraveling.

00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:26.522
Okay so for this next step right here

00:03:26.522 --> 00:03:29.088
you will need to cut out a felt heart,

00:03:29.088 --> 00:03:32.002
the same material as your flowers.

00:03:32.002 --> 00:03:36.402
And just have it ready to
start gluing on the flowers.

00:03:37.572 --> 00:03:39.790
So I like to lay my
flowers out on the heart

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.611
and kind of get an idea
of how it will look.

00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.572
Afterwards I will just
apply glue onto the bottom

00:03:45.572 --> 00:03:49.094
of the flowers and then
glue them onto the heart.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.584
Once you're all done you have yourself a

00:03:51.584 --> 00:03:53.959
lovely looking flower-heart.

00:03:55.728 --> 00:03:58.027
Lastly you can apply
this onto a pillow with

00:03:58.027 --> 00:04:00.928
some fabric glue just by gluing each part

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:03.141
of the heart onto the pillowcase.

00:04:08.463 --> 00:04:10.600
Okay guys so that is it,

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.341
thank you so much for watching!

00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:14.744
