00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.949
Welcome to Corporate Speech Solutions. My
name is Jayne Latz and today we're going

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:21.630
to discuss some telephone tips. Many
people contact us and they specifically

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.650
say they need help on the telephone so
today I want you to have five simple

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.770
tips that will really make a difference
when you're speaking on the phone. Number

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:44.219
one, always speak in a clear and
articulate manner. Don't rush or mumble

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.460
your words. How often have you received a
voicemail message that you needed to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.120
replay once or even twice before you got
the name of the person? So think about

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.360
that and make sure that you speak in a
slow and clear manner. If you're tired, my

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.930
second tip is stand up and put energy
into your voice. We often have such

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.460
important calls that come in at the end
of a day and the last thing we want to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.729
do is pick up that phone and get into a
conversation but stand up and you'll

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.920
have immediate energy in your voice and
the person on the other end won't know

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:37.409
that you're as tired as you feel. Three-
always be sure to say your number two

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:45.240
times. We can't be responsible for the
noise around us, or with a cell phone, if

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.840
the sound goes in or out. How would you
feel if the reason you didn't get that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.700
call returned is simply because they
couldn't. They lost one digit and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.390
couldn't call you back. By simply saying
your number two times it helps make sure

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.289
that you'll get that call returned. For
example please call Jayne Latz

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:22.010
at Corporate Speech Solutions. Our number
is 917 841 2965, again that number is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:40.170
Jayne Latz 917 841 2965. The fourth tip is
to speak each letter in a clear way. The

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.109
telephone has a way of cutting out some
high frequency sounds and making it very

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.569
difficult for the listener to discern
which letter you're really saying so

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:11.310
give an example such as my name is Jayne
Latz. L, A, T as in tiger and Z as in zebra. And last number 5,

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.560
don't be in such a rush that you want to
give a quick fix such as call me back at

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:30.299
triple 9 6. The number is 9996. Might be
easier for you to say it the first way

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:39.599
but it's easier for the listener to take
down each digit. Same thing with 2956.

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:50.220
Don't say 2956 take your time and say
all the numbers. So those are 5 telephone

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.769
tips that I hope will help you to gain
confidence every time you pick up that

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.260
phone and if you have additional
questions please be sure to visit our

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.940
