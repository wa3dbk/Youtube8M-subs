My name is Brandon Sarkis, on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.280
use a George Foreman grill to make stuff besides
grilled cheese and hot dogs. For this next

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.870
shot, I've got some shrimp. Got some nice
sixteen twenty shrimp here. So I'm just going

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:25.990
to take my brush with my olive oil, like always.
Just brush each one of my shrimp. A nice little

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:38.320
liberal layer of olive oil on each one. And
right onto the grill they go. I'll put the

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.950
salt and pepper on them when they're on the
grill. So let's go to the grill now. Let's

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:49.490
open it up. Looks like we're ready to go.
Looks like everything's all nice and hot.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:01:01.149
So we're just going to take our shrimp. Everybody
likes grilled shrimp. The good thing about

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.070
shrimp, shrimp cooks really fast, so you could
do a whole lot of shrimp in this thing very,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:15.180
very quickly. There's all my shrimp. Just
add a little bit of salt and pepper, like

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.350
always, got to have your salt and your pepper.
There we go. We're going to close this lid

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.549
down. We're going to come back in about, well
see for shrimp it kind of varies. You want

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.560
to be kind of careful. I think we can probably
get this shrimp done in, I don't know, let's

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.780
say two minutes probably. So we'll be back
in about two mintues. Alright, let's check

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.500
on the shrimp. And they look absolutely wonderful,
so we're just going to take these off. Two

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.750
minutes for these wonderful, perfect looking
shrimp. I mean, I could've filled this thing

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.670
up. I could've done gosh, twenty, twenty-five
pieces just now. Something else you can do

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.729
is you can do more than one thing at a time.
You can do your steaks and your shrimp at

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.349
the same time. Obviously you want to keep
an eye on the shrimp, put the shrimp on towards

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.299
the end. Look at that. Two minutes, and I've
got some really, really great looking shrimp.

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.090
So you can't go wrong with that at all.
