00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.850
this david packard shelf had david
paquette dot com great to have you with

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.610
us today including everybody from the
i'd love it when i wake up in the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.950
morning and brocco bombing is president
face book page check them out on face

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.679
book i gotta email asking us to talk
about our feelings regarding syria

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.699
and allegations of chemical weapons the
use now u_s_ secretary of state john

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.599
kerry said that there is strong evidence
those are the terms of use strong

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.779
evidence

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.359
proving that the syrian government use
chemical weapons in its war against the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:30.889
militant opposition

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:36.690
and this goes against recent u_n_
findings right so kerry said

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.780
there's no question in my mind that this
fight is about the terrible choices that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.530
the assad regime has made

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.130
to use gas which we believe there is
strong evidence for the use of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.050
previously the u_s_ had said it lacked
evidence that the government of syrian

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.190
president bashar al-assad was
responsible for aghast attack against

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.360
members of the rebel opposition

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.720
and carey also did not further
substantiate his claims now there's a

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.440
number of different back and forth about
this that's not really the issue up to

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.450
people passed this to say

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.829
what are our red lines

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:10.490
on

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.350
syria another words do we believe that
this chemical weapon usage is the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.280
groundwork being laid of similarly to
wheat w m_d_s in iraq to eventually have

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.520
some kind of larger operation there

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.000
and requested that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.180
uh... do we'd be if if it is true that
syria has used chemical weapons against

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.830
uh... against citizens would that be
passing the so-called red line for u_s_

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.950
intervention

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.919
truth the u_s_ simply not get involved

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:42.739
period unless there is a direct attack
on americans or or or citizens abroad

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:45.040
accurate you stand on it

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.280
well i find it hard to believe that the
u_s_ would warrant to have anything to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.150
do

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.340
with the country because i just don't
see it strategically making much sense

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.610
artsy you just don't think that there
are principal resource is all

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.200
uh... owned strategic alliances that
would make sense to even get involved

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.960
and that's really what the u_s_ cares
about

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.150
uh... are also think that i mean i i do
think

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.460
the rebels should be should be helped
more than they're being help now i think

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.790
the atrocities of of the dictator pretty
heinous but

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.409
and i will say that with the u_s_ should
be worried about

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.369
is who ends up in power after

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:23.319
the the crew

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.939
antenna that did that and the time would
it make sense for the u_s_ to get

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.069
involved if

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.240
to in order to have uh... assay as
arguably influence over who ends up and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.279
down

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.629
bullets a potentially a slippery slope
uh... i don't know i mean i don't really

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.769
have a red line i think that uh...
saying that the redline is the use of of

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.079
chemical weapons

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.859
is basically saying that it's a red line
for humanitarian reasons

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:53.149
at that point uh... then it's certainly
becomes hypocritical because look at all

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.569
of the plot times we could have gotten
involved for humanitarian reasons that

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.019
we didn't because there wasn't also some
resource

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.059
strategic alliance though i don't think
that fact is the reason not to get

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.599
involved in one part ticular cases are
certainly

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.349
it's unlikely that the u_s_ would get
involved in every case i'm just

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.989
concerned that allot of people outside
of the united states criticize the u_s_

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.859
for being the quote-unquote policeman of
the world and yet at the same time

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.799
everyone expects us to do something
uh... in this case for humanitarian

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.789
reasons i would say that

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:27.569
well lewis is saying is probably a
factor here

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.129
i would expect an international
coalition tell leased if they're not

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.319
gonna put troops on the ground do
something to help the rebels

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.620
uh... whether that be for humanitarian
reasons or because it's the right thing

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.550
to do for the people of syria

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.389
in terms of the political

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.170
uh... consequences of this

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.900
indeed their case i would hope that it
wouldn't be just the u_s_ doing this
