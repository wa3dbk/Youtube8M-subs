In this clip, I'm going to tell you how to
make cheese pakora. So let's begin. First

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:34.550
we take grinded ground flour, say five spoons,
add some garlic paste to it, a little salt,

00:00:34.550 --> 00:01:08.439
as per the taste, grinded coriander, cumin
seeds, red chili and Ajwine. Now add water

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:19.350
to it, and stir it well so a thick paste is
formed. Keep on stirring till the paste is

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:32.990
formed completely.
Add some more water, as per the requirement.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:46.979
So here the paste is formed. Take some cheese
and dip it into this thick paste and then

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:58.180
place it into the heated oil and let it fry
for approximately two to three minutes. After

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:18.049
which, it will turn dark brown in color, which
indicates that it's ready to eat. So now your

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:23.260
crunchy and crispy cheese pakoras are ready
to eat. So you can eat it with either tomato

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.880
ketchup or mustard sauce.
