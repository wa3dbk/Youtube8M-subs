00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.500
Hey man.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.500
I've recently been doing some contemplation

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.100
About people's dependency upon cellular telephones.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.800
Yeah man. Me too.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.500
I've really noticed that everyone always

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
seems to be on their mobile device

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.930
instead of really being in the moment.

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:23.900
Exactly.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.320
And I feel that this is a very significant issue

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.000
That needs to be address immediately.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.500
Yes, immediately.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.180
We really should do something about this.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Here we have a man

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.700
Who's chosen to Instagram

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
His apple pie, a la mode.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.300
While he fumbles through the filters

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.200
His ice cream has gotten "a la hot"

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.260
And the pie "a la cold."

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.200
As you can see

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.200
This street performer's drawn a crowd

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.649
To watch him do his thing.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.200
But instead of just enjoying the show

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.700
it seems that everyone's decided

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.000
To make a documentary.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
Notice this unreasonably attractive couple

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.330
Enjoying a reasonably priced Italian dinner together.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.600
Social networking instead of working

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
On getting to know each other better

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.680
How does that filtered picture taste

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
Since your dessert has gone to waste?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
When do you think you ever will

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.100
Wanna watch this portrait juggling film?

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.000
You know you want to touch each other

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Does that feel good?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
He's my brother.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.100
Get off the phone now!

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.100
It's gonna be okay

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.900
There's no need to be afraid.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.900
It doesn't love you

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
Its gonna die one day.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.200
The government is probably

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800
Spying on you with it anyway.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.500
Here we have a stereotypical teen

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.000
Forced to endure "Family Game Night."

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
He's stereotypically texting

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.800
And missing his mom

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.100
Demonstrate a carousel ride.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100
Little Ethan here

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.100
Is celebrating being the center of the universe

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.300
For one year.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.300
But "The World's Greatest Dad"

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.200
Is more worried about 'Facebooking' it

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.800
Than actually being here.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.500
Let's listen in and see if we can get some context.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.800
"Please hurry! We're at 382 Pine."

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.280
He has the nerve to make a phone call

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.900
At such a pivotal moment in his friend's life.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.500
How could you be so disengaged?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
While precious memories are being made?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.400
Do you really think your friends need

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.800
Another baby picture in their feed?

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.500
Don't be such a self- centered guy.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.000
Now isn't that better?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.500
"I think he just died."

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.800
Get off the phone now!

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.900
It's gonna be okay.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.100
There's no need to be afraid.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.400
(Get off the phone now!)
It doesn't love you

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.200
It's gonna die one day.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.700
It's crawling with e-coli bacteria anyway.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.300
(Get off the phone now!)
It's gonna be okay.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.400
Hey guys. I'm on the set of our music video.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.500
There's Rhett.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.500
Seriously?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.700
What?
