00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.000
This glass has water, and this has sewer....

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
How does this relates 
to animal experimentation?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
UNDERSTANDING ANIMAL EXPERIMENTATION

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.000
The concept of model.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Animals are used in research because 
it is understood that they are models.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.000
A model in science is a resource
that aims to represent a certain reality.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.600
In this second video, 
I will highlight an idea

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
that is already known even 
by who experiment on animals:

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.300
the idea that the best model to understand
the human biology is the human himself.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.500
"The best way to increasingly know and understand the human species,from the psycho-social to its organic aspects, 
is doing studies on humans"

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Some may say it is unethical to use people
in research,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.500
as lots of crimes has been 
committed in medical experiments...

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.500
they raise the devil out of these episodes,
which is quite convenient

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.700
in order to sustain that it is
better to use rats instead of men!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Of course many *#*# has happened in research
involving humans, and we need to always learn

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.000
from these tragedies. But not all human
experiments are like that.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.000
Today we follow high criteria guidelines 
in human research,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700
we have regardful ethics committees,
legal punishments, and so on...

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600
The fact is that people are experimented on,
and a lot!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
For instance, drugs available in the drugstore
do exists thanks

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to tests on human volunteers in the clinical
phase.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.200
And it is in that phase, with humans being
experimented on,

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.900
that the data are in fact relevant.
So, it does not follow the fallacy that

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.700
these experiments are unethical, or not viable.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.700
If they are conducted with ethics, 
respecting the person dignity and integrity,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.000
and providing all information about the research

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.700
then they are quite possible,
acceptable and specially desirable.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Well, this is the Vitruvian man, 
made by our fellow Leonardo.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
What we see here is a human model, 
with all its dimensions...

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.900
within that we already know as 
constituting a human body.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Now this is a Vitruvian rat. 
It does not exist, of course...

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.300
...but is a good image 
to reveal the belief

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.900
(and a strong belief!)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.900
that if I inject a substance to a rat, 
than the reaction on this animal

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.400
can give us some clue 
of what might happen to ourselves.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.200
But no!

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.400
Centuries ago, when classical 
anatomists opened animals,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.000
what they saw was a tremendous 
similarity on the distribution of organs.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In fact, we are very alike in our internal
anatomy,  when compared to other animals.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.000
That induced many scientists from that 
period to assume that,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.800
if we are alike in our internal anatomy, 
then we are alike in our physiology!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.800
Its quite a good thought, 
but not quite the reality.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In physiology, we know that small differences 
are very important on, say, metabolic chains.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.800
Then a important question 
is raised on this subject:

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.500
how similar are we from the physiologic 
standpoint, to justify animal modelling?

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.000
One of these answers relies on genes.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.500
Its alleged that there is a lot of 
genetic correspondence amongst some species.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
For instance, with monkeys we
share about 98% of our genes

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.000
and with mice, up to 90% are shared.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.500
It is curious that we share more than 
50% of our genes with you know what?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.400
The remaining question is that: 
what these numbers says about  the similarity amongst species?

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.000
Remember the glasses with water and sewer
 presented in the beginning of this video?

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.000
Well, I want to believe that none of you
 would drink the glass of sewer...

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.500
if I tell you that 99% of it is pure water!

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500
This 1% of difference is imperative 
on this comparison.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.000
So, genetic correspondence, at least in this argument, 
is a mere quantitative evaluation,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.800
and its says little about the real 
differences found amongst species.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.500
And beyond physiological and metabolic
differences amongst distinct species,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.000
there is another factor that limits a lot the idea 
of modelling in animals our human condition,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.500
which is the environmental factor.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
This is the Vitruvian Homer Simpson. 
And believe me, he does exists!

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.200
This image represents the human being on
its peculiar environmental condition

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.800
with his own habits, culture, 
lifestyle, beliefs....

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The fact is that experimental animals are models that, 
beyond the fact that they are genetically homogeneous,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.500
they have a very standardized diet...

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.500
live on a highly controlled 
environment...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.400
are sedentary...

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.400
have artificial diseases...

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.200
are usually young adults, healthy and 
without intercurrent diseases.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.500
Absolutely nothing to do with our situation.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:32.000
If factors like nutrition, exercises, environment, age 
and many others affects a lot on our physiology,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.000
and in fact in all other animals...

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.500
...what kind of model is this 
that is aimed to represent our biology?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.300
"The real world of medicine includes great genetic diversity, intercurrent diseases, and a highly variable environment including nutritional status; these factors are difficult to model in animal studies"

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.200
We need to understand that every
model used in Science has limitations...

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.000
What actually happens is that 
these limitations are not usually

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.500
considered by those experimenting on animals.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.000
Not to mention the idea of translating data 
amongst different species,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Not to mention the idea of translating data 
amongst different species,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.800
which is, from the standpoint of evolutionary biology, and the 
science of complexity, quite rustic!

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.200
Then the researcher will say: 
"Oh, but in vitro models are limited..."

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.200
Of course they are! One of the most 
important characteristics of models...

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.000
is that they can be improved, and even abandoned,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
if they are considered irrelevant 
for the studied phenomenon.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.000
What is missing is a rigorous 
and independent evaluation

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.500
of animal modelling. I think this 
is the main point to understand

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.500
why we need to replace animals 
in biomedical research.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.000
It is pointless to talk about how the replacement 
should occur if I am not convinced about the reasons

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.600
for replacement. 
Or we should end like this:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.800
"Those with the absolute conviction that animals are unnecessary in biomedical research could prove their point by simply showing there is another way. Such a demonstration would be a tremendous contribution to society"

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.200
This guy may have forgotten that 
a criticism to any established model in science

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.000
does no rely on the existence 
of any better model that replaces it.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.900
And criticism should be allways welcome in science.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Research on human health is 
going through a phocus change.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.500
Instead of standing on supposed 
similarities we share with other animals,

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:12.000
the interest is now being on the differences we find 
amongst individuals of our own species.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.700
For instance, pharmacogenetics
is a field interested in this variation,

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:26.500
as even ethnical differences 
are relevant on drug responses.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:35.000
We also know that environmental conditions are 
determinant on the emerging of diseases that affect us,

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:39.000
...even our thoughts can 
interfere on our physiology!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.300
Now I ask you: what is more relevant 
from the standpoint of modelling?

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.000
Generate data in animals 
to cure human diseases,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.500
or generate data from our own biology, 
respecting the biological limits of each species?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.000
See you next time.
Saravá!
