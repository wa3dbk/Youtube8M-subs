00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.520
If you're wondering what I've been up to this summer

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.900
I've been busy using this machine

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.260
And I've not become a sewing freak

00:00:07.484 --> 00:00:11.544
the only reason is that I will be attending the Medieval Week (Visby, Sweden) this year

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.200
I've only one and a half day left before I travel to Gotland

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.200
and I've got too many things to do

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.980
When you're visiting the Medieval Week, you need something grand to wear

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.660
and that's my current project

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.660
One of my dresses are hanging in the background

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:39.151
(In the beginning I planned to sew just that one dress, but something happend and now there are two of them)

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.860
I'm finishing the second dress at the moment

00:00:44.648 --> 00:00:46.648
with this lovely pink color

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.080
yes

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.400
I've ben struggeling with you, my friend...

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.400
First, I found this green fabric

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.120
and later I found this 1940's dress pattern at Etsy.com

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.025
The style was similar to the one I'd sketched for my dress

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:06.085
At least the 40's dress had the same waistline, opening in the front and almost the same length

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.700
But the sleeves were too short, so I made new ones

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.560
I thought the neckline was ugly, so I cut this one out instead

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.660
Since the pattern was made for a dress with loose fit,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.160
and I wanted a close-fitting, I had to change the fitting as well.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.420
I also made the skirt longer (especially in the back)...

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.960
...wider.. 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.580
... etc etc ...

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.700
My finished dress looks nothing like the one in the pattern

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240
I gave my sketch long, wide sleeves

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:47.980
but as I was sewing, I realized that wide sleeves probably would be too much for this dress

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.620
So I decided to make slim sleeves.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:52.834
I'm very pleased with that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.080
But that's when I started to think of a second dress

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.920
I wanted bell sleves as well

00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:02.156
I will show you..

00:02:05.034 --> 00:02:08.034
These sleeves are huge!

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.020
I cheated and used a zipper for closer fit

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.000
I had no idea how this pink dress would turn out

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I had no special design in mind

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.400
besides the fact that I wanted it fitted with bell sleeves

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.320
but I think it turned out really well

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.120
and I like it as much as the first dress, which is awesome

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.500
since the first dress was properly planned, and this wasn't..

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.220
I've had so much fun and I've gained plenty of knowledge

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.120
I've never been sewing anything outside school

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.540
I like to start from scratch, without any expertise

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.440
and just try things out

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.880
I don't need any tips or tricks to get started

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.480
I feel most progress when I'm facing challenges all by myself, without anyone telling me what to do.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.260
I just try and see what happens

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.340
Now I have to finish my second dress before we're leaving in two days

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.920
Hopefully I will post a video next week with footage from the Medieval Week

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.380
Hope you're having a great summer

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.380
See you soon!
