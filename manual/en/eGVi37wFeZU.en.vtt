How to Guess How Many Candies Are in a Jar.

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:08.139
Want to win the prize?

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.940
Knowing a little math is the key to winning
this popular contest.

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.110
You will need A jar filled with spherical
or oblate spheroid candies Calculator Tape

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.790
measure Vernier calipers (optional) and computer
with internet access (optional).

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:24.790
Step 1.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.820
Ask for or estimate the total volume of the
jar as best you can.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.279
Convert the volume to milliliters.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.960
Convert to liters quickly by typing "convert
(your original units) into liters" into a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.220
search engine.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.430
Step 2.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670
Determine whether the candies are spheres.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.990
If they are balls, like gumballs or jawbreakers,
they're spheres.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.910
If the candies are round, but longer than
they are wide, they are "oblate spheroids."

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.070
Step 3.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.350
Find the volume of one candy, also in milliliters.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.380
First, find the radius of one candy, either
my estimating, using a tape measure, or by

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.840
using vernier calipers, which will provide
the most precise measurement.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.080
If your candy is spherical, use the formula
V = 4/3πr3, where r is the radius of one

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.730
candy, in centimeters.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.420
Round pi to 3.142 if you don't have a scientific
calculator.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.230
If the candies are oblate spheroids, use the
formula V = 4/3πa2b, where a is the longer

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.020
radius, and b is the shorter radius.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.040
Step 4.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.380
Calculate the percentage of the total volume
the candies take up in the jar.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.600
Calculate 64 percent of the jar's total volume
if the candies are spheres, and calculate

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.940
66.5 percent of its volume if they are oblate
spheroids.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.240
Step 5.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.891
For spherical candies, divide your estimate
for the size of one candy into 64 percent

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:47.530
of the volume of the jar.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.979
For oblate spheroid candies, divide the average
size of one candy into 66.5 percent of the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.000
volume.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
You've got the answer; now amaze your friends
with your guess!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.840
Did you know Did you know?

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.939
Bubble gum was invented by Walter Diemer in
1928.
