00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.750
I’ve given you a couple of options for ideas
to embroider on the front of your sweater.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.880
I have space invader, and I’ll show these
you in detail at the hand camera, and heart.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.400
And I’ve given you charts for both of these.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.860
Really, you can look online, there are so
many free cross stitch motifs, and you can

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.160
use any one of those.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.310
As long as the design is something that’s,
you know, maybe 15 stitches by 15 stitches,

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.210
a little more, a little less.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.550
Any of those will work as duplicate stitch
on something like this.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.910
And there are so many free ones out there.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.379
You can even do – what I think would be
nice is to do a letter, um, the baby’s first

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.570
name, something like that, one single letter.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.510
Anyway, there’s another idea.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.810
Let me show you these in detail.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.019
Here’s the little heart.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:02.699
And I’ve done it out of a variegated pink
yarn.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.290
And here is the little space invader, which
I’ve done out of a bright shocking green

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.290
on the gray.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.880
Okay, let’s work this.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.170
Here is my plain sweater front.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.620
And when I decide the pattern I want to use,
I want to be sure to count down and make sure

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.861
it’s centered, and make sure it is where
I want it to be.

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:27.710
I’ve placed the ones that I’ve done kind
of high up on the sweater, not in the center.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.390
But kind of high up right here, and then counted
down the number of stitches that it uses to

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.430
make sure that it is where I want it to be.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.680
You’ll want to do that with your own pattern.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.060
You can’t really mess that part up, as long
as it’s centered, of course.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.750
Now I’m using a really bright yellow here
for demonstration purposes, and it’s just

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.880
a worsted yarn.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.740
So I’m going to double it up. Because this
is chunky, this is worsted, double thickness

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.090
of this will match pretty well with what I’m
doing.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.640
So I have my tapestry needle, and I thread
the yarn on to the tapestry needle, and double

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.640
it up.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.172
Okay, I’m not going to pay attention to
where I am, because I just want to demonstrate

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:11.200
this technique to you.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.700
We’ve talked a lot about the knit stitch,
and this being the knit side of stockinette,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.530
being a series of Vs.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.000
And that’s what we’re going to work with
now.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.840
Duplicate stitch is really just a way of copying
exactly the way the knit stitch looks.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.060
See, it’s a series of Vs, and it just happens
to be in a pattern.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.010
So the first thing I do is I come in from
the back, and I come in at the bottom of a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.010
V.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.280
There’s a V, I’m right at the bottom of
it.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.690
And I want to pull my tail, leaving some edge
in the back – edge. Some of the end loose

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.080
in the back there but not too much.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.411
So there’s the first V, I came in the bottom
of this V, I skip that V, and I go through

00:02:53.411 --> 00:02:56.680
both legs of the V above it.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.319
Pull that through, and I watch my tension
there.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.340
And I go back down into the same hole that
I came out of.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.760
Ta da!

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.760
We have a V.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.630
Now I’m going to keep traveling up here
a little bit.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.810
I can come in at the bottom of a V right here,
skip that V, and go through both legs of the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.510
V above.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.510
Watching my tension.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.770
Especially because I have double thick yarn.
You see, you might have seen that one of those

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.390
strands kind of looped up on itself, so I
just tightened it up.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.030
I go back down into the same hole I came out
of, tighten that up, watching my tension the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.030
whole time.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.700
Okay, there I have a couple of Vs.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.209
I can keep doing this, and my favorite way
to do duplicate stitch is actually to travel

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.220
up like this, which is why I’m demonstrating
it this way.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.090
When you’re doing a pattern, of course,
you probably have to go different directions.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:58.050
I do find it easier, easiest, to start at
the bottom of a motif and work my way up.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.660
Okay, so I have a few stitches there, and
I can very easily travel to the left, doing

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.090
the exact same thing.

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.100
And I can travel down, although it’s not
my favorite way to do it because I have all

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.530
these stitches to go through.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.380
Okay.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.710
So that’s duplicate stitch.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.360
And once – you watch your tension as you
do it. But once you apply a little steam to

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.699
this, it does even things out and make it
look even better than when it’s first done.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.180
So pick a motif and embroider it to the front
and make the sweater your own.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.050
I think this will make a really good baby
shower gift.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.289
