Hey youtubers it's Charlie, comic con is this
week and I'm going to be doing a bunch of

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.420
Marvel related videos and a giveaway so I
wanted to do a big preview for all the Avengers

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.679
and spinoff movies stuff that's going to be
happening. There are a few films Marvel isn't

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.679
going to be promoting like Guardians but the
big news is that there will be an Avengers

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.710
Age of Ultron Trailer and I will be uploading
the panel footage.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.400
Be sure to subscribe to get all that stuff.
It's going to be a crazy week, but here's

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.390
what's going on.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.319
First, most important. The Marvel Universe
Panel is going to be on Saturday July 26th

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:38.109
at 5:30PM Pacific Time. That's going to last
two and a half hours. Most panels are only

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.769
one hour long. Marvel's is longer because
they dedicate a bunch of time to each of their

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.999
upcoming movies. Like last year they did about
45 minutes for Winter Soldier, then another

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:49.229
45 for Guardians, then the rest of the time
for Avengers 2.

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.079
This year is a little different in that they
have new movies they'll be showing off like

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.839
Ant Man and a full on Avengers 2 presentation
with the whole cast. That still leaves a lot

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.530
of time, what is the big surprise this year?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.579
Marvel just announced release dates for Five
new mystery movies. Those are theatrical movies,

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.530
so we're talking spinoffs, avengers sequels
and new characters. Those five are on top

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.579
of the movies they already have scheduled
in phase 3 including Ant-Man July 17th, 2015.

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:13.450
Captain America 3 May 6, 2016. Then 7 more
untitled films. These are the dates for each

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.729
of them.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.729
July 8th 2016, May 5, 2017, July 28 2017,
November 3 2017, July 6 2018, November 2 2018

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:29.780
and May 3 2019.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.149
What's the deal with so many untitled films.
Marvel will probably announce at least 3 or

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.249
4 of them. No one expects them to announce
all 7. But it's possible.

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:43.719
The most likely movies they'll announce are
Doctor Strange, it has a director but no release

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:50.719
date. It's rumored to be that July 8 2016,
making it the first phase 3 film after Captain

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.700
America 3. They have their actor, they found
Doctor Strange, but he hasn't signed the contract

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.749
yet.

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:58.130
Kevin Feige, president of the studio said
that if he signs by Saturday, they will announce

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.609
who it is at the Marvel Panel. That would
be the biggest surprise.

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.819
The biggest theories right now include Benedict
Cumberbatch, Jared Leto and Edgar Ramirez.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.720
After that, they'll probably announce Thor
3, Avengers 3 and a Guardians Sequel. I'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.069
also expecting them to announce what the first
movie of phase 4 is, the first movie after

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.920
Avengers 3.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.349
There is a small small chance they could announce
a Black Panther movie and an Inhumans Movie.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.069
That's a whole lot of information to dump
on Hall H, but that's why Marvel's Panel is

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.120
always the best.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.540
Like I said, I will be uploading it that night.
So it should post by midnight Saturday night

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.930
depending on internet speed.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.930
The Avengers 2 Trailer is a separate thing.
Marvel typically does not allow people to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.739
post footage from the panel online, I'll still
do a breakdown of it no matter what, but if

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.099
they do allow it to be posted online, I'll
add it to my video.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.099
Marvel announced that what they're going to
be doing, or trying to do is release at least

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.870
one sequel movie a year and one new character
movie a year. So here's a screenshot of that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.500
release schedule again, the unknowns.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.129
Spring is always where they put their biggest
movies, the sequels. Meaning the summer dates

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:13.079
are when we'll probably see new characters.
Once we get into 2017 there are 3 movies,

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.849
so they'll probably experiment and see if
it hurts their box office to release so many

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.590
big movies in the same year.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.819
If it goes well, and it totally will. They'll
probably start releasing 5 movies every two

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.849
years in addition to extra Netflix releases
like the Netflix shows.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:33.010
So for anyone wondering about Black Panther,
Captain Marvel and other big Avengers level

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.209
characters, we will definitely see them eventually.

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.400
I'm still expecting the first female driven
one to be Black Widow, but I think Captain

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.239
Marvel will be the second one.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.239
Feige has previously said that Phase 3, thematically
is going to be about Magic. Something they

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.549
haven't done in any of the movies yet. If
you remember at the end of Winter Soldier,

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.870
Baron Von Strucker said we are entering the
age of Miracles.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:07.730
He was talking about mutants, but miracles
is also another word for magic. It was no

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.269
coincidence that HYDRA was tracking Stephen
Strange. I think it's interesting Sitwell

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.160
didn't saw "Doctor" Strange. But that doesn't
mean that in current continuity, Stephen Strange

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.510
is not Sorcerer Supreme.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.350
But when you think about Phase 3, think about
him and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Phase

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.300
3 is paving the way for a multi dimensional
Marvel Universe, but giant asterisk.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.080
That doesn't mean they're going to jump into
the multiverse or visit any demon planes,

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.440
it just means they're building the foundation
to do that.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.440
Feige did this other interview where he made
it sound like Marvel will introduce Doctor

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.400
Strange in an Avengers context. Just because
in his mind, that's the way the character

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.310
has been developed in the past. In the comics
he's always a big part of Illuminati stories

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.110
and big Avengers Team Ups.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.310
That's why I totally think it's possible that
the Avengers 2 post credits scene could be

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.810
a Doctor Strange moment. They already hired
Scott Derrickson to direct a Doctor Strange

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.060
movie, so we know he's getting a standalone.But
if the president of the studio thinks the

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.470
character needs to be established through
the Avengers and Avengers 2 is still shooting,

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.960
wouldn't it make sense to include him in some
small way?

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.290
It's just supports the theory that they'll
announce some big Doctor Strange stuff this

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.760
weekend.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.980
The other big news they probably won't talk
about is the fate of who will direct Avengers

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.380
3. There's a lot of talk that Joss Whedon
will only write and produce that. The reason

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.380
people are reporting that is because the demands
of catering to Marvel's way of making movies

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.100
is getting tough. And Marvel movies have literally
been all he's thought about for the last 3

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.130
years and however long it takes to make Avengers
3. That's exhausting.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.480
So typically in situations like that, he'd
just step down from day to day directing duties

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.860
and just work on the script and produce. He'd
still have a big say in who gets cast, what

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.990
the story is and how everything looks. He'd
just get more of his free time back to be

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.600
a normal human being again. He does have a
family.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.000
If Joss Whedon doesn't direct Avengers 3,
who will they pick next?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.480
That's easy, James Gunn. Whenever you see
Guardians of The Galaxy in a couple weeks,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.670
you'll see exactly why James Gunn would be
perfect for a big team up movie like Avengers.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.720
Plus, he's not as expensive as Joss Whedon
at this point.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.350
It's true that Gunn said depending on how
well Guardians does at the box office, he

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.870
will direct Guardians 2. Marvel hasn't confirmed
that movie yet, but I'm expecting them to

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.330
announce it at the panel. Right now, it's
pre-release ticket sales are estimating it

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.210
will make between 68 and 70 Million Dollars
opening weekend, if it goes crazy that number

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.310
could go as high as 80 Million.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.330
Compare that to Winter Soldier opened at about
95 Million Dollars and Thor The Dark World

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.470
which opened at 85 Million dollars. Those
were both sequels. The first captain america

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.580
movie only earned 65 Million it's opening
weekend.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.910
So if Guardians actually hits what they're
predicting, James Gunn will definitely do

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.350
a sequel. That could make it harder for him
to do a third Avengers movie, but it just

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.610
depends on scheduling.
It will be a little easier to guess what Marvel

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.280
will do once they announce a date for Avengers
3, which I think is going to happen this weekend.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:04.610
I think that's going to be that July 2018
Date. That would give them two more films

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.010
to do after Captain America 3.

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.890
And for those asking about Tom Hiddleston,
he won't be back until Thor 3, which I also

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:19.820
think they'll announce at the panel. I don't
think he's going to introduce everyone like

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.740
he did with that huge reveal last year. He
was there mostly because they were promoting

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.660
Thor The Dark World.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.030
A small part of me thinks that James Spader
is going to do an Ultron Voice to intro the

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.890
panel. They'll do the Loki thing, but it will
be James Spader doing creepy Ultron Voice.

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.930
That is the coolest thing I think they could
do, but let me know if you have another theory.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.520
Here's the details on my Marvel giveaway.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.400
I'm giving away a Marvel Funko Pop figure.
All you have to do to participate is be a

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.040
pretty much any character that's available

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:55.360
So big reminder, Marvel Panel Saturday Night
