Announcer: You're watching Adorama TV.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.469
Mark Wallace: Hi, everybody. Welcome to another
episode of Adorama TV. I'm Mark Wallace. Well,

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.609
this week's iPad app review is all about Celtx
Script. Now, we've talked a little bit about

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.090
Celtx Studios and Celtx for the McIntosh and
PC, it's a desktop application. Well, now,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.980
some of that functionality comes to the iPad
as well as the iPhone. So, we're going to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.590
take a look, really quickly at Celtx Script.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:35.070
Celtx Script is an application on the iPad
that allows you to write screen plays. But

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.910
it also allows you to interface with Celtx
Studios which is a free application for your

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.670
desktop. So, this as I open it up, we have
a sample script in here. This is the Wizard

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.329
of Oz. And you can see that we have all kinds
of things in here. We have scene headings.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.290
We have action. We have characters. We have
dialog, etc. So, let's go in here and let's

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.579
create our own script.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.239
So, I'm going to hit this script button right
here. And I'm going to push the plus button.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.580
And it's going to ask me for my script name.
I'll just call it test. And then it's going

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.789
to ask who wrote this, and I'll say Mark did.
OK, Mark did it. And this other thing here,

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:13.399
Celtx Sink. Now, you want to turn that on
if you have Celtx for your desktop application.

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.920
So, I'm going to say, done. And now I have
this test script, I can go in here. The first

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.969
thing it's going to ask me for is my scene
heading.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:28.450
This menu bar at the top, it has a scene heading,
this is for action, this is for your characters.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.420
If you want to add dialog, you put that in
there, for an parenthetical you have that,

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.049
and then, of course, you have your shots and
your transition. It's just like any screen

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.020
writing software that you would normally have.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.169
So, for example, I can say this is an interior
shot, and it's at an office. So, there we

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:50.070
go. Now, as soon as I hit return it's going
to go straight to action, which is what we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:02.539
would expect. And I'm going to say, Leon is
hiding in the corner. So, that sort of sets

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.840
the scene and of course I can type in a bunch
of stuff. I'll hit return. Now, it's asking

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.360
for more action. But, I want to enter a character,
so, I'll tap that. And I'll say Leon, that's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.660
my character.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.220
And then, as soon as I hit return that automatically
goes to dialog, and I'll have Leon say something

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.640
and say, I don't know, "Hi there." I don't
know why he's hiding, but I'm not a very good

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:37.750
writer. "Hi there." And then I'll say a little
parenthetical here, Leon sneaks a snickers,

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.110
cause he loves candy, I don't know, just making
stuff up. And then I can go in here and I

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.960
can say, this is a wide shot. And I can go
back here, add some more action, Leon runs

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.040
across room.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.920
You can see this is [laughs] becoming really
horrible. So, anyway, etc. You can do all

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.260
kinds of stuff. And then let's say we need
to transition that to, sorry. So, that automatically

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.560
made the transition. I'll go back here to
make this action. I'll hit return. I'll make

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.530
this fade to black. OK, there we go. Now,
I have my horrible script in here of Leon

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.980
running across the room, and I'm done. OK,
I've written my script. There it is.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:28.150
So, I've got all my different things set up.
Now, if I go back to script, and I'm going

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.040
to hit sink. Now, when I do that, you're going
to see something else. I've previously exported

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.780
this script that I'd built on my desktop machine,
and you're going to see that show up here.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.571
But, this is also going to save this test
to the server, so, when I open my desktop

00:03:41.571 --> 00:03:43.569
machine, I can import that as well.

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.930
So, I'm going to hit sink. This is going to
go out and contact the server. It's going

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.930
to bring everything in. When I go back, you
can see that test has been saved to the server,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.480
and then also this other script that I created
earlier has been brought in. That was one

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.760
I exported from my desktop. Now, let me show
you how to export. This is the digital photography

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.380
one on one white balance that I did a few
weeks ago, I guess, on Adorama TV.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.690
But, let me go quickly and show you how you
export from your desktop. It's pretty simple.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.060
You just go to the script menu. You click
script, and then export to your iPad or iPhone.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.870
Now, once you do that then when you sink,
you'll see that that shows up here. All right,

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.279
now that we've sink, you can see that this
digital photography one on one white balance

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:32.000
episode is here. And I can look through that,
and you can see all of the... this is a very,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.090
very basic script, but I have that in there.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.770
But, the nice thing is if I click this over
here, I can see all of my different scene

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.860
headings. If I just need to jump to the wrap
up at the studio, I can see that. Or, if I

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.379
needed to go to the animation to see what
I'm suppose to read, I can do that. This is

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:51.340
really, really nice if you are reading through
a script and if you have a really long script,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340
you can see those.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.800
Let me show you a little bit more complicated
script. And this was as studio lighting DVD

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.259
that I'm working on. This has many, many scenes.
In fact, it's got right now 42 scenes. It'll

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.180
probably have more than that by the end of
it. But, let's say we're shooting on location

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.159
and I need to know well, what is scene nine.
What is that all about? I can just hit that,

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.659
go through there and see, "Oh, OK. That's
exactly what we're talking about. How does

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.169
that roll into 10. OK. Got it. Now, let's
go back to five."

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.189
So, this is really nice because most of the
time you don't shoot in sequence. And, so,

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:28.300
to get some context to see what's going on
that's there. And, so, it's really, really

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.840
nice. Now, the other thing is I have this
test script, and, so, if I have this here,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.370
what I can do is... Let me show you how you
import into the Celtx on your desktop.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.009
Now, it's just the opposite of what you did
when you exported it. You just go to script,

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.880
import from iPad or iPhone, and we can see
that this script looks just like it did on

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.059
the iPad, and now I can do all kinds of other
things in my desktop application like I do

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:59.540
in my master catalog in scheduling and things
like that. It's really, really, really nice.

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.539
Well, that's Celtx Script for the iPad. A
couple of things you should be aware of before

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:08.509
you purchase this application. First of all,
the sink that we showed you, the sink functionality,

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:13.479
well, that does not work with Celtx Studios.
So, if you have this story or script that

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.199
you've saved to Celtx Studios and you want
to sink it right to your iPad, it doesn't

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:22.229
work. You have to actually go to a desktop
application, open it from Celtx Studios and

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:23.629
then export it to the iPad.

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.370
Now, that's a bummer, because if you're working
in a collaborative environment which most

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.979
people do, if somebody else updates this script
in Celtx Studios well, it doesn't automatically

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:36.539
show up in the iPad. You have to, again, go
to the desktop, export it, and then it'll

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:41.689
show up there. The other thing that the sink
does not work with, it does not work for AD

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.809
scripts, it doesn't work for storyboards,
and it doesn't work for sketches either.

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.940
Now, I really hope that Celtx updates their
application, because those are really, really

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.369
valuable tools that we can use a lot. Also
the production catalog and scheduling, that

00:06:54.369 --> 00:07:01.080
isn't available either. It only works for
your scripts. Well, based on that I still

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:05.260
think this is a really, really valuable tool
for anybody that's using Celtx because you

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.550
can go in and you can use these for read throughs.
You can use them to make sure that you're

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.219
getting all of your stuff done on location.

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:16.199
And if you really just need to look at your
lines, as an actor, you can just scroll through

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:20.650
here and see what you're doing. So, it's worth
the 10 bucks for this application. And I do

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:25.720
recommend it if you're a heavy user of Celtx.
Well, there you have it. Thanks for joining
