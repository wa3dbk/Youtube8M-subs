00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
2-Araldite adhesive(alterative for shoe goo)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
3-Handgloves and scissors

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
4-Damaged shoe

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
5-Piece of sponge

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Take your damaged shoe and measure the torn part
of your shoe

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Trace down the measured torn parts on the tyre tube

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Cut the traced part

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Do the same  for sponge but this time measure
the depth of the damaged part

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Cut the required part

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now mix the resin and hardener(equal proprtion) of 
araldite adhesive

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
After mixing put the sponge in the hole 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Apply the mixture on the cut part of the tyre tube

00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Stick those tube parts one by one covering the
sponge and damaged part

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Make sure you form a thick layer at the ends so that it 
does'nt come out while skateboarding 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Do the same for the side part(This part is a bit difficult 
but can be easily done if done properly)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Apply multiple layers of mixture on the side part as 
it dries out(you can also use a hard cloth in place of 
tyre tube for the side part as job becomes easier)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Few tips
1-Put thick layers on the edges especially for the side part 
(remove air bubbles if encountered)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
2-Put multiple layers for better result

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
3-Smoothen out the edges using file(tool)

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Your shoe is now ready for some skateboarding action

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
As you can see its a fresh shoe

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Apply some araldite to the side part of the shoe

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Repeat the same step of mixing resin and the hardener

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Apply some mixture on the side part and form a layer

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000
You can see the shiny layer in the video which will boost your 
shoe life by 2-3 months

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
TIP-Apply mixture again as the layer fades away after doing 
tricks for better result
