Hey, it's Coach Tief for Tips4Running.com
and I have some running slogans to talk about

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.610
today.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.730
Nothing's better than having a great running
slogan to print on a T-Shirt, or to put something

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.910
on the front and the back of you're cross
country's team shirts to keep you motivated.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.130
I have a huge list of running slogans at the
link below if you want to see all the different

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.840
running slogans I've collected, but I'm kind
of asking you.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.360
What are some of your favorite running slogans.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.600
Just comment down below.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.720
I've got a list in my pocket of some of my
favorite ones.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.230
I've been trying to make my own running memes
now.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.870
Umm, and I don't know.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.520
Here's a few of those pictures.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.270
I just did one with an old picture of me back
in high school and it says, "It's fun to win,"

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.960
and then those are all my teammates and myself
pointing at someone after we won a race.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.960
Yeah, it was fun.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.309
Another one is I just ran in a Tough Mudder.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.980
So here's my, "Mud run fun," little memory.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.680
If you guys want to send in pictures of your
own, do that.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.280
Send in a picture of your own favorite, umm,
running picture and then slap a saying right

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.940
on it because hey, I'll post it on my site
and you can be internet famous I guess.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.729
Well, not really, but kinda.

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:26.729
Ha ha.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.430
Here are some other of the quotes that I wrote
down that are on the link down below.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.140
Umm, my personal favorite, "The faster you
run, the faster you're done."

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.420
Here's a front side, back side one.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.249
So on the front, it says, "Run with the best."

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.909
On the back, "Dust the rest."

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:44.909
Kinda like that one.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.909
I guess I like rhymes.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:46.909
I don't know.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.380
Ahh, if you're on a girls team, I always appreciated
this one.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.140
"I'm the fast girl your mother warned you
about."

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.310
And, of course I've got some borderline inappropriate
ones down at the end.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.399
"We kick asphalt."

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.399
There's a good one.

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.900
Yeah, it kind of sounds like you are swearing,
but anyways, check the link down below, and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900
leave your comments.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.090
I want to know what your favorite running
slogans or running quotes are.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.090
Alright.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.989
Happy Trails.
