00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.540
This is probably been the last eight years
I've done portraiture-like pieces.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.520
I worked in cardboard for,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.360
maybe twenty five, thirty, years.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.740
I didn't know Kurt Cobain at all.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.240
I mean, there's a big age difference.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.640
But I did find him an engaging person.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.700
He is bigger than life.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.440
He comes out of the Northwest.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.440
He comes out of the history of the Northwest.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.820
He's not fitting in -- he's fighting everything that he comes from.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.820
You know, he's raging against that but
he's part of it as well.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.340
I don't want to portray an angst about him, I want to portray

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.800
a handsomeness,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.320
a comfortableness, sort of a silliness, maybe about to grin.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.360
He looks healthy.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.040
And I wanted that added, this youthfulness,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.820
a strong youthfulness,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.580
with him, like his voice is,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.820
and there's a lot of anguish in his --

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.620
his voice when he'd sing, but there's also a strength in it, I wanted to portray that as well.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.000
I began doing pieces in cardboard because of, just, the economy.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.020
I'd find cardboard boxes and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.600
cut them up and make pieces with them, I could paint on it.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.500
The work is very physical and

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.660
there's an escape in that and it takes
on its own life as well.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.920
It's very abstract in the beginning.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.380
As it starts to evolve pieces are cut away, pieces are added on,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.160
and I think the hard part is knowing when to stop.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.320
To leave it with a sense of vitality.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.280
It's pretty simplistic, very low-tech.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.000
Cordless screw gun, drywall screws, glue.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.920
This is archival cardboard as well, it has this blue-grey color.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.220
I like the color, I like the
coolness of the color.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.340
I'm taking this from its original purpose of packaging,

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.320
and manipulating it and making it into something more precious than packaging.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.380
They're not a memorial, they are much about

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.100
mortality, immortality.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.080
The materials suggest that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.640
the way they're put together in a very, sort of, quick rough way

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.280
as if they're falling apart.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.180
Self-destructing.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.800
All that playing into the idea of icons, celebrities, being revisited,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.460
peaks and valleys, being brought back, being discarded.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.520
So it's meant to be more of a continuation, an ebb and a flow, rather than just this

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.240
memorial.
