just as your primary care physician may
refer you to a cardiologist to have heart surgury

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.460
your general dentist may want to refer
you to an endodontist

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.240
if that case looks like it's going to be
too technically

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.520
challenging for them or above what they
feel comfortable doing

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.189
an endodondist is a dentist who has had
additional training

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.119
additional two or three year program
that focus on that program is specific on

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.460
treating teeth that have pain infection
associated with a root canal problem

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.490
an endodontic procedure in a nutshell is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.580
you end up with injury to the tissue that lives inside the tooth called the pulp

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.470
that tissue unlike other tissue doesn't
have the ability to heal

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.580
as other tissue might becomes painful
infected

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.350
I don't know if words can't really
describe the level pain that I was

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.300
actually suffering

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.840
problems I had an excruciating toothache
the cavity

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.000
was below the gum level it just was just
giving me grief

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.100
just a constant pain in the back of my mouth for all day

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.980
I finished the procedure about 10-15 minutes ago

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.540
and I'm still a little numb a little bit, but I feel good, it's great

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.960
patients can run the gamut as far as
symptoms are concerned you can have

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.840
pain swelling sensitivity to hot or cold

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.759
biting pressure, sometimes there are no
symptoms whatsoever

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.890
an endodontist will remove the soft infected tissue from inside of the tooth

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.520
tissue from inside of the tooth

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.530
We clean, seal and fill the root canal space

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.690
after the root canal is completed you
will need to return

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.710
to your general dentist have either a
filling or

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.750
a crown placed on the tooth to protect
it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.240
there's nothing that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.010
looks like or feels like or
functions like a natural tooth

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.330
by providing a root canal for a patient

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
you can allow them to maintain their tooth

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.830
for their lifetime the root canal should
not be a painful procedure

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.260
part of your advanced training is to learn
the technique to make a potentially

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.520
painful procedure

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.750
as pain-free as possibly can be, and as a
general rule the vast majority of

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.540
endodontic procedures

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.730
are performed pain-free

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.360
I had the heart of rabbit, my heart was
fluttering

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.240
I mean I have dental phobia you know but
these guys put me at ease

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.290
I feel 100 percent better than now than
what I did before I came in

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.960
it is amazing I was so scared I thought
you didn't hurt so bad and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.960
and um, it when really really good if
you're about to come in to get a root

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.670
canal

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.870
I tell you I feel the same way I was
really nervous and everything

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.520
but I am it's not as bad as you would
think in it's only worth having your mouth open

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.030
for an hour to get rid of all that pain

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.620
probably the best way to ensure that
you're getting an endodontist who

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.430
is truly

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.990
specialized in endodontic care is go to the
website

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.680
at aae.org  and there is a public
section

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.150
that will take you to the endodontist
in your community

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.319
root canals with the advances that we've
made can be

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.870
actually a pleasant experience you walk
into the endodontist office in pain

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.500
you leave the pains gone you feel better
and you get to retain your natural tooth

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.110
there's nothing man-made they can
replace the natural

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.680
tooth in your mouth
