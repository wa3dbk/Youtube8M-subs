00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.360
&gt;&gt; I'm walking for my daughter.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.490
&gt;&gt; We're walking for Mary.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.849
&gt;&gt; I walk for all of our patients.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.900
&gt;&gt; We are here to support our girl Rialee.
She is cancer free as of now. She was fighting

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.380
Ewing sarcoma, so we are here today to walk
for her and run for her and support everybody

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.110
here, all of these amazing kids.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.190
&gt;&gt; It's such a wonderful feeling to see the
parkway filled up on a Sunday morning. 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.800
It just feels incredible and we feel so much
support. There are so many families out here

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.690
who are affected and it's wonderful to be
a part of this. She woke up at 5:45 and said

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.450
"Today is race day. It's Parkway Run
day." Right?

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.879
&gt;&gt; Record numbers today, we're estimating
more than 12 thousand people. We're here

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.949
on the parkway to find more cures for childhood
cancer.

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.250
&gt;&gt; CHOP's motto is hope lives here and boy,
does that resonate every single day and it

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.369
resonates in our hearts and our lives. We're
very touched.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.100
&gt;&gt; This is my city and it makes me so happy
to see people who I grew up with, people who

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.250
live here, all here for the same reason. I
don't know, it's just overwhelming, it fills

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.090
me so much.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.300
&gt;&gt; They saved my life, so they mean everything
to me and I love all the people here and there's

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.789
just so many incredible kids and doctors and
nurses and social workers and everybody's

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:28.569
just great.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:29.929
&gt;&gt; I'm walking for my daughter.

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:30.939
&gt;&gt; I walk for Leah.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.549
&gt;&gt; Run for Rialee

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.349
&gt;&gt; It is an amazing feeling to be here today.
Last year, she crossed the finish line in

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:42.299
her wheelchair. This year she's walking it.
So, it's a big deal, it's a big deal.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.429
&gt;&gt; It means a lot that I'm going to be able
to cross the finish line when so many kids

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:52.109
can't, and to be able to do that is so awesome
and I can't wait.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.760
&gt;&gt; It's the Four Seasons Parkway Run and Walk! 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.760
This is a special, special group right here.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 Such beautiful children!

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.980
&gt;&gt; Let's hear it for the kids again, our ambassadors
this year.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.180
&gt;&gt; $1,275,000.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.189
&gt;&gt; Thank you all so much for your fundraising
and your participation.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.230
&gt;&gt; You just never know whose lives it's
going to hit next.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.969
&gt;&gt; Being able to support programs and projects
and research with independent sources of funding

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:33.249
like the Parkway Run is absolutely critical.

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:36.829
&gt;&gt; Most of the things that we do early on
is entirely funded through events like this,

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.340
foundations and families. So this is the money
that really transform what we do on basic

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.879
research towards finding cures. Without it,
we could not do what we do on a daily basis.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:50.840
&gt;&gt; We definitely get goosebumps when we see
everybody. It means the world to us. I don't

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.890
think they even realize how much it means
to us as parents to see everybody supporting

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.810
these kids and the funding and the research
that is needed and to see all these people

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.760
out here, it means the world to us.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.670
&gt;&gt; I am so proud of everybody for coming out
for her. It means a lot to us. All my friends

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.010
are here. . .

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.310
&gt;&gt; I am telling you, we are so lucky here
in Philadelphia to have CHOP. To have this

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.969
world-renowned children's hospital.

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.319
&gt;&gt; We can be a part of bringing even more
and making 13 or 14 thousand people

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.290
next year.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.530
&gt;&gt; Cures are in front of us. It just takes
us to do it and the support to do it.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.980
&gt;&gt; Walk for me.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.920
&gt;&gt; For Veronica

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.899
&gt;&gt; Run for me.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.670
&gt;&gt; Thank you for walking for me.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.430
&gt;&gt; Thank you for running for me.
