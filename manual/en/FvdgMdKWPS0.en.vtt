00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.040
Computer tv CES 2009

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.060
Hey there, what's going on?
Check it out.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.970
I'm sitting here
in front of the ASUS booth

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.000
and right here is the new
Eee Top PC, 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.130
this is the new touch screen
Atom desktop they have.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.640
And what's incredible about this
it's this is going to be coming in

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.560
at a really low price point,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.600
and it's all completely
touch sensitive. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.730
All right here.
You don't need a keyboard,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.130
you don't need anything
but your fingers

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.070
to navigate this
15.6 inch touch screen display

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.430
that you are going
to find on this thing.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.430
It is running on
an Atom Processor.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.260
It does come 
with a 160 GB hard drive

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.100
and 1GB of DDR2 RAM. 
So we are looking 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.660
at similar specs
to a netbook here. 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.800
But, you get 
a nice package for your home.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.200
and this is perfect
for a computer to have,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.130
say, in your kitchen,
or on your table, 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.500
in your living room, 
right next to your couch.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.230
A perfect PC for pulling
up recopies

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.470
and pulling up anything
on the web.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.600
And it's all in this really, really
nice packaging. 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.740
It does have a webcam
built into it,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.240
 as you can see
on the back here. 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.900
Really, really cool setup.
It has a couple of USB ports

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.830
and a memory stick port
right over here. 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.470
A very clean design
and all from the folks at ASUS.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.540
Not bad, especially considering the price point.
I am not sure exactly 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:32.870
 what it is,  but I think
I remember reading

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.930
it is going to be 
right around the $500 mark.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.130
So, it's a really, really 
cool system, comes with XP home

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.030
pre-loaded on-board.
And of course, what makes it extra special

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.530
is the fact that it is
fully touch sensitive 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.970
right out of the box.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.470
That's the E Top. 
The ET 1602,

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.610
one of the incredibly cool systems,
we are seeing out here

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:55.600
at CES 2009. 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.300
Computer tv CES 2009.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800
