00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.130
The DrawingPanel class used in 
this video 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.590
can be downloaded from 
java dot martincarlisle dot com.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.960
Most modern programs use a 
graphical user interface, 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.740
rather than doing console I/O as with 
System.out.println.  

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.800
In the class DrawingPicture, we 
create a small picture of a yellow face.  

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.630
We start by creating a DrawingPanel 
object.  

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.370
Most Java classes have JavaDoc 
documentation 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.400
that can be viewed in a browser.  

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.160
This DrawingPanel class has 
JavaDoc documentation that 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.750
can be downloaded along with the 
source code.  

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.320
Looking at the documentation for the 
constructor, 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.690
we see that it requires two 
parameters, 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.740
for the width and height of the window.  

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.250
We’ll pick 300 by 300 for the size of 
this window.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.390
Next, we get the graphics object from 
the drawing panel.  

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.140
Graphics is a standard Java class 
that supports two dimensional drawing.  

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.390
You can think of this as painting on 
a canvas in layers.  

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:14.380
The order is important.  

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.960
We’ll first draw the yellow background, 
then add the eyes and mouth.  

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.130
If we did it in the reverse order, 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.430
the background would cover over 
the eyes and mouth.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.120
The coordinate system for Java has 
zero, zero in the upper left corner, 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.600
and 299, 299 in the lower right corner, which may seem upside down vertically.  

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.500
This drawing panel shows you on the 
bottom the coordinates of the mouse.  

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.460
We first set the drawing color to yellow, 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.830
then draw a circle (a special case 
of an oval) in the middle of the screen.  

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.720
The four parameters represent the 
upper left corner 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.780
and width and height of the bounding 
box in which the circle is inscribed.  

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.500
We then set the color to black, and 
draw two rectangles for the eyes.  

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.170
The parameters represent the upper 
left corner, then the width and the height.  

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.470
Next we draw another oval 
for the mouth.  

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.260
Finally, we copy the graphics to 
the screen.  

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.040
This particular drawing panel class 
is double-buffered.  

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.540
That is, the screen is not updated 
until the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.120
copyGraphicsToScreen 
method is called.  

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.850
This allows for smoother animations 
and reduced flicker.
