00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.639
break systems, some electrical systems to

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:14.469
painting, welding, doing bodywork,
straightening small dents, straightening big

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.419
dents

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.460
and um... basically making the car
after were, all finished with it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.050
after it's been wrecked

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:22.880
make it look brand new again

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.670
it's so gratifying to take something that's
been damaged

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.249
and bring it back to you know a state that

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:30.699
you know when the customer walks in
and says wow

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.660
you did a great job so it's very
gratifying

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.780
what you see right here this is a
1996 uh...

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.790
ss camaro

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.760
and it had front end damage on the bumper
and we're currently

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.780
fixing the bumper right now

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.140
over here we have race car

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.260
that we just finished painting

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.180
we designed and laid out the rally
stripes on it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.309
and now we're just about ready
for the process of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.340
reassembling it and putting it
back together

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.170
we get all sorts of different vehicles
in here anything from a volkswagon

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.680
to a mercedes to a cadillac

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.170
or to a pickup truck so uh... we do
have quite a variety of different

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.700
vehicles that you learn to work on here

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.810
we aren an ICAR welding

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.400
qualification test site

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.909
we're on of 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.360
only a few in uh... a large area around
here, technicians come in here from

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.500
the field

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.690
an actually take the weld test

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.110
so that uh.. they are qualified in
industry and that they're doing a

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.729
quality weld on a vehicle which is very
important. not only are we a steel welding test

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.090
site but we're also an aluminum welding
test site which means basically a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.690
student could come out of here with
both weld qualifications. we also do the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.880
star program

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.740
which is uh... required by the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.929
uh... EPA now that all painters
be certified so we do certify our

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.589
students here to meet the NECHAP
standards

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.639
the total cost of our program
is right around thirteen thousand

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:23.059
dollars

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.040
with tools included

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.219
the students are required to buy a set of
tools now that can range depending on

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.819
the quality tools and uh... and

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.329
where you purchased them

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.469
but that'll run somewhere between two
thousand and thirty five hundred dollars

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:41.329
Vendors come in here for what we call 
a tool night, where 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:46.639
up to fifty percent discount is offered
to the students

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.529
It's just know a lot guys that are
interested in cars no matter what the

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:54.329
age we have and age range right now
from about

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.539
eighteen to uh... forty

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:04.059
we've had female students in the past
who have done real well, especially in

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:07.649
the painting area and welding area

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:11.389
anywhere from insurance
companies as far as adjustors and

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:15.509
that type from uh... paint jobbers
which are paint suppliers

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:21.149
body shops we have a lot of graduate
setter by shop owners and managers and

00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:27.969
also technicians in the area

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.259
here in our lab we have three different
frame machines that we use for frame or

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.829
structural panel repair or structural
frame classes

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:36.750
um we do have

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.719
computerized measuring system that we
use with these machines

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.760
and they 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.219
um... basically measured the dimensions
of the vehicle

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.889
where there at and also tell us 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.849
which way and how much they need to
go back to

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.769
OEM standards this is one of
our paint booths here - down cross draft

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.699
with baking capabilities

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.949
and the students learn gun technique in
here

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:05.479
over behind me here is another one of our
booths that has a car in it right now

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.649
its getting ready for paint

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:13.270
um... this is also a down draft booth 
with baking capabilities

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.459
it will get up to about a hundred
and forty degrees

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.639
when we go to dry the paint in there
when we hit the big button

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.099
this is our dupont paint mixing room
here

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.490
where we mix our paint

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.729
you'll see all our tints there

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.710
we also can mix tri-coats here

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.629
and a lot of our colors anymore 
contain pearls

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:40.930
and so it gets to be a real

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.419
treat when it comes time

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.009
to match paint

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.479
this is our virtual spray unit

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.439
and what is does is simulate
the spraying of a true

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.020
spray gun through a video game

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.679
you might say

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:55.640
basically

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.240
gives us a score and analyzes
how well you did with thr spray gun
as far as

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.520
applying paint to the screen here

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.439
it really helps the student
get comfortable with the spray gun

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.069
so that when he does

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:09.130
go in the booth he has a good

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.180
feel of how the fun works

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.970
how to operate it and how to 
finesse it

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.139
for example the student would 
be sitting here

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.139
knee-knocking here at first
but as he gets good at it just walk it 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:27.150
down across and simulate spraying a hood,
a fender or different part that would a

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.000
real world situtation so

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.150
for the most part

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.979
this has really been a great training tool

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.139
for us as far as getting the student prepped
before going into the pain booth
