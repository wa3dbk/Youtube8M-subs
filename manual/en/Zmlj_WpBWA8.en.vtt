Well just because you have organized your
bathroom doesnâ€™t mean that it is always

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.720
going to be like that. I understand even though
I am a professional organizer we all live

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.140
life and yes things can build up when we have
a busy week. So I am going to show you a few

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.710
tips to make sure that your bathroom stays
as orderly as possible even in those stressy

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.520
times in life. So as you can see here I have
some items that are out of place but they

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.510
do have a home and that is the most important
thing about organizing. So you are organized

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.390
when you have a home to put everything and
that way it makes it quick and easy to put

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.260
things away. So we are going to be practicing
the two minute rule and what that rule consists

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.790
of is this; if you can do something in two
minutes or less just do it now, because otherwise

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.970
things are just going to build up and build
up and then all of a sudden you are going

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.240
to have a big bomb of a mess and it is no
fun to clean up that sort of thing, because

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.920
it really gets to be overwhelming. So what
I do is I take a little caddy and this caddy

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.770
can be used in any room of the house but it
is great for bathroom organization and this

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.290
could have been you know if things got misplaced
around the house, let us say these were you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.820
know by your television table or something
like that. Well, all I do is I bring them

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.260
in to my bathroom and my caddy and I would
just start to put them away in their appropriate

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:43.260
places, so this will go here for instance,
here, here and watch out how fast I am doing

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.950
this because everything has a home. This goes
with eye stuff, I have my eyelash curler here,

00:01:50.950 --> 00:02:02.150
brushes, makeup brushes have a home right
there, like so. Everything is so easy when

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.570
everything has a home. Now the next step that
I really want to talk to you about is the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.370
one in one out rule or for a very advanced
organizers we like to do the one in two out

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.590
rule; and that means whenever you come home
from the store and you bought something really

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.379
great and new that you want to add to your
bathroom such as a brand new facial cream.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.120
Well if I have got a brand new facial cream
you need to - whether or not you have a buildup

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.409
of face products - you need to get rid of
an old one, because the cycle will continue

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:45.639
to happen more in equals crushed space and
crushed space equals cluttered living. So

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.900
let us say for instance, oh! I bought this
brand new product here, so if I am getting

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.629
this brand new product I have to think about
you know what I really want to live without

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.840
and if you can think of something that is
really great. So you just trade it out, that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.579
way you are always working with the same amount
of stuff and this can be passed on to someone

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.489
else or maybe it goes in the trash. Also another
thing to think about is try not to buy anything

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.139
new for your bathroom. You know there is always
the greatest next product out there, but try

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:18.549
to use up what you have before you go to the
store and buy something new and then it can

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.120
be really like a rewarding tree for keeping
such a great space to live in, so those are

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.530
my tips and I hope you continue to use them.
