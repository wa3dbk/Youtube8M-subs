Hi you guys!
I've got some exciting news.

00:00:03.183 --> 00:00:06.647
I just finished recording a video

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.027
on this model.
It will be up in maybe a week or so.

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:16.011
It's a flower, a twirl
created by Krystyna Burczyk.

00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:19.265
But the real reason for this video is:

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:24.219
Good news: last week I reached
5555 subscribers

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:27.472
which I'm really excited about.
You keep me going

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.223
Everyone that subscribes,
watches my videos,

00:00:31.308 --> 00:00:34.284
especially comments and
posts video responses

00:00:34.707 --> 00:00:37.907
really motivates me to make more videos.

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:40.852
As of today I've got
- let me check -

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:45.056
5658 subscribers.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:48.760
So within a week,
about 100 more subscribers. Yey!

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.700
That's really nice!
I always try to make

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:57.355
a special video
- a noninstructional video -

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.443
when I reach a number of subscribers

00:01:01.518 --> 00:01:03.943
that makes me really excited.

00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:07.610
So, this time I decided not to
make a contest

00:01:08.042 --> 00:01:11.209
but I want to post a video

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:16.703
that features some answers
to questions you might have

00:01:16.892 --> 00:01:19.203
about origami or about myself.

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:22.012
So, comment on this video

00:01:22.127 --> 00:01:26.457
with a question to me
that you would like to have answered.

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:29.006
I'm going to pick a couple few that I

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:32.255
I find interesting or
a lot of people ask.

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:37.056
They need to be questions
that I feel comfortable answering.

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:40.365
If it get's too personal,
I'm not going to answer it.

00:01:40.865 --> 00:01:43.253
But general questions about myself

00:01:43.463 --> 00:01:46.189
and maybe even detailled questions about

00:01:46.312 --> 00:01:48.468
origami - go for it!

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:52.640
I have to set a deadline, I guess.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.423
My deadline is a week from now.

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:02.201
It's Sunday today [18 April 2010],
still quite early,

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:04.418
just finished recording.
I always have to record

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:07.034
quite early, so that
there's not a lot of background noise.

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.220
By now it's light outside.

00:02:11.382 --> 00:02:13.720
Let's just set

00:02:14.609 --> 00:02:17.523
Sunday morning [25 April 2010]
your time as the deadline.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:21.450
It will take me a couple of days to
look through the comments.

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:24.773
I have to think about
which questions to answer in any case.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.419
Until then, you know:
happy folding

00:02:29.453 --> 00:02:33.613
You'll be seeing an instructional video
on this superb flower

00:02:34.113 --> 00:02:36.979
I think I'll probably [upload it]
next weekend.

00:02:37.838 --> 00:02:39.818
I'm going hiking today

00:02:39.854 --> 00:02:41.292
so I don't have time to edit.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.236
But at least I managed
to record.

00:02:46.372 --> 00:02:50.814
I hope you have a great Sunday.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.441
I hope you have a great week.

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:57.367
Thank you for your subscriptions,
your comments, your video responses,

00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:01.165
and thank you for your views.
Thank you for staying tuned.

00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:05.298
I really appreciate

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:06.766
all of your comments

00:03:06.947 --> 00:03:09.064
even if they're sometimes critical,
I can take that.

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:16.383
I'm just sharing my happiness about

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:20.801
happyfolding being the success
it is right now.

00:03:20.807 --> 00:03:22.120
Ok, bye bye.
