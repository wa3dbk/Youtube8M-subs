00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:18.120
Hi!

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.380
Now I will talk about zamioculca.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.250
Also known as zamia or bright.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.960
English its name is zz plant.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.380
Because the scientific name is Zamioculcas zamiifolia.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.840
This is a super tough plant, ideal to have indoors.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.880
It does not need much light or nor too much water.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.540
It is super easy to maintain.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.240
Especially if you think you do not have the green thumb.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.220
It is a plant native from tropical Africa.

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:47.829
It is erect and rhizomatous.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.740
And has short stem, and its foliage is very decorative.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.020
It is thus through bright, very beautiful!

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.400
I used substrate for cacti and succulents.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.480
When you do water, water thoroughly.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.220
But let the substrate dry between one watering and the other, because it does not like too much water.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.360
See how the stem is kind of chubby?

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.620
So it's not exactly a succulent, but we consider it, right?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.180
As if it were from the family of succulents.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.540
So it likes little water.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.720
As I said in the beginning, it goes very well at home.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.700
So it likes this shade environment, right?

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.180
No need to worry too much about light to it.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.080
Of course if you leave it in a place with a little more clarity will be good.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.780
But the sun will likely burn the leaves.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.120
It will not be very happy.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.000
Its growth is slow, but it can reach about 90 centimeters tall indoors.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.800
There in Africa it may be even higher, but there is the native environment of it, right?

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.320
Here in Brazil it is not in its natural habitat.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.200
To make new seedlings, you can divide the rhizome or stakes with the tips.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.020
Attention! All parts of this plant are toxic.

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400
So take care with pets and children.
