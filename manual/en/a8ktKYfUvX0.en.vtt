00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.120
BRADSHAW: In less than twenty years, we have developed a regional, comprehensive public university

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.538
at a pace that's not been duplicated ever in higher education.

00:00:15.538 --> 00:00:20.098
KING: I remember coming back, visiting FGCU when it was four buildings.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.080
GORMAN: And to see it transition from when I was younger

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.480
to the fifteen thousand students that we have today

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.500
is just absolutely mind-blowing.

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.366
BRADSHAW: All of the buildings that you see, most of them around you now

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:32.620
in '07, they were not here.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.340
DE LA ROSA: Our faculty are of the kind that you would find at much larger institutions.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.556
BRADSHAW: Part of our DNA is to be good stewards of the environment.

00:00:40.556 --> 00:00:43.916
It's meaningful that we have a fifteen-acre solar field that provides

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.360
eighty-five percent of the power to these buildings.

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:50.689
WINTON: When you look at the job placement statistics for FGCU graduates,

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:52.177
they're phenomenal.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.700
This is a great place to be right now.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.580
STUDENT: We've accomplished so much.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.810
But there's still more to be done.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.120
To get there, we need your help to fund five initiatives.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.560
BEATTY: A lot of people are asking, why Florida Gulf Coast University?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.360
And the answer that you come back to is, what can you offer those students that's very different?

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.800
MULANEY: I went around looking at different schools, and none of the facilities compared

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.540
with the technology in the labs that we had here.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.660
WINTON: So I have two sons. I want them to go to a university

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.720
with a great facility, great classrooms. Why shouldn't they have the best?

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.813
JAMES: A scholarship, without a doubt, develops our economy.

00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:38.573
DE LA ROSA: It's probably one of the most important things. I probably wouldn't even be here if I didn't have it.

00:01:38.573 --> 00:01:42.142
BEATTY: You may be giving a scholarship to the next person who's going to start a small business,

00:01:42.142 --> 00:01:45.902
to that doctor who's going to stay down here and help provide medical care.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.800
WINTON: Our job is to educate and send well-rounded young people into the workforce.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.440
MCKENNA: Our students learn a lot about networking from day one when they enter our program.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.840
BLACK: The students intern with a variety of different programs in the area,

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.620
and that sets them up for a job opportunity.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.740
SMESKO: With all the success, particularly with men's basketball,

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.280
everybody's excited about the university.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.600
KING: We're Dunk City now. People know us.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.460
SVENSSON: Our coaches really go out of their way to help us here

00:02:13.464 --> 00:02:15.334
with the resources that we have.

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:18.094
JAMES: If we don't have scholarship opportunity for student athletes,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.000
they might very well go elsewhere.

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:23.649
SMESKO: And it's time we helped give them the facilities they need to be successful.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.260
ROEPSTORFF: The dynamics that come together when we meet with the business community

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.500
and see what their needs are, it's just a two-fold partnership.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.280
RUMBOLD: We have a number of students that work for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.057
or work for one of the county labs.

00:02:39.057 --> 00:02:41.757
KATKIN: I think the university does so much for Southwest Florida,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
and it's going to do even more.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.660
SVENSSON: You helped build this.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.820
JAMES: Without your donation, my dream wouldn't have been able to come to fruition.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.520
GORMAN: I can say without a doubt that coming here and becoming an Eagle was the best decision I made.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.680
WINTON: We need donors that are committed to FGCU for the long term.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.700
BRADSHAW: We cannot do it without the continued, unwavering support

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.060
of the people we serve and the communities that we embrace.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.180
STUDENT: Five initiatives, one goal. Success.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.140
Together, we are just getting started.
