00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:10.070
Let me introduce this particularly handsome German Short-Haired Pointer

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.551
his name is Fritz.

00:00:11.864 --> 00:00:16.474
Fritz arrived at The Lost Dogs' Home undesexed and with raging hormones

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:21.646
that were driving him to hump everything and pee everywhere.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:25.358
His first stop was the vet clinic, where he was desexed.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:31.573
This got his hormones under control. He then joined our Behaviour Modification Program.

00:00:32.527 --> 00:00:37.467
Initially Fritz was very stressed and excitable, this of course was not his fault.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.043
Like so many dogs that are surrendered to The Lost Dogs' Home, he was simply untrained.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:49.632
Fritz was so out of control on a leash that it was difficult for even a strong man to hold him.

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:55.096
Three days after arriving at The Lost Dogs' Home we began to teach Fritz some manners. 

00:00:55.096 --> 00:01:02.228
Firstly I taught him that the best way to get someones attention was by keeping his four paws on the floor

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:09.145
rather than jumping.

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:19.537
I then taught Fritz to walk nicely on a leash

00:01:19.537 --> 00:01:23.532
When he was walking nicely I praised and rewarded him.

00:01:23.532 --> 00:01:29.381
Fritz quickly learnt that he could go for a nice walk if he just stopped pulling and pushing me around.

00:01:29.381 --> 00:01:36.554
He was soon able to walk nicely on a leash for other people. 

00:01:40.825 --> 00:01:43.921
His next lesson was learning not to barge through doorways.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:50.985
By closing the door each time he tried to barge through, Fritz soon learnt that the best way to get through a door

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:53.696
is to wait to be invited.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.908
Fritz has also learnt to sit.

00:01:57.205 --> 00:02:00.453
The last important step before making Fritz available for adoption

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:04.791
was to check that he was able to use his manners around other people.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.919
He passed this test with flying colours!

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.506
Our handsome boy now has manners to match.
