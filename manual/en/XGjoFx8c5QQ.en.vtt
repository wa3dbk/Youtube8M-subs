00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.090
In part 1 of this movie, we take a look at basic transforms.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.610
Transforms are the three tools you need 
to move, rotate, or scale objects in a scene.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.020
You can access them from the main tool bar, but also
from the quad menu when you right-click in a viewport.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.800
The keyboard shortcuts for Move, Rotate, 
and Scale are W, E, and R respectively.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.800
Transforms are also selection tools in their own rights,
so you don't have to switch back and forth between 
Select Object and the three transform tools.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.940
When a transform like Move is enabled and 
you select an object, a transform gizmo appears.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.820
In the case of Move, the gizmo shows three axis handles representing
X, Y, and Z directions, with the colors red, green, and blue.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.220
To move the object in any one direction, place the cursor
on the arrow until the line of its axis handle turns yellow.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.560
The arrowhead itself doesn't change color.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.340
And then when you click and drag, the object's motion
is constrained to that direction.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:16.340
To move an object in two directions simultaneously, 
place the cursor on the square where two direction axes meet.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.160
Rotation is similar, but the gizmo is different,
with a set of concentric circles.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.800
Again, the red, green, and blue colors 
reflect the X, Y, and Z directions.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.860
There is also a gray circle, which lets you rotate
the object on a plane parallel to the viewport.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.185
When you drag any one of these circles, it turns yellow
and the rotation is constrained to that axis.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:49.560
When the cursor is inside the sphere of rings, you can
rotate the object freely on all three axes simultaneously.

00:01:50.515 --> 00:02:00.019
If you wish, you can turn on Angle Snap from the main tool bar
to restrict the rotation to 5 degree increments.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:12.340
You can right-click Angle Snap to access the Options tab 
and change the angle to the degree you want, such as 45 degrees.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:27.440
You can also use the options in the Snap tab for precision control
to specify which elements you want to snap to, such as grid lines,
points, object pivots, edges, faces, and so on.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.530
The keyboard shortcut for Angle Snap is A.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.390
Scale has a few more options.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:42.870
In its simplest form, placing the cursor in the center of the gizmo
lets you make the object bigger or smaller without deforming it.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.640
However, dragging a single axis handle deforms the object
in one direction and the aspect ratio is altered.

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:56.985
You can also scale an object on 2 axes but not on the third.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.370
For example you can alter the fuel drum's radius
without altering its height.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:12.670
Finally, you can also use this last Scale option
in the flyout to squash and stretch the object,
which is very popular for creating a cartoon effect.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:24.680
Basically, this option lets you scale the object
along a given axis, in this case the Z axis, and deforms
the object along the other axes to retain the object's volume.

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.620
Sometimes you need to enter specific values
when you transform objects.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.540
You can type in values at the bottom of the screen,
or by right-clicking the appropriate transform button,
such as the Move tool in this case.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:47.360
The selected object at this time is at World coordinates -2, 0, 0.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:57.410
This scene displays meters as the unit of measurement, and you might see other types of units, such as inches or generic units, if you are using a different scene.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.620
To relocate this object to the origin of the world, you can set its X value to 0.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.150
Notice how the X value at the bottom of the screen also changed to 0.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.100
Sometimes though, you may need a relative offset.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.270
This other fuel drum, for example, 
has an imperfect decimal-driven X value.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.010
Suppose you want to push this object an extra 2 meters
to the right from where it is right now.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.110
Then you would use the Offset: World X value,
in the right column here.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.080
Once you type in 2 and press enter, the value
goes back to 0, readying itself for another entry,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:43.470
and the Absolute: World X value changes to the sum
of the original value plus the offset you just added.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:54.200
If you wish to add a relative offset at the bottom of the screen,
this option toggles between Absolute and Offset coordinates,
much like you have in the Transform Type-In dialog.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.950
Let's dismiss the dialog for now.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.130
Ultimately, you may need to align objects
together in some form or another.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.770
First, select the object you wish to relocate, such as this fuel drum,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:08.630
click the Align tool,

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.430
and then select the target object to which you want
to align the fuel drum, such as this crate here.

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.220
You can then preview and adjust the alignment
using a series of options.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:27.930
Let's make sure in this case that we align the pivot points first,
and then align the two objects in X, in Y, and in Z.

00:05:28.322 --> 00:05:37.806
Once you're done, click Apply to continue the alignment work,
or press OK to confirm the changes and exit the dialog.
