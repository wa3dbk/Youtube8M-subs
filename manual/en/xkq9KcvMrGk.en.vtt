00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:12.830
 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:24.200
I'm using four pounds of stoneware clay.
I attach the clay to the bat, and then I center

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.850
the clay.
So after I center the clay, I open up.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.229
Once the clay is opened up, I start bringing
up the walls with equal pressure

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.260
inside hand/outside hand at about 3 or 4 o'clock.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.080
I deliberately leave the walls of the form
thick knowing that I'm going to be pushing

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.080
it out, to make the form from a cylinder into
a rounded shape.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:25.760
After I pull the form up, I next smooth it
with a rubber rib.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:42.070
And then I use a tool called a Steve tool
that creates vertical texture.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.750
Next I apply sodium silicate with 
a brush.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.190
To get the sodium silicate hard on the form,
I use a heat gun.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.940
After the sodium silicate is dry and firm,
I can no longer use any water on the outside

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.590
of the form.
The shaping of the form comes all from pressure

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.590
with my inside hand pushing out.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.120
It takes several attempts to push it from
the top down, bulging it out until I get the

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.380
cracks to form and I achieve the profile
that I want.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.380
The cracking follows the lines that were made
by the Steve tool.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.980
After the lip is refined I use a needle tool
to trim it evenly and then I round it out.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.420
I cut a section of the bottom off to get the
profile more graceful.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.150
When the pot is competed, I take a wire tool
and I cut it, removing it from the bat.
