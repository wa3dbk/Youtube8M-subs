00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:09.639
Daddy Clay: &nbsp;We're at the fair with the Metro
Moms! [intro music]

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.650
Clay: &nbsp;Hey, welcome back to the very special
episode of DadLabs.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.930
We are back with some of our very favorite
moms.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.930
It's the Metro Moms.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.930
Thanks for being here, guys.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.820
Mom 1: &nbsp;We absolutely love being here at
the state fair.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.270
We have some fantastic tips to help you be
ready to tackle fairs and festivals with your

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.270
kids.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.140
Clay: &nbsp;We're brought to you today by Britax,
thoughtfully designed for you and your child.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.140
Britax.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.899
Let's roll!

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.270
Mom 1: &nbsp;Are you ready to go out to a fair
or festival with your child?

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.989
Well, I'm going to tell you how you can prepare
in advance, so that you take only what you

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.579
need, and you leave at home things that you
cannot take in there.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.739
It's very important that you check the fair's
website before you head out so that you know

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.149
what items you can and cannot take in.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.260
Some fairs do not let you bring in your own
food or drinks.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.810
Others are more lenient.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.270
Be sure to pack the stroller with everything
you need.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.020
If you forget something on the list and you
bring something that you can't take in, that's

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.650
OK, because a lot of them have coat‑check,
so you can leave the product behind at the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.650
gate.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.470
Once you get in, a map is the most important
thing that you can grab.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.720
Check out your nearest emergency stations
and restrooms.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.630
Most of all, have a great time and be prepared.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.580
Mom 2: &nbsp;The most important tip that I have
is to bring the right gear.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.110
A really good stroller is going to keep you
and Dad comfortable, and most importantly,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.180
the child as well.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.870
Something with a nice big sunshade to keep
that hot sun from overhead.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.900
Something with a cot, so the child can recline
and be comfortable if they need to take a

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.210
little rest.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.100
Make sure that you bring some healthy snacks,
too.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.950
You don't want to have to load up on junk
food at every single stop, so bringing enough

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.070
healthy snacks from home is going to go a
long way, too.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.650
Make sure you stay hydrated.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.200
If you're going to be bringing your own bottles,
bring something that can keep them cold all

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.260
day long, like the double‑walled bottle
from organicKidz.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.420
Finally, make sure you have enough hand sanitizer
on hand.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.950
They're going to touch a lot of sticky icky
surfaces, and their hands are going to get

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.950
pretty yucky.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.980
So, whether you like the sprays or the wipes
or the foams, make sure you have enough family‑friendly

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.980
hand sanitizer.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.250
And sunscreen.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.420
If you're only going to be out a few hours,
you can leave it behind and put it on at home.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.870
But if you're going to be out all day, make
sure you bring extra sunscreen with you so

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.090
that you can reapply, too.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.630
Clay: &nbsp;Whether it's a big game, a fair or
a festival, they all have one thing in common

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.630
and that's interference.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.010
I'm not just talking about people cutting
in the concession line.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.220
All these people means lots of gadgets.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.730
And that can wreak havoc on your communication
system.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.650
So, don't depend on the old standby text or
phone conversation when it's time to get the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.530
family back together if you get separated.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.070
I encourage it.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.510
Everybody should have the flexibility to go
off on their own to do the things that they

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.510
like.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.820
Just set rally points and times instead of
depending on the electronics to bring you

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.820
back together.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.640
Daddy Brad: &nbsp;You can see, moms and dads might
have a little bit of a different perception

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.140
about what a successful fair trip is.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.910
Instant gratification, a little more worried
about the aftermath.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.880
Mom 2: &nbsp;Yeah, I'm worried about staying hydrated,
and avoiding the stomach aches and the sunburns

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.250
and the meltdowns and the tantrums.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.000
Brad: &nbsp;You know what I really love about
today?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.450
Hanging out with the Metro Moms.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.450
We've had a great time.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.450
Thank you so much!

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.290
Mom 2: &nbsp;And a big thank you to DadLabs and
Britax, thoughtfully designed for you and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.290
your child.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.880
Without Britax we could not be ready for this
outdoor festival.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.570
Brad: &nbsp;You know what I'm ready for?

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.459
Some fried butter for the way home.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.950
Well, that's all for us here at DadLabs.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.680
We'll see you next time.
