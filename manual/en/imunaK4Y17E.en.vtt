00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.410
[Steve Myers] A question came up about homosexuality.
And one of the points some people try to make

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.860
is the fact that Jesus never condemned homosexuality.
They'll look through the New Testament and

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.900
say, "He never anything." In fact, they'll
point to the Apostle Paul and say that he

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.800
was very hard on homosexuals. In fact, one
of the past BT Dailies, we talked about several

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.449
sections in Romans and in 1 Corinthians - some
of Paul's writings - where he condemns the

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.179
act of homosexuality.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:40.380
Now, is this true? Is it really true that
Jesus never said anything about homosexuality?

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.270
It's not true. It is not true - there's a
basic misunderstanding that many people have.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.350
They forget what the Bible actually says.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.580
If you were to go back to the book of Leviticus,
it shows very clearly some interesting insight

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.000
into this behavior. In Leviticus 18:22 the
Bible says, "You shall not lie with a male

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.890
as with a woman. It is an abomination." Now
we read that and people will say, "Well, that's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.770
Old Covenant. That's Old Testament. That doesn't
apply to us today." Well, is that true?

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.729
Well a couple of pages over, it says in verse
13 of chapter 20, "If a man lies with a male

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.799
as he lies with a woman, both of them have
committed an abomination" (Leviticus 20:13).

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.969
Now if you were to check this out, you'd see
very clearly who's actually doing the talking?

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:35.689
It's not Moses. It's not any man. But it's
the Lord. If you look at the beginning of

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.753
chapter 18, the beginning of chapter 19, the
Lord spoke (Leviticus 18:1 and Leviticus 19:1).

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:43.640
And so very clearly, who is it? It's the Lord.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.630
Now, here's the question: who is the Lord?&nbsp;And
that's the vital question that everyone has

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.829
to answer when it comes to what the Bible
says and whether or not Jesus said anything

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.829
about homosexuality. You know where we find
the key?&nbsp;The key is found over in 1 Corinthians.

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:13.240
If you look at 1 Corinthians it is very clear
who the Lord is. 1 Corinthians 10:4, it says

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.360
very clearly the Lord that spoke to Moses
- notice what the Apostle Paul says under

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.980
inspiration. He says, "I don't want you to
be unaware that all our fathers were under

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.950
the cloud." Verse 2 of chapter 10 of 1 Corinthians,
"All were baptized into Moses and passed through

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.129
the sea" (1 Corinthians 10:2).

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.189
Now, we know that story of the Israelites
coming out of Egypt. Well, who was the God

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:41.280
that was with the Israelites at that time?
Who was God, the Lord, that spoke to Moses

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.120
that spoke to the people? Well it says in
verse 4, "All drank the same spiritual drink,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.860
for they drank of that spiritual Rock, which
followed them and that Rock was Christ" (1

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.860
Corinthians 10:4).

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.599
So, you see what the Bible says is the God
of the Old Testament is the One who became

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:09.390
Jesus Christ. So, the Lord that spoke homosexuality
is an abomination in the Old Testament was

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.739
not some mean, old God that was different
than Jesus Christ. It was the One who became

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:21.250
Jesus Christ. Hebrews 13:8 is so clear. It
says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.430
and forever. And if you fast forward to the
end of the book, go to the book of Revelation.

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.470
Revelation 22:14-15, it says, "Blessed are
those who do His commandments. They have a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.770
right to the tree of life." They have a right
to eternal life. But verse 15 says, "Outside

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.200
are dogs, sorcerers, sexual immoral, and murderers
and idolaters. "

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:52.930
So Christ is consistent. The Bible is consistent.
God loves the sinners, but He hates the sin.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.200
And that's the problem. So, He calls all to
repentance. He doesn't wish that any would

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.290
perish - but that all would come to repentance.&nbsp;That's
God's hope for all of us.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.590
So Jesus Christ is consistent. Jesus Christ
did speak clearly - not only about homosexuality,

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.959
but He talked about lying and murdering. Look
at the big ten. They are so clear. And so

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.100
never forget that. Jesus Christ is the same
yesterday, today and forever.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.849
That's BT Daily. We'll see you next time.
