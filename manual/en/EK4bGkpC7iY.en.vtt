The Bible, uh, for me is a guidebook.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.520
I think it's inspired by God,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.800
and I do think it's filled with inaccuracies.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.600
From a, you know, historical context,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.220
if you're, like, a literary studies person, the Bible is uh, um,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.460
just another text in, in many ways, and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.140
and truth is, I guess I'm a bigger believer

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.020
in empirical evidence, you know.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.100
It helps me figure out

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.620
how to live in kind of this crazy world.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.200
The Bible is the most trustworthy book

00:00:39.208 --> 00:00:40.228
on the planet Earth.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:41.548
Uh, I personally don't think

00:00:41.548 --> 00:00:43.920
everything should be taken literally.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.940
And I think that, uh, depending on the person,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.060
they should be able to interpret the Bible

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.320
the way that they want to.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.240
There's plenty of things that,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.540
even if you don't believe in God,

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.880
there's plenty of things in the Bible that

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.500
can improve your life, can, um,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.760
if you come to appreciate them,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.240
help you gain knowledge and wisdom, um,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.150
and help you to be a better person.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.360
The Bible? Mm, that's controversial.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.600
Thank you for asking.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.900
You'll see yourself in there.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.280
You'll see things in there that remind you of yourself,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.040
and it'll make you really want to change.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.240
You'll realize that that Bible's not lying to you,

00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:41.083
but it's telling you truth.

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:44.000
It's a, it's a storybook

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.660
just like any book that you can buy at the library.

00:01:46.666 --> 00:01:49.546
It's just a storybook written by some people

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.546
about some character.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.833
I think the values, um, that are presented in the Bible

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:09.291
and the stories, I mean, they're all stories

00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.051
that apply to, to everyday life

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.120
and things that have actually happened.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.760
So I think there's definitely truth,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.458
and you can definitely trust in what it's saying.

00:02:17.458 --> 00:02:18.958
The Bible's still here. Itâ€”

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.820
this book is almost 2,000 years old.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.380
Uh, it, it still exists for some reason,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.900
and to me, that stands out.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.780
That means something. That's not coincidence.
