00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.140
In this episode i'll teach you how to create
this Light Reveal Effect.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.390
I'm Mark Spencer from Ripple Training, Welcome to Motion Magic where you'll learn Visual Effects

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.190
and Motion Graphics in under 5 minutes. 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.440
Here we are in Motion with a Text Layer that has an outline and no face.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.260
From the Library I'll select
the Generators Category, then the Generators

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.300
folder locate the Clouds Generator, and add it to the Layers list. Notice how these clouds are animated.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.340
I want to use the Clouds to
reveal the text, so I'll select the text layer

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.670
and from the Object menu choose Add Image
Mask. I'll drag the clouds layer to the well

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.080
in the Heads up Display, then I'll change
the source channel to Luminance. 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.880
Now, we only see the text where the clouds are white.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.260
To create the rays of light, I'll select the group containing the text and the generator

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.320
Then from the Filters shortcut menu, I'll choose Glow, Light Rays.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.080
In the HUD I'll crank up the amount all the way 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.820
then in the Filters Inspector I'll increase the expansion so that the Rays don't get cut off

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:16.220
I'll also increase the Glow to two. If I skim the Project there are too many rays, so I'll select the clouds layer

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.680
and in the Generator Inspector I'll
turn off the first two layers

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.360
set the third layer to one, and the fourth layer to .5.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.760
Then, I'll reveal the gradient and move the black color tag over to the right

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.120
and move the white tag closer to it to create a mostly black field with bright white spots.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.820
You can see this if we turn the Clouds Layer back on.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:48.180
Let's turn it off, if I skim now we have
just a few rays of light beginning to reveal the text.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.340
Over time I wasn't more and more
white in the clouds to reveal more of the text.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.229
So, with the playhead at about two seconds, I'll set a keyframe for the location of the black color tag

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.629
which also sets a keyframe
for the white color tag.

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:09.929
Then  I'll move the playhead to 4 seconds and move both color tags to the left to fully reveal the text.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:17.420
To animate  the Light Rays off I'll select the filter,move to three seconds, go to the filter inspector,

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.740
set a keyframe for amount. Then move to four seconds and set the amount to zero.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.120
I want the text to end up filled with white. So, I'll select it, move the playhead to three seconds 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.760
and in the style tab of the text inspector,
enable the face set the opacity to zero

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.860
and set a keyframe and also set a keyframe for the opacity of the outline. 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:47.800
Then with the playhead at four second, I'll bring up the
face opacity, and bring down the outline opacity.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.400
I want more dramatic light rays, so with the
playhead where I can see the Red Rays

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.290
I'll select the light rays filter and press Command-D twice to make two copies. 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.580
If I press F6 to open the timeline and make sure Show Keyframes is enabled, 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.340
I can easily adjust the timing of the animating elements.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.000
Then, I'll press Command-R to create a Ram Preview and Play.
