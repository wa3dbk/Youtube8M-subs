00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.436
Welcome back to another cooking video, I'm
Chef Devaux, and today I'm going to teach

00:00:02.436 --> 00:00:04.820
you how to make the Millionaire Sushi Roll.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.430
It's a quite pricy roll to make so if you
can take it out of the bank to make it, it's

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.429
well worth it and it's just delicious, so
let's get straight into making it -- let's

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.429
go.

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.000
Alright so you start by taking a half sheet
of Nori, and you spread out 120-grams of cooked

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.750
sushi rice over it, nice and softly.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.960
Do not press it down, just fluff the sushi
rice out.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.500
If you don't know how to make sushi rice,
a link has just appeared on the top left corner

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.360
to my recipe, How to Make Sushi Rice.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.350
Okay, so now you take your mat and move it
up the board, and clean the board with a wet

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.730
towel so that the rice doesn't stick to the
board so much, and now place it over that.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.859
Now what you do is you take one third of Unagi
grilled eel and you place it on top of your

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:53.359
half sheet of Nori, then add some thinly sliced
cucumber.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.800
Okay now to roll the sushi roll, usually I
use a bamboo rolling mat underneath this,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:02.359
but you can just curl it over with your hands
and just form the sushi roll like this, you

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.870
don't really need a bamboo mat.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.470
And now you just use a bamboo mat to firm
it up.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
Now this method is a bit harder than the usual
way -- if you're new at this, try the method

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.930
in some of my older sushi roll videos instead
of this one.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.770
Okay, so once you've firmed it up, you turn
it on its side and you firm it up again, and

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.990
then you turn it on its side one more time
to firm it up one last time, and this is done

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:28.460
so you get it nice and smooth all the way
around, otherwise it looks a bit square -- this

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.039
looks more round.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.409
Alright, so now you take your sliced avocado
and you take slices one by one adding them

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.270
to your sushi roll, and I am doing it this
way because I want spaces in between.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.200
I don't want a massive amount of avocado,
so I'm leaving gaps on purpose.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.250
Alright, so once you've covered the entire
sushi roll with avocado you place a piece

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:55.189
of cling film over it and another bamboo mat
just to fix that on.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.580
Once you've fixed that on what you do is you
take your knife, you wet it in some water,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.659
and then you make three cuts -- one in the
middle and two on either side just to get

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.610
a nice smooth cut on both ends of the sushi
roll.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.400
Then you wet your knife again just to make
sure the rice doesn't stick to it much, and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.250
now you cut the two blocks in the middle into
three pieces and then do the same for the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.250
other block.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.810
Alright, so then you end up with six sushi
pieces and two end pieces -- I recommend you

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.560
just get rid of the end pieces, eat them instead
of putting them on a plate because they look

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.099
a little bit scruffy.

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:35.590
Alright so now you take your cling film off
and just inspect your sushi roll pieces, make

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.410
sure everything is good -- they look pretty
good.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.410
Yes?

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.410
I am just going to move them to one side to
make sure they're all good.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.959
Alright, so like I said we have six pieces
of sushi and two end pieces.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.610
You might notice that four are just about
to disappear now because I'm a little bit

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.090
hungry and what the heck, I want to eat this
now.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.629
Alright, so now you take your four pieces
of sushi and spread them out equally across

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:08.100
a plate, and then you take some Foie Gras.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.950
This has black truffles in it, little slices
of black truffles going all the way across

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.629
and two big ones up against the sides.

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.940
It's rather expensive, but unbelievably delicious.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.879
Just place a little sliver of Foie Gras onto
each individual piece of sushi.

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:29.371
Take your time with this because you don't
want to have massive blocks of Foie Gras on

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:30.459
the sushi roll.

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.829
You want to have thin slivers, otherwise it
becomes too overwhelming.

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.860
Great, so nearly done here -- one more go.

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.930
That's a nice little piece of truffle on that
last one.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.849
Alright, so now I am simply just going to
take a blow-torch and start to burn the top

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.189
of the Foie Gras with it and brūlée it and
get all those beautiful aromas releasing as

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:18.420
the Foie Gras starts melting brown, and just
becomes something completely different.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:28.130
Alright so now that I'm done with brūléeing
the Foie Gras, I'm going to take a little

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.020
bit of caviar from a certain fish, and this
comes from Rio Frio which is two hours away

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.620
from where I live, and it's quite pricy, just
like the Foie Gras with truffles in it but

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.090
its delicacy and it's just an awesome thing.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.949
Just place a small little scoop on top of
every sushi roll, and just be generous with

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.120
it.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:57.419
Okay, once you're done with that -- I'm going
to put this away, the caviar.

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.210
Alright, so now I'm just going to make it
rain, not with money, just with gold.

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.240
So this is edible gold leaf which I am just
sprinkling over it, and I find it very fitting

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.039
considering it's the Millionaire Sushi Roll.

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:21.770
There should be expensive stuff on it -- there
we go.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.130
Now I am just going to add some shredded carrots
as garnish and some shredded cucumber as another

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.130
little piece of garnish.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:39.170
Then I'm going to add a little bit of pickled
ginger, followed by a little wasabi flower.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.259
Now I'll take a little bit of truffle oil
and just a tiny dash of truffle oil, mix it

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.291
in with some extra virgin olive oil -- a lot
of extra virgin olive oil.

00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:54.520
You want a ratio about ten to one and one
being truffle oil.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.870
Now the reason for this is the truffle is
very strong and pungent so I don't want to

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.510
have it overwhelming the sushi roll with it.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:09.099
Now I am going to just drizzle it over -- there
we go nearly finished, and that's basically

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:11.160
it.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:17.350
We're done here.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.350
And Voilà!
