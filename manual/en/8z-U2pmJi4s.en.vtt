Hi, Joe Glavin
here with Philadelphia Floor. Today we're

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.440
on a job site where the customer has removed
indoor/outdoor carpet, PCT tile and underneath

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.760
was a maple floor. What we're going to do
today is test different methods for removing

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.760
mastic, cutback adhesive and old carpet
pad that's glued itself to the floor.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.540
So there's all kinds of different substances
on the floor over the maple that we're going

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.460
to remove. We're going to try methods using
essentially buffer. On the bottom of the buffer

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.460
we'll have a mastic removal tool that has
six cutting edges on it.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.629
The first thing you'll want to do is inspect the floor surface for any screws,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.829
nails or staples. These can damage your equipment
and the tooling.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:21.690
After prepping the surface, install the block
and adjust the buffer and begin the process.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.880
As you can see the buffer was set up for dust
collection. There's a hose, a skirt, attached

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.550
to a tank vac. We removed the skirt as the debris was getting caught underneath

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.270
and clogging the cutting blades.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.630
As you can see, the buffer is kicking out
pretty large pieces of debris. There is no

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.310
need to keep the skirt on as the vacuum system
wasn't picking up this debris. All it was

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.950
doing was clogging the blades.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.950
Here we're removing the cutback adhesive
and felt and transitioning over to the mastic.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.830
As you can see the block's doing a pretty
good job of removing material in one

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.830
pass. It's important to realize that this
is going to take time. Adjust your pace so

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.640
that the material is being removed.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.300
We're going against the grain here, but
whatever is working, with the grain, against

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.780
the grain, is fine. This block is not going
to damage the floor. It's specifically made

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.250
for a wood floor, and it's a 50-grit abrasive.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.130
As you can see, there's quite a bit of debris
flying around. It's important that

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:40.100
the debris get swept up as you go. By sweeping
up your debris, you're increasing the effectiveness

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.500
of the abrasive. You don't give the abrasive
a chance to clog if you keep the debris out

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.650
from underneath the buffer.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:56.650
As we transition into the carpet pad, anyone
that's tried to remove carpet pad that's

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.830
been stuck to a hardwood floor for 50 years
knows that it can really be a challenge.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.420
The block is doing a great job at removing
the carpet pad. As you can see, it's bare

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.420
wood in almost the first pass.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.970
When we started the process, there were three
methods we were going to use to remove the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.970
mastic. One was the titanium block.
As you can see, it's doing a great job.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.640
The only problem is it clogs quickly. The
surface area the titanium block allows for

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.380
the mastic to be reheated and get gummy again.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.380
It reactivates the adhesive and clogs the
abrasive. While this is a method used pretty

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.480
often, the process of taking the block off,
cleaning it with solvent, putting it back

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.750
on and continuing can be tedious.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:07.750
Another method we used was a belt sander.
With a 24 grit, we only got four passes before

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.680
the belt shot off and we had to shut the machine
down. In just a few passes, the amount of

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.750
material needed to be cleaned out of the machine,
off of the wheels and off of the top roller

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.290
disabled the machine.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:32.380
The top roller caked like this will not allow
the belt to track properly. As you

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.350
can see, the mastic removal block hardly has
any debris clogging the abrasive. This keeps

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.900
the abrasive effective and removing material
from the maple floor.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:51.040
This clearly made it the best choice for getting
this job site down to bare wood. After all,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:58.040
getting to bare wood is where we need to be
for this sander to be effective.
