00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.975
- Hello, everybody.

00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:04.185
Today, we are going to talk
about the digestive system,

00:00:04.209 --> 00:00:06.975
and we are going to start out
with our study

00:00:06.999 --> 00:00:08.975
of the gross anatomy
if the digestive system

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.810
by looking at some of
the functions

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:13.518
of the digestive system.

00:00:13.542 --> 00:00:17.101
So, let's get started
making a list of functions.

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:22.226
I have six primary functions,
and I'm actually--

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.560
I can't help it.
I have to draw you--

00:00:24.584 --> 00:00:27.351
even though I have this lovely
picture right here,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.852
I could use this picture,
but you know what?

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:31.976
We're going to get
into the anatomy

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.018
of all of these parts
and who these people are

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:37.018
and what part is
what in way more detail

00:00:37.042 --> 00:00:41.727
than we've got going on here.
But I can't help it.

00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:46.975
I have to draw you a picture
of your own digestive tube.

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:50.435
Does this look familiar?

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:52.685
You know it does.
We did this.

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:56.935
We drew this body when we were
talking about epithelial tissue.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:01.518
Remember that?
And remember how I had,

00:01:01.542 --> 00:01:06.477
oh, what is this?
A smiling happy mouth.

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.477
And what is this?

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:12.975
I'm going to make it
look like a sphincter.

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:15.975
Dude, I'm not even going
to talk about that.

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:19.435
That's your anus.
This is your digestive tube.

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.059
We're going to name all of
the parts in this lecture,

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:26.143
but I'm going to draw you a
picture of all of the functions

00:01:26.167 --> 00:01:29.685
of the digestive system,
and we're going to start

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.393
with the first one, which
is basically ingestion

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.643
of food particles
into the mouth.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:42.975
One of the jobs of the digestive
system is to ingest food.

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.975
That makes sense, doesn't it?
Imagine that.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:49.727
And, look, I even
drew it for you.

00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:52.185
Guess what?
Another function--okay.

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:55.976
I have to draw you a piece
of food that came in.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.976
Another function of the
digestive system

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.477
is to digest the food.

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.143
Really?
True story.

00:02:08.167 --> 00:02:12.935
What is digestion?
Well, basically, when you digest

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.768
something you break it
down into littler parts.

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:20.643
How great is this?
Look.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:25.976
I'm even going to label these.
Ingestion, this was number one.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.975
Digestion, this was number two.
I broke it down into pieces.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.975
In our digestive
system there are two

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.477
ways that we break things down.

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:39.560
We can break things
down chemically,

00:02:39.584 --> 00:02:43.643
or we can break them
down mechanically.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.975
That says mechanically.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.018
Of course it does.

00:02:50.042 --> 00:02:52.268
When you break something
down chemically, you actually

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:56.310
add a chemical to it and the
chemical breaks the chemical

00:02:56.334 --> 00:03:01.768
bonds in the original substance,
creating smaller particles.

00:03:01.792 --> 00:03:03.727
That's what digestion is.

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:05.975
When you break something
down mechanically,

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.975
you actually apply a force to
break the particles apart.

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.143
The end result is
exactly the same.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:15.518
You end up--you start out
with a big particle.

00:03:15.542 --> 00:03:18.351
You end up with lots of little
particles, which, again,

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:22.185
is the definition of digestion.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.976
A third thing that happens
in the digestive system--

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.975
I'm going to draw it
in a different color.

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.518
The digestive system,

00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:38.810
the whole system moves
substances through it.

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:43.393
So it's called motility.

00:03:43.417 --> 00:03:47.894
But basically, you're moving the
particles through the GI tract.

00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:50.727
So, look.
I'm going to draw it like this.

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:55.975
This is number three.
These particles move,

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:58.975
and I'm going to try to make
my little purple particles.

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.852
They just move through
the digestive tract.

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:07.059
As we examine our entire system,

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:10.059
we are going to see
the different parts of the tube,

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:11.351
and we're going to name

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:13.435
all of those different
parts of the tube,

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.477
and we'll notice
that different parts

00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:17.976
of the tube have different
functions.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.852
Like, different things are
happening in each of the parts,

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:23.351
but we have to move the food
through the tube

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:24.975
in order to get from the start
to the finish,

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:29.602
which makes complete sense.
Of course it does.

00:04:29.626 --> 00:04:30.975
We also have--

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.351
oh, I love this one--

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:38.226
another function is secretion,

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.975
and it's probably a good idea--

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.685
we're going to see secretion
in lots of different scenarios.

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:47.975
Secretion is when, like,
body cells--

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:50.143
this is familiar to you,
I know.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:56.935
Epithelial cells lining
the lumen of my digestive tube,

00:04:56.959 --> 00:05:00.768
actually are
producing substances,

00:05:00.792 --> 00:05:05.435
digestive chemicals,
mucus, other enzymes,

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:09.810
even sometimes
some waste products

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.976
are actually secreted
into the digestive tubing,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.810
but when a substance is moved
from the inside

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:18.477
of the body into the outside,

00:05:18.501 --> 00:05:21.810
into the tube,
that process is secretion.

00:05:21.834 --> 00:05:23.643
Are some of these familiar?

00:05:23.667 --> 00:05:26.685
They are totally functions
of epithelial tissue,

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:29.560
which is what
the tubing is lined with.

00:05:29.584 --> 00:05:33.268
All right.
Number five,

00:05:33.292 --> 00:05:37.101
why are we doing that?
Why digestive system?

00:05:37.125 --> 00:05:40.975
Why?
Because you are hungry.

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:43.435
Your cute little
cells are starving.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:44.975
And so another function

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.185
of the digestive
system is absorption.

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:51.810
Again, hopefully familiar,
because this is actually

00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:54.852
a function of the epithelial
tissues themselves.

00:05:54.876 --> 00:05:59.143
So, once you break down
your chemicals, your food,

00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:02.602
it gets digested
into smaller pieces.

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:03.975
What is the point

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.435
of breaking it into smaller
pieces in the first place?

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:11.894
Well, your cells actually cannot
use the hamburger directly.

00:06:11.918 --> 00:06:14.018
Your cells have to use
the molecules in the hamburger.

00:06:14.042 --> 00:06:16.226
They can't make energy

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:19.310
that you can use out of
an entire hamburger.

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:21.435
So, break it down.

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:23.685
Don't leave it in the tube,
because guess

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:25.727
where the tube is going.

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:27.975
Yeah.
That direction.

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:31.602
Anything you leave in there is
going to end up in your toilet.

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:33.975
Hopefully it's your toilet.

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.975
I don't really want
to think about that too much,

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:42.143
but anything that we want,
we better get it out of there

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:45.143
through the process
of absorption.

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:46.935
That's handy.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:51.477
And then anything that's
left over, yes.

00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.018
The things that are left over--

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:57.975
so we're going to take
the little purple squares,

00:06:57.999 --> 00:07:02.101
and anything that's left,
we are going to eliminate.

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:04.975
Elimination.

00:07:04.999 --> 00:07:08.768
Interestingly, the way
we eliminate stuff

00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:14.143
in the digestive system is by
going poo-poo through the anus.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:18.059
So, literally, diarrhea.
Diarrhea is awful.

00:07:18.083 --> 00:07:20.268
And you can--

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:23.059
it's a huge issue
if you have diarrhea

00:07:23.083 --> 00:07:25.975
and you can't
get it under control,

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:27.518
because you actually
are going to poop out

00:07:27.542 --> 00:07:28.894
all of your nutrients.

00:07:28.918 --> 00:07:32.185
You are going to eliminate
all of that stuff

00:07:32.209 --> 00:07:34.351
before you can absorb
the good stuff.

00:07:34.375 --> 00:07:35.975
You can't absorb
the water back in.

00:07:35.999 --> 00:07:37.185
You can't absorb the nutrients

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:40.310
back in because you are
pooping it out so fast

00:07:40.334 --> 00:07:44.768
that it is gone
before you can absorb it.

00:07:44.792 --> 00:07:45.975
Those are all--

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.643
that's a big picture overview
of our functions

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.685
of the digestive system, and now
we are going to break down

00:07:51.709 --> 00:07:54.810
each individual part of our tube

00:07:54.834 --> 00:07:56.477
and talk
about the unique features

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:58.185
found in that part of the tube,

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:00.768
and some of the anatomical
features,

00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:03.417
and then some of the functions
in each part.
