00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:07.330
In the world of speed and fast paced cow work,
this is a bit that I find to be very effective,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.590
good to the horse and placed in any hand,
can be the kind of bit that will put together

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:18.310
the right amount of leverage, the right picture
to control a very fast, high energy horse,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.920
and to protect the rider from any possibility
of under control. There's no question when

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.609
we go to compete, we sometimes choose a bit
that's going to be a little more assertive

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.169
because we have to have that ultimate control
that comes with the use of different kinds

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.550
of leverages. We're going to look at this
bit and recognize that we do have some of

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.129
those design features that are kind to the
horse. We have the dog bone in the center,

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.629
preventing the nutcracker effect, we have
sweet iron inlay here that allows for the

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.550
horse to salivate, it has a fast twist, which
is going to bring it to be just that little

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.749
bit more assertive than no twist or a slow
twist, giving contour and texture to make

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.269
that horse want to be just a little more focused
we say. The real unique feature of this, and

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:09.150
we sometimes call these an elevator bit, some
people do refer to them as gag bits. We want

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.550
to look at the feature and how that works.
In its proper position on the horse, this

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.620
should, this piece should be relaxed and hanging
nicely in the horse's mouth when at rest.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.300
As a horse becomes a little bit stronger,
more aggressive in their desire to compete,

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.930
as we pull back, this ought to slide upward
and, as you can see, create a little more

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.100
tension putting more pressure to the roof
of the horse's mouth. As all the other leverage

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.540
bits, this curb chain in place would put a
very assertive hold to the horse's bit as

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.390
it rises up and creates more contact, more
pressure. And so you'll have a horse that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.270
let's call it, they get a little bit of warning.
We begin to pull back, it raises up, that's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.070
why they call it the elevator, it comes up
further, and as it gets to here, that's going

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.600
to put them in a very strong sense against
the roof of their mouth. Somewhat why some

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.800
people do call it a gag bit. So with this
bit, I might put it on a very strong, competitive

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.819
kind of team penning or ranch sorting horse,
and or some of my game horses, my play day

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.290
horses. Especially when they have a rider
who's truly just learning. It's still kind

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.359
enough but assertive enough to work in that
picture.
