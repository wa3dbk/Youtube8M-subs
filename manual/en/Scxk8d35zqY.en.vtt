00:00:13.454 --> 00:00:20.200
The first thing that grabs your attention as you enter the house

00:00:20.223 --> 00:00:22.231
is its design

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:28.337
it's a design that makes the most of the open spaces

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.028
here, for example, we have architectural details that are very eye-catching

00:00:33.028 --> 00:00:41.701
here the fusion between the exterior and the interior is very well done

00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:52.186
for example, as you see, we have this wood floor with recessed lighting

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:56.948
which merges the interior with the exterior of the house

00:00:56.948 --> 00:01:02.774
here we have a large sitting room with incredible views

00:01:02.774 --> 00:01:05.267
just look at the generous spaces

00:01:05.267 --> 00:01:07.728
this is a spectacular house

00:01:07.728 --> 00:01:10.923
I have not been here at night time but I've seen photos

00:01:10.923 --> 00:01:16.497
with all of the indirect exterior lighting that it has

00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:21.741
and for the amount of metres of glass

00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:24.183
the house is divided over two floors

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:27.792
let's take a look at a few areas in more detail, like the kitchen

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:32.019
here we have a large kitchen, an island-type kitchen

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:41.458
as you see, the outside is always present from the inside of the house

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:44.125
the worktop is made of Silestone

00:01:44.125 --> 00:01:53.105
it has many compartments to keep kitchen equipment

00:01:53.105 --> 00:01:58.409
and it's a pleasure to be in here cooking while looking at the sea

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.001
and at the same time enjoying the exterior

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:06.064
here we have a pantry

00:02:06.064 --> 00:02:09.545
with a lot of shelving as you see

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:14.668
and also with carcases for electro-domestics

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:21.834
the whole house has a lot of recessed lighting in the ceilings

00:02:21.842 --> 00:02:26.651
here we have a laundry area

00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:29.620
with cupboards

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.726
there are lots of cupboards throughout the house

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:38.081
it really is very well equipped

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:45.908
here we see a dressing room with wardrobe-type cupboards

00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:48.298
and here we have a bedroom

00:02:48.298 --> 00:02:54.576
which is also of a considerable size

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.408
it's one of the most modest

00:02:56.408 --> 00:03:01.121
as it's the only one without sea views

00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:03.162
no, there are 4 with sea views

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:04.697
and there are a total of 6 bedrooms

00:03:04.697 --> 00:03:10.236
and all of them have bathrooms

00:03:10.242 --> 00:03:17.408
and here we have a guest cloakroom

00:03:17.408 --> 00:03:19.736
look at the finishes

00:03:19.736 --> 00:03:22.959
the taps, everything is of the highest quality

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:24.059
everything is well-chosen

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:30.634
here, for instance, we have the walls in micro-cement

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:36.148
the floors are wood and natural stone

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:40.389
the views are just tremendous

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.271
and we go up to the first floor

00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:48.903
to see more spaces in detail

00:03:48.903 --> 00:03:54.998
there is very good natural light in the house

00:03:55.014 --> 00:04:01.037
here we find this entrance with cupboards

00:04:01.037 --> 00:04:03.485
very useful

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:10.866
this walkway takes us directly to the main bedroom

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:15.059
which is known in English as the master bedroom

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:18.506
and first of all we find this dressing room

00:04:18.513 --> 00:04:24.487
with lots of drawers and wardrobes

00:04:24.488 --> 00:04:29.767
and here we have fantastic sea views

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:37.978
and here as you see this headboard is positioned to take a double bed

00:04:37.978 --> 00:04:42.208
and here we have the bathroom of the master bedroom

00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:46.932
this bathroom is a little bigger than the others

00:04:46.932 --> 00:04:52.823
here for instance we find double hand basins

00:04:52.823 --> 00:04:56.877
everything is impeccable

00:04:56.877 --> 00:05:01.110
and here we have the shower

00:05:01.114 --> 00:05:07.094
the views as you can see are unbeatable

00:05:07.097 --> 00:05:10.049
let's continue and look at a few more bedrooms

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:17.142
on the upper part of the house there are a total of 5 bedrooms

00:05:17.148 --> 00:05:20.175
here we find three together in a line

00:05:20.175 --> 00:05:26.002
the are more or less identical inside

00:05:26.002 --> 00:05:29.664
as you can see they are not lacking in any detail

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.139
there are showers in all of the bathrooms of the house

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.836
except one which has a bathtub

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:42.002
here we find a combination of elements

00:05:42.002 --> 00:05:47.862
there is stone and micro-cement

00:05:47.877 --> 00:05:53.897
the house needless to say is perfectly climatized

00:05:53.905 --> 00:05:59.065
it has a ducted air-con system

00:05:59.072 --> 00:06:04.893
and there are controls in all of the rooms of the house

00:06:04.893 --> 00:06:08.279
here as you see, in all of the bedrooms

00:06:08.283 --> 00:06:11.313
there are wardrobes

00:06:11.313 --> 00:06:14.184
it really does not lack any detail

00:06:14.184 --> 00:06:16.784
it's a very well-built house

00:06:16.784 --> 00:06:20.023
wery well-lit

00:06:20.023 --> 00:06:26.577
and which enjoys at the front sea views

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.549
and at the rear there is protected rustic land

00:06:32.549 --> 00:06:35.503
which cannot be built on

00:06:35.503 --> 00:06:37.846
and with these magnificent images

00:06:37.846 --> 00:06:40.032
from this spectacular location

00:06:40.045 --> 00:06:41.286
