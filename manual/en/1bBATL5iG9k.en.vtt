00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:04.020
What up y'all my name is Tweet Boogie.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.640
I represent the South Broncs.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.720
Had my first hip-hop crew at 14.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.610
Done some work with Jay-Z, Mary J. Blige,
Destiny's Child.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.999
Travel all over the world.

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:20.260
I teach hip-hop culture and right now I'm
ready to teach you some dances for the club.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.080
Let's get started.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.080
Chris Brown.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.119
Everybody wants to know how to dance like
Chris Brown, but right now you see him in

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.779
the reject video going off.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.849
He's doing a Cat Daddy.

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.980
So right now imma bout to break that down.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.410
So you take your right arm and it has to come
in front of your body in a circular motion,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.250
so it's the opposite side of your body which
is on the left.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.250
Boom.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.250
Good, in a circular motion.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.830
Then you gonna take the left arm and do the
other side.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.830
Two.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.430
So lets try that again.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.370
One, two.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.260
Now you're going to use both arms on the side
of your body and you're going to drop your

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.510
knees like so.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.000
Woah.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.520
Now you're gonna come up and boom.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.600
Let try that again.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:18.100
So you have down, up, seven, eight, and down,
up, seven, eight, and down, up.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.100
You gotta drop the knees and bring the hips
back.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.200
Down, up.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.170
Try it again.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.620
Seven, eight and down, up.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.790
Now we're gonna use our arms together.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.560
One, two.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.700
Seven, eight and one, two.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.210
Now we're gonna try to put all those steps
together so bring it across your body . One.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.909
Bring it across the other side.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.920

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.200

One, two, down, up.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.470
You can actually drop it a little bit lower
than that.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.450
Seven, eight and one, two, down, up.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:09.450
Good.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.329
