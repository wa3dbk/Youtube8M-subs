00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.220
Let's talk a little bit about sliding on clay.
Lots of people have a misconception

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.070
of what that is. People think that if you just
stop moving you are going to slide. No, the

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.210
way to slide on clay is, you are actually sliding
your foot forward in both directions. You

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.790
have to push out and lightly touch the ground,
and sink at the same time. That is how you

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:49.080
learn how to slide. The sliding on clay is
your last step. Instead of stepping to the

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.589
ball, what I am going to do is I am going
to slide to the ball. The key for a balanced

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.640
slide is to make sure that the body stays
back, you are sending your foot forward keeping

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.750
it light and sinking. Then you can swing and
get back. Another important misconception

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.619
is that you hit the ball while sliding. No,
you hit the ball after you finished sliding.

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.530
So if I am going to hit the ball there, I
am going to move, slide, hit the ball and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.870
then slide back. Next time you are on the
court, simply practice sliding like that.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.030
Keep it light. Keep your weight in the whole
foot. If you put your weight on the tip, you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.100
are going to feel like you falling over. If
you put too much weight on your foot, you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.230
are not going to be able to move it. With
a little bit of practice, slowly you can integrate

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:52.110
that into your game. First maybe pick up balls,
while sliding to the ball. Then by hitting

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.850
a few shots when it is close, and then try
to run longer distances.
