00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.109
Hi!

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.910
Tyrone Shum here from Outsourcing Live.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.730
All right, welcome to this next part in the
video series that I'm showing you on how to

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.810
outsource and another common question that
I've been receiving is how to overcome the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.380
fear of standing in front of the camera, and
talking and just presenting from the camera.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.020
I know a lot of people are fearful with that
and personally when I first started, I was

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.210
exactly the same.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.600
I was worried about how my hair would look,
I was worried about how my shirt would fit,

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.690
I was worried about how I talk, all that kind
of stuff.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:38.780
And it was nerve-racking.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.690
But after a while, after practice, after doing
this many, many times, I felt a lot more confident.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.100
And it's just like public speaking or getting
onstage and talking to people in a large crowd.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.710
Even today actually I still get nervous speaking
in front of an audience of hundreds of people

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.380
so it goes to show that it's not something
that just comes naturally.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.100
But what I wanted to share with you inside
this video today is to give you some pointers

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.659
on how to be able to create videos and be
comfortable in front of the camera and it's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.830
very, very much practicing thing.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.040
It's not something that will just come easily
to you but once you get the hang of it, it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.380
becomes very, very easy and that's how I'm
able to create a lot of videos very quickly

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.280
because I can just hop in front of the camera
and just share with you my knowledge and tips

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.540
on how to do it.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.360
So the first thing I want to share with you
is if you're not comfortable with doing the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.070
camera first, that's fine.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.070
Script it out.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.450
Write down some notes, I'm just actually giving
you an example right now.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.340
I've written some notes down so that makes
it easy so that you can see that I actually

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.800
follow my notes.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.390
But the most important thing is just write
down an outline or guide so that way you don't

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:51.810
get mentally blank.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.090
You can stand in front of the camera and talk
by following your guides.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.130
And it's okay if you've got to look at the
script here, it's fine to read it off sometimes

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.960
but make sure that you have you eye contact
with the camera because that's very, very

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960
important.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960
So that's the first tip.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.489
All right the second tip I want to share with
you is pretend as though there is a person

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.989
in front of you like a friend who you are
talking to.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:17.099
So just imagine there's a friend who's saying
hey tell me a little bit more about so and

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.099
so.

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.040
And it'll be like gazing or talking to somebody
as though you're introducing them to the first

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.350
time about a particular topic.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.709
And if you'll think back to the days if you've
ever tried to pick up a girl, I know that

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.500
this is a very popular and hot topic.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.260
When you're trying to pick up a girl this
is a similar idea is that when you talk to

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.500
them, you want to make sure that you have
eye contact but also strike a conversation

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.660
that's interesting to them or with them and
just talk as though you are talking to another

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.870
person and that's very, very easy to do because
once you don't think that you're in front

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.840
of camera but you're talking to another person,
you can go for days if you know what you're

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.840
talking about.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.000
So that's the second tip.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.330
The third tip I want to give you is turn it
into interview style and it's actually not

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.770
that hard to do.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.320
So once again, it's very similar to number
two except that you don't have to look in

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.811
front of the camera, you can actually turn
to the side which is what I'm going to do

00:03:08.811 --> 00:03:12.629
right now and pretend there's someone in front
of you.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.450
And have a list of questions or you're pre-prepped.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.989
So what you could do is whenever you got your
question in front of you, read it out loud,

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.349
answer the question as though you're doing
interview with someone and basically go through

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.680
that step one, step two of each question.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.470
So as you can see that wasn't that hard.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.270
You can stand in front of the camera, facing
at a different angle and get an interview

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.270
type of style.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.050
So that is my third tip there and really there's
not much more that I can give you in terms

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.920
of how to overcome the fear of that but I
think the main thing is practice.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.820
And overtime, once you become confident to
get in front of the camera and talk and share

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.090
ideas like this it becomes much, much easier
I can guarantee you do that because personally,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.739
I've done it.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.909
So I feel as though I'm at ease when I'm sharing
a lot of things with you, it's like as though

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.599
I'm actually talking to another bestfriend
or my wife on a general - everyday.

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.049
This is how I talk everyday, I talk to my
wife like this as well so after a while it

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.079
becomes very easy to be able to communicate
with you and I hope that's how you feel when

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.959
you watch these videos with me.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.320
Okay, anyway, if you've got any other questions,
feel free to ask me down below.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.539
I'd like to actually know what else do you
find fearful when you get in front of the

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.539
camera.

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.680
Maybe I could create another video on that
but I think this sort of gives you some tips

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.779
and some strategies on how to be able to overcome
that fear in front of the camera.

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.580
And if you can do that, you know I'd love
to be able to see that so leave some comments

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.960
down or some of your feedback on what other
things that you get scared about in standing

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.139
in front of the camera and I love to be able
to answer your questions.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:52.460
