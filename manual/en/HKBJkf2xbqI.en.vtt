00:00:00.803 --> 00:00:04.721
Narrator: The structure
of a Medieval Manuscript.

00:00:06.614 --> 00:00:09.616
For more than 1,000 years
all books were written

00:00:09.616 --> 00:00:12.618
and illustrated by hand.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.075
By the middle ages books were being made

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:20.237
by taking sheets of parchment,
folding them in half,

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:23.548
and arranging them in to short stacks

00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:25.990
called gatherings.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.631
Gatherings were joined side-by-side,

00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:31.560
sewn at the books spine
and attached to covers

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.355
to protect the books content.

00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:36.572
Looking at the spine of a book can reveal

00:00:36.572 --> 00:00:37.864
its structure.

00:00:37.864 --> 00:00:40.388
A gathering is typically
made of several sheets

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.684
of folded parchment.

00:00:42.684 --> 00:00:45.021
One sheet of folded parchment is called

00:00:45.021 --> 00:00:46.515
a bifolium.

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:49.593
Half a bifolium is a folio.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.842
Each folio is assigned a unique number

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:55.988
which refers to its front and back,

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:58.882
its recto and verso.

00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:01.299
When a book is assembled its folio's

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:03.879
are in sequence.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.375
A good example of this
can be seen by following

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:10.074
a story illustrated in a single gathering.

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.211
This story begins with St. Catherine,

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:15.048
an early convert to Christianity.

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:18.699
It continues with her
ability to convert others,

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:22.711
which angers the Roman Emperor.

00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:26.101
Catherine is tortured but survives.

00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:28.910
The story ends with St.
Catherine's martyrdom

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.821
and her body taken to Mt. Sinai by angels,

00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:34.979
but if a book is not bound its folio's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.669
can seem out of order.

00:01:39.608 --> 00:01:41.314
Here you can see that the first and last

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:43.405
illustrations were actually painted on

00:01:43.405 --> 00:01:46.981
the same piece of parchment.

00:01:48.612 --> 00:01:50.778
The structure of a book is a sophisticated

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:53.559
feat of engineering
that remains essentially

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:56.777
the same today.

00:01:58.825 --> 00:02:01.053
(The End)
