00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.910
Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now we are
ready to cook our blueberry and apple cinnamon

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.550
pancakes and you are going to scoop that batter
out carefully without knocking all of the

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.160
air out of the batter. You never want to stir
your batter; just scoop out what you need

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:28.570
or you'll knock the air out of it, there.
Okay we'll leave that there. Now I am going

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.590
to prepare this pan. I'm going to use some
pan spray. Just a little spray. You don't

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.409
need a lot of it. This is the blueberry pancakes
and we'll scoop a little of that. You'll see

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:53.100
it has a lot of yummy blueberries and you
don't want to put those too close or make

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.660
them too big. Just scoop them in there. Sometimes
you can pat them down a little bit. I'm going

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:10.140
to put that over there. Now our apple pancakes
are beginning to form a little bit firm on

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.259
the side and you look for the bubbles on the
outside.

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.149
See the little bit firmness here. A little
bit of bubbles. Wait just a little bit longer.

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:31.750
You can also put your spatula underneath and
peek and see that it is starting brown nicely.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:44.040
Those are ready to flip.
Get the spatula right under there and flip

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:52.640
it over there and you let that cook. And how
you tell it when it is done you just can hit

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.750
it and see it is a little bit jiggly right
now because it is not cooked yet but when

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.950
it is done wit will be a little bit more puffy.
Now our blueberry pancakes have been over

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.979
cooked there. Also getting firm on the sides
and also have like little bubbles. You get

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:22.250
underneath and flip that over. Beautiful!
you can move your pan around to put it in

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.780
a position that is easy to flip the pancakes.
Now our apple pancakes seem to be good. You

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.170
just hit the middle, peek under the bottom
to see if those are done. Here we can transfer

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:47.840
those onto our serving platter. Those are
our delicious apple cinnamon pancakes and

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.650
now let's check our blueberry pancakes and
take a peek. We'll just give them a second

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:05.670
more. They are bouncing back when I hit them
in the middle. That looks good. The blueberry

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.320
pancakes because of the blueberries they can
be very juicy so they might take a little

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:28.120
bit longer to cook. Just scoop them off and
see the bottom there and there you go. Delicious

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.980
blueberry and apple cinnamon pancakes.
