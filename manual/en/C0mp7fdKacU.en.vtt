00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:07.309
we've talked about guidance in the united
states and how regulations that toward bands

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:09.749
are a little too relaxed right

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:15.639
we have a perfect example of that uh... msnbc
just recently did a story today about how

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.099
in the past four years mexican authorities
have seized ninety thousand weapons due to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.210
the nation's drug war right

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.949
eighty percent of those ninety thousand weapons

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:28.909
are small but from the united states

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:33.100
so what the members of the cartel doing is
they're hiring people in the united states

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.120
they're paying them two hundred dollars each

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.220
she'll buy guns multiple times

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.230
and then given said members of the mexican
cartel

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.250
uh... first of all ho mostly as a company
u_s_d_a_ decided he would love

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.790
about i had like bill the correction actually
study percent according to the that i'll call

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.840
tobacco and firearms

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.880
ninety percent

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.550
what i love it at about this article again
it you know my workout today on the uh...

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.790
media today do that wonderful fake neutrality
o

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.290
uh... the government reports that of the cases
they have track

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.890
they go for sure

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.110
if ninety percent of the guns are coming from
the united states on the other hand the n_r_a_

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.750
says no

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.280
yeah of course the n_r_a_ says noble what
where they're that

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.619
and where is there evidence do they have no
evidence in your own nothing and it's a ridiculous

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.210
because look i'd get it i'd get it people
want their guns ok eighty in the united states

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.550
there's a constitutional right to have a gun
okay i understand that

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.260
dates to be more regulation dude like it come
under who

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.460
this is a sense that should be saying that
the seriously

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.149
elicit the fact that one individual can buy
some role guns

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.490
there was one person known in the story

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.329
that purchased

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:51.450
fifteen guns

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170
and what it's about three more and he got
caught

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.080
no one should be allowed to buy fifteen guns
at once why do you need fifteen times

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.969
just in case the caribou is also pack

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:03.730
fifty

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.259
you never know when the moose is going to
turn around

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.299
do you think these

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.769
it is easier on a bullet in the first working
down here

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.520
at the moment look thing about this

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.329
the drug cartels think hey you know what

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.180
let's go to the united states because they're
so soft

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.010
yes today

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.980
there so soft india let anybody buy guns

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.830
so in a wet

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.269
mexico their way to top honors let's go united
states for those suckers i will let us

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.569
by all the weapons that we want need

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.069
as crazy

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.209
but it's amazing how much the united states
is fueling the struggle work mexico

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.990
both by out buying the trucks and also

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.290
by giving them weapons can make the cartel's
even more powerful

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.290
mhm it's unbelievable and by say hey we're
doomed war on drugs for the only way you can

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.260
sell drugs

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.669
is if you're in the legal cartel

00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:58.400
and

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.589
thereby encouraging the growth of illegal
cartels who then go on to do terrible things

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:07.189
by the way we have a new number for you guys
for a number of people killed they update

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.489
the number every once in awhile when they
get the new the facts in uh... thirty one

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.909
thousand people have now died at in the war
on drugs in mexico since two thousand six

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.989
so

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.550
but uh... and by the way how did most of those
people died apparently most of them died

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.980
with guns me

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.529
indeed you would have spared you were over
wall and

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.979
so that we take you know we're losing the
china and everything else you know we can

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.870
we can't make that fails

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.730
we still make guns that killed people

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.440
yet u_s_a_

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.599
u_s_a_

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.629
it's absurd man we got it the whole thing
is to be turned upside down
