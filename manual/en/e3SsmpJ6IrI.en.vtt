How about make that one, what's that one say?
I dunno. Read it. My daughter's teacher sent

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.500
home a list of sight words she's supposed
to learn, and I'd like to know how I can make

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.099
learning those words fun. Well sight words
are high frequency words, like 'the' and 'was'

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.140
that often contain irregular spelling patterns.
So they just need to be memorized. Flash cards

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
can help with this, but they're even better
if you can play some games with those flash

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.150
cards. You can make a set of flash cards using
the words that your child is learning. Or

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.949
better yet, give her a list of those words
and have her make the cards herself. This

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.489
gives her a little bit of writing practice
and allows her to internalize those words.

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.750
2 minutes? Yeah! One game is a simple beat
the clock. Have your daughter pronounce as

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:05.750
many of the sight words as she can in a set
time period. You can also play a game called

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.630
stepping stones, for this game your daughter
can put those flash cards on the floor, and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:20.630
then step on each stone as she calls out the
word on the card. You can also play a simple

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.240
game of tic-tac- toe. For this game you just
want to make a grid, place a flash card in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.520
each of the spaces, and take turns with your
daughter reading the sight words. If the sight

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.020
word is read correctly, that player gets to
pick up the card and place an x or an o in

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.369
the space.
