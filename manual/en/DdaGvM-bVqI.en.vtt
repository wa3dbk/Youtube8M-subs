Welcome from AC News, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
let's see today's trailer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and cinema news is coming up!

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Clive Owen is convinced to become an action star.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And in fact we find him as lead role in Recall, written by Paul Schrader,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
better known for the screenplays for Martin Scorsese such as Taxi Driver or Raging Bull.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The director will be Harold Becker

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
who has not directed since his 2001 Domestic Disturbance.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Shooting should start March of next year in L.A and Bulgaria.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Owen has not produced great films recently,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but it's hard to give up on him, Schrader could be useful.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
First images for the new James Bond, Skyfall, have started to leak online.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The movie is shooting in London, in Pinewood Studios,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and recently director Sam Mendes was at a conference confirming the last main details.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Daniel Craig and Judi Dench will obviously still be in the cast,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
but at the conference were also present Naomie Harris,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Berenice Marlohe and Javier Bardhem.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Also confirmed Ralph Fiennes.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The interesting tip is that Skyfall will not be part of a trilogy,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
but will have his own separate story from the previous movies.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
That's all for today,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
see you soon from AC News!
