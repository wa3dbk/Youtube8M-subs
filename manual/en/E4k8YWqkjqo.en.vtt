00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.099
Hello. My name is Nancy Hannafin from the
Department of Nursing here at Towson University.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.289
I'm going to talk to you today is about
creating culturally competent health care

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.769
Cultural competency requires a
commitment from health care providers to

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.039
be responsive to the different attitudes,
verbal cues,

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.449
and body language from the patients that they
are caring for. 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.030
It may not require that the health care provider uses the
same methods of health care in the

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:41.450
country of origin but it does require that the health care
provider has a familial era de with those countries of origin.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.249
Understanding the different cues in the health care settings

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:50.950
will help to improve patients
satisfaction and health care outcomes.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.080
In two-thousand-one the U.S. Office of
Minority Health created the C.L.A.S.S. Standards.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.030
class stands for a culturally and
linguistically appropriate services.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.250
This is a series of fourteen standards
that are recommended guidelines

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.659
to provide appropriate services for

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.030
patients of all populations.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.619
When utilizing these standards you have to
remember that one size does not fit all,

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.889
and you cannot stereotype any particular 
culture you have to recognize and ask your patient

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:27.060
what is it from their culture that they
want to infuse into their health care

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.560
so that you can assure them of a more
satisfying patient outcome.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.570
In wo minutes we cannot even scratch
the surface of identifying the diverse

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.690
cultural needs of our patient population.
But, with a commitment to cultural

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.440
education we can provide a new dimension to
culturally competent care and patient satisfaction.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.060
Any reason to celebrate someone's diversity

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.060
and to recognize something that's unique
and special to a certain group of people

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.570
benefits all of us.
