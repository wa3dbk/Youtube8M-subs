00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.220
I can't believe

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.820
The night lay waste to all we'd given

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.540
But honestly

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.420
You've gotta know that this ain't livin

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.200
But we could run

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.880
From elysium

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.880
Let it burn, let it burn

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.220
You've gotta know that nothing lasts

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.380
FOREVER

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.360
I can't believe myself

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.160
I never thought that this would be our end

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.520
But it's nothing new

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.300
And my lovers honesty

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.220
But I can push it back push it back down if I have to

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.120
If you want me to

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.020
Cos we can run

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.920
We can run

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.180
Cos the stars they fall

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.520
All for you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.800
So tell me now

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.460
What's left to lose

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.520
If we run

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.340
If we run

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.260
If we run

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.480
FOREVER
