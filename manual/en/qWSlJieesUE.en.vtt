00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.150
Okay, you just watched us cut in the walls.
Our next step in painting the kitchen is to

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:12.260
roll on the paint. Let me show you how that's
set up. We have our roller tray, and our plastic

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:19.110
roller tray insert. We have our roller cover,
and our roller, our roller extension pole,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.850
our paint, and our brush. You want to put
the roller on the roller cover, and you want

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.460
to take some tape, and you want to remove
the lint from this roller cover. It was direct

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:42.489
from the factory. It's made out of a synthetic
wool. Some of the hairs tend to stick to the

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.840
paint. When you first put it on, you want
to just wrap it in the tape like a Barber's

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:55.910
pole, all the way around; make sure it's securely
stuck, just like a big lint brush; pull it

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.559
off. You can see, see how much lint is on
that. That would have, most likely got stuck

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:10.109
on the wall. So I want to put a good amount
of paint in there, because the roller's got

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:22.380
to absorb a lot of paint when we first get
wet. We catch our drips; close up our can.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.829
I like to get it evenly wet, because like
I said, it's going to be pretty dry and thirsty.

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.029
It's going to absorb a lot of paint at first,
so we want to get it evenly filled with paint.

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:38.619
You don't want to just dip it right in. You
want to just dip it, and then you kind of

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.959
roll it out, using this part of the tray to
roll off the paint, so it's not too drippy.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:58.539
I'm going to apply the roller pole. This is
the same thing as any broomstick. It has the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.200
same type of little grooves, so you could
just use your broom if you don't have one

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:12.069
of these handy. We want to let the leverage
of the pole do most of our work for us. The

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:21.440
first step is to get the paint on, and then
we want to go back where we've put it on,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:45.110
and just roll it out, rolling the excess off
around again, this part of the tray, and like

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.109
needing these zigzag configurations to put
the paint on. It goes on pretty heavy. Then

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:58.329
we're going back through the area that we've
just mapped out for ourselves. We're rolling

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.959
in a now I can pretty much let the whole pole
do the work for me. That's the key to this;

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.670
a lot less effort is needed. If you notice,
I'm working in block sections. I like to work

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.319
block, block, block, block. I do it in large
squares. It's small, manageable amount of

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.819
area that I can roll out, very similar to
when we're brushing. We want to keep a one

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.310
run at a time method. So, this chair rail
that's going through the middle of the wall,

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.709
now we're going to back brush it. It's like
I like I tell you, the two parts of painting

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:57.629
is one, getting the product onto the surface,
and then next, it's to brush it out. Got about

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:12.750
two more sections to do, block, and then block.
Getting right up to the edge to roll over

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.410
our cutting strokes so that they'll dry nice
and uniform and you won't see any of our brush

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.940
strokes on the wall. Now, in the same fashion,
you want to kind of spread the paint to the

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.610
whole extent of our section while the roller
is still really wet, when it first comes out

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:39.060
of the tray good to spread it throughout your
whole entire segment, and then roll back,

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:55.340
and even out the entire area. Okay, that's
looking fantastic. Now we're ready to move

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.189
on to the next step.
