TheFNDC.com presents Drinks With Diablo

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The German Apple Strudel Cocktail

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Alright, welcome back.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is Jöhnny Dîablø

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for Drinks With Diablo

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
for TheFNDC.com

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and today we’re making a drink called 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the German Apple Strudel

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and you can enjoy this drink anytime

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
of the year.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Summer, winter, it doesn’t matter.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
OK, what you’re going to need:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Some vanilla vodka,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and if you don’t have that, just use regular vodka. That’s fine.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You’re going to need some apple juice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You’re going to need a little cinnamon.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And you’re going to need some fresh lime.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And this is a long drink

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so it goes in a highball glass.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, let’s start.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
One and a half ounces of vodka.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Vanilla vodka, specifically.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Four ounces of the lime juice, no, apple juice.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Apple juice, I should say. My bad.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Apple juice.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Add a couple of lime wedges

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
to the mix.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Maybe we’ll

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
just squirt a little lime juice in there.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is just a little teeny tiny wedge.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There we go.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we’ll throw those lime wedges in there.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Oh wait, a pinch of cinnamon.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You need that.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Pinch.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay, that’s a pinch.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Okay, shake it up.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Alright.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It smells apple-y.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Hmm. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Interesting.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Wow. Look at that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
How’s that?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
But how’s it taste?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That tastes a LOT like 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
an apple strudel. It’s like apple pie, or like apple strudel.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But it really does taste like apple strudel.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You’ve got the vanilla and the vodka.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It doesn’t even taste like alcohol.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The cinnamon and apple juice,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and this, just a little touch of lime; 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It tastes just like strudel.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Mmm!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
More of that.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Okay.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
