00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.700
All right.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.800
We all know this dance.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.520
We've all seen this dance.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.960
From step teams to fraternity marches, sorority
walks, everything, right?

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.580
We all call it different things.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.010
I call it the pony, so we're going to learn
the pony today.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:39.550
This dance is a little odd because as your
legs move up, your body goes down.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.500
You want to think accordion, meeting in the
middle.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.460
So, right foot goes up, left knee bends.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.780
Let's try that again.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:00.250
We go 1-2-3-4, again 5-6, try it on the other
side.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.430
Bring that up, good.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.799
Keep your body going down, 7-8.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.200
Let's do that again.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.500
Now, there is a another piece to this, so
you're not just bending.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.360
You have to leave the floor, but don't jump
up.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.500
You want to fall down.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.970
Fall 2, fall 3, 4, fall 5, 6, fall 7, 8, other
side.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:25.970
2-3-4-5-6-7-8.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.000
We're going to do it a little faster, OK?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.990
5-6-7-8, 1, and 2, and 3, and 4, switch, 5-6-7-8.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.149
The key in switching is once you put this
foot down, keep them both planted, so that

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.979
you can fall on the other leg.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:58.859
So, we're going boom, 2-3-4, and 5-6-7-8.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.329
You can do any arms you want with this move.

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:11.009
You see this a lot, step teams, you even see
this.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.070
You don't have to do all of that.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.180
You'd even see this.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.720
Just have fun with the pony, have fun with
the pony.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.590
Let's try music.
