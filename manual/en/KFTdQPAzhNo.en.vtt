00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.109
Magic has existed since the very creation
of the universe.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.920
Its presence has been woven into every fiber
of the cosmos by the Ancient Primordials.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.640
Magic takes part in every aspect that the
universe consists of.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.280
Life, death, the elements and much more.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.739
Magic’s extreme diversity allows it to manifest
in any shape and form, creating and destroying

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.650
planets, parallel worlds and pocket dimensions.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.579
One would think that such omnipotent power
cannot be contained or exploited, but as races

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.780
and civilisations evolved, ways of utilizing
magic were discovered.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.940
Some could tame the power with concentration
and study, using mainly their mind.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.149
Others invented tools that made the harnessing
and usage of magic much easier and less time

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.640
consuming.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.710
Many centuries ago, before the fall of the
Mad Moon, the sapient races of our world had

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.110
just begun to grasp magic and how it can be
studied and used.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.720
Even individuals with exceptional intellects
spent their entire lives to grasp even the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.180
most miniscule aspects of the arcane.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.100
But, there was one who differed greatly from
the rest.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.770
A scholar that possessed a mind sharper than
anyone else’s and a memory that seemed limitless.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.280
His name, at that time, was Garral.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.770
Even during his childhood, the genius spellcaster
could master spells that the wisest elders

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.580
could barely comprehend.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.770
Garral read and memorized one magical tome
after another, forever ceiling the knowledge

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.730
within his mind.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.610
Upon reaching adulthood, the wizard was already
feared and respected among his peers.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.010
Peers whom he would soon dismiss, for not
having even the smallest bit of his talent.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.390
The mage set out into the world, yearning
its secrets and arcane knowledge.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.370
As luck would have it, Garral eventually came
across a civilisation that was far more advanced

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.120
than the one he left behind.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.970
In his homeland, Garral and other scholars
would study their craft in solitude, so his

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.450
surprise was justifies upon discovering a
thing called a college, a place where the

00:02:50.450 --> 00:03:03.990
path of magic is taught to all those who wish
to pursue it.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:14.690
Garral immediately admitted into the college,
but the old clerk in charge of admissions

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.620
misheard his name and instead wrote down ‘’Carl’’.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:27.250
At first, Garral’s emotions rivalled between
confused and furious, but after a short while,

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.840
he burst into laughter.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.440
Garral was thinking that perhaps a new name
would really fit his life-changing decision

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:49.519
and, more or less as a joke, took on his new
persona of Carl.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.209
The time spent in college left Carl slightly
underwhelmed.

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.519
While happy to have access to new spells and
incantations, he still far outclassed not

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.330
only other students, but the teachers as well.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.000
Embracing his incredible talents, Carl eventually
stopped looking for equals and instead, revelled

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:31.500
in being the best at what he does, eager to
show off his superiority whenever possible.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.759
During one evening spent in the college library,
Carl came across a scroll titled ‘’Sempiternal

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.629
Cantrap’’.

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:48.360
The old piece of papyrus contained vague information
about what appeared to be an immortality spell.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.300
Being the genius that he is, Carl easily deciphered
the scroll’s riddles and read between its

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.349
lines, filling in any gaps with the knowledge
he already had.

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:04.979
After a night of struggling, he had mastered
the secrets of longevity and granted himself

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:15.849
eternal life.

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:21.400
Centuries passed and the protégé wizard
achieved many feats and amazed the most revered

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:29.610
spellcasters, The Hidden Council agreed unanimously
to promote him to the status of Magus.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:36.649
From that, he once again changed his name
and now refered to himself as Arsenal Magus,

00:05:36.649 --> 00:05:42.560
thinking that it fit his amazing selection
of destructive spells.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:48.619
As time went on, the Arsenal Magus acquired
more and more knowledge, breaking the boundries

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:51.139
of impossibility.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.749
Seeing himself as an entity beyond the mortals
of his world, the Magus sought a new title,

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:02.080
one that would truly reflect his undisputable
might.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.159
Now known as the Invoker, the supreme sorcerer
believes that the world can no longer offer

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:14.779
him any more power, thus robbing him of what
was once his only purpose.

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:20.770
He uses his powers now to show off his awe-inspiring
superiority.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.199
The Invoker believes that a being that witnessed
the shards of the Ancients descend upon the

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:32.949
world and lives to tell about it, does not
need any justifications for simple self-indulgence.
