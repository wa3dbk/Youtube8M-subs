00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.840
Welcome the Country Sampler on Video. I'm
Susan Wagner

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.599
and this is one of our stylists Debbie Plantery. In our October/November issue, Debbie

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.410
came up with an ingenious way to
repurpose old sweaters

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.810
into homey country Christmas ornaments. Debbie, how did you come up with this idea?

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.380
Well the other day while I was going through
my closet,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.849
I noticed many beautiful Christmas sweaters that I no longer wear

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.230
because they are out of style. And I thought how simple and easy would it be

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.329
to reuse the sweaters to create new country ornaments.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.550
The material adds great texture and feel to the ornaments and the holiday colors add warmth to your decorating.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.200
These look really easy to put together. Are they really that simple?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.570
They really are! All you need is an old sweater

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:50.900
and if you don't have one

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.900
you can easily find one at a garage sale or resale shop

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.220
a foam ball, an old Christmas ball ornament, or a rag ball and some twine.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.220
All you need to do is gather up the fabric around the ball

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.980
This is where I like crafting with a friend because sometimes I need help.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.770
Sure, I'll help out. Do you mind pulling the top?

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.700
Just tie the twine around the sweater at the top of the ball

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.200
and tie it again at the top to form your loop.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.900
And that's all. It's really that simple.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.340
These are adorable Debbie. Is there anything else
you can do with old sweaters?

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.450
Oh lots! If your sweater happens to have a pocket

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.400
you can cut the pocket out, wrap it around a mason jar to create a cute holiday vase.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.800
Also you can use the same kind of
square that you used for your ornament,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.420
gather it together in the middle,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.900
tie it with twine and put it on one of your Christmas presents. Very cute!

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.390
Look for these holiday ornaments

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.390
and other great Christmas decorating tips in the
October/November issue of Country Sampler
