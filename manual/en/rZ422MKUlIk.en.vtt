00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:08.969
bjbjz Wearing a swallowtail coat, jeans and
a chimney-pot hat, Robert Dick often had children

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:33.350
following him from his bakery in Thurso, as
they were curious to know what he was doing

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.350
on his walks. He was not only a baker, but
also a renowned self-taught botanist, a geologist

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.650
and naturalist. Interested in entomology,
he collected moths, beetles, butterflies and

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.650
bees. To bring the samples home he pinned
them to the inside of his hat. Robert Dick

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.050
was born in Tullibody, Clackmannanshire in
1811. His father, Thomas Dick was an Officer

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:07.050
of Excise. In 1826, Thomas Dick was promoted
to Supervisor of Excise and moved to Thurso.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.670
In the summer of 1830, Robert Dick also travelled
to Thurso where he set up his own baker s

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.170
shop. Dunnet Head was one of his favourite
places to walk, describing it as having a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.170
forest of ferns. Dunnet Head Lighthouse was
built in 1831, an event Robert Dick must have

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.070
witnessed. Robert Dick saved old letters,
envelopes, newspapers and documents to keep

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.659
his collection of small plants and mosses
in. His Herbarium collection is now in Caithness

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:48.659
Horizons Museum, Thurso, and contains around
3000 specimens. Robert Dick died in 1866.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.400
My name is Joanne B Kaar, I m an artist and
I live in Dunnet village, on Dunnet Head in

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.380
Caithness. Inspired by the landscape, and
it s rich heritage, I have been collaborating

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.509
with Joanne Howdle, curator at Caithness Horizons
Museum , digitalising their now fragile Robert

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.730
Dick Pressed Herbarium Collection. The Robert
Dick Herbarium Collection was in need of remedial

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.940
conservation treatment. In 2011, the bicentenary
year of Robert Dick s birth, Caithness Horizons

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.290
received funding for remedial conservation
work to be undertaken on 85 of the pressed

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.010
herbarium sheets, and arrangements were made
for them to go to The Scottish Conservation

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.010
Studio in South Queensferry near Edinburgh.
It was the combination Robert Dick s job as

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.590
a baker, the beautifully pressed plants, hand
written notes on herbarium labels and a whole

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.500
variety of papers which provided a rich source
of inspiration for my artwork. I exhibited

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.590
this new work, Paper wrappers and Herbarium
sheets in the gallery at Caithness Horizons

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.230
in 201. I up-dated Robert Dicks bakery to
give it a contemporary feel, adding information

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.180
about his work and personal life with aprons,
flour bags and biscuit tins. A few of the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.750
recently conserved herbarium sheets were on
display as part of my exhibition. In 2012

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.280
Caithness Horizons received funding from Museums
Galleries Scotland and Creative Scotland s

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.280
Iconic Artists in Iconic Places fund, for
the next art project. Again, working in collaboration

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:31.060
with museum curator, Joanne Howdle and inspired
by Robert Dick s original metal, moss collecting

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:38.060
box, I designed a scaled up version, using
reclaimed metal but full of surprises inside

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:48.510
On opening up, it reveals flowers which pop-up
hidden, insects, drawers to pull and flaps

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:55.709
to lift. A portable museum of curiosity which
invites you to explore. The images inside

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.580
tell the story of what happened to the plants
after Robert Dick picked them ,Panels show

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.920
images from his collection, the variety of
papers he used and the beautiful herbarium

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.349
sheets with his hand written notes detailing
the places where the plants were collected.

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:21.690
Flaps can be lifted up to reveal more about
why he cut out place names from newspapers,

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.520
and why he was asked for so many samples of
the Northern Holy grass by other collectors.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:34.520
You can discover why there are herbarium sheets
from other collectors in Robert Dick s collection.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.750
A drawer opens to reveal a branch with a few
leaves and blossoms from a lime tree which

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.130
once grew outside his childhood home in Tullibody.
Other drawers pull out to reveal beetles which

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.800
are responsible for damage in many museum
herbarium collections, and also tools of the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.800
trade for conservation work. Fold down this
flap to find a list of activities you might

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:07.160
like to try, including playing this board
game inspired by the Robert Dick collection.
