This video is maybe completely boring.
It was made to show the fungame players 
that border war isn't anything for them, 
as a reaction to all the comments at the Border War action videos.

00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:07.250
Guys, come back!

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:24.809
Walking is great, isn't it?

00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:26.588
NO! To much walking.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.671
Did you have got any hits yet?

00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:29.690
To much, yeah.

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:35.349
Oh. Return again, the whole way back!
Isn't that great...

00:00:39.765 --> 00:00:41.816
What was that, they have called us!

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.898
Eco 7 here is Eco 2 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:01:00.018
TO MUCH INFORMATIONS!

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:04.106
What was that? Didn't you've realised what you should do?

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:09.375
- No, why?
- You are running away from us while we where still here...

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.864
I just took the players who where allready here...

00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:32.448
Wait! There are maybe enemys...

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:51.905
Here is Eco 2...

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:05.561
We are going down now...
We are not allowed to shoot until we take fire.

00:02:06.243 --> 00:02:08.608
If the police said anything else, then this is what we have to do.

00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:13.109
We will receive the next informations 
downhill, I have not enaugh informations yet.

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:16.951
We come from this way to the city...

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:26.659
Company 2, follow us!

00:02:27.743 --> 00:02:30.777
Do you need our support? We have a different task then you.

00:02:39.301 --> 00:02:42.255
We have to make a line.

00:02:56.262 --> 00:02:58.439
Going downhill here is the horror...

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:23.599
Later we will meet the task force there...

00:03:24.515 --> 00:03:27.433
Medic?
Do we have a medic here?

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:29.168
Negative, we will all die.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.869
We have to support the village, NOW!

00:03:43.062 --> 00:03:45.999
Got it. Move, now!

00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:06.104
Down there is the KESS. If someone point a weapon at you, fire!

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.056
On the left...

00:04:33.445 --> 00:04:37.108
Go this way and then left. We are to near now.

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:56.601
I have received the information that Eco 2 needs our support, we have to go back.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:06.457
Yeah, exactly. I am a big fan from moving ahead and back. 
We will now go this way and then make a curve to them.

00:06:22.846 --> 00:06:24.228
Watch out, he has an RPG!
