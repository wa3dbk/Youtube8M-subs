00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
all right welcome back we have icing
here we're going to create icing we're

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.019
going to use shortening and if you don't
have shortening if you're in a country

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.969
like when I live in New Zealand I find
it very difficult to find shortening you

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.189
can also use butter if you are going to
use butter try to find unsalted butter

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.500
and then we have icing sugar and we have
some warm water and we have some instant

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:37.230
coffee in warm water now this is about 2
cups of shortening so again if you're in

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.950
the metric system just a cup size with a
bit more and this is about 3 cups of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.550
icing sugar and we will see how much of
that we need as we go alright so the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.680
first thing we're going to do is we're
going to put our shortening into our

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:07.380
bowl using our spatula shortening is
just a vegetable fat so if you don't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.600
watch shortening years you can also just
look up vegetable fat and we'll just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.140
scrape that into the bowl and what we're
going to do is we're going to mix this

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.450
we're going to beat it like crazy until
it's nice and smooth before we add any

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.369
of our other ingredients so let's take
our blender

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.680
now you can start mixing on low
otherwise it might just clump and throw

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.329
it at the full so we start on low

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.890
like that and now we can mix um hi and
really get it nice and creamy and fluffy

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.220
and light

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.939
and again slowly turning off the beater
before raising it up so you're not

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.610
spraying all of that shortening all over
the place where we have a nice

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.950
consistency is nice and smooth and
whipped up okay so now we're going to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.500
add our icing sugar so that's about
three cups worth again if you're in the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.330
metric system I'm not sure how much that
is but simply a nice tall glass will do

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:33.000
this is also very versatile I rarely
make the exact amount I always just try

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.040
and see now now that this is in here if
we go in there with our mixer on high

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.880
it's going to pull and go everywhere so
we really want to actually first mix it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.090
before we turn on a little bit just to
get it scrubbing onto it so that it's

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.510
not going to fly everywhere a little bit

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.410
got some chunks

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:13.160
see that now I can turn on my mixer on
low and it won't fly all over the place

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.210
all right so just turn though

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.580
okay
so then we'll try this with our last

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:47.209
clean spoon a little bit better okay
put these away alright as I put that

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.970
away I was thinking no I still taste a
lot of the grease in my mouth and you

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.159
really want your icing to be nice and
smooth and gentle so I am going to add

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.569
even more sugar the beauty of this is
that I intend to make some cupcakes

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:14.629
later and then I'll have lots of icing
leftover here's my clean spoon for a

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:35.530
moment a bit more water okay and we'll
just do the last test a little bit

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:46.099
perfect okay so now I'm going to put
some of the white icing in here so that

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:52.789
I can have some white icing and some
mocha like brownies as you can see it's

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.630
kind of stiff we're going to make that
nice and soft in a moment

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:07.759
all right so now we're going to thin out
the white icing first we're just going

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.699
to take the water that I had here the
EPS over hot water I'm going to pour

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:22.340
some in I think the whole amount is fine
again this is just you have to go get

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.849
more icing off of our feeders so now we
have a nice fluffy icing that we need so

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.960
put that aside we'll take our other bowl
of icing here that we want to make into

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.130
a polka
all I did was take warm water and about

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.770
two tablespoons of instant coffee I
really made it strong you can use less

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:48.110
you can just use one teaspoon I like to
have really thick strong flavour in our

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.070
icing so I'm going to pour because I'm
not sure how watery this will be I'm

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.860
going to pour half in and I'll save half
there we go now we're going to have to

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:07.370
mix on though first to mix it as it will
have splatters of coffee everywhere all

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:14.800
right I'm just going to grab a little
spoon and see how it tastes a little bit

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:27.469
very nice so there's our mocha and
there's our white okay I'll show you how

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:31.150
to ice the cake in a little bit
