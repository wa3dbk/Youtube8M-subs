00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
In this video I am going to show you How to fold

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.060
a piece of paper that is just about the size of a Square

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.100
into a perfect square

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.380
First, we want to create one nice edge

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.100
So take one of these ragged edges and fold them

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.480
So you get a nice and straight edge

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.760
then, turn the paper around and fold that edge in half

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.680
So that the two halves exactly lie on top of each other

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680
and then you unfold that again

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.880
and you can see, you have created a crease right here

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.240
Now, I am going to turn the paper like this

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.580
and bring the nice edge to the top of paper. So that the

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.240
crease you see here aligns with the crease down there

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.420
Like so

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.860
and you crease that

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.740
and then you unfold that

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.900
and you can see again you created a crease

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.360
and these two creases now meet exactly here

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.760
what we are now going to do is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.840
we are going to fold this paper diagonally

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.860
so crease those exactly through that intersection

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.760
So you can pinch this a bit. Just pinch it.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.440
and then what you want to do is you want

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.720
to align this crease (on the Top) with that one down

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.060
and here again

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.600
the crease on the top with the crease on the bottom

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.720
Like so

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.060
So you get exactly the right angle on that diagonal

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.840
and when you unfold that you can see

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.420
you created this diagonal crease

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.320
Let's fold this crease back again

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.960
and then turn the paper around

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.460
Now, what we want to do is

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.020
we want to fold this edge in half. So that

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.300
we exactly go through the intersection of the creases

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.800
from the fold

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.660
So just go along there

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.200
and then again align these two edges

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.140
so they perfectly align on top of each other

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.680
and then you get something like this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.440
and you can see, you got a top layer here

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.840
Now what we are going to do is

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.520
take a scissor and cut exactly along that edge.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.620
Like so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.240
and then when you unfold, you can see

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.700
you still got one edge here

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:07.020
and cut that with scissor

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.260
and then you have got "A Perfect Square"
