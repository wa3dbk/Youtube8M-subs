Right now, I can see that trouble in your system.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.740
I am saying to that infirmity in your system, in your bones, in your blood, in your kidney, in your liver,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.200
in your muscles, "Out!"

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.660
I say I can see them coming out; your sickness is coming out, your disease is coming out.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.340
It is coming out, in your blood! It is coming out, in your kidney!

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.640
It is coming out, in your liver! It is coming out! I say, "Out!"

You disease, you sickness, out. In my liver, tendons, blood, muscles,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.300
In my kidney, blood, womb, out!

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:20.640
Confess, "Out!" in the name of Jesus. Say, "Out!"

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.340
