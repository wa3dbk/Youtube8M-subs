00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.020
NIGEL: Hello and welcome to a new Dota 2 report.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.980
Hope you've been enjoying the game.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.480
I have some downtime here as the hero I'm controlling, Phoenix, is dead.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.200
It looks as though we're about to see in this game

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.060
barracks

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.400
exploding

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.160
Let's see how it turns out.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.720
TERRORILLUSION: Ah, the best thing about being me. There' so many

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.024
TERRORBLADE: No, don't do that.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.460
TIMBERSAW: Take that, Terrorman!

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.660
I've got the Aghanim's Scepter now!

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.520
..One of the Aghanim's Scepters...

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.840
He had a lot of scepters!

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.500
TERRORBLADE: Reflection!

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.160
TIMBERSAW: Oh! I forgot he had that ability.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.640
I hadn't seen him use it yet.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.774
REFLECTION: You should be nicer to people! And trees!

00:00:47.774 --> 00:00:49.214
TIMBERSAW: Neverrrr!!

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.500
TERRORBLADE: What the hell of hells is going on?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.029
Why can't I damage the tower?

00:00:59.029 --> 00:01:02.315
TIMBERSAW: Hahaha! The 'backdoor protection' system!

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:06.675
If there are no creeps nearby, the structures will become more difficult to damage!

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.980
TERRORBLADE: And you just... turn that off when enemy creeps get near?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.629
TIMBERSAW: It's not a well thought out system.

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:14.434
TERRORBLADE: Well then.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.140
TIMBERSAW: Holy shit! He's out-damaging the backdoor protection!

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.060
ANNOUNCER: Radiant Structures are fortified.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.595
TERRORBLADE: Oh you've got to be kidding me!

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.860
Fine. I'll just kill you, then!

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.840
TIMBERSAW: Oh boy.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.300
SUPERCREEP: Never fear!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.080
NIGEL: So, uh, other dead teammates, what do we do?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.114
ENIGMA: I'm thinking that if you can buy back right now, you should.

00:01:47.114 --> 00:01:50.714
NIGEL: I was thinking that too but I wasn't confident enough to make that call

00:01:50.714 --> 00:01:52.760
...And was just gonna do it if anybody else did it.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.434
TIDEHUNTER: Tidehunter can't afford to buy back.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.700
ENIGMA: Uh, okay! Decision made! Let's go!

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.980
NIGEL: I have no more money.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.620
ENIGMA: Wow! Is that the Arcana set!?

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.989
NIGEL: I really don't know.

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.555
ENIGMA: Whoa! It even has a little doggie!

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.340
Hi, doggie.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.380
I don't even know what it's like to have cosmetics of any kind at all

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.880
ever in any form...

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.680
Let alone a unique Arcana like this.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.940
Amazing.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.000
NIGEL: So, she's like, a more powerful ice wizard now?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.235
ENIGMA: No, but she looks f***in' awesome.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.200
and is, like, constantly shitting snowflakes and stuff.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.740
And floating!

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.980
..And the dog.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.560
NIGEL: Says here it's about 30 dollars.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.980
ENIGMA: Hey, uh, Terrorblade, if you could teleport home and help defend that would be great.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.574
We just wasted a bunch of time talking about Arcana or some shit

00:03:00.574 --> 00:03:03.234
so our base is actually in real trouble now.

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:05.355
TERRORBLADE: Alright, fine!

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.820
Hey, you, shopkeep! I want to sell you my shoes!

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.220
TIMBERSAW: Hey hey! Don't do business with the enemy! Traitor!

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.900
TERRORBLADE: And one more thing. I'd like to order Boots of Travel.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.500
TIMBERSAW: No!

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.600
TERRORBLADE: Oooh! Snazzy!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.654
How do they work?

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.300
Ha ha! *blthlthrhtlhrhtl*

00:03:25.372 --> 00:03:26.012
WHOOoaa-

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.200
ENIGMA: Holy... Everyone's health is so low!

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.160
How did NO ONE die?

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.080
Zeus!

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.580
ZEUS: You called?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.194
ENIGMA: Use your ultimate right now!

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:06.055
ZEUS: You can't run from heaven!

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.960
ENIGMA: Yeaaaah!

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.440
That's what I wish would happen...
