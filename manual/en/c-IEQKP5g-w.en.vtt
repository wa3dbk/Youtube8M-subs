Hey guys! It's Avappy, and today I'm making an opening video!

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.560
So I went to the supermarket and I found

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.800
4 different Blind Bags

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.620
So there are an LPS, an MLP

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.400
a Minecraft one and Shopkins!

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.620
So in this video, I will open just two

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.120
and you will have to see the other part to see the two others!

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.420
In this video I'm going to start with the LPS one and the MLP one!

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.560
I just show you the package to see what they look like.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.980
So there is this one

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.040
This is a G4 Series #1 LPS Blind Bag

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.140
Sorry for this f*cking luminosity but I make this video at night so I'm sorry!

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.380
So here it is

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.820
And the second one is the MLP one

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.463
Series #10

00:00:54.463 --> 00:00:58.020
So they have sparkles and I already have some of this series

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.200
I'm super excited for the MLP Blind Bag

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.100
because I just have 4 of this series and three out of four have Rarity's shape

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:06.534
I really want Fluttershy but

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:08.835
I think Fluttershy's code is AC

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.240
and this one is AF. Normally I don't remember the code but it wasn't volunteer...

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.340
So let's open this one!

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.340
I'm gonna take scissors! That's better...

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.060
Okay

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.600
So

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.220
I pay attention not to cut the card

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.180
Oh wow!

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.860
Aww

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.920
It's so cuuute!

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.340
With this and this little accessories!

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.660
I don't really know what animal is it but I think it's so adorable!

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.000
I think he can go in it and looks like a cupcake

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.509
if we put this on its head

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:57.934
Let's try this right now!

00:01:57.934 --> 00:01:59.795
So here it is

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.720
It's absolutely so cute

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.820
I didn't think there were LPS like this one, I didn't see it on the package

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.060
So it's so cute but if you can tell me what animal it is please?

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.000
It looks like a squirrel with its tail!

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.960
So let's open the MLP!

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.100
So this is a series #10

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.860
Normally, there are 12 series but in France we're always late

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.240
I'm scared to cut the card!

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.000
There's a small hole I don't know why but anyway!

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.860
Hope I didn't cut the card!

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.200
Wow!

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.800
She's beautiful!

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.880
I really like pegasus

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.660
Her card

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.560
Her name is... RainbowShine!

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.240
I think she's beautiful!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.215
I don't really like pink and violet but she's still awesome

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:02.715
and I love her cutie mark

00:03:02.715 --> 00:03:04.154
which is a rainbow!

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.680
And I really like pegasus too

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.100
Especially this shape, I love their...

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.740
Their wings I don't know why

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.400
So yeah I think she's so beautiful and cute!

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.300
So that's all for the first part and thanks for watching!

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.900
And you also can watch the second part where I will open a Minecraft Blind bag

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.735
and a Shopkins one!

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.120
