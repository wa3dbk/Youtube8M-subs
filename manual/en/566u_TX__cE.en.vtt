00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.860
Welcome to Jikoni Magic.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.160
Today we are making chicken Biryani.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.210
Most people dread making this dish because
of the myth that has been perpetuated of how

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.969
complex it is to pull off.

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.730
Worry not, I have simplified the dish to the
point whereby you will have enough courage

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.970
to call your friends over and actually impress
them.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:30.250
Our ingredients are 1 small unripe pawpaw 500Ml yogurt or maziwa
lala, one teaspoon ginger-garlic paste, 2

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.090
chicken thighs and drum sticks that have skin
removed but still have the bone in them (this

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.300
will give very good flavor and stork) 3 pureed
tomatoes (you can finely chop them, you don't

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.220
have to use a food processor or blender) three
medium sized potatoes that are peeled and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.220
chopped.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.330
Add to this one teaspoon of turmeric powder,
toss together and set aside for a few minutes.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.720
Our whole spices are 3 cloves of garlic, one
bay leaf, one teaspoon freshly cracked black

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.190
pepper and four cardamom pods.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.510
Deep fry the potatoes until they are golden
brown but don't let them cook completely and

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.670
set aside on a kitchen towel for the excess
oil to drain.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.970
Puree the yogurt, paw paw and ginger garlic
paste until smooth.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.210
Add your chicken to this mixture.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.570
Next add the following spices, 1 teaspoon
turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon coriander powder,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.450
one teaspoon garam masala, one teaspoon red
chili powder and one teaspoon cardamom powder.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.280
Mix everything together and set aside for
thirty minutes.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.810
Meanwhile, chop one large onion and cook in
2 tablespoons of oil until it browns. Be careful

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.520
not to burn because it's going to taste bitter.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.220
Remove and drain on a kitchen paper.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.430
in the same oil that was used for frying the
onions put all your whole spices and cook

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.210
for about two minutes until they release their
natural oils and flavors and remember not

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.560
to burn them.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.240
Take your chicken together with it's marinade
and add it to the pan.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.600
Make sure you get all the mixture out, don't
leave any of this goodness behind.Add salt

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.739
to taste, stir well, cover it and let it simmer
for about 20 minutes.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.709
Come now and add the tomato puree and mix
everything well.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.459
Make sure that everything in there makes one
happy family.

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.019
Meanwhile, prepare your rice.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.189
Cook one cup of rice in 2 cups of water and
let it only be done three quarter way.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:34.020
Don't let it cook for more than this because
it will mash up by the time you finish, and

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.420
use good quality rice like long grain Basmati
rice.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.849
The other preparation that you have to do
as your chicken is cooking is preparation

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:42.849
of your dough.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.099
make a dough and then come and roll it as
you can see me doing here in this clip.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.540
Make sure as you roll it you stretch it out.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:59.450
The aim here is to come up with a dough that
is long enough to cover the rim of your cooking

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.650
pan, the one that you are using to cook your
biryani rice.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.670
If you do not want to make the dough then
the other alternative that you have is to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.499
use a kitchen towel.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:18.239
Come and remove your bay leaf, set it aside
and then scoop out half of the mixture,one

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.950
chicken thigh, one drumstick and half of the
curry mix into a separate bowl.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.090
Whatever is left behind, Spread it nicely
so that it covers the bottom of the pan, as

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.269
you can see here.

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.719
Biryani is a layered dish.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.260
So what we are going to do next is start on
our layering.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.219
The first layer that come on top of this curry
is your rice.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:45.449
Remember the rice that you cooked 3/4 and
drained?

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.010
Yeah, that's the one we are putting here.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.959
put only half of it and spread it evenly so
that it covers the entire curry.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.040
Then take your potatoes, all of your potatoes
and place them on top of the rice.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.900
Make sure you space them out evenly, arrange
them evenly on top of your rice so that everyone

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.760
gets some bit of potato as they are eating.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.349
Then next come with your onion that you had
fried, the ones that you browned.

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.530
Spread them evenly as well on top of your
potatoes.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.520
Do half of them, not all the browned onions
and then take your coriander leaves and spread

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520
them out.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.240
Now let's start the layer again.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.460
Take that mixture of your chicken curry that
you had scooped out and start by placing it

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.090
on top of the coriander.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.169
And then come and start doing your rice again.

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.229
You see the way we are layering?

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.860
Put your rice on top of the chicken mixture
and spread it out evenly.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.330
All the rice that had remained, make sure
you spread it out.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:00.699
Next come and take your browned onions and
place them on top of the rice.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:07.289
After which you are going to take your coriander
leaves and place them as well on top of the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:08.289
rice.

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:16.740
Then make sure that you mix either food coloring
or saffron in a bit of water and some milk

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.949
and then come and put the drop throughout
the rice, not just in one spot but in several

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.360
spots as you can see me doing here.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.470
Then take your dough, the one that you rolled
out to cover the top of your pan.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.659
Place it nicely around the rim.

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:34.600
Be very careful not to burn your fingers.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.750
If it makes it easier you can divide the dough
into two so that it's easier to handle.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.330
I divided mine into two because it was too
long, it would have meant falling over or

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.440
sweeping the ground or the work surface.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.820
That's not what I was after.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.120
I wanted to make sure that I roll it out nicely
and efficiently.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.689
So as you can see I have finished rolling
it out and make sure that you press it firmly

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.819
so that it holds tight.

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.810
come with your pan and press it on top.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.220
Cook this food for about thirty to thirty
five minutes.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.530
You will know that it's done when the dough
dries on the sides and steam starts leaking

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:16.530
out.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.460
When you're lifting your lid after the thirty
five minutes, if it's stuck you can use a

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.900
fork.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.030
Now you can see after the thirty five minutes
I'm back, there is the dough still attached.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:31.830
Take a fork, fluff up your rice.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.980
It's dry, it smells heavenly.

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.980
Then come and serve.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.550
This is like always my favorite part.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.169
Good portion for everyone.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.960
In this instance the dish was just enough
for two, so serve your chicken piece over

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.020
there and bon appetit.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.650
I hope I have demystified everything for you
. Go ye forth and practice.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.860
It's a very easy dish.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.300
Thank you for joining me.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.860
Till another day, keep it Jikoni Magic.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:58.360
Goodbye!
