00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
On the news of Yesterday, we showed you a stolen truck

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that had to be localized and recuperated through an online control system.

10:00:01.000 --> 10:00:05.000
ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM
The system allowed us to find a truck that was stolen in the city of Guarda.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The chanel SIC NEWS went to know the system to the company that provides the service

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to the client, so they can have all information about the track of the vehicle 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Artur Falacho, owner of the transport company, did not expect this situation 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but with the help of the service provider it was possible 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to follow the truck from the place where it was stolen  – Guarda – 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
till the city of Chaves, where -after his information- the police 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
could find the truck with the trailer still loaded inside a warehouse.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
After they stole the truck,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
he took the Motorway A24 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and at Chaves he left this Motorway, 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
as you can see the blue line, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and now I'm making a zoom so we can see the warehouse 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
where the WebEye system had shown the truck 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and some movements that the truck had made.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
As we have power to control all our clients page,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in one/two minutes it is possible to check where is the truck 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and help the client on that hard time.

10:00:50.000 --> 10:00:55.000
ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM
The system could follow the truck from Guarda till Chaves.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We could find the truck almost 300 km far away from its departure place.               

10:01:11.000 --> 10:01:15.000

WebEye Iberica        

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The system has been installed on a hidden place

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and through the GPS and GPRS signals it is possible 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to follow the vehicle. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The system can cost between 199,00 and 1.500,00 EUR, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
it depends on the requirements of the clients

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and a monthly fee is between 20,00 and 48,00 EUR.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
By the map, you can see some trucks on Europe 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the company have almost 20.000 client's vehicles, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
even the technician truck can be followed.

10:01:25.000 --> 10:01:30.000
ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM
The price of the system is between 199,00 and 1.500,00 EUR

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
This system allows  any client to obtain a lot of information 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
about the vehicle and also the driver.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Is it also possible to send and receive messages 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
using our PNA system, with all these tools we help the client 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
optimizing its fleet with a consequent costs reduction.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In this case, David drives on the south side 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of the river Tejo, each 15 secs, the truck is online 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in the system. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Every time he stops at a client he can send a message, 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
writing that he is there, 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
do not saying where, but on the map 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you can see where is his last position.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The system says exactly where he is 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and we can find him. This is really a very important tool 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to make the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
situations like this more easier.In this case a truck was stolen at Guarda, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and the story had a happy ending.

10:02:25.000 --> 10:02:30.000
ONLINE CONTROL SYSTEM
The system make possible  know the position and other details of the vehicle.
