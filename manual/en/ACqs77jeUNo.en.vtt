00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.130
Ricky Carmichael: I'm Ricky Carmichael.
I'm a native Floridian and I'm here to

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.090
conquer Florida.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.720
Ricky Carmichael: Off we go man!

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.019
J.H. Leale: I'm ready for the warm water.

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.760
Ricky Carmichael: Are ya?

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.410
J.H. Leale: Im ready to do some jet ski
ridin'.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.119
Ricky Carmichael: I'm looking forward to it, its going to be fun. Especially, crushing

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.830
you and spraying you with water the whole
time. Make sure you wear some goggles.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.850
J.H. Leale: Jumping waves isn't like jumping dirt piles bud, I got ya.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.570
Ricky Carmichael: Oh,OK

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.359
J.H. Leale: It's a little bit different
in the waves.

00:00:33.359 --> 00:00:36.739
Ricky Carmichael: I'll give you that, it
is different but it has an engine, so.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.060
SFX: Engine Rev Noise.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.840
Instructor: So we are going to be doing 28 miles today, a full circle around the island.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.929
Two separate oceans on a jet ski in one day,
we will do some calm water, some rough water

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.620
see if you can throw yourselves off. I get a little entertainment somewhere.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.890
J.H. Leale: (Laughing) Oh somebody is getting
thrown off today.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.810
Ricky Carmichael: (Laughing) Oh he will be falling off, he is a stick and ball guy, so.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.760
J.H. Leale: (laughing)

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.620
Instructor: We are off!

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.880
Ricky Carmichael: I think the cool thing about
jet skiing in Key West is that one-minute

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.950
you are in the Gulf of Mexico the next moment
you are in the Atlantic Ocean.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.390
Ricky Carmichael: A 28 mile loop around the
island, really it is second to none.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.320
Ricky Carmichael: When we were on our jet
ski ride there was a lot of mangroves, that

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.780
was really cool you know. I just love mangroves,
the water being so clear I can't describe

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.640
to you how beautiful that was.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.500
Ricky Carmichael: We are on the jet skis and we were coming from the Gulf of Mexico to

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.310
the Atlantic Ocean side, we came across what they call "the river of sand" and basically,

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.630
it is a huge sandbar right off shore.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.270
Ricky Carmichael: Not everyday do you get to experience stuff like this, check that

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.789
out. That's cool right there. When you think of Florida, it gets no better.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.099
Ricky Carmichael: Being a motocross guy, as I was sitting on the jet ski I was thinking

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.400
even though its not two wheels I felt like I was at home.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.199
Ricky Carmichael: I was getting excited, because I knew how much I was going to mess with JH

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.609
and spray him and just ruin the guy on the
jet ski.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.580
J.H. Leale: Jumping waves isn't like jumping dirt piles, bud.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.180
Ricky Carmichael: That was fun, huh?!

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.220
J.H. Leale: Dude, that was awesome!

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.180
Ricky Carmichael: Did you like getting sprayed
in the face the whole time?

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.049
J.H. Leale: (laughing) Did you like it?! I
got you too!

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.870
Ricky Carmichael: You know, I think that if
anyone is coming down to Key West to go Jet

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.290
Skiing I'd tell them there is so much to
see. So, after being on the Jet Skis for so

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.150
long I gotta say, it was nice to get back
to what I know best which is two wheels and

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.339
riding scooters around town. It was fantastic.
