00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.880
Today on BRStv we have a quick product spotlight
on the Red Sea coloration trace element program.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.469
This program fulfills all of my biggest desires
for any product.

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.390
It's very specific about its claims, transparent
about what is in the product and how it works

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.040
and uses a dosing methodology based on something
that makes sense as well as knowing when you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.460
are dosing too much.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.420
All these things make it much easier to trust
the manufacturer and evaluate the product's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.420
performance.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.660
The line comes has four additives.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.980
Coral Colors A which is Iodine and Halogens
including Iodine, Bromine and Fluorine which

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.820
will promote the production of pink coloration
through the increased production of pink chromo-proteins

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.890
which are related to Iodine and Bromine.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.190
The halogens also act as antioxidants and
oxidative agents within the coral's soft tissue

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.380
which helps the coral rid itself of free oxygen
radicals produced by the zooxanthele and prevents

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.380
bleaching.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.710
Coral Colors B will bring out the reds in
your corals by dosing Boron and Potassium

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.010
which is related to the red chromo-proteins.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.700
Potassium also helps the coral transport nutrients
within its soft tissue as well as form the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.090
proper formation of the aragonite skeletal
structure.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.649
Coral Colors C will bring out green coloration
primarily with iron but also contains trace

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:22.150
amounts other light metals like cobalt, manganese,
aluminum, zinc, chrome, nickel and even traces

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.659
amounts of copper.

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.799
Many of these elements are related to the
production of green and yellow chromo-proteins.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.420
Beyond color, these micro elements in the
C bottle help regulate and promote metabolic

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.740
processes such as respiration, energy production
and photosynthetic catalysts.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.529
Coral Colors D will help promote purple and
blue colors in your corals with eighteen trace

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:46.979
elements including silver, gold, vanadium
and tungsten which promote the production

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.869
of the blue and purple chromo-proteins.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.639
There are two ways to dose these products.

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.170
One's based off of testing the levels and
figuring out a weekly or daily dose and another

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.130
which is based off the amount of calcium used.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.469
Each one will be attractive to different people.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.520
Red Sea has found that most corals utilize
most trace elements in a ratio that's closely

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.010
tied to calcium consumption which frankly
makes a lot of sense.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.069
What's nice about this is there are tons of
accurate test kits for calcium and the test

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.010
kits are really easy to do.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.470
Same thing cannot be said of trace element
test kits.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.880
There are only a handful of trace elements
we can even test for at home, fewer accurate

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.640
kits and even fewer that are easy to perform
or read.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.950
I will say Red Sea produces the best kits
I have used.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.280
So matching the trace element dose to calcium
dosed is really great solution for many reefers.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.350
This is as easy as dosing 1 milliliter of
each trace element for every 10 milliliters

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.610
of Red Sea two part calcium solution dosed.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.530
There are a lot of different two parts out
there and many of you are using a different

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.320
brand so it's a pretty common question if
this line can be used in conjunction with

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.320
those other brands.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.990
It absolutely can and while I am sure they
would prefer you use their products exclusively

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.930
they'll still be pretty happy if you are using
their trace elements well as their related

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.930
test kits.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.460
All you need to do is some math.

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.700
They state that you need 1 milliliter of each
trace element solution for every 20 parts

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.410
per million of calcium dosed.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.900
Since many of you are using the BRS two part
we did the math for you.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.930
For every 51 milliliters of the BRS two part
calcium solution dosed you will need to dose

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.890
1 milliliter of each trace element solution.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.560
This can be dosed daily, every few days or
even weekly.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.680
As an example a tank like this one using BRS
2 part might require 100 milliliters a day

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.570
of two part which would mean 2 milliliters
a day of each trace element solution, 6 milliliters

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.810
every 3 days or 14 milliliters once a week.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.190
Since none of these need to be refrigerated
you can absolutely hook these elements up

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.400
to a dosing pump just like your two part.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.450
We don't recommend you use Red Sea's Color
Program in conjunction with a brand that states

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.640
it already includes trace elements because
you would be doubling down on some elements

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.620
and you run the risk of over dosing.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.510
Now is probably a good time to note why Red
Sea doesn't simply mix these elements in with

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.930
their two part mix.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.069
Presumably it's because many of these elements
cannot be mixed with calcium chloride or sodium

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.200
carbonate without precipitating or causing
other issues.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.060
Two parts which have the trace elements mixed
in are convenient but they are limited as

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.650
to the elements they can add.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.490
Keeping them separate really does open up
the possibilities.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.000
Lastly you can absolutely use this system
with other calcium solutions like Kalkwasser

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.160
and calcium reactors it is just a bit more
difficult to identify how much calcium your

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.790
tank is consuming with these two methods.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.979
Calcium reactors are also likely adding some
amount of trace elements as well so we strongly

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.530
recommend testing frequently when you start
this program.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.960
