00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.970
[Music]

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.420
[Applause]

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.220
[President Obama] Hello Cincinnati!

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.670
[Applause]

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.629
[Supporter] I'm Tony White, and hello Mr.
President.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:13.830
[President Obama] Good to see you, Tony.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.250
[White] OK.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.879
[President Obama] What kind of business do
you have?

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.270
[white] A barber shop and beauty salon.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.150
[President Obama] There you go!

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.730
[White] I've been in business for over 10
years now. What will you be doing for the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.730
self-employed and businesses with less than
10 employees. And also, when can I cut your

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.129
hair?

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.670
[Applause and cheers]

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.399
[President Obama] First of all, let me answer
the second question first. You know...

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.989
[White] I know.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.989
[President Obama] that you would not want
a president who is disloyal to his barber.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.510
Right? I mean... a man and his barber, that's
a strong connection.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.579
[White] I know, I know.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.390
[President Obama] In terms of small business.
Look, small businesses are the lifeblood of

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.490
our economy. They account for most of the
new job growth. Ever since I came into office,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.740
one of my biggest priorities was how do we
support small businesses. Which is why we've

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.740
actually provided 18 different tax breaks
just targeted at small business. We've actually

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.329
been pushing the banks to say, look, tax payers
pulled your backside out of the fire, it's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.560
now important for you to step up and make
sure that small business aren't finding their

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.009
credit restricted, especially if they've been
in business for a while. And I want to make

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.439
sure that you're getting the same good deal
as everybody else.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.450
[White] He's the first president that actually
done something to affect our lives that we

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.109
can see.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.279
[President Obama] Right now, one of the things
we're pushing Congress to do is to give you

00:01:54.279 --> 00:02:00.399
a tax credit if you hire additional workers
or you give folks who are working for you

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.569
a raise. We want to give you incentive to
do that.

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.049
[Applause]

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.899
[President Obama] But this is an example of
where there's a contrast between myself and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.500
my opponent. His basic tax plan is to give
folks at the top a tax break. Now we can have

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.500
that debate, but what I've said is, in the
meantime, let's give 98 percent of indiviuals

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:30.630
and 97 percent of small businesses some certainty
right now by going ahead and passing a law

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.090
that says your taxes won't go up.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.090
[White] The stuff that he's doing and working
on, it deserves the small business supports,

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.450
support from people like me.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.360
[President Obama] My most important job is
fighting for you and I'm going to do everything

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:55.360
I can as long as I have the honor of being
president to fight for you and working families

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.770
and middle class families all across this
country. Let's finish what we started and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.670
remind the world why the United States is
the great nation that it is. God bless the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.980
United States of America.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.550
[Applause]
