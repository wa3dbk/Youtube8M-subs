00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.500
Dear Vandi,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.000
it is your husband who is rattling for you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.500
If you like this idea, put your hands up!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.000
I got two buddies here, they are my tickety-timy-team,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
both of them rock like hell.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
While you are watching one of the chatters

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.500
I can take a breath in secret.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.000
It's my toast and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.500
I tell you what's up.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.200
1996:

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.700
when the day finally came

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.200
to enroll to the Tech University,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.750
I can definitely recall that.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.250
Checking the people: geeks,

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.750
more hundreds of techie guys

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.100
and the cool girl who the whole gang goes for

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.500
is called Veronika Vanda Váczi.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Yeah, she is V. V. V.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.500
this is how our wedding  y-e-a-r  became

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.500
2009.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.000
V-a-n-d-i,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.250
this is not the first  d-a-t-e  any more!

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.250
Let me hear you say:  V. V. V.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.750
this is how our wedding  y-e-a-r  became

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.500
2009.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
V-a-n-d-i,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.250
this is not the first  d-a-t-e  any more!

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.250
1996 and 2005:

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.750
between these not too much happened, sometimes

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.250
we saw each other at the university. And i sent her a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.750
love email - which got deleted.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.250
Ten years passed by. That time

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.750
i was browsing on the upgraded community portal IWIW

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.250
in my freetime, when, my God,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.750
she confirmed from America that she had known me.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.250
But the point what i can tell now is that

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.750
we were chatting during the whole winter on the MSN.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.250
So three months had been spent virtually,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.750
until spring came and there was no snow any more.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.250
On March 17, 2006

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.750
we were to meet first: just her and me.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.250
The date started - this is not the ancient times - 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.750
exactly at 1:30 AM.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.750
Only the second date was annoying.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.250
I told her how good I can bear cold temperatures.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.750
However, in half an hour it got colder outside and

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.250
the freezing hotshot felt sticky in a warm coat.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.750
But despite all of this, that night

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.250
we became a pair at the trash-bins of Közraktár street.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.750
So the close opinions might have been true that spring:

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.250
I was not gonna be a stranger bachelor any more.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.750
Afterwards, as written in the big book,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.250
you cannot even imagine that this

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.750
cute and nice Vandi, like the good fairy,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.250
conjured me immediately. 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.750
After a short while i just recognized

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.250
that my life had essentially changed.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.750
I just realized that she had moved to my flat

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.000
along with the content of a tiring-room.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.750
Of course, this relationship has its issues.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.250
Vandi fell over when riding an ATV, for example.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.750
We had worries and disputes

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.250
but neither of us give a damn about those nowadays.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.750
We have been on hilltops and at the sea,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.250
I don't even dare to tell this all.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.750
All in all, do you get what we are all about?

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.250
Tell these people something they dont know about us!

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.450
Velence is our fave place in Hungary.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.800
But been in Prague, Bratislava, Cluj, Vienna, Plitvice.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.100
A lot of snowboarding and skiing and

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.450
Zakynthos, 50 degrees, therefore: frisbeeing.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.800
Eskimos stole our money in Warsaw,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.150
we lost 25.000 HUF and we stared stupidly.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.500
Paris is splendid, even along with a stomach-ache

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.850
but the Ukranian border officer bundled us off.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.200
We drove across the U.S. to Dallas but meanwhile

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.550
police caught me and I was convicted.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.900
We saw the East coast though, Atlanta as well and

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.250
Atlantis flew above us at Miami.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.600
We bought a car to make the trip cheaper but

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.950
it broke down in an abandoned, desert place

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.300
in New Mexico, at the UFO spot, but

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.650
we made it to Las Vegas, on four wheels, again.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.000
We did not talk about the weekdays yet, however,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.350
it is pretty awesome to be in softwarm bed. Sure,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.700
since we got a lot of Rahó creatures,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.000
dudies, Turtle, plush toys, Owl and Alien.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.350
A lot of programs together, hiking, BBQ-ing,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.700
beers, wines, bed-cinema, parties, falling asleep,

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.050
doing the room while listening to hip-hop, puppet-shows, fun,

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.400
dancing and practicing, okay, bye!

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.800
I got the answer since the Virginia Beach proposal trip:

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.150
my choice is "I do, I do".

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.450
She does not bite you, as she is no cannibal,

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.800
but Dudu, Vandi, Vandács, oh and Vandibáb.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.150
1996:

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.500
I did not beleive that this day would ever come.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.500
My wife, called

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.850
V. V. V.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.000
has a new name:  Mrs. Ercsényi!
