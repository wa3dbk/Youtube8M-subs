00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.280
The Golgi apparatus

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.440
consists of general components:

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.940
the cis cisterna nearest the endoplasmic reticulum or ER,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.240
Other key players in this process are

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.580
are the proteins being transported

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.260
and the enzymes that modify them.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.580
Translated proteins are encapsulated in vesicles in the ER.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.520
A group of these vesicles fuse,

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.980
and these fused vesicles form the cis-cisterna.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.580
As the protein moves through the stack,

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.280
it is modified by resident Golgi enzymes

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.040
at specific locations in the apparatus.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.420
These modifications are important

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.680
because they provide the signal that determines the final destination of the protein.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.960
So how does the protein move through the Golgi?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.300
Movement occurs in waves.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.980
First the cis-cisterna becomes part of the medial Golgi cisternae.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.800
Behind it, a new cis-cisterna is formed

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.220
by the fusion of vesicles from the ER.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.780
Meanwhile, one of the medial cisternae migrates

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780
and becomes the new trans-cisterna.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.160
Collectively, this process is known as the cis-maturation model.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.940
Proteins are sorted within the trans Golgi network.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.120
Proteins with the same target sequence and are destined for delivery to the same location.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.880
The trans Golgi network then buds off into vesicles.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.100
These vesicles then migrate to their target location.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.720
These locations include internal organelles

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.020
such the lysosome, the digestive organelle of the cell.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.140
The vesicles can also be targeted to the cell membrane

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.940
where the targeted protein can be released from the cell

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.500
for delivery elsewhere in the organism.
