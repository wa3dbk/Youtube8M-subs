00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.800
Hi guys, I'm Laura Vitale and on this episode
of Laura in the Kitchen, I"m so excited because,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:26.820
well, see, I love everything red velvet, and
Valentine's Day is around the corner, and

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.000
if you're anything like me, you'll be staying
in in your cozy nice house because it is too

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.350
cold out and I don't want to deal with crowds
and all that fun stuff, which is not that

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.350
fun for me.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.230
So we'll be staying in, making breakfast in
bed, and making a really lovely dinner, Joe

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.079
and I, but for breakfast, I figured I wanted
to share with you, a great option.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.320
I'm going to share my Red Velvet Pancakes
with a lovely cream cheese drizzle, they are

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.510
so good, think red velvet cupcakes but in
a pancake form.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.630
They're incredibly easy to do, you'll require
just a few ingredients, and it really is - it

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.890
just feels special, just feels like you've
gone the extra length to do something really,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.280
really special for the occasion, and the ingredients
you'll need are some basic ones, starting

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.149
with some all purpose flour, baking powder,
cocoa powder, salt and sugar, buttermilk,

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.970
egg, you'll need some melted unsalted butter,
vanilla extract and some red food coloring,

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.790
and I'll share with you the ingredients for
the cream cheese drizzle in just a little

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.229
bit, but for now we are going to get started
on the actual batter.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.420
Really easy, so, so easy!

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.830
I'm going to mix together my dry ingredients,
you can double up the recipe to feed a family

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.630
of four to six, this is going to make enough
for the two of us, plus with some leftovers,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.110
and here's a really fun thing, I don't know
if I ever shared with you before, but I love

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.890
storing leftover pancakes in my freezer, like
I freeze them and then I just warm them up

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.270
in my toaster oven.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.270
Pop!

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.010
In my toaster, it's not a toaster oven, see
I try to be cool and then I just destroyed

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.010
myself.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.360
In a toaster, I like reheating them in a toaster!

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:06.340
So, now I'm just going to take my buttermilk,
which is really nice and thick, my egg, butter,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.039
and then just a splash of vanilla, and I'm
going to give these just a little mix before

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.410
I add them to my dry ingredients.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.519
Can I get this vanilla opened?

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.060
Yes, I can.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.340
A nice little drizzle of vanilla.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.920
And then just give this a nice whisk to combine.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.610
Add the wet into your dry, and now all you're
going to do is mix this together to combine,

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.250
and once you have your batter pretty much
together, we're going to start adding some

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.690
of the red food coloring, but I want to get
some of this mixed up really well first.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.480
Okay, you can see that there's a few lumps
in there, but this is the thing, a few lumps

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.580
in a pancake batter is not a bad thing, you
don't want to over mix this because otherwise,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.701
your pancakes won't be really fluffy and delicious,
and now I'm going to add in a little bit of

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:55.121
food coloring, these are red velvet after
all, if you don't want to bother with red

00:02:55.121 --> 00:03:00.070
food coloring, you don't have to they will
taste exactly the same, but, again, we're

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.280
going for that red velvet vibe so I'm - red
velvet vibe, that's pretty cool - I'm going

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.520
to add some red food coloring to my red velvet
pancakes.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.000
It's like my excitement is taking over here.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.230
And then I just start with a little bit and
get that mixed in, and then you just keep

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.330
adding until you get the intense color that
you desire.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.810
Okay, this looks great, now I've got my griddle
here preheating, now I have a non stick griddle

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.930
pan, so that means I don't have to grease
my griddle pan to make my pancakes.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.510
And truth be told, sometimes I like cooking
my pancakes in a little bit of butter, but

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.780
most of the time I like cooking them on just
my non stick griddle because they come out

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.310
perfect and fluffy, they don't overly brown,
so I prefer cooking them on this.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.180
If you do not have a non stick one, you must
grease your skillet or your pan because the

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.870
batter will stick to whatever you're cooking
it on.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.379
I'm preheating this over about medium heat,
I'm going to let my batter sit for about five

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.370
minutes while this is preheating and then
we'll cook up our pancakes.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:09.480
My pan is ready, the batter has rested and
now I'm just going to put little dollops and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.510
just let them cook for a couple of minutes
on each side, you know what pancakes look

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.659
like when they're ready to be flipped, they'll
start to form bubbles, kind of all around

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.230
the top and then you just flip them and let
them cook a couple more minutes and then you're

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.230
done!

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.020
Keep an eye on them and I'll show you what
they look like once we're all done, and once

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.770
they cool a bit, then we can start making
- can I make more of a mess by the way?

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.120
We can start making our glaze.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.199
All my pancakes are done, and now like I said
you can add more red food coloring to get

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.379
them really, really red or you can even do
green for like St Patrick's Day, you could

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:46.710
do whatever you want, think about this - as
far as food coloring goes, you want to do

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.869
yellow, do yellow, it's completely up to you,
this is the right color for me, the world

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:53.349
is my pickle, this is how I'm diggin' it today.

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:59.120
Now we're going to work on the glaze, now
it's really like a glaze meets frosting, I

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.229
suppose, it is delicious, you could serve
these with maple syrup and they would be fabulous,

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:09.360
but why not go all the way, I've got a little
bit of cream cheese in my bowl, really important

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.210
that your cream cheese is at room temperature,
and as you can see I"m kind of just mixing

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.300
it around to make sure it's really soft, I
don't want this to be hard because then it

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.990
won't incorporate everything well.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.210
I'm going to add just a teeny tiny bit of
vanilla, more than a teeny tiny bit, but hey,

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.520
I like vanilla so I am okay with a little
extra drop.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.729
And then, of course, we need some confectioner's
sugar, because this needs to be sweetened,

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.490
and what I do is I kind of just work with
my spatula and just work to mix in my confectioner's

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.560
sugar and then I start adding a little bit
of milk at a time, once my sugar is incorporated,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.590
and just mix it until I get the desired consistency
that I'm looking for.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.009
Some people want this to be like a frosting,
some people want this to be really thin like

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.960
a syrup, you do and add as much or as little
as you want.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.479
I'm just going to add a little bit more, I'm
going to keep on mixing until I've got the

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.869
right consistency.

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:07.180
This is perfect for me.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.789
As you can see I've got a little plate ready
for myself, priorities, of course!

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:12.979
I need some ready.

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:19.129
And now I'm just going to add a little drizzle
of this gorgeousness, and you can make it

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:23.720
thinner if you want to but I like it on the
thick side because I really am treating this

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.490
almost like a frosting, I know, I'm so bad.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.599
I mean, who does that for breakfast?

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.469
I do!

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:33.960
Not embarrassed either.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.879
Because you know what, it's a treat, and once
in a while you have to treat yourself otherwise

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:38.879
you'll go nuts.

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:43.119
That's what my mother says and that is a rule
I have been following my whole life, clearly.

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:47.789
Look at that, they are just so perfectly cooked.

00:06:47.789 --> 00:06:49.779
Mmm!

00:06:49.779 --> 00:07:05.370
That is so good, you know, you could make
regular pancakes, and that's perfectly acceptable,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:11.860
but when something as special as red velvet
pancakes are so easy, why not go through the

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.650
extra step and make something really special
for your romantic breakfast?

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.110
