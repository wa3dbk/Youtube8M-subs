00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.810
Carson City, the capital of the state of Nevada -- Named after the frontiersman

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.810
Kit Carson, who rode through the Eagle Valley in 1840 in his quest to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.669
map the west. 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.069
Carson City sits in the center of one of the most scenic and historic areas in 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.269
the country

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.969
...and is known for its fresh air, beautifully rugged natural surroundings 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.220
and its proximity to the casinos of Reno and skiing in Lake Tahoe.  

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.130
The Carson City Public Works Department is responsible 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.410
for taking care of the city's water

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.760
wastewater, transportation, landfill, fleet, environmental and renewable power systems. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.510
with a staff of over a hundred and
twenty people

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.030
we are often called on to assist the public 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.550
in many different ways 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.840
and many of our duties go on around the clock

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.850
In order to achieve its goals, the men and women of the Carson City Public 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.390
Works Department created an infrastructure revolving around the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.300
capabilities of its people

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.460
and the best available smart city technology from Invensys.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.840
Leveraging virtualization,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.390
 iPads, and smart phones 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.990
to increase the efficiency of its operators and management. 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.140
Increasing situational awareness and achieving a high level of 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.170
operational readiness

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.040
We've created a totally integrated management system that control's the 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.280
city's water and wastewater utilities.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.869
utilizing the latest technology to deliver affordable water and wastewater 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.700
services to the people of Carson City.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.020
This solution also 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.710
includes the management of the Public Works solar plants that provide up to 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.630
748,000 KWH of clean power each year

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.789
The City maintains all of the traffic lights for Carson City

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.800
and Douglas County

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.100
Integration with Wonderware has enabled real time status, alarm notification, 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.090
and historization of the state of communications for the transportation 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.320
system

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.270
which enables better monitoring

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.740
an operational readiness

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.060
And the positive effects of this solution on the way work is done in 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.179
Carson City 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.059
are quickly evident

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.949
The overall solution has everyone plugged in; 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:20.450
allowing Carson City to achieve a 15% reduction in man-hours

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.959
What's most important is that Carson City has achieved its goals through a 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.689
complete set of innovative tools, capabilities and solutions.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.619
The virtual machines that we've implemented here in Carson City 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:35.189
have reduced the burden of administration and overhead costs 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.010
while significantly increasing the reliability 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.469
and disaster recovery processes

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:41.249
The ability 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:46.089
for our operators and engineers to use the iPad to control the Water, Wastewater, 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:48.370
Transportation, and Energy systems 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.430
has greatly increased situational awareness and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.749
has allowed our people to stay on the move.

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:58.129
SmartGlance offers unprecedented mobility. We can monitor critical process

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.979
information from anywhere 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.579
and make decisions on the fly. 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.959
Success at Carson City means working hand in hand 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.169
with Ecosystem partners, such as Wonderware PacWest

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.239
Wonderware PacWest has had a strong partnership with the City of 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.739
Carson City for many years 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.819
and we've taken great pride in providing them with the tools and support they need 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:20.699
in order for them to achieve their goals.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.269
What we've created here is a smarter Carson City. 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.159
One with a complete solution that involves ArchestrA System Platform 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.999
running on virtual machines, accross wireless platforms 

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:35.309
and involves both standard and mobile monitoring and control.

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:36.909
Success also means a 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.109
Public Works Department dedicated to the community it serves

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.760
The activities of the Public Works Department touch the lives of Carson City 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.349
residents 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.019
and visitors on an everyday basis. By combining the strength and knowledge of multiple 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.180

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.549
we provide the community with the highest quality of customer service.

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.269
