00:00:00.638 --> 00:00:01.287
Bo: Hey guys.

00:00:01.287 --> 00:00:01.872
Billy: Hey, Bo.

00:00:01.872 --> 00:00:02.748
Bobby: Hi, Bo.

00:00:02.748 --> 00:00:07.120
♫ (lyrics) Flipping Physics ♫

00:00:07.513 --> 00:00:08.640
Mr. P: Ladies and gentlepeople,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.836
the bell has rung,
therefore class has begun,

00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:11.430
therefore you should
be seated in your seat

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.594
ready and excited to analyze
a video taken on the moon.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:15.595
Billy: Cool.

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:16.334
Bobby: Which moon?

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:17.411
Our moon?

00:00:17.411 --> 00:00:19.165
Bo: Yeah, our moon.

00:00:19.438 --> 00:00:20.347
Mr. P: Yep.

00:00:20.347 --> 00:00:22.248
In order to show that the
acceleration due to gravity

00:00:22.248 --> 00:00:26.530
is independent of mass,
in 1971 NASA filmed

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.176
astronaut David Scott holding a feather

00:00:29.176 --> 00:00:30.915
and a hammer at the same height

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.289
and dropping them at the same time.

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:34.629
Let's enjoy the video.

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:35.815
David: I wanna watch this.

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:37.846
A good picture there. I've got ...

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:40.015
Operations: Beautiful picture, Dave.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:45.858
David: In my left hand I have a feather.

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.897
In my right hand a hammer.

00:00:47.897 --> 00:00:50.320
I guess one of the
reasons we got here today

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.314
was because of a gentlemen named Galileo

00:00:52.314 --> 00:00:54.699
a long time ago who made
a rather significant

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.227
discovery about falling
objects and gravity fields.

00:00:58.227 --> 00:01:01.506
And we thought that, where
would be a better place

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:05.952
to confirm his findings than on the moon?

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:09.396
And so we thought we'd
try it here for you.

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:11.136
The feather happens to be, appropriately,

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:14.918
a falcon feather for our Falcon,

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:17.408
and I'll drop the two of
them here and hopefully

00:01:17.408 --> 00:01:20.313
they'll hit the ground at the same time.

00:01:21.406 --> 00:01:23.553
How about that?

00:01:23.553 --> 00:01:24.101
Operations: How about that?

00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:25.588
David: I think that
proves that Mr. Galileo

00:01:25.588 --> 00:01:28.109
was correct in his findings.

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:29.370
Mr. P: So now what we're gonna do,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.843
is we're gonna take a look at the video

00:01:30.843 --> 00:01:32.203
and figure out variables that we know

00:01:32.203 --> 00:01:34.723
and see what we can calculate from there.

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:36.132
So, Bobby, taking a look at the video,

00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:38.552
which I have now looped to just show

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.337
the dropping of the objects, tell me

00:01:40.337 --> 00:01:42.645
a variable that we know.

00:01:42.645 --> 00:01:44.617
Bobby: It looks like ...

00:01:44.617 --> 00:01:47.261
Is their initial velocity zero?

00:01:52.362 --> 00:01:54.478
Mr. P: Yes, the initial
velocity in the Y direction

00:01:54.478 --> 00:01:56.866
is equal to zero because
he drops the hammer

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:57.991
and the feather.

00:01:57.991 --> 00:01:59.266
Bo, what else?

00:01:59.274 --> 00:02:00.512
Bo: We know from the last lecture

00:02:00.512 --> 00:02:02.629
that the acceleration due
to gravity on the moon

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:05.638
is about 1/6th of what it
is here on earth, right?

00:02:05.638 --> 00:02:07.440
Mr. P: Correct, however more specifically

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.748
it's the acceleration due
to gravity on the moon

00:02:09.748 --> 00:02:13.239
that is 1.62 meters per second, squared.

00:02:15.423 --> 00:02:17.915
And, therefore, the
acceleration in the Y direction,

00:02:17.915 --> 00:02:22.064
which is equal to -g, is equal to -1.62

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:23.922
meters per seconds, squared.

00:02:23.922 --> 00:02:25.627
Uh, Billy, what else do you see?

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:26.735
Billy: Isn't the frame rate of standard

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.650
definition video 29.97 frames per second?

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.479
So, can't we just figure
out the number of frames

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.240
to determine how long it fell for?

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:35.874
Mr. P: Absolutely right.

00:02:35.874 --> 00:02:37.251
Very nice, Billy.

00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:39.136
The National Television System Committee,

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:42.994
or NTSC, standardized the color television

00:02:42.994 --> 00:02:46.177
broadcast signal in the
United States in the 1950's

00:02:46.177 --> 00:02:50.371
to have a frame rate of
29.97 frames per second.

00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.891
And this is clearly after the 1950's

00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:56.609
and is before high definition video.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:58.700
I wasn't even born in 1971.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.135
So let's go through and count the frames.

00:03:01.135 --> 00:03:03.590
David: Well, in my left
hand I have a feather.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.078
In mt right hand, a hammer.

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:07.691
And I guess one of the
reasons we got here today

00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:09.561
was because of a gentleman named Galileo

00:03:09.561 --> 00:03:11.182
a long time ago, who made

00:03:11.182 --> 00:03:13.973
a rather significant discovery.
Operations: Superb!

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:16.548
Mr. P.: So there you go, 36 frames.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.314
We need to convert the change in time

00:03:19.314 --> 00:03:21.313
from frames into seconds.

00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:22.364
Billy pointed out that there are

00:03:22.364 --> 00:03:25.977
29.97 frames per second in this video,

00:03:25.977 --> 00:03:28.489
therefore we're gonna
multiply our change in time

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.285
by the reciprocal of the frame rate.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.347
And what do we get for our change in time?

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.318
Bobby: It's 1.201201 seconds.

00:03:42.457 --> 00:03:43.773
Mr. P: And given that information

00:03:43.773 --> 00:03:46.426
we can figure out the initial
height above the ground

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:50.167
from which Mr. Scott droped
the hammer and feather.

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.135
Bo, how can we figure
out the height initial?

00:03:53.135 --> 00:03:54.831
Bo: Well, the acceleration is constant,

00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:56.534
so we can use our uniformly accelerated

00:03:56.534 --> 00:03:59.331
motion equations, we just
need to pick the right one.

00:03:59.331 --> 00:04:02.149
Let's use the displacement
equals the velocity

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:04.493
initial, times the change
in time, plus one half,

00:04:04.493 --> 00:04:06.992
times the acceleration, times
the change in time, squared.

00:04:06.992 --> 00:04:08.606
We have all the numbers
and the initial velocity

00:04:08.606 --> 00:04:10.747
is zero and anything
times zero is just zero,

00:04:10.747 --> 00:04:14.788
so the displacement
equals 1/2, times -1.62,

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:18.153
times 1.201201 squared, which gives us ...

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.380
-1.16874 and using two sig figs

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.171
because our frame rate
only had two sig figs,

00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:28.204
so that rounds to -1.2 meters.

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.467
Mr. P: Very nice, Bo.

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:37.197
One thing to notice that I did,
is I added Y's to make sure

00:04:37.197 --> 00:04:41.150
that we identify that this
is all in the Y direction.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.576
Oh, for those of you who are
still using English units,

00:04:44.576 --> 00:04:46.861
because there are 3.281 feet per meter,

00:04:46.861 --> 00:04:48.788
we can do this.

00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:54.881
Which means that Mr.
Scott dropped the hammer

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.533
and the feather from an initial height

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.784
above the ground of
approximately 1.2 meters

00:04:58.784 --> 00:05:03.784
or 3.8 feet, which is
approximately this high,

00:05:06.122 --> 00:05:08.425
which looks pretty close to me.

00:05:08.425 --> 00:05:10.904
Yes, Bobby, you have a question?

00:05:10.904 --> 00:05:12.900
Bobby: Mr. P, where did the negative go?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.138
Mr. P: Oh, right, okay, so the delta Y,

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:17.954
or displacement, has both magnitude and direction

00:05:17.954 --> 00:05:19.597
and because the hammer and feather

00:05:19.597 --> 00:05:21.633
were going down this means that the

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:23.208
displacements were negative.

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:25.409
However, I asked for the heights initial

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.469
above the ground, which
is a positive number.

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:29.616
Any other questions?

00:05:29.616 --> 00:05:30.555
Billy: No.

00:05:30.555 --> 00:05:32.160
Bobby: Cool video.

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.353
Mr. P: In that case,
realize that we just took

00:05:34.353 --> 00:05:37.589
a video that was filmed
in 1971 on the moon,

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:40.779
which has almost no
atmosphere and therefore

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.453
the hammer and the feather
were truly in free-fall.

00:05:43.453 --> 00:05:45.731
We counted the frames
to figure out how long

00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:49.303
they were in free-fall
and used a UAM equation

00:05:49.303 --> 00:05:50.766
to figure out the height initial

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:53.116
for the hammer and
feather above the ground.

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:55.194
I think that's pretty cool.

00:05:55.194 --> 00:05:57.220
Thank you very much for
learning with me today.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.791
I enjoyed learning with you.
