00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:03.284
(hard rock music)

00:00:03.284 --> 00:00:04.847
- Nikki?
- Yeah?

00:00:04.847 --> 00:00:06.282
- What are we doing today?

00:00:06.282 --> 00:00:09.742
- We are showing you the
proper way to prepare absinthe.

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:11.542
- Exactly. As you know absinthe

00:00:11.542 --> 00:00:13.596
is a very popular drink here.

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:14.884
Let me tell you something.

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:19.681
Absinthe, A, was never
designed to be done as a shot.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.003
Secondly, if you watched my
video from the Czech Republic,

00:00:22.003 --> 00:00:23.302
you saw the dudes preparing it

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:24.904
with the flames and everything.

00:00:24.904 --> 00:00:26.995
That's just a marketing ploy

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:29.284
because the proper way to prepare absinthe

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:32.718
has absolutely nothing to do with fire.

00:00:32.718 --> 00:00:36.096
- (sighs) I like the fire.

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.444
- [Skyy] So Nik?
- Yes?

00:00:37.444 --> 00:00:38.850
- [Skyy] Could you pour an
ounce of that in that glass?

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.826
Do a three count.

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:43.843
- [Nikki] Okay, one, two, three.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.665
- [Skyy] Perfect. Take this spoon.

00:00:45.665 --> 00:00:46.861
- Yes?

00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:48.140
- [Skyy] Place that on top there.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.765
- Well, now I can't 'cause
you already did that.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:51.658
- [Skyy] Okay, sorry here,
you put that spoon on top.

00:00:51.658 --> 00:00:53.747
Okay? Do it all sexy, that's
right, keep it sexy, girl.

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:55.744
That's right, okay.

00:00:55.744 --> 00:00:57.544
Now we have sugar cubes here, okay?

00:00:57.544 --> 00:00:59.263
The sugar's up to you, exactly how many

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:00.679
cubes you want to use.

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.862
So for you, let's use three cubes.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:05.079
- I'd do five (laughs).

00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:08.950
La, la, la, la, la.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.413
- [Skyy] Okay, perfect, perfect.

00:01:10.413 --> 00:01:12.654
Oh, you want to do five cubes?

00:01:12.654 --> 00:01:16.380
- (laughs) La, la, la, la,
I like things to be sweet.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.737
- [Skyy] So Nikki has
here five cubes, okay?

00:01:18.737 --> 00:01:20.199
- [Nikki] Mmm-hmm.

00:01:20.199 --> 00:01:22.150
- Because she definitely
got a sugar addiction.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.320
And this right here is going
to act as our water fountain.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.852
A lot of times you see water
fountains in absinthe ads.

00:01:27.852 --> 00:01:31.225
So we can do is just have
a nice little steady flow.

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:33.385
- [Nikki] I've never seen an absinthe ad.

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:34.721
- [Skyy] Train over these cubes.

00:01:34.721 --> 00:01:36.223
Please cubes, start dissolving.

00:01:36.223 --> 00:01:37.250
(Nikki laughs)

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.317
Jesus Lord, have mercy,
these cubes are hard.

00:01:39.317 --> 00:01:41.872
Okay, that one's-- they're kind
of breaking up a little bit.

00:01:41.872 --> 00:01:44.901
- [Nikki] Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cubes.

00:01:46.532 --> 00:01:49.790
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.969
(hard rock music)

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.167
And it's just room temperature water?

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.395
- [Skyy] Yeah. You could, I mean,

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:06.554
you could put in cold water.

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:07.736
It's really up to you, you know?

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:08.661
- [Nikki] Mmm-hmm.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:09.742
- [Skyy] You could put in ice cubes

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:11.430
but then ice cubes will
further dilute it, okay?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.475
- [Nikki] Okay.

00:02:12.475 --> 00:02:15.253
- [Skyy] And then we just
give this a nice little stir.

00:02:15.253 --> 00:02:17.819
- It smells like licorice.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.921
- Tons of swagsis.
- Black licorice.

00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:21.872
(claps)
- And there you have it!

00:02:21.872 --> 00:02:23.659
The proper way to prepare absinthe.

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.157
Go ahead, take a sip.

00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:27.233
- All right.

00:02:30.172 --> 00:02:31.577
It's very sweet.

00:02:31.577 --> 00:02:32.540
- It is?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.679
- That's a first--
- Well it's not--

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:34.979
It's not very, very sweet.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.396
It's good, it's very good.

00:02:36.396 --> 00:02:38.973
I would sip on this, like at a lounge.

00:02:38.973 --> 00:02:42.259
- It's very good, but notice
she used five sugar cubes.

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:43.617
That makes a difference.

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.916
You put one cube in there,
homeboy, that's your ass.

00:02:45.916 --> 00:02:47.030
You'll be like ew!

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.375
- However, this is probably
the least sweetest drink

00:02:49.375 --> 00:02:51.071
that I've had on this show.

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:52.232
- Tipsy bartender!

00:02:52.232 --> 00:02:53.892
- Tipsy bartender.
- This is really, really,

00:02:53.892 --> 00:02:55.077
really, really good.

00:02:55.077 --> 00:02:56.458
Leave the fire alone.

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:57.920
- It's good and it's simple.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.395
