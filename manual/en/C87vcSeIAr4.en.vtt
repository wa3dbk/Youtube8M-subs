00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.820
Hey man, how are things?

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.360
Things aren't bad!

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.740
Aside from all of these people owing me money!

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.640
I only assume you have yours with you. Unless you really enjoy wasting my time.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.180
Don't even worry, man! I got it right here!

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.620
What is that?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.540
It's Pokemon cards!

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.640
So you don't have my money?

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.320
This is your money!

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.500
Back in the late nineties, early aughts, they used to be worth a few bucks.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.540
But based on estimates at the time, they are now worth... a lot!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.680
This'll pay you back, and then some!

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.120
This is going to end very badly for you.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.360
I'm completely serious! These were the best investment I've ever made!

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.820
I was kinda hoping to buy a Lamborghini with these,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.500
but paying off my crippling debt to a scary loan shark is a close second!

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.800
I even have... a holographic Charizard!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.840
It's a big deal, I promise.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.720
You see that?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.760
...Yes.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.240
That is a "drop shadow." This is not First Edition.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.080
You might make a hundred dollars off of this if you sold it to an idiot.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.760
Do I look like an idiot?

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:07.320
...No.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.280
How much exactly do you think all of these are worth?

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.200
The whole binder?

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.100
Uh, well that was the big one so..maybe not quite a million anymore?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.100
But...

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.540
You have a.. Grimer, Tentacool, Omanyte, Mewtwo...

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.060
That's a good one!

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.500
No. It's not.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.760
Nobody likes Mewtwo.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.020
WHAT? Mewtwo's the best!

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.620
He is the best. He's a fascinating, emotional character caught between the two worlds of Pokemon and humans.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.520
And nobody cares.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.520
And he's worth four dollars.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.000
How do you know all this?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.660
Mysterious Fossil?

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.300
Well...

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.420
You thought you could pay back my money...

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.460
WITH MYSTERIOUS FOSSIL!?!?

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.480
No! I've got tons of other stuff! There's like six Unown in there!

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.660
THEY ARE ONLY GOOD AS A COMPLETE ALPHABETICAL SET AND YOU KNOW IT!

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.720
You don't have sets of anything in here! Just...

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.940
Pieces! Some Mori Clay illustrations, some Japanese cards.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.080
A few stray holographics, but none of them are from the same series!

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.260
And who collects only two legendary birds? You know there are three!

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.780
The fire one looks weird!

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.640
These are basically worthless. And now, I don't have my money.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.980
What're we going to do about that?

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.980
Woah, wait. It's cool. It's fine.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.880
I've got another way of paying you, it's way better. It's basically guaranteed.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.660
Is it Beanie Babies?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.600
It might be Beanie Babies...

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.760
If you have any sense of self-preservation, you will not lie to me about this.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.120
Do they still have the tags on them.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.820
...Yes.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.920
I will think about it.
