Hi, I'm Si Nguyen with Duplo USA and today I'm here to 
 talk to you about the benefits of off-line collating

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.678
with the Duplo DSC-10/20 Suction Collator.

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:21.157
We're here with the Duplo 350C Booklet System, which connects the DSC-10/20 Collator

00:00:21.157 --> 00:00:24.363
with our mid-range DBM-350 Bookletmaker.

00:00:24.363 --> 00:00:29.753
We've also added the optional Square Spine module to improve book flatness.

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:35.692
Jobs processed on collating and bookletmaking systems are finished at much faster speeds

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:40.613
and output from multiple printers can be accepted and finished with equal ease.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:46.981
Should the printer break down, an off-line finishing operation 
 will continue to run without interruption

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:52.189
unlike with an in-line system where the entire production 
 would be brought to a halt.

00:00:53.113 --> 00:01:01.227
Now, let me go over some of the features and benefits of 
 the DSC-10/20 and what sets us apart from the competition.

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:07.109
The Duplo DSC-10/20 paper collator was introduced back in 2011

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:11.499
and it's our heavy-duty yet affordable suction collator model.

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:18.177
Each bin comes equipped with its own adjustable feeding 
 system for consistent and accurate feeding

00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:22.411
that handles coated, curled, or static prints with ease.

00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:32.127
It also features Duplo's proven suction feed system that is found 
 in our high-end DC-10/60 Pro and DSC-10/60i collator models

00:01:32.127 --> 00:01:40.200
as well as our sheet feeders, offering top-of-the-line technology 
 feeding both offset and digital print media.

00:01:40.196 --> 00:01:46.920
The DSC-10/20 Collator is programmed through the user-friendly control panel.

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:52.580
It has a block mode function that allows for 
 continuous running without stopping for reload.

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:58.430
And it also rejects improper sets on-the-fly without interrupting the operation.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.320
As you can see the collator is small in 
 size but also modular in design,

00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:12.000
the collator can easily be configured with any Duplo 
 bookletmaker for offline collating and bookletmaking.

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:15.100
And up to 2 towers can be connected.

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:20.230
If you're looking for a collating and bookletmaking system for your mid-volume runs,

00:02:20.234 --> 00:02:29.050
our 350C Booklet System is the most affordable air suction system on 
 the market, producing up to 3,000 booklets per hour.

00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:35.560
As the sheets are fed and collated, sets are 
 smoothly guided through the DBM-350 Bookletmaker.

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:42.070
The push belt transport system gently guides the sets through 
 the bookletmaker to prevent scratches and static build up.

00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:46.330
The sets are then stitched together using heavy duty stitcher heads.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.760
With the 350C Booklet System, up to 20 jobs can be 
 saved in memory and instantly recalled for fast changeovers.

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:12.430
Once a job is selected, the stitch heads, fold roller, 
 paper side guides, and trimmer automatically self-adjust.

00:03:13.062 --> 00:03:19.500
The Duplo 350C Booklet System is a great investment for 
 users that currently own a friction feed system

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.100
and cannot justify a larger air-feed system.

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:32.680
If you're looking to collate for NCR padding jobs or perfect binding 
 jobs, you can choose from two of our optional stackers.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:38.380
The DCR-ST Cris Cross Stacker which is suitable for high volume stacking jobs.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:45.430
Or the DSC-10/20 Stacker, which can be integrated into 
 the collator for straight or offset stacking.

00:03:56.917 --> 00:04:01.540
That's it for today's presentation on our DSC-10/20 off-line collator.

00:04:01.544 --> 00:04:04.350
Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time.
