00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.650
Students ask me all the time if their essays
make a difference and the short answer is,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.380
absolutely yes.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.200
I was extremely anxious about writing my college
essay.I had a really hard time thinking of

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.200
a topic.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.840
At first I didn't know what to write about.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.450
The pressure was definitely there.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.560
I was really nervous that maybe they wouldn't
get to the essay, they wouldn't pay attention

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.560
to it.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.739
When I pick up an application the first thing
I like to read is the student's essay.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.610
Essays can really be a significant tip factor
in our final decision.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.450
The essay is something you can really bring
yourself into and really let the admissions

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.890
directors know who you are.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.480
Who I am on paper is not who I am in person.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.160
The rest of my application was a bunch of
stuffy numbers and grades.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.510
It's really just a free space to talk about
yourself and what about you is different from

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.510
everyone else.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.870
The one thing I wanted to do was stand out.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.160
Every year I read about 2,000 essays.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.900
That's a lot of writing.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.780
Now what makes an essay stand out?

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.260
Some of the best essays I've read are essays
where people are just being themselves.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.030
It's about how much of you you can put into
your essay.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.490
How passionate are you about something.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.350
It's really going to make a difference in
the whole group of applications if you can

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.530
make the person remember you.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.740
That was really the only way they could see
who I was as a person . We're looking for

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.630
all those different kinds of people to add
to what Boston University is.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.630
Everyone has something unique about themselves.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.630
Everyone's story is different.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.390
For me that actually was marching band.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690
I ended up writing about why I wanted to be
a teacher.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.170
I actually wrote about one of my experiences
playing hockey.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.270
You don't need to have a story that's one
in a million.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.890
You can have story that everyone has but it's
about making it yours.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
Once you find that topic, it's all about just
writing and re-writing.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.780
The main chunk of the work is actually in
revising.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.780
Please proofread.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.780
Proofread, proofread, proofread.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.060
As many people as you can get to read your
essay, the better.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.460
My dad edited all my essays and everything.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:57.001
I had my guidance councilor read my essay
and I had my English teacher read my essay.

00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.140
I had to cut out a bunch of awesome sentences
that I thought were great.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.360
Keep your story concise.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.250
When it says 500 words, you really have to
make sure it's actually 500 words.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.880
I think mine was 600 words, I cheated.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.279
That is when you'll get that perfect essay
and that's when you know you're ready to click

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.980
that submit button and enjoy that heavenly
moment.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.189
It was pretty sweet.
