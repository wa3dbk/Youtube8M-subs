00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:09.110
A quantum computer is a device, a technological
device that in principle would harness the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.580
full capacity of quantum mechanics to undertake
calculations that a standard computer would

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.840
be absolutely unable to achieve.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.490
One way of thinking about it is this.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.680
There’s an approach to quantum mechanics
where one imagines that there are many in

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:37.700
some sense parallel realities moving along
in some larger environment if you will.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.970
Where, for instance if I want to measure an
electron, quantum theory says well there’s

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.300
a 50 percent chance it’s there and a 50
percent chance it’s over there.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.340
Now what does that mean?

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.660
Well one interpretation says well there’s
actually two universes and in one universe

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.410
the electron is here and in another universe
it is over there.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.129
That’s kind of a crazy sounding idea but
a quantum computer perhaps can harness that

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.429
by doing some calculations over here and other
calculations over there in parallel.

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.689
Now it’s doing in some sense twice as many
calculations as a classical computer existing

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.159
in one world would be able to do.

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.000
Now imagine taking that idea and spreading
it over all of the possible realities allowed

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.680
by quantum mechanics.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.390
Now you’re harnessing all of these different
worlds if you will to do all of these calculations

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.020
in parallel much faster, much more powerful.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.020
Doing calculations that in a single universe
would be impossible.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.990
So this is one way of thinking about it and
it offers amazing possibilities and we just

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.530
need to see how successful we are at harnessing
these ideas to actually put it into practice.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530
And we don’t know yet.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.069
We’ll see going forward but it’s an exciting
possibility.
