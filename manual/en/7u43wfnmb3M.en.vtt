Hi, welcome to GoodKnitKisses.  I'm Kristen and I’m here with my friends

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.840
at allfreeknitting.com and they've asked me to produce a video on the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.029
basics of loom knitting

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.449
you may be curious about loom knitting

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.499
you're a regular knitter or crocheter or you just don't do either of those things

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:25.319
but you've been curious about it

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:29.969
it's very easy.  There are several stitches from regular knitting

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:33.270
that you can produce on a loom

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.580
and they are just done in a different fashion it can be quite addicting and

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.220
I’m here to show you a few of the looms and some of the yarn that would be suggested and a

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.380
few of the projects that you can do.  Let's get started!

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.320
First I’d like to tell you about circle looms or round looms

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.340
this particular pack came from Provocrafts Knifty Knitter series and you can

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.100
buy all kinds of brands different ones are hard

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.239
plastic or wood or even a bendable 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:03.920
plastic a pliable plastic

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.020
you can actually make them as well. all the pegs are standard they all come

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.230
with a  routed groove on the outside to help you when you're knitting over

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.700
and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.430
the gauge

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.860
is the space between the peg since all the pegs are

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.850
one

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.800
size if you noticed this peg is the same as this peg

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.690
but the gauge is a little bit bigger so and then this. This one is

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.049
bigger

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.479
in size, in circumference

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.860
allowing a larger project to take place on here, you can actually create

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.539
hats and you can create

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.530
flat panels as long as you don't connect all the pegs

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.280
you lots of things on here starting here this would be a baby or small and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.460
preemie

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.409
child hats and this would be a toddler size hat

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.290
if you make the stitches loose enough and if you've got an adult who has a very small

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.500
head that's a perfect one for that

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.840
and don't put more than one

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.420
strand of yarn

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.359
this green one here, the next size up is more for adult hats

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.989
and this size here

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.389
would be for an extra large adult hat or if you wanted to have several

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:15.969
strands

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.919
that made it a tighter knit, this would be 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.589
excellent for that. And my husband actually has a

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:25.249
little big bigger head  and I used two strands and it made a perfect hat

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.240
also I use and make cocoons on that

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.730
for little babies

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.689
as photo props or

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.219
whatever else, basically it's a long big hat.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.819
This ones called a bloom loom, it's a very small loom, you can make flowers on

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:40.859
them

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:46.529
this is your knitting tool (I’m missing a peg here, but it's in the other room)

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:50.279
knitting tool that comes with your set you can also buy another one if for

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:52.409
whatever reason it broke or you

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.869
need extra for a more looms and projects

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.389
but these are standard

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:01.919
this is called a spool loom

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.700
and it creates a round

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.109
and you can pick either this side

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.569
or this side and you could make a nice thick or smaller

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.789
i-cord

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:13.319
on that

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.329
it's a nice handy tool

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.989
these down here are just a system for making pompoms if you like or you can make them

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.139
by hand

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.459
or any other fashion and they are just

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.939
helpful. if you'd like to know how to do that

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.060
and these are your rectangular looms or long

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.900
looms

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.719
it's basically like a rake with

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:34.719
instead of one side it's got two

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.040
and this actually came in a set of four there's one a little

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.589
smaller than this one it comes about to here

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:43.730
and then a blue one that’s longer

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.939
then this and it's about twenty four inches i believe

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:51.139
so these are the looms that you can use

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:51.909
I suggest you

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.469
go to your local craft store and find what's near you, grab one

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:59.029
Start Looming.  It’s a lot of fun!

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.249
Thanks for tuning in to GoodKnitKisses, I'm Kristen. Happy Looming!
