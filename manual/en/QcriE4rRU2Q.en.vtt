00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.960
Hi! I'm Ed Dowling from eddowling.com. I'm
here to talk about tuning in general for open

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:15.280
tunings, uses of tuners for expertvillage.com.
In the old days, people used the pitch pipe

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.449
or if there was 3 or 4 people around, they
would all just agree on what note was E if

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.720
there was no tuner at all. From there, by
agreeing on a note you can tune a guitar by

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.660
knowing the relationships . In this tuning,
which is open G, it's going to be to get to

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.339
this D to make a G note, which is the next
one. I can fret the fifth fret and get an

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.721
approximation of what the next note should
be. Now, to get the next note in this tuning,

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:53.679
I go up to the 7th fret and so and so, and
so on and so forth. I go the 5th fret now,

00:00:53.679 --> 00:01:02.030
the 4th fret, and now I believe the 3rd fret.
Nobody's doing this anymore. Everybody uses

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.420
a tuner. This is a good tuner but it's not
chromatic. It only has the major notes; it

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.460
doesn't have some of the notes I'm needing
even for this tuning here. You'll usually

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.890
find a few notes on there that you'll trust.
In this case, open G. The D string stays the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.040
same as constant tune. What you do is you
take your handy tuner here either plug you

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.990
guitar in or let the microphone pick up the
note until it say in this case D a D note.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:42.640
The G note actually is a true G note so I
can tune that one too. If you are going to

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.490
go and buy a tuner these days and you know
you are going to play a opening tune a chromatic

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.609
tuner it gives you all the notes which include
the sharps and flats it makes it very easy

00:01:52.609 --> 00:02:08.850
to tune any tuning. You don't really need
it if you

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:53.890
have

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:10.900
a few notes
