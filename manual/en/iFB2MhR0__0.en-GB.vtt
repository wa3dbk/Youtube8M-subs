00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.529
The SSG 08 costs just $1,700 and is the budget
sniper rifle. The AWP costs $4,750 and is

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.940
effectively a one-hit killing machine. The
two autosnipers both cost $5,000 and are practically

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.700
the same in every way, as discovered in my
previous comparison video. Because of this,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.660
my main focus in this video will be on the
AWP and scout though I will occasionally throw

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.020
in the autosnipers for comparison.
Unlike the autosnipers, bolt-action rifles

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.790
such as the SSG 08 and AWP need to be reloaded
after every shot. This means that they have

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.050
a lower firerate and that you have to click
for every shot, and between these you're vulnerable

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.350
for about a second. Even when you are able
to fire again, it pays to take a fraction

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.289
of a second to aim since your inaccuracy will
be reduced during this time.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.059
You see people doing noscopes, but it's not
always a good idea since the accuracy when

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.739
unscoped is rather poor. Here's a result of
40 shots, each 2 seconds apart. The autosnipers

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.120
are best, closely followed by the SSG 08 and
the AWP trailing way behind.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.559
However, zoom in and the tables are turned.
The SSG08 is poorest, followed by the autos

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.730
and with the AWP sporting the most accuracy.
Bear in mind that I compared scoped accuracy

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.390
at 4,096 units, a distance further than any
situation you'll encounter in-game. Zooming

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.550
in with the weapons gives you an unquestionable
advantage- here's the AWP at 512 units when

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.780
scoped in, just to give you a taste of how
accurate it can be when compared with noscope.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.590
But that's not the end of the story. I said
earlier that it's best to stay scoped for

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.650
a while before firing for maximum accuracy.
It turns out that the amount of time you need

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.300
to do this for varies with each weapon. The
SSG 08 only takes 3/10 of a second to get

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.740
to 90% accuracy and half a second for all
of it. Although the AWP and Autosniper have

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.020
a HIGHER accuracy, it takes far longer to
achieve this. In fact, it takes the AWP about

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.590
0.7 seconds and the autosniper 0.9 seconds
to match the SSG 08 for accuracy and over

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.700
a second to get to their maximum accuracy.
This makes the more expensive snipers better

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.260
for defending from an entrenched position,
rather than for quick-scopes and reaction

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.110
shots which is what the SSG 08 excels at.
In addition to this, here are the firerates

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.060
for the weapons. Of course, the autos are
the best but what's interesting is that the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.730
SSG08 reloads .2 seconds faster than the AWP.
This, as well as earlier factors, make the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.959
SSG08 the best sniper to use for Quake3 players
who jump about taking pot-shots at people.

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.409
If you fire at the fastest possible speed
with snipers, the AWP and SSG08 will not become

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.950
more inaccurate with later shots since time-wise
they're far enough apart to reset accuracy

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.290
already. The autos, however, will have a recoil
pattern which I covered in the previous video.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.579
Quick-switching will NOT speed up reload rate
for any sniper in any situation. There is

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.409
an invisible timer that leaves you standing
there unable to fire until it's up, even if

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.430
the animation for it ended seconds before.
The reason that quick-switching is still useful

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.890
is because it allows you to get out of the
scoped mode without having to cycle through

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.620
the zooms and you can maintain more mobility
whilst doing so.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.879
Onto damage. All of the snipers deliver considerably
more damage than the other rifles in CS:GO.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.969
The autos deliver the least and they take
either one headshot or 2 regular hits to take

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.749
down enemies regardless of armour. The scout
has the added bonus of killing enemies with

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:08.560
one hit in the stomach if they don't have
armour, and the AWP kills people instantly

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.790
anywhere apart from in the legs, but even
that will reduce them to low health. The damage

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.700
fall-off is just 1% for the AWP and 2% for
the others for every 500 units, making them

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.000
effective at long range. Which is kind of
what you'd expect.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.519
All snipers share the joint greatest penetration
value in the game. I'll study exactly how

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.389
this compares with other weapons in another
video, but it can pass through 4 surfaces,

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.029
making a 5-man possible. I'm not going to
theorize on how I managed this when I have

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:37.029
only managed 4 since, but at least now you
know it can be done. Combine the penetration

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.609
with increased damage and less distance drop-off
and it makes spamming walls an effective tactic,

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.480
particularly with the autos which have the
disposable magazine capacity and high fire-rates.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.169
The kill reward is $300 if you eliminate players
with either the scout or the auto snipers.

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.629
The AWP earns you just $100. Combine this
with the AWP's high cost and your economy

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.150
will be at a disadvantage if you choose to
be a sniper with this weapon.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.389
Clip size for all snipers is, in my opinion,
very generous. Autos have 20 shots each which

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.840
is more than enough for most situations- in
fact, it makes it a great weapon to spam down

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.560
the middle of Dust2 with at the beginning
of the round. Aside from that the autos don't

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.870
have much purpose for the rushing T-side,
but hey. The AWP and SSG08 both have magazine

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.479
sizes of 10, but bear in mind that there's
also a delay between each shot since they're

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.580
bolt-action.
Movement speed is fascinating. The AWP restricts

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.300
you to 200 units a second, or 150 when scoped.
The auto snipers weigh in at 215, or 150 when

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.210
scoped... while with the SSG08 lets you move
at 230 units even when scoped in! Firing when

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.080
moving is a no-no with all snipers, but the
SSG 08 remains the best of the bunch. Yet

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.240
another bonus for Quake players.
But the biggest bonus is jumping accuracy.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.479
We've all heard about this and it's true-
the SSG 08 becomes almost fully accurate while

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.330
jumping, particularly around the peak of the
jump. The horrendous problems with CS:GO's

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.030
hitboxes deliver a double whammy, making the
sniper in question difficult to hit while

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.330
pulling this stunt. The AWP also has a strange
perk. If you land while in scoped mode the

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.780
inaccuracy is just a 1/3 compared with landing
when unscoped.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.550
When it comes to reloading, the SCAR20 auto
sniper is the fastest, followed by the SSG08

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.069
and then the AWP, with the G3SG1 coming last.
If I had to guess I'd say that this will be

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:18.070
changed at some point since it seems excessive
for a gun that's so similar to the SCAR20

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.111
in almost every other way to have such a drawback.
All weapons take 1.05 seconds to equip and

00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:27.610
to fire apart from the AWP which takes 1.3
seconds, cementing its place as a heavy weapon

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.190
that requires planning to use.
The zoom power of the weapons tells the same

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.130
story. All snipers zoom in the same amount
with the first level of zoom, but the AWP

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.490
has a stronger second level of zoom than the
others. If used properly this can work to

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.940
its advantage but you have to be aware of
the increased tunnel vision that you'll encounter

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.411
with this weapon.
All snipers slow players down when hit. Apart

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:50.940
from the G3SG1, they all slow people down
to 40% when shot in the legs, or 35% elsewhere.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:58.039
The G3SG1 only slows them down to 65% in the
legs or 50% elsewhere. Not sure why it's worse

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.340
in this regard, I suspect Valve of updating
this at some point and of rendering this entire

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.061
video obsolete!
Oh and none of the snipers fire tracers. Just

00:06:06.061 --> 00:06:10.080
thought I'd throw that in there.
In conclusion, the SSG 08 is a cheap and powerful

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.129
tool in the right hands. It has fast accuracy
bonuses and the jumping perk mentioned previously

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.849
makes it annoying to face in combat. The reduction
in damage compared with more expensive snipers

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.020
is more than compensated for by its low price.
The AWP is the big Daddy of CS:GO weapons.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.879
The body and arms are also one-hit kill areas
with this weapon, but the down-side is that

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:32.900
it's a slow weapon to use and you're a sitting
duck in close-quarters combat. It has its

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.300
place in the game but isn't always the best
choice, depending on situation and the economy

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.000
of your team.
The autosnipers have been mentioned before.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.240
The SCAR-20 is the superior weapon and its
use on CT-side suits its strengths in defuse

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.500
maps. At just $250 more than the AWP it's
a decent alternative that comes into its own

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.720
when fending off multiple enemies at once.
All weapons have their place within the game,

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.210
a good player will understand that and will
choose their weapon accordingly.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.419
Thanks again to SlothSquadron who helped to
get the facts and figures correct for this

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:04.260
video, check out a spreadsheet of figures
that he and BlackRetina have made in the description

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.149
