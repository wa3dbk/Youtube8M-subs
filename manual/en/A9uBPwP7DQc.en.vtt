Welcome and thanks so much for talking to me, and Cady, I wonder if I could start with you?

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:13.350 position:97%
I gather that you have brought music with you to the International Space Station and wanted to ask what you have with you.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.600 position:97%
Well I play the flute on the ground and it's one of the things I love to do so I brought my own flute with me.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.050 position:69%
But I also brought some other flutes with me

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.520 position:92%
I have a pennywhistle from Paddy Moloney of the Chieftains,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.590 position:98%
and also a very old Irish flute from Matt Molloy of the Chieftains,

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.140 position:81%
and I have a flute from Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.540 position:98%
So a pretty well-rounded spectrum and I am having a great time up here with them.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.980 position:97%
That's amazing. How did it come to be that you have those three flutes with you?

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.600 position:59%
Well so with mine it makes four total,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.770 position:97%
and we get to bring a certain number of things with us to represent, or just to,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.670 position:83%
we just get a certain amount of space to bring stuff.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.270 position:98%
And you know, one of the things I think that's important to do is try to share how amazing it is up here,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.060 position:98%
and relate to different groups of people and I relate to flute players.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.130 position:95%
And I just wanted them to understand what a cool place it was

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.140 position:98%
and how many possibilities there were to play music up here on the space station.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.390 position:98%
I'm not sure which flute you have there with you but you have a flute with you,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.380 position:97%
Why don't you tell us which one it is and I wonder if you would play us out with a song?

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.970 position:98%
Well I'm from Massachusetts and I brought my own flute, which was made by a really neat company in Massachusetts.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.420 position:80%
And the song I'm going to play is called "Bluenose"

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.860 position:97%
and it's by a Canadian guy named Stan Rogers, who writes a lot of things I love to play,

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.800 position:97%
and it's about an old sailing ship sailing the oceans, being away from home.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.810 position:97%
And that's the kind of perspective you can't help but have when you're up here looking down at the Earth

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.790 position:63%
and you think about the early explorers.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.920 position:98%
And here we are more recent explorers, but we all have some things in common,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.340 position:73%
and there are jobs we have to do far from home.

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.660 position:97%
So this is for John McBrine, who in our International Space Station branch in the astronaut office

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.220 position:94%
is the cornerstone of our branch, and it's his favorite song

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.710
Great.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:35.100

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.000 position:98%
Cady Coleman, a little flute music from space. Thank you so much.
