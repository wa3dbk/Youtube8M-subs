(Female narrator):
In the city of Brisbane, there is a great secret.

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:28.308
No, more than that, it’s a place with many secrets.

00:00:28.308 --> 00:00:34.003
Come with me and we’ll explore this place of secrets together.

00:00:35.775 --> 00:00:42.367
The Brisbane Botanic Gardens at Mt Coot-tha is our place of many secrets.

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:51.274
Walk with me, and look and listen as each secret tells you its tale.

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:55.900
Find a large, sandy-coloured sculpture.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.035
Can you see wondrous things carved into its surface?

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:03.166
It’s here that our journey begins. 

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:07.740
Walk quietly, use your senses. 

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:14.853
Walk quietly, use your senses. Can you see me? 

00:01:14.853 --> 00:01:24.369
I’m black and tiny. I’m very busy visiting flowers to collect nectar. My honey is rich and beautiful.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.907
Can you see me? The stingless native bee.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.435
Walk quietly, use your senses. Can you see me? Come along and be my lunch.

00:01:40.435 --> 00:01:48.702
Oh! Excuse me! I should say: join me for lunch. It’s lovely and cool in my pond. 

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:54.340

Bamboo is wonderful. You can make it into almost anything.

00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:13.569
My baby and I love to eat it. The soft, young shoots are so very tasty.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.165

00:02:24.906 --> 00:02:33.783

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:31.098
I’m not really crying but I am the home for many creatures. Can you find the babies in the nest? 

00:03:31.098 --> 00:03:34.616
I’m very proud of them. So is their mum.

How many rainforest birds can you count on me? Four of my friends have flown out of the forest.

00:04:17.837 --> 00:04:22.115
Walk right round me; I’m very beautiful.

00:04:22.115 --> 00:04:26.969

00:04:32.863 --> 00:04:40.371
Plants like me have lived since the time of the dinosaurs. I love wet, cool places.

You can make beautiful, rainforest music with me.

I like to sleep high in the tree branches. I get very tired from so much eating.

00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:08.789
I am waiting here to meet you under the shade of the Tallowood Tree. I would love you to see my joey. 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:12.303
He’s very handsome. He’s called Oliver.

00:05:17.793 --> 00:05:23.462
Walk quietly, use your senses. Can you see me?

00:05:23.462 --> 00:05:28.378
Logs in the forest are special places. They are my home.

00:05:28.378 --> 00:05:34.131
They keep me dry and lots of juicy bugs live there as well. Yum! 

00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:43.796
Can you see me? The Spotted Quoll. And, oh! Don’t forget my friend, the Bandicoot. 

00:05:43.796 --> 00:05:49.503

00:05:49.503 --> 00:05:54.384
Come and find us at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Mt Coot-tha.

There are more secret friends to find here.

00:05:57.374 --> 00:06:05.076
You may have to look a little harder though as they are quite shy.

00:06:07.576 --> 00:06:14.380
