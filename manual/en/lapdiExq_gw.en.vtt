00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.395
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.480
My name is Danine.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.790
And I study online at Southern
New Hampshire University.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.180
The moment I met my advisor
Anne over the phone,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.210
was really a turning point.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.860
I remember that she spent
over an hour with me

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.500
on the phone acclimating me too
distance learning in general.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.650
Originally I entered the school
as a justice studies major

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.390
based on my career, which was
20 years in law enforcement.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.724
But about a year
into that, I realized

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:43.140
that when I was going to finish
my law enforcement career,

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.910
I probably wanted to do
something completely different.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.130
I changed my major to English
language and literature.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.150
When I spoke with
my adviser Anne

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.860
about possibly changing
majors and going,

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.210
really, in a completely
different direction,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.910
she was an advocate.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.920
And she brought me
over to the path

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.110
that I have found
much more rewarding,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.170
and then stayed with
me to see how it goes.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.030
Sadly, I have never
met her face-to-face.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.870
I can't explain to you how huge
that is for a distance learner

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.810
to have a person that
they can connect to that

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.704
is 100% vested in your success.

00:01:28.704 --> 00:01:31.249
And if you could tell Anne
something, what would you

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.935
tell her?

00:01:31.935 --> 00:01:34.552
If I could tell-- oh, shut up!

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.950
Oh, I recognize you
from your picture.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.914
We match, look!

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:48.410
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.690
Thank you so much for coming.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.290
You see, this is what you get.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.950
This is what you get at SNHU.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.810
I'm blown away.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.800
I didn't know she was coming.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.350
It's been so much
more than just,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.770
what class do you want to take.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.770
It's been great,
it's been great.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.330
I would describe my
adviser Anne as someone

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.830
who is genuinely
interested in my success,

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.220
and who sees my
success as her success.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.360
See yourself
succeed at snhu.edu.
