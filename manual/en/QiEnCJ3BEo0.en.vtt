NARRATOR: And now, Sesame Street
Dinner Theater is proud

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.820
to present the musical tale of
a boy who thinks he doesn't

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.390
like a food until he gets
to know that food.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.160
We bring you, Veg Side Story.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:24.636
MOM: Tony, eat your veggies.

00:00:24.636 --> 00:00:27.990
TONY: I don't wanna, Ma!

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.710
DAD: But Tony, vegetables
are good for you.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.670
TONY: Come on, I don't even
know what this stuff is.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.520
MOM: It's zucchini, Tony.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.990
TONY: Zuchinni?

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.870
Yuck!

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.696
DAD: But Tony, you didn't
even try the zucchini!

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:44.608
MOM: For me, Tony!

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:48.190
Just take one little
bite of zucchini!

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.390
TONY: All right, all right.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.370
I'll take one teeny
bite of zucchini.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:00:59.685
TONY: [SINGING]

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:07.950
Zucchini, the most beautiful
food I ever ate.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.390
Zucchini, zucchini, zucchini,
zucchini, zucchini, the most

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.450
beautiful food in the world,
and it sure tastes great.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.210
Zucchini, zucchini, zucchini,
zucchini, zucchini.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.630
I just tried a veg
named zucchini.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.180
It was green and it did
grow, it sprouted

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.850
from below the ground.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.090
Zucchini, I just ate a
veg named zucchini.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.840
I had it with my lunch, it made
a lovely crunchy sound.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.112
Zucchini, try it once, the
taste is beguiling.

00:01:50.112 --> 00:01:55.280
Try it twice, and your mouth
will be smiling.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.454
Zucchini, I'll never stop
eating zucchini.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.665
The most beautiful
food I ever ate.

00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:10.805
Zucchini.

00:02:20.034 --> 00:02:20.533
MOM: Well?

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:23.960
What do you think, Tony?

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.460
TONY: It was cool, Ma!

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.710
Real cool!
