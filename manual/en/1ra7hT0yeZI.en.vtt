00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.840
-Hi, Eugenie. How are you?
-Good!

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.480
-Where to?
-To my hotel, please.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.800
Why did you start tennis?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.520
It was 15 years ago, I was 5 years old.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.960
My mum put me in these groups,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.400
it was like once a week
and we mostly played games.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.840
All the normal kids thought it was fun
and I was like

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.320
"No, I want to play more",
so my parents realised I really wanted to play.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.720
I played my first tournament when I was 8 years old!

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.480
How do you imagine tennis in the future?

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.880
The court will be electronic
and so when the ball bounces out,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.800
it will correct 100% of the time.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.920
How do you imagine tennis clothes in the future?

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.720
Some amazing clothes, when you sweat, it just...

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.120
-Controls the sweat.
-Exactly!

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.400
-I sweat a lot...
-So do I!

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.400
My voice is like a cat that's been strangled,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.480
and fell in a river and is also drowning.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.960
We're going to pick up a good friend of mine
who's a DJ and is working

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.760
on the original soundtrack
of "Road to Roland Garros".

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.400
-Adriano.
-Eugenie.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.760
I heard you're not a good singer...

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.720
Horrible! I just explained to him how badly I sing.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.760
-Whatever you guys want me to do, I'm ready...
-Whatever?

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000
It's not even on correctly.
Come on, guys!

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.800
Can you put some effect?

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.400
Sounds like a car crash!

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.840
You made me sound worse there!
I wasn't that bad!

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.800
It's just to show you
how good you are without effect!

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.960
What I do every time at the end

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.880
-is a little selfie...
-I'm the master of selfies!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.960
You need to lean back!
