00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.630
Well, we're kind of caught off guard by the
the amount of success Chuck Knows Church

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.579
has received.

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:30.199
We did fourteen of these. Fourteen
episodes as we call them and we thought we'd

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:31.009
be done

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.140
uh... With the first video we went from
literally a week from two thousand views

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.780
to eighty five hundred views and that didn't
include people downloading off the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.180
website and putting it on their own
websites and putting it and showing it

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.370
to their churches. [camera operator] Chuck are you good?..

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.410
roll

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.540
Scene five take one [clap]

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.980
So, in a very short amount of time it has
grown to receive an audience that

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.670
really loves Chuck

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.160
that's pretty cool.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.260
[Chuck voice] so I'm in church the other day

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.299
and I meet this ordained elder

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.450
right, who introduces me to uh... yes
uh... hair

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.600
[behind camera] Hey Chuck [chuck] Do I talk to you or the camera [behind camera] To me

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.529
[Chuck] I'm used to talking to the camera.

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:15.710
everybody is in the camera

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.800
but you are over here.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.450
I feel like they are all staring at me now

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.820
[behind camera] Hey so what is Chuck Knows Church

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.940
what's the point and why is it important or fun

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.090
[Chuck] Here's the deal, I think Chuck Knows Church
is important 
important because

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.420
uh... whether someone has bee in the church
for a long time or brand new to the church

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.030
or the brand new to the church

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.930
I think there's a lot of unanswered
questions about

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.460
more common things you know, I think
when we look for spiritual answers we

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.220
have a resource

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.470
you know we have our resource we have
our bible we have our leadership that

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.190
kinda

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.370
uh... take us through that but uh...

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.930
when it comes to you know more

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.100
elemental things like the difference
between the pulpit and a lectern

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.380
the stuff that we may be afraid to
ask

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.250
uh, now you don't have to.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.420
cause we are just giving it to you.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.540
and so I think that works for people
coming to church or a little afraid or

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.570
little overwhelmed but also people who
have been here forever

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.680
and might be embarrassed

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.890
to admit that even though they've grown
up in the church they don't really know

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.979
what the sacristy is or something..

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.260
Scene two take four

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.049
how many takes is this?

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.009
It's been five, it'll be five takes, we're all waiting

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:27.400
because Chuck keeps on sitting on his microphone

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.729
he always blames everybody else

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:33.939
but it's actually him.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.859
We've realized if we have fun with this

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.889
if we introduce people to these subjects
in these terms

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.620
and what you do in church in a way
that

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.439
informs them but makes them smile

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:45.739
gives them a chuckle

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.699
uh... they learn even more

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.680
and that's a beautiful thing it's fun

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.779
your know church can be fun

00:02:52.779 --> 00:02:59.699
a lot of the gospels based on irony I'm
not totally in love with the angle

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:01.799
of the chin'nel region

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.529
my chin doesn't look like that, normally has a lot of

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.409
the depth

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.589
and separation

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:11.099
the fact that Jesus was born in a stable

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.599
the fact that he called Jesus Lord

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.369
and yet he washes the disciples feet

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.109
that's iron

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.029
and we pick up on that fact

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:22.529
that basis of comedy

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:26.819
uh... irony throughout the gospel we
pick up on that

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.319
and use it in Chuck Knows Church

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.739
so yeah we end every episode with
"tell 'em Chuck sent you" or "tell them.."

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.229
be sure to ask your pastor..

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.979
not tell him

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:38.879
tell 'em

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.059
and and we do that to kinda take the
pressure off I think uh... for anybody

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:48.660
you might want to talk to their leadership about it
you know they can say Chuck sent me

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.550
whether or not the leadership actually
knows who I am

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.429
what we are

00:03:53.429 --> 00:03:56.869
uh... it still gets them in the door
and if they don't know that they can go

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:57.640
well

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.259
he's on these videos, let me show you, then suddenly
innocently

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.189
people in leadership of the church uh...

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:04.939
are more comfortable with

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.299
Chuck as well

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:11.369
uh... right now right behind me uh...
we are set up to do fourteen more episodes

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:13.859
we are actually on the third day

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.280
We are a machine. We have no money to do
these things uh... relatively no money

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.410
so we are doing them on an absolute shoestring and I think they're filling a need

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.200
and it's been a lot of fun

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.099
to see the success

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.130
of this small but mighty little effort
this ministry

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.520
called Chuck Knows Church
