Would you like to start learning the woodworking

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:11.389
craft?

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.389
It's not exactly easy, at least not if you
want to become good at what you're doing,

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.769
but it's fun and it's worth all the effort
for sure.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.140
You will need some guidance though and you
can get it on the net if you want to make

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.140
it as easy as possible for yourself.

The net is filled with all kinds of information

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.990
as you probably know already and you will
be able to read as much as you want about

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.990
woodworking there.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.340
You will also be able to find as many DIY
woodworking plans as you might need online.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.940
It's always of big importance to check the
accuracy though since there are a few plans

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:33.940
out there which shouldn't be there at all.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.400
You should only use easy and accurate DIY
woodworking plans in the beginning since that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.230
will make it a lot easier for you to succeed
and that will make the woodworking craft a

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.720
lot more fun as you'll soon discover.

You can always subscribe with a woodworking

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.700
magazine if you want to try another alternative.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.111
The DIY woodworking plans that can be found
in magazines are mostly accurate and easy

00:00:57.111 --> 00:01:02.280
to follow and you will most likely get great
results if you stick to the plan.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.900
The cons with magazines is the price.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.210
You will have to pay more to get DIY woodworking
plans from a magazine than if you search on

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.210
the net.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.979
It's a lot easier to use the net but you need
to keep your eyes open and look with a critical

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.510
eye before you start following a plan.

One thing to keep in mind in the beginning

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.990
is that it's good to start with simple DIY
woodworking plans where you can use hand tools

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.990
to complete the project.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.990
You need to learn how to handle hand tools
before you start using heavier tools.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.990
It's very important for your safety that you
learn much about the woodworking craft before

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.990
you start using heavier tools.

Take a look online and see what you can find

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.990
out there.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.400
You will probably be able to find a good online
guide for woodworking rookies and the same

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.606
site might offer you some quality hand tools
as well.

00:01:30.606 --> 00:01:31.700
Some knowledge and good hand tools is all
you need to start.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.560
You will be able to create your own furniture
within a few years if you start practice right

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560
away.
