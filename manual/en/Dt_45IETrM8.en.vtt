00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.520
Hello Kevin!

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:12.160
How are you?

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.040
Fine.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.240
Where do you want to go?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.120
Roland Garros, please.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.920
Hi Kevin!

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.440
Kevin?

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.440
- Hello?
- Oh hi! How are you?

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.400
How are you?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.120
Good thanks! I wasn't sure

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.680
where that was coming from!

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.440
It's the car!

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.600
Have you ever met

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.880
a talking car before?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.640
… semi-talking, but not

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.640
as eloquent as you are.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.640
Oh thank you!

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.120
That's really nice.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.600
Kevin, you're 6'8,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.760
- Right?
- Yep.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.120
What's the hardest thing

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.800
about being a tall guy?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.080
I'll definitely have to say

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.880
travelling in planes,

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.920
coming over to Europe, I think

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.760
I managed to get 20' of sleep over an 8 hour flight…

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.360
That part's tough.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.440
And in terms of beds and hotels, I mean

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.640
I'm pretty used to it.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.320
And now we're in my car!

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.200
Are you comfortable?

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.040
Very, thank you.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.960
Is there room for your legs?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.080
- There is.
- Great.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.080
What is the best thing

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.320
about being tall?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.200
I get a good view

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.080
at concerts,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.040
and tennis wise I think

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.360
it helps a lot with my game.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.960
But anyway I don't really feel as I'm as tall as 6'8

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.080
- I feel like…
- I feel like you're normal!

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.080
Yeah I think I'm more normal,

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.440
but then I see myself in pictures and stuff,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.120
- and realize that… I'm tall.
- OK, maybe I'm tall.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.400
Did you ever hurt anybody

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.240
with your big serve?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.560
No… No I haven't.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.960
Actually that's not true!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.400
In Memphis this year,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.800
I was playing Sam Groth

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.240
and he was standing up,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.040
I missed the ball a little long,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.120
and the ball skidded

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.520
and hit him… Where most men

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.640
don't like to be hit.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.800
He was down for maybe 15 or 20 minutes.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.040
I still feel bad about that,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.680
we joke about it when I see him,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.160
that was a pretty funny incident.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.400
I suppose you sent him flowers?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.240
Exactly…

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.760
Guys, here we are.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.640
Kevin,

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.880
Could I just ask you to give me a hug?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.240
… Sure.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.240
Thanks for the ride!

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520
Oh thank you, it's been a pleasure to meet you.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.200
You too.
