VW 2.0T TSI Spark Plug DIY (How To)

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.450
Today, in Auto Parts, were going to be
replacing spark plugs at 2.0 TSI engine on

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.690
this particular model -2013 CC, and most current
2.0 TSI engine to service in a row recommended

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.349
by Volkswagen is 60,000 miles. We recommend,
as history has always been, 40,000 miles for

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.900
replacing spark plugs that it is a replacement
or at least checked or cleaned to make sure

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.050
that they are all in good shape.
For the DIY, were going to be using rare

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.510
few tools 3-inch Ratchet, 10-inch extension
and a 5/8ths spark plug socket which is going

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.039
to be used for most Volkswagen and Audi engines.
On this 2.0T Engine, were going to replace

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:58.039
spark plugs with NGK BKR7EIX plugs. We found
it to be the most economical choice and they

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.969
do come pre gapped, ready for installation.
Once we go through our install, we start much

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.470
like our Coil video if you'd seen that.
You just remove the engine cover by just pulling

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:15.470
up at each corner and move this to the side.
We then go through and remove the harness

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.640
from each coil and push that out of the way.
We can then go through and remove each ignition

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.630
coil. Now, were ready to remove the spark
plugs. We can go ahead through with our ratchet

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.890
and go into the cylinder, and loosen its spark
plugs. This particular plug has around 30

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.090
to 4,000 miles on it. You can take a look
if it is a little bit warm. Now, we can go

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.960
through and remove the other ones. Now, weve
removed all the spark plugs.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.200
As mentioned earlier, were going to be
replacing our original spark plugs with this

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.870
BKR7EIX plugs. Here, you can see a comparison
versus a brand new BKR7EIX plugs and the original

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.870
NGK version of the Volkswagen plug. Theyre
obviously is somewhere on your electro here.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.720
We also offer the Volkswagen version, if youre
also interested in those, as well as the Basher

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.720
for 2.0T Engine. We, generally prefer, recommend
engine NGK plug because its the most economical

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.510
choice, but if you have a preference, there
isn't really going to be a major differences

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.790
between the NGK version and the Volkswagen
version and the Bosch version. Theyre all

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.100
going to be really similar. It really boils
down to preference.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.960
So, when were going to be installing these
spark plugs on this engine? They're already

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.750
are pre-gapped as we talked about that before,
even installing your spark plugs socket, and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.600
pop it in place. When you have these spark
plugs socket, they have a rubber piece inside

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.500
that retains the spark plug so you can turn
it upside down and it doesn't fall out.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.100
When installing this in our engine, you set
them in place and you kind of throw them in

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:05.100
by hand and wait for them to bottom out. Now,
were going to go ahead tighten down all

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.230
our spark plugs. As mentioned in the NGK box,
you tighten them down by hand and then you

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.070
go half to 2/3 of the turn. The intention
of this is just to crush the crush washer

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:38.070
at the end of the spark plugs. Just keep in
mind, we don't wanna go crazy tightening

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.680
these we really don't wanna do any damage
at the engine; just enough to where youre

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.680
getting the spark plug all in and tight. Once
were done tightening down all these spark

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:12.010
plugs, we can now re-install all the ignition
coils. You wanna make sure that they're

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.710
all the way seated down; otherwise, you could
have some misfire issues. Reinstall all the

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:35.810
spark plug connectors get them all kinda
lined up, and start tightening them. Get them

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.340
snapped on. Make sure you hear them locked
in place. We can put our engine cover back

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:51.340
on and just pop down at each corner and we're
all set.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.520
That's how we install NGK BKR7EIX spark
plugs on a 2.0T TSI engine.
