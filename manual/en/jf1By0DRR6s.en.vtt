As we continue the SUN OVEN Cooking Essentials
series, we're going to talk

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.920
about making hard boiled eggs without water
in the SUN OVEN.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.679
The amazing
thing about making hard boiled eggs in a SUN

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.660
OVEN is no water is required.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.050
When you think about how you boil an egg.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.610
You take an egg, you bring water
to a boiling temperature.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.210
You place the egg inside a pot of hot water
that

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.300
has the even heat of the hot water all the
way around the egg shell.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.829
Well,
on a SUN OVEN, the entire chamber is even

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.670
and it has a completely even
heat.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.309
So consequently when we make hard boiled eggs
in it we don't even

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.710
need to use water.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.559
I've had the opportunity to teach how to cook
in the SUN OVEN on five

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:57.559
different continents.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.400
When I'm in a developing country and trying
to get

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.439
women to understand how to use the SUN OVEN
with the even heat, one of the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.259
first things I'll do is have someone bring
me an egg and I'll just take an

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.659
egg and I'll set it on the shelf of the SUN
OVEN.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.420
If I've preheated the SUN
OVEN, I put the egg in for about 35 to 40

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.420
minutes.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.600
I have a perfect
hardboiled egg.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.870
But you don't have to do them one at a time.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.520
When you do a larger number of
eggs in the SUN OVEN, it's best to use a cardboard

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.640
egg carton.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.320
You can hard
boil them without water by putting them in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.510
a pot, but then anywhere the
eggs touch each other you're going to get

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.999
a little brown spot.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.530
So what I
did here is took some cardboard egg cartons

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.289
and I just took a knife and cut
the lids off of them.

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.719
When I put this in the SUN OVEN the eggs will
boil

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:43.140
without having any water in them.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.210
The nice thing about it is that the many people
who raise their own

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.859
chickens or get freshly-laid eggs know that
it's very difficult to peel a

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.530
hardboiled egg that's been freshly laid.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.479
The wonderful thing about cooking
in the SUN OVEN, doing hard boiled eggs in

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.749
the SUN OVEN without the water
is that the membrane that on a freshly-laid

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.020
egg builds up between the
eggshell and the egg white completely disappears

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.650
when it's hard boiled in
the SUN OVEN.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.300
So it's very easy to peel.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.630
So there are advantages particularly with
freshly-laid eggs to doing them

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.630
in the SUN OVEN.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.930
But the leveling tray will accommodate two
dozen eggs.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.270
I've preheated the oven.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.610
It's a late September day.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.710
It's partly cloudy.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.510
So
today we don't have full sun.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.000
I think the maximum temperature we're
probably going to reach today is probably

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.010
between 290 and 300 degrees
Fahrenheit.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.010
But we can cook the eggs.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.450
Normally I can cook two dozen eggs in about
an hour and ten minutes.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.049
Today
I suspect with the lower temperature it's

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.180
going to take approximately an
hour and a half.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.640
So all I did was cut the lids off the egg
carton.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.189
Now I'll
open the preheated SUN OVEN and I will put

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:54.019
the eggs in.

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.590
Sometimes you've
got to balance them a little bit while you're

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.150
getting them in.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:07.690
So now the
two dozen eggs are there.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.680
We'll shut the door here.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.840
We'll set this in the
sun.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.510
We'll come back in probably an hour and a
half or so, and see how the

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.129
sun is doing.

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:22.470
Well, it's been about an hour and a half.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.550
The sun is kind of playing hide
and seek today, so it's been coming and going.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.530
But let's take a look and
see how the eggs are doing.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.680
It's hard to tell by looking at an egg whether
it's hard boiled or not.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.439
But what you can do is, we're going to open
this

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:39.799
up and we're just going to take one of the
eggs out of the oven, using a

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.030
hot pad here because it is pretty warm.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.500
Then, the way you can tell if an egg is done
is, if you just set it on a

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.400
flat surface like this table, and you spin
it, see, it spins nicely.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.510
It's
not wobbling around, which means that this

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.560
egg is done.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.950
So, then we can
take the rest out and they'll be ready to

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.560
eat.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.620
Well, let's see how the egg came out.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:26.120
Look at that, we have a perfect
hardboiled egg with absolutely no water.
