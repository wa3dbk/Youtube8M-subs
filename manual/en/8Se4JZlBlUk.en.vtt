00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:11.002
In last week's Wigan v Liverpool game we heard the 
 frankly astonishing news that Stewart Downing had scored.

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:17.535
With a header! What next, Emmanuel Adebayor with a 
 lung bursting run in the 90th minute?

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:22.461
What's the most unexpected thing you've ever heard or seen on a football pitch? Omid?

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:32.579
Well, err, for me the most extraordinary thing was I remember Terry Venables became manager of Australia and there was a World Cup play off, actually with my country, Iran.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:43.072
and it was a two leg play off I think at the Azardi stadium in Tehran. It was 1-1 and in the first half I think Kewell got a goal, I think Viduka got a goal, I think it was two-nil.

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:50.441
and with about 15 minutes to go there was a famous guy 
 in Australia, he was a nutcase who parachutes into events.

00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:52.900
he parachuted into Vegas in a boxing match

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:02.310
he parachuted into the stadium, during the game. With 15 minutes to go he comes in, and the crowd's cheering, and he lands in the Australian goal and gets caught up in the nets

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.881
so it takes about 5 minutes to cut him out 

00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.280
so everyone's laughing, Venables is laughing, the Australian players are having a drink

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.665
and if you look over everyone starts laughing at the 
 Iranian team because they've got into a huddle

00:01:12.665 --> 00:01:17.915
and they start doing Muslim prayers. They're going down like 
 this - the whole team and they're really galvanized

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:21.215
and they come up and of course they've got to get 
 2 goals to go through on the away goals

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:29.350
and they score 2 goals and they go through. I think they're trying to kill 
 the parachutist because he was the one who didn't just distract the game but

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.983
gave that kind of Muslim spiritual power to the Iranian team

00:01:32.983 --> 00:01:38.187
who prayed solidly for 5 minutes, scored the two goals 
 and went through to the 1998 World Cup finals.

00:01:38.187 --> 00:01:41.710
Did they think he was some kind of message from heaven

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.320
They thought he was sent by Mohammed, they actually thought that. 
 It wasn't a comedy they go this is a sign.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.200
That is quite an unexpected thing to see

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:52.280
And then in the papers they said the 
 whole of Australia was laughing at us

00:01:52.277 --> 00:01:55.360
and they came through and scored two goals

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.960
and of course they went through to the World Cup and they played  America and they beat America and they thought there was some kind of spiritual power

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.810
I remember the game against America, I was in Golders 
 Green high street that evening, getting a bagel

00:02:04.808 --> 00:02:09.160
and after, sorry, this is one of the 
 most Jewish stories you will ever hear

00:02:09.162 --> 00:02:14.960
and erm, err, after the game loads of Iranians came down in limousines 

00:02:14.963 --> 00:02:18.120
waving Iranian flags - let's go and wind up the Jews

00:02:18.123 --> 00:02:20.880
that was their Filipino servants waving the flags actually
