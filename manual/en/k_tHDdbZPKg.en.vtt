-Hey, What are you doing ?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:24.820
-I'm going to play football.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.280
-No no no! You have homework to do.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.280

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.330
I never did that ?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420
Yes you did, you attented a special needs class.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.520
But I don't understand anything at mathematics !

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.700
Michel drove from Caen to Saint Etienne on an average speed of 120 km/h and arrived at 6 p.m.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.660
What time did Michel leave knowing that he stopped for an hour ?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.809
Hum, yes it's easy

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.869
You takes the... -And did they say why is he going to Saint-Etienne ?

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.660
So, from there to Caen, there's 300 kms and the guy stops for an hour

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.340
Yeah, maybe he bought a sandwich... But no.... But yes ....

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.770

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.650
Yes, I do, yes, yes, it's just the man, he drives, he starts from here and he..Let's do some Biology.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.520
Hermaphrodite means that snails are in love with girls and boys

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.720
I don't understand...

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.580
They are bisexuals !

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.600
No, there aren't. Gosh, he is 11 !

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.900
Yes, he's 11 but... look at what we can see in his biology's books

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.790
Did you see, we can see all of the things...

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.110
And ?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.860
Yes..yes...I I'm going to the bathroom..

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.760
What is he doing ?

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.820
Well, what he's doing is that I'm going to buy you a new Biology book. For god sake it's a sea urchin's sex

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.620
You don't understand ?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.620

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.410

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.780
It was to please grandma..

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.730
Well, that's exactly what I'm saying it's a dead language

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.180

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.410
It was to please grandpa'.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.440
He pisses us ofd until the end that one.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.420
Let's do history !

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.740
What are you learning in History?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.820

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.980
(Laughs), it was too please grandad too

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.020
Michel drives at 120 km/h...FUCK IT'S NOT THAT HARD !

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.480
We still don't know why he is leaving from Caen though...

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.540
(plays the flute)

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.420
You sure?

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.780
But it's not a bank !

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.500
-GDP is a bank.... - But it's not a bank... -Well GDP Paribas [he's misunderstanding with BNP paribas, a french bank]

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.560
Do you remember when you would get in the bus and everyone was doing "Yeaaaaaah the CES"? Well everyone was making fun of you.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.080
Michel drives from Caen... - Don't read this again..

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880
-Well, there we go, physics, I like that, I know that !

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.800
All the thing with "derivation" I know that very well.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:36.040
So wait "in a derivation serie Michel plugs in.." -Fuck, He's called Michel too -I swear to you if I find him, I'm making him a balls piercing with the binder ring's, Clac, Clac !

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.360
-And the present subjonctive ?
-That I know. [sound like suck]

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.680
No, "That I knew" this was the imparfait of the subjonctive.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.280
What's the matter ?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.860
-He said "suck"

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.500
I understand..

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.300
-Michel drive at 120 kilometer/h..

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.580
Fortunately they don't ask how much he paid...

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.560
B) How much did he paid ?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.140
RHHHHHHAAAA, but it's in franc ! (old french money)

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.600
Hey, in the phone book, I found 79 Michels who live near by, if you want tonight we can all fuck them !

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.780
No wait, it was a joke !

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.260
But we don't even know who is that Michel !

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.540
Excuse me ? Are you in charge of the program ?

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.680
-Euh, no.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.900
-'Cause it's fucking difficult ! -And know we can't do shots ! -We lose all of our credibility in front of our children !

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.100
We don't even know at what time did Michel left !

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.700
Because they said that he drives at 120 miles/h, OK ! But maybe he took the departmental roads !

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.440
I hope that he drive french at least ! -Exactly !

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.960
-Come one Daddys, we're gonna kick the face  of the math teacher !

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.220
-I'm sure he's called Michel.
