00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.319
Alyssia: Why am I in this kitchen?

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:03.560
Who could this empty chair be for?

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.080
Olivia: I’ll tell you why, because she is
in my kitchen.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.550
It’s Blog Health Fitness.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.930
Today we are going to be doing a collaboration
which we have decided to call the Super Food

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.150
Snack Challenge.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.460
Alyssia: #We created a new challenge, the
#Super Food Snack Challenge that you should

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.690
try for yourself.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.880
Where we are going to taste test these snacks
and ingredients from the health food store.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.869
We’ve picked out some for each other, we’re
going to try them together and we’re going

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.190
to tell you what we think.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.740
Olivia: I hope they’re good.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.910
Alyssia: I also hope that.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.840
Be sure to check out the rest of it on her
channel, go and subscribe.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.840
Olivia: Right here.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.840
Right here.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.280
Alyssia: Love health fitness.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.950
So my first contribution is dates in oat flour
and I got these in that little section with

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.190
the dispenser bins.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.170
I don’t know why the dates are covered in
oat flour but I thought it was interesting

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.579
and I thought I should make Olivia try it.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.250
We actually decided that it would be unfair
if one of us brought all the gross things

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.700
to try so we both have to try it.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.330
But dates, if you don’t already know have
a lot of fiber, they are very sweet and they

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.000
have a lot of brain and heart health.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Go ahead dig in Olivia.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.650
Olivia: I don’t know why this is covered
in oat flour

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.030
Alyssia: In oat flour, I know, cheers to us.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.720
Olivia: This kind of looks like, I don’t
know like a bugger, like a giant…

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.320
Alyssia: Ew like now, I don’t want…let
me just pull it out.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
To us.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.670
Olivia: Ok cheers.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.840
Alyssia: Cheers.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.610
Olivia: It’s good

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.700
Alyssia: It tastes like a date covered in
oat flour.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.350
Olivia: I don’t understand like why they
need to put it in oat flour.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.110
Alyssia: If you know why they make dates covered
in oat flour premade, comment below and let

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.590
us know because I have no idea.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.750
Olivia: It’s not bad but it’s not a great
date either.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.630
Alyssia: The super food rating for the dates
with oat flour…alright.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.400
Olivia: Alright.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.090
Alyssia: Olivia’s first contribution…

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.310
Olivia: Ok so I have finger limes.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.420
Yeah I don’t know what the heck these are
so we are going to try them.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.180
They probably have a lot of vitamin C, I would
assume, they’re probably really good for

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.250
detoxification as well as digestion.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.579
Alyssia: They look like pickles.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.409
Olivia: They do, they look like pickles but
they are limes.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:21.409
Alyssia: Cheers.

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:22.409
Olivia: Cheers.

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:26.720
Alyssia: Oh my God ew ew, it tastes like Quinoa
inside.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.249
Olivia: It’s actually pretty sweet.

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:29.819
Alyssia: It tastes just like a lime.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:30.819
It tastes like a lime.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.499
Olivia: Like I think it is almost sweeter
than a lime

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:36.159
Alyssia: Tastes like a lime but it kind of
bursts in your mouth

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.233
Olivia: Yeah I don’t know that maybe we…

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:42.209
Alyssia: I don’t know how fun it would be
to eat but maybe like put it in a smoothie

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.209
or something.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.209
Olivia: I kind of like it.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.909
Alyssia: Alright let’s give our super food
rating, one, two, three, meh.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.230
Olivia: Super

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.650
Alyssia: I still keep eating it though, so
alright let’s move on.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.970
My next contribution is raw cacao nibs.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.549
These are still in the pulp, which I’ve
never seen but I thought that would be a good

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.549
reason to try it.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.599
Now usually they peal off the pulp so cacao
is great for, you know, anti-oxidants, flavonoids.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.700
It comes from a tree and it makes chocolate
so it must be a vegetable.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.700
Olivia: Doesn’t smell very good.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:16.700
Alyssia: No it doesn’t.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.249
Olivia: Kind of like looks like a cocoon.

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.449
Like there is going to be a bug in it.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:26.449
Alyssia: What does it smell like?

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:27.449
Poop.

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:28.449
Olivia: It really does.

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:29.449
Oh so you can open it.

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:30.449
Well I’ve had cacao before us, so this just
looks like the cacao...

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:31.909
Alyssia: Yeah but it has the…I’ve never
had it with the pulp on it.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.319
Olivia: I don’t…do you think we should
eat the pulp?

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.640
Alyssia: I’m not…I’m trying to peel
the pulp off and it’s not coming so I think

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.689
it’s going to have to be eaten.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:42.459
One, two, three.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.609
Olivia: It gets like weirder as you go.

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.769
Alyssia: And then you keep going.

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.159
Olivia: The pulp is really gross, like I’ve
had cacao nibs before but the pulp in this…

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.780
Alyssia: Let me just try the cacao

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.129
Olivia: Is really gross.

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:53.610
Alyssia: It does not taste like chocolate.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.549
Olivia: That’s why I always don’t understand,
it’s like…

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.900
Alyssia: How do they make this taste like
chocolate?

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.069
Olivia: Yeah, how do you like you must have
to like put tons of sugar in it or something

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.700
because it doesn’t taste like chocolate,
it really doesn’t.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.790
Alyssia: It doesn’t taste good.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.169
Olivia: Or when people like sprinkle it on
top of like you know their breakfast, then

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.890
they’re like yeah it’s all chocolatey,
and you’re like…

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.589
Alyssia: One, two, three, worse than meh.

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:14.589
Olivia: Meh.

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:15.589
Olivia: Ok, yeah, yeah

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:16.589
Alyssia: It was…

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.589
Olivia: Yeah.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.589
Alyssia: It was bad

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:19.589
Olivia: That was pretty bad.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.900
Alyssia: That was…I mean I give the limes
a meh and this was definitely worse so.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.900
Olivia: Yeah, don’t…

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.020
Alyssia: I’m actually going to throw the
whole bag away because they’re nasty.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.020
Olivia.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.979
Olivia: Okay so I brought some Kale crunch
chips

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:31.979
Alyssia: Mmmmm

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:36.530
Olivia: And these are the cheesy chipotle
flavor and I’ve heard really good things

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.280
about these when I’ve read reviews on them,
so you people better be ready, that’s all

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.280
I got to say.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.550
I, I think I like Kale chips usually so

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.479
Alyssia: How do they flavor it, what’s the
ingredient that’s flavoring it?

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:48.349
Olivia: Let’s see, red bell peppers…

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.840
Alyssia: Oh that’s clever.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.289
Olivia: Organic cashews, organic sesame seeds,
lemon juice, nutritional yeast, cheese, seeds,

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.520
smoked salt, coconut palm sugar, chipotle
paprika.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520
So wholesome ingredients.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.520
Alyssia: Yeah that’s great

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520
Olivia: Pretty awesome

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.520
Alyssia: It’s a good snack

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.520
Olivia: Yeah.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.520
Alyssia: Let’s try it.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.599
Olivia: I kind of really want to eat this.

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:05.080
Alyssia: Let’s do it.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.520
It’s like a chipotle chip.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.629
Olivia: Yeah, it really is.

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:08.669
Alyssia: I would eat these as a chip substitute.

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:09.669
Olivia: Definitely.

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:10.909
Alyssia: A chip sub or chub.

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.169
They are kind of spicy.

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.169
Olivia: They are.

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:14.169
I kind of like that.

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.240
Alyssia: But that cayenne’s going to give
us that extra metabolic boost.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.230
I like it.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.080
Alright, rating one, two, three, super.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.449
Olivia: Super

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:31.020
Alyssia: Dried mulberries are my final contribution
to this taste test

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.210
Olivia: I really like them, I’ve tried them
before but it’s been a while so.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.800
Alyssia: Yeah, what’s really interesting
about these is they have over half the sugar

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.850
of most dried fruits.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:44.889
So raisins and figs and all that are usually
like packed with sugar, I mean even if it

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.360
is natural it’s still a lot of sugar.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.030
So these have over half the sugar and they
have a lot of fiber and protein.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.639
One cup of these has like 12 grams of protein
or something which kind of seems crazy if

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.580
you think it might be gross but let’s find
out.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.580
Dried mulberries.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.940
Olivia: I think they always look like little
fluffy bugs, they’re squishy.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.129
Alyssia: And they taste just as sweet as a
raisin.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:07.129
Olivia: Yeah.

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.770
Alyssia: For over half the sugar I’m not
buying raisins anymore, I’m using these.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.050
Olivia: I definitely like the texture of these
way better than raisins.

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.979
Alyssia: Me too, am not a huge raisin fan.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.050
Olivia: No I feel like bugger…

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.199
Alyssia: they’re kind of like turd, turdy.

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:19.199
Olivia: Bugger.

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:20.199
Alyssia: Buggery, well…

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.009
Olivia: Oh my God this one has a little tail,
that’s kind of gross.

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:24.659
It like pulling out the…

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:26.060
Alyssia: You can eat that one.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.900
Alright these are pretty good.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.220
Alright ultimate rating, super.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.229
Olivia: Super.

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:38.530
Alyssia: Alright so there you have it our
Super Food Snack Challenge, we now nominate

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.830
you to try it out.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.110
Some of them were good, some of them not so
much but you’ve got to go to Olivia’s

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.069
channel to check out the rest and see what
other kind of goodies we tested out.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:50.960
Be sure to subscribe to her channel and mine
if you haven’t already.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.509
And give this video a big thumbs up if you
enjoyed it.

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:57.740
I’d say overall, I think this challenge
was super.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.539
Have a good day.

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:00.949
Olivia: Bye.
