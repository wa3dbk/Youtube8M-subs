00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.560
[typing]

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.280
You ever think back to games you played as a kid

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.060
and wonder "why the crap did I play that so much?"

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:13.440
Super Solvers Spellbound!
is one of those games for me,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.600
and I don't wonder that because
it's a bad game or anything,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.900
because it's certainly not.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.380
I wonder that because...

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.220
well, it's just freakin' spelling.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.920
You spell words.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.160
That's it!

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.960
Whatever the case may be, this
game was awesome to my young self.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.520
Maybe it had something to do with the fact

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.520
that you played an androgynous character

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.300
wearing nothing but a hat, hoodie and boxers.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.560
Or maybe it was because your
character rides a skateboard

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.400
that's not in the game whatsoever

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.360
and I subconsciously adored deceitful cover art.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.740
I dunno. But what I do know is that Spellbound

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.260
is either the fifth or the sixth game,
depending on who you ask,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.640
in The Learning Company's Super Solver Series,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.340
succeeding games like Midnight Rescue!,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.380
Out Numbered!,

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.080
and Treasure Mountain!

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.280
The game was originally
released for DOS PCs in 1991,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.440
with slightly upgraded
Windows and Macintosh versions

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.060
arriving in the years to come.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.720
Following in the footsteps of
previous Super Solvers games,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.580
Morty Maxwell, aka The Master of Mischief,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.240
is once again planning on taking over the world

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.200
by almost being a nuisance,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.040
this time entering the Shady Glen School Spelling Bee,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.380
along with his Paintbrush-inspired robotic minions.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.780
It's up to to leave him spellbound

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.440
by out-spelling him every step of the way.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.980
A silly setup that has absolutely no bearing

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.860
on what happens in the game, but hey!

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.980
It's meant for ages 7 to 12,
so what do you expect?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.100
Inside the box, you have a piece of blue foam,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
which is absolutely ideal for not quite

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.660
piquing the curiosity of your lazy cat.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.860
You also get a "read this first" paper

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.520
that nobody ever reads first,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.120
a set of low-density 5¼-inch and 3½-inch floppies

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.020
to please those who derive pleasure from disks

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.300
both big and small,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.420
a manual covering all the
expected manually manual things,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.080
and this Learning Company software catalog,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.600
showing what must have been one heck of a party.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.760
I mean it.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.960
These '90s kids are undoubtedly having way more fun

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.140
than should be allowed.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.640
Red-faced ginger kid here with
his mind sufficiently blown.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.560
Striped-shirt braces kid striking a
successful golfer fist-pump pose.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.420
And this random kid completely passed
out on the couch in the back of the room,

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.900
the insanity of Learning Company games

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.620
just too much for him to handle.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.420
Start the game up and you're
greeted with some music,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.540
and the game's colorful intro
screen showing off its use

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.200
of 256-color VGA graphics.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.500
Your Super Solvers character walks in

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.020
from...some...where...

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.800
and stops to read a message

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.700
about the Shady Glen Spelling Bee.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.260
Once you enter your name,
you're then given the option

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.860
to choose the word list that you
want to use throughout the game.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.900
There are quite a few already included in Spellbound,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.400
covering a variety of age-
appropriate words and subjects.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.660
However, there is also the option
to create your own word lists,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.660
which really opens the opportunity
for the game to get some more

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:06.840
targeted usage.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.480
Just be sure THESE words are spelled correctly,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.340
as that could get very confusing during gameplay.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.140
Then choose your difficulty,

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.460
which only affects how many
puzzles you have to solve

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.440
to reach a spelling bee and nothing more.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.340
Once you're finished,
one of the magic garden gnomes

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.140
from previous Super Solvers games

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.100
shows up with a fancy red Spellbinder,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.300
which is kind of a chunky PDA
that only does word puzzles.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.620
At this point, you can choose
one of three different activities,

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.840
each of which will reward you with points

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.580
toward a set goal to reach
the current spelling bee.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.540
There are five spelling bees,
or levels, throughout the game,

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.500
and the further along you are,
the tougher things get.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.820
The first activity is Word Search,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.800
which is exactly what it sounds like.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.920
It's a word search puzzle

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.400
comprised of a selection of
words from the list chosen earlier.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.840
At first, it's exactly what you would expect

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.340
where you'll find a word that's
placed pretty normally in the puzzle.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.200
Sometimes the words will be backwards,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.160
but otherwise it's not that big of a deal.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.240
Until you reach the later levels, that is,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.440
where the word will start
to be grouped in diagonal

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.480
and even totally irregular shapes.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.880
I really like these later-level word puzzles

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.880
because they require a
little out of the box thinking

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.040
that really appeals to my brain somehow.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.840
Next is Flash Card,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.740
which is pretty much the only activity where

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.020
you might not earn all possible points.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.740
You're presented with a set of flash cards

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.380
with the Master of Mischief
mischievously printed on them,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.880
lending some evidence to the theory that

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.560
he is in fact the one that
gave you this Spellbinder.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.940
But I'm not going into conspiracies, heh heh.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.960
Just press Space to be flashed with a word

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.900
and then type the word in correctly

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.860
from memory.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.800
Each time you're correct, you get some points,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.520
but if you miss one, then you
won't get the full point total.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.780
In later levels, you also get the
option to enter a bonus round

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.540
where the eight words that were
flashed earlier are then scrambled.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900
Descramble them, and spell them,

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.540
and earn extra points toward your grand total.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.640
Lastly, there's Criss Cross,

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.840
which is just a simple crossword puzzle.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.580
No gimmicks here, just enter
the words from the word list

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.460
in such a way that they cross
each other in a logical manner.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.720
If you fail, well, you really suck

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.960
because you can't fail.
It's just trial and error.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.200
Once your score reaches or passes the target score,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.560
the spelling bee for the level will be unlocked.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.680
And if you have a sound card
that plays digitized sounds,

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.860
you'll hear an off-screen spelling bee host

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.300
introduce the contestants,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.120
accompanied by a short little
musical ditty for each one.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.120

[MIDI rock music plays]

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.100
It's worth noting that is
the only point in the game

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.560
where any kind of actual
sound effects are heard,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.560
and that's the digitized speech.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.880
While there are sound effects
in other parts of the game,

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.880
all are done through MIDI instruments,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.700
not unique effects files,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.800
so things will sound quite different,
depending on the hardware you have.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.260
Anyway, the spelling bees are just like

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.300
the flash card activity from earlier,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.700
except now you have to outlast the others.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.220
Once you do that, you're then
rewarded with a podium scene

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.100
and are moved onto the
next spelling bee location

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.320
where you have to do
everything all over again.

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.060
It follows a pretty logical
path of spelling bees,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.300
from classroom to school-wide,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.420
to citywide and statewide.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.680
All the way up to nationwide
on the freakin' White House lawn.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.400
Eventually, you'll reach the final
battle against Morty Maxwell,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.820
who lasts a few words longer
than the previous robots.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.420
He'll eventually screw up, though.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.120
And hooray! You've won
the game and saved the world

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.360
from absolutely no threat whatsoever.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.800
And that's really about it for Spellbound.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.780
Just three activities and a spelling bee.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.760
Do it five times in a row,
with only slight variations each time,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.720
and there you go.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.660
Game over in about 15 to 30 minutes,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.720
depending on the difficulty chosen.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.580
Once again, I'm not really sure why
I played the game so much as a kid,

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.700
but...I did,

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.700
and I had other games I could have been playing,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.920
so it must have been doing something right.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920
Sure, it's incredibly repetitive and

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.540
really kind of stale, as far as gameplay goes.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:02.760
But it has bright graphics, cheerful music,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.960
some simple but effective animations,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.400
and I know for a fact it helped to fuel

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.840
my current sensitivity to proper spelling.

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.640
For a kid, it's fun

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.460
and teaches some valuable stuff,

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.460
so I see no real problem with it.

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.240
And, yes, with the word lists,

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.720
you can effectively exploit the entire game

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.420
by using words that are
almost impossible to get wrong,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:23.620
but that's beside the point.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:25.000
When it's used properly,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.100
Spellbound is an awesome little learning tool

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.200
and I still think it holds up quite well,

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.180
even to this day.
