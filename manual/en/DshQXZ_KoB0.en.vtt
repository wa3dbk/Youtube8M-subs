00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.450
Kakeru, you have to pass the crisis.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.550
Have you forgotten your dream that you said to me?

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:17.070
Luna, how I want to go with you to make sure
if there is really Moon Princess on the moon.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.940
It was this man that saved Luna.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.050
His name is Uchu Kakeru,
who longs for the space so deeply.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.630
However, his health...

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.990
Is there anything I can do for Kakeru?

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.280
I could understand everything that Kakeru has said to me.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.640
But as a cat, I just can't say anything to him,
or do anything for him.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.650
Luna...

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.120
If I am a human...

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.060
How I want to be a human girl!

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.720
Silver Crystal, I pray to you.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.900
Please let Luna become a Moon Princess with human body,
make Kakeru's dream becoming true.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.270
Ah, how glaring it is. What's the light?

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.620
Luna, open your eyes, and look at yourself.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.530
What? Who is this? Me? A human girl?

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.050
Yes. Go ahead.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.880
Tell Kakeru what you want to say to him personally.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.680
Kakeru, you have to live.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.190
Come to the space which you are dreaming for.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.700
I'll be wait for you on the moon.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.060
It's a date.
