00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.840
School time!

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.720
My skin is glossy type so I use the balm first.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.240
This is the thin, clear balm which is perfect for oil control

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.680
And effective pores cover

00:01:02.173 --> 00:01:04.413
Rub it evenly for a light , dry skin

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.980
May I introduce you a really cool and convenient product

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.360
This is the BB Foundation Lunch Box from Too cool for school

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.820
It contains concealer,highlight and BB Cream only in 1 product

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.140
The foundation is in jelly form

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.840
Thin, smooth , perfect cover and oil control

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.540
Apply it evenly all over your face just like this

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.380
Next, lift the lit, there’s a section for concealer.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.300
I use it for my dark circles

00:02:01.006 --> 00:02:03.926
The other part is the gentle pink highlight

00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:06.826
We only need a line on the nose brigde

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.440
This time I use orange blush cream so I use it right after the foundation and concealer

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.240
Mark 3 points and rub it evenly

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.940
Remember not to use too much cream otherwise you will look like a clown ^^

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.600
After that,I use Powder pact which is also from Too cool for school

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.840
But I usually call it “The Camera360 powder pact" because it’s extremely smooth and natural

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.480
Next apply thin eyebrowns

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.300
Everything has to stay light and delicate

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.460
Otherwise you won't be able to go to school

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.460
Rub the blush cream on the eyelids

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.280
so the eyes won't get pale

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.260
Rub it evenly and it feels like your own skin

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.880
Natural as Photoshop

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.520
I still use the eyeliner but unlike usual

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.580
I only use creamy waterproof eyeliner to draw closely to the eyelashes

00:03:47.778 --> 00:03:50.998
Make sure it's only a bit darker

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.820
Use red lipstick on the inner lips to increase our charm

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.420
Finish!

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.680
Fix your hair and clothes a bit and we're all done

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.360
Let's go to school!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.640
Hurry up or you will get detention
