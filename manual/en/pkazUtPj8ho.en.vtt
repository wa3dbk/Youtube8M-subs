00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:09.320
The Osprey Porter 65 travel duffel combines
weight hauling capability, nearly 4000 cubic

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.059
inches of storage capacity and the ability
to be carried in a variety of ways.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:23.000
Let’s take a closer look at the many features
of this versatile travel piece.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.199
The full dimensions of the Porter 65 are 26
inches long by 19 inches wide and 15 inches

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.199
deep.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.340
So it does exceed carry on size.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.880
This is a piece that you will be checking
at the air-port.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:46.610
So it has got very durable construction with
that in mind and it has got a nice, clean

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:55.630
protected profile so that it arrives at your
point of destination unharmed and still looking

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:56.630
great.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.110
So you have got really durable fabrics.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.080
You also have Osprey’s straight jacket compression.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:12.530
So it is a foam padded panel that obviously
locks in place and can be cinched down so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:19.470
that the full contents of the pack remain
secure, remain stable and in place exactly

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.130
how you packed the porter in the first place.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.880
So we will reopen those buckles and get those
compression wings out of the way and show

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.240
you how you can get into the interior of the
pack.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.500
There is a very large U shaped zipper here
on the front that gets you into that full

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.180
internal capacity of the main compartment.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.230
You also have a very sizable organizer pocket
here on the front of the pack.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.360
There is a floating pocket here that you could
certainly put a laptop or electronics in there

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.990
if you are taking that item or items like
that on your trip.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.990
Got all kinds of other organizational pockets
here, so all the little things you may want

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.020
to take on a trip, be it a business trip or
just a vacation.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.640
You have got all that organization built right
into the pack.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.070
You have also got a long, deep zippered pocket
on the outside face of the pack, so just another

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.050
place to keep documents or things a little
closer at hand that you may want to get to

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.200
in the airport or as soon as you have reclaimed
the porter from the luggage carousel.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.870
A couple of other pockets to touch on here.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.370
There is another large zippered pocket here
on top.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.770
It could definitely be a place where I might
have toiletries or some things that, again,

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.349
I want to retrieve rather quickly.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.660
There is a separate zippered pocket here at
the bottom of the pack.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.950
Nice place to keep separate from the rest
of the pack, dirty clothes, wet clothes.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.670
In this case I have got two pairs of shoes
in here.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.680
Again, you are going on your trip.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.860
There may be any number of different activities
that you are engaging in when you go there.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.470
So if it turns out you want more than a couple
of pair of shoes, but you really don’t want

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.850
those in with your clean clothes, so definitely
a feature I like built into the Porter.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.950
For added security the zippers do enable you
to use a lock.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.270
Osprey doesn't include that lock, but there
are certainly travel locks available.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.450
You can thread that through the two portions
of the zipper and better secure the two man

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.040
compartments of the Porter 65.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.410
Where I think the versatility really shines
on the Porter 65 is the ways in which you

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.410
can carry it.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.160
You have got very rugged, very durable haul
handles built into this pack.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.290
So whether you are hauling it this way, whether
you are carrying it here on the side or whether

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:11.530
you are taking advantage of the tuck away
suspension system on the Porter 65, you can

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.609
confidently know that you are going to be
able to carry the Porter 65 basically in whatever

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.219
way you choose.

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:27.949
As far as this suspension system is concerned,
you can see it is certainly a fully padded,

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.289
contoured harness here at the top of the pack.

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:36.970
So you have got the carrying comfort you would
expect from a backpack in play.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:45.620
And at the bottom in very, very streamlined
compartments, you have a tuck away hip belt.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.289
So there is some padding there, too, which
bolsters the pack’s ability to comfortably

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.050
carry weight in a backpack carrying style.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.719
And there is adjustability built into that
hip belt as well.

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.129
You have got a sliding sternum strap and load
lifter straps.

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.639
And on the buckle you even have an integrated
safety whistle.

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:17.849
So all of that combining to make the Porter
65 and extremely versatile option for travel,

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:22.279
be that adventure travel, be it just a vacation
or even business travel.
