00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840
Take everything off.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.060
Get him the blanket now.

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.488
Get him the blanket.

00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:05.868
We need a blanket.

00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:07.750
Everybody--

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:08.250
OK.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.416
Take your hat off right now.

00:00:09.416 --> 00:00:10.770
Put this on.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.262
Put this on your head.

00:00:13.262 --> 00:00:14.220
There's pizza in there.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.470
I need you to eat pizza, dude.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.631
Eat the fucking pizza, OK?

00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:17.130
Seriously.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.140
Eat the pizza.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.420
Cassidy, you need to take your
jacket off and warm him up.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.249
Come inside.

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.520
Shit.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.940
Hunter.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.460
I need to get your body
temperature, Hunter.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.779
Hold on.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:31.820
Where are the other guys?

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.850
They're right behind us.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.350
Give them the fucking chicken broth.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.974
Who do we have?

00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:36.030
Chicken broth.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.381
He's coming, he's coming.

00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:39.006
What's up, man?

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.780
How's it going?

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.000
Hey, I need a dry--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.940
something dry.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.840
Stay there.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.174
Put on this dry towel over here.

00:00:47.174 --> 00:00:48.298
He needs a dry [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.950
Oh look, somebody Tindered me in Vegas.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.660
Can we have a dry hat?

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.785
Can we please not talk
about Tinder right now, bro?

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:53.570
That's a joke.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:54.630
You're supposed to laugh.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.520
A dry [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.360
I just need a towel real
quick so I can dry my head.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.090
Hunter, you're not doing good, dude.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.975
He's doing great.

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:05.102
He just needs to warm up.

00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:06.060
Come on, stay positive.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.934
Get him in that metal blanket.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.850
Can you please pass me
a towel if you got one?

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.340
Yo, Cassidy, you need to wrap him up.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.883
OK, dude.

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:13.615
Stay there.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.310
Here.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.959
Hey.

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:16.500
Get him over to the excess generator.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.791
It's got some heat, and then
change him out over there.

00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:19.520
Come on, Hunter.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.180
You're doing great, boy.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.680
Thank you.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.350
We'll see you, bye.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.860
OK.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.580
How are the conditions out there?

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.580
I mean, obviously it could be better.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.870
I mean, I didn't see the forecast
calling for this 80 mile an hour wind,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.860
but it is what it is.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.046
It's a little cold, but there's nothing
you can do about it now, you know?

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.341
Dennis.

00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:42.840
Yeah, bud?

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.985
Someone needs to fix this thing.

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:45.795
What thing?

00:01:45.795 --> 00:01:47.690
Who haven't had their broth?

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.899
Have you had your broth yet?

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:50.940
No, but I'll take it now.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.501
It's just like, I'm not
getting any water out of it.

00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:55.369
It's broken, I think.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.915
That's what [INAUDIBLE] was saying.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.790
Your girlfriend was
saying that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.427
God damn, that's good.

00:02:00.427 --> 00:02:01.010
Who's is this?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.718
Calories, Dennis.

00:02:01.718 --> 00:02:03.060
Everybody bundle up over there.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.160
We're going to do a cuddle puddle.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.490
Who's hat is that?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.390
That's for Hunter.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.800
That's for Hunter.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.070
Fuck, man.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.759
I need one too.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.300
Put it on your head, then.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.410
That pizza sounds amazing.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.150
Where's it at?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.206
It's in the tent.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:13.705
Right here.

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:15.070
What's up?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.782
What's it like out there?

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:17.850
It was great, man.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.167
This is my first Tough Mudder, so
I'm kind of having a great time.

00:02:21.167 --> 00:02:22.000
How does this go on?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.571
I've never worn one of these.

00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:24.070
I got it.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:27.050
This side.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.560
Ready?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.340
You got to get that mop back.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.930
Pull it back.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.060
OK, there you go.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.510
We have another space blanket.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.600
Thank you.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.754
I feel like a condom.

00:02:40.754 --> 00:02:44.290
Well, I'm not going to tell
you what you look like.
