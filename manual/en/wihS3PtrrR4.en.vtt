Hi, I'm Andrew Simpson and I'm a spine surgeon
with the Texas Back Institute. I attended

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.770
college at the University of Florida prior
to attending medical school at Yale, and then

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.270
went on to do my surgical residency at Harvard
and then a spine fellowship at Emory University.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.680
Texas Back Institute has a really longstanding
excellent reputation with regard to academics

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.690
in spine surgery. They're one of the few places
in Texas that actually has a spine fellowship

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.649
and I felt that I really benefited from some
great teaching and training, and I really

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.679
wanted to pay that forward and help train
the next generation of spine surgeons. I chose

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.550
spine surgery later in medical school. I initially
went to medical school with the intention

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.409
of being a pediatrician because I had a really
fantastic pediatrician as a kid. He had a

00:00:55.409 --> 00:01:01.129
great relationship with me and a wonderful
way of always making me feel better. And that's

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:09.530
kind of what I want to [do], give back to people,
and why I wanted to be a physician. Spine

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.700
surgery came later when I was in medical school
and in anatomy and starting to perform surgeries

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.990
where I realized that I had a particular knack
for that and really enjoyed surgery. I'm very

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.859
thoughtful when it comes to patient care,
I treat every patient like they're a family

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:32.189
member. I take a lot of time with them, trying
to get to understand their specific problem

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.429
and complaints, understanding their specific
anatomy, and coming up with a treatment plan

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:44.450
to assess their particular problem set, and
try and maximize the benefit they can get

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.259
with the least invasive intervention. I'm
very conservative, most things I think we

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.780
can take care of with modern physiotherapy
techniques and injections, and I hold surgery

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.469
as a sort of last resort. One of the things
I'm particularly passionate about is really

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.179
doing the right thing for patients, because
these days physicians can be incentivized

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.640
by other things and lose track of the fact
that you're really just trying to make people

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:24.500
better. And that sort of has become my passion, putting the patient and them as a person above anything

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:33.140
else, and doing the thing that I think is most right and beneficial for them, regardless of anything else.
