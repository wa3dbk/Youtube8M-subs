How to Save Money during an Unpaid Internship.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.790
Save what little money you have during an
unpaid internship by making creative adjustments

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.790
to get by.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:24.960
You will need Cash Ledger Leftovers Bike Happy
hours Side job And free events Internet access

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.029
(optional) and other interns (optional).

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.490
Step 1.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.050
Ditch the plastic, which can cost a fortune
in interest.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.020
When you spend cash, you can see it disappearing,
which tends to limit spending.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.449
Step 2.

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:43.879
Write down all of your expenses in a ledger
to prioritize expenditures and keep track

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:45.640
of your spending.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.550
The organization and discipline will come
in handy later when you have some money to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.720
manage.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.320
Many websites offer free money management
and budgeting software.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.330
Step 3.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.360
Volunteer to clean up after meetings or office
luncheons, which often involve fancy food

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.100
that just gets tossed.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.280
Snag some free food, coffee, and donuts while
you're at it.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.330
Waste not, want not.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.780
Step 4.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.690
Walk or bike to work to save money, get exercise,
and enjoy some fresh air.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.800
If you have to drive, try to carpool.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.140
Step 5.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.050
Get in the habit of attending of happy hours
at local joints, where for the price of a

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.780
cheap drink you eat free.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.420
Get together with other interns for potluck
dinners or split big entrees at restaurants.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.420
Step 6.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.890
Find a side job that can work around your
class and internship schedule.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.701
In some jobs, you may even be able to get
some homework done while you're there, or

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:47.520
at least relax while padding your pocket for
that rainy day.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130
Step 7.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.270
Entertain yourself at free concerts or cheap
leisure activities that are happening around

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.660
town or on campus.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.340
Internships are all about expanding horizons,
so do it any way you can.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.580
Did you know In 2008, the National Association
of Colleges and Employers found that 50 percent

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.350
of graduating students had held internships
-- 17 percent more than were shown in a 1992

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.170
study.
