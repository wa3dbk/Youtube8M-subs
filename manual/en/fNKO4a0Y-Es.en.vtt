00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.680
I'm going to show you how to use a silk string
in the knotting and beading.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.780
So when we use a silk string, it's usually
when we use a better material.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.279
So now I'm going to attach the clasp, and
when I attach a clasp with the silk string,

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:26.349
I use a product called a French wire, and
basically French wire covers your cork, and

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.450
you'll see what I mean by that when we actually
physically do it.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.840
So basically French wire are tiny coils of
very, very fine wire.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.310
You don't want to handle it so much, because
you'll create crimps in it, like you can see,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.450
you know, some of these pieces here.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.000
So basically I'm basically going to use the
Griffen silk bead cord that comes with the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.350
needle, and I've decided that this is the
correct size that goes into my bead hole,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740
the correct size of silk.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.780
The size is indicated here, and you can sort
of just visually tell.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.579
They're not that much money, so I usually
buy two sizes that I think are the closest.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.009
It comes in silver or gold, and, you know,
so this is the clasp I use.

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.240
So normally I would use gold, but I don't
have the right size for this thick cord, so

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.470
I'm going to use this silver one that I sort
of black in already.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.390
First I put on the crimp.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.880
Then we're going to choose a piece of the
French wire.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:42.630
It comes in different inner diameter opening
width size, so I'm using a thicker thread.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.010
I'm going use, I don't have gold that will
fix this, so I have to use a silver one.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.700
And basically I put it through the needle,
and the length that you cut is sort of, depends

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.710
on, you know, your design, if you like it,
you know, prominent or not prominent.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.409
And just going to slide it on.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.650
So then you have the crimp, you have the French
wire, I'm going to put the clasp on.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:24.560
And I put the, I center the clasp on to where
the French wire is, and 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:38.040
I'm going to put this through the crimp, and
just gently pull, and you see, so then the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.560
crimp covers your silk so you don't see that,
you know, tan cord.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.129
So the French wire you can do silver, you
can do gold, you know, that's also part of

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.950
your design process, if you'd like it to match
or not match, or contrast.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:02.080
And then I'm going to use the crimping pliers
that's, and make sure the two sides are parallel,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.879
and see that you get that crease in the middle.

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.599
Then I use the other end, and that's it.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.109
And that's how we use French wire.
