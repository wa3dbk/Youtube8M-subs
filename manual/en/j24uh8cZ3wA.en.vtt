00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.629
(piano playing)

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:06.877
Beth: Looking into the space of this diner

00:00:06.877 --> 00:00:09.628
through these glass windows
makes me feel really aware

00:00:09.628 --> 00:00:13.086
of the sound of my own
footsteps on the sidewalk.

00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:14.820
Steven: We're in the Art
Institute of Chicago,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.628
and we're looking at Edward
Hopper's "Nighthawks," from 1942,

00:00:18.628 --> 00:00:22.378
this classic American painting
that's usually seen as an expression

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:26.045
of wartime alienation of
the notion of separation.

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:27.657
It really is about separation.

00:00:27.657 --> 00:00:30.322
Look at the warm light in that diner,

00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:32.133
and compare it to the exterior.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.138
You get a sense of the quiet conversation

00:00:34.138 --> 00:00:35.739
that might be taking place inside,

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.489
but we have no access to that.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.279
In fact, there's not even a doorway
to let us into this restaurant.

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:43.989
Beth: There's an immediate
implication that we are alone.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.882
It almost starts to feel frightening.

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:48.906
Steven: There's a way that
the painting functions

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:51.574
as a kind of prison that
amplifies or intensifies

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:54.625
not only the sense of
silence, but also the way

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:56.658
in which light fills this space.

00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:59.406
Look at the way in which the
warm light of that interior

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:02.823
filters out onto the sidewalk,
creating a series of shadows

00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:05.905
and areas of light that
seem to lay over each other

00:01:05.905 --> 00:01:08.490
and create this complex set
of rays on the sidewalk,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.574
and the way in which the light
hits the glass as it turns

00:01:11.574 --> 00:01:13.990
around the corner of this building,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.014
leading us to that sharp
diagonal across the street

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:21.489
where that lonely cash register stands
as the only recognizable object.

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:25.291
Beth: But, you can imagine life
around it at another time of the day,

00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:28.406
but now it's all eerily silent.

00:01:28.406 --> 00:01:32.964
It makes us look up at those
windows for some sign of life,

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:34.532
but we don't see anything.

00:01:34.532 --> 00:01:36.406
Steven: We can see blinds
that have been pulled down

00:01:36.406 --> 00:01:40.238
by somebody at some point, that
seem, now, completely abandoned.

00:01:40.238 --> 00:01:42.656
We can imagine, perhaps,
the inhabitant is asleep,

00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:44.809
but there's no presence,
no [unintelligible] life.

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:46.461
Beth: Then, we just want to know,

00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:48.402
what are these figures doing together?

00:01:48.402 --> 00:01:50.423
Did that couple come in together?

00:01:50.423 --> 00:01:51.837
Did they meet here?

00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:53.675
Why is the male figure sitting alone?

00:01:53.675 --> 00:01:56.965
Why has he wandered into
this diner so late at night?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.446
What are they talking about?

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.247
It's all very open.

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:02.708
There's not a clear narrative here at all.

00:02:02.708 --> 00:02:04.652
Steven: The only clarity
is the sense of isolation,

00:02:04.652 --> 00:02:05.983
the sense of alienation.

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:08.320
I find this especially interesting.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.959
If you think about the year in
which this was painted, 1942,

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.992
the height of the 2nd World War,

00:02:13.992 --> 00:02:15.828
in some ways, the cities were emptied out.

00:02:15.828 --> 00:02:17.630
There were a lot of people
that had gone overseas.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.381
Beth: It was a time of great
fear and anxiety in America.

00:02:20.411 --> 00:02:22.403
Steven: That's right.
This was really the height

00:02:22.403 --> 00:02:23.712
of the violence of the war.

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:26.379
Nobody knew which way the war
was going to turn at this point.

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.943
Beth: These are subjects
that preoccupied Hopper

00:02:28.943 --> 00:02:33.046
for his entire career, images
of lonliness and isolation

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:36.130
in the new urban spaces.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.918
Steven: This is also a rendering

00:02:37.918 --> 00:02:39.486
that is particularly American.

00:02:39.486 --> 00:02:40.711
It's generalized.

00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:42.421
We don't know precisely where we are.

00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:44.358
Hopper lived in Greenwich Village,

00:02:44.358 --> 00:02:46.214
and certainly the brick
buildings behind us

00:02:46.214 --> 00:02:49.546
are reminiscent of the architecture
that we might find in the village,

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:51.532
but this is not a specific street corner.

00:02:51.532 --> 00:02:53.546
This is not a specific cafe.

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:57.880
It is a kind of stripping away of
everything that's nonessential,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.675
so that we're left with a
kind of idealized rendering

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:04.676
of these forms of this
American experience.

00:03:04.676 --> 00:03:07.448
Beth: There's a sense
of that in the geometry

00:03:07.448 --> 00:03:11.685
of the composition, the
horizontal line of the counter

00:03:11.685 --> 00:03:14.423
that the two figures in the
background lean against,

00:03:14.423 --> 00:03:18.212
those very geometric
forms of the coffee urns,

00:03:18.212 --> 00:03:20.993
the rectangular shape of that doorway.

00:03:20.993 --> 00:03:24.265
Steven: Well, there's this
conflict between these figures

00:03:24.265 --> 00:03:27.022
going about their ordinary
lives and the strict geometry

00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:29.606
of the space that he's imposed
in this imposed in this image.

00:03:29.606 --> 00:03:31.107
I have to say that I love the fact

00:03:31.107 --> 00:03:33.341
that those coffee urns are so specific.

00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.732
You can even see the glass straws,

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:37.899
and see how much coffee is left in them.

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:40.732
There is that sign just above this cafe

00:03:40.732 --> 00:03:43.019
that's advertising cigars for 5 cents.

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.855
There's this specific
turn of the cash register

00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:49.566
across the street, that
is there are signifiers

00:03:49.566 --> 00:03:52.316
of a kind of everyday American experience,

00:03:52.316 --> 00:03:54.697
even as this painting
has been emptied out.

00:03:54.697 --> 00:03:58.149
He's left these few clues
that really place us

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:01.799
in a particular place, in a
particular time, in our experience.

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:05.390
Beth: How about the napkin
holders, and the sa-

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.246
Steven: (laughs)

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:08.328
Beth: and the salt and pepper shakers,

00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:11.777
and the mugs of coffee,
and the glass of water?

00:04:11.777 --> 00:04:17.828
There's a kind of love and attention
to those very dinery objects here.

00:04:17.828 --> 00:04:19.385
That's really compelling.

00:04:19.385 --> 00:04:20.225
Steven: Absolutely.

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:23.626
You have those cherry-topped
stools that spin.

00:04:23.626 --> 00:04:25.210
You see the cherry of the counter.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.359
Beth: There's a kind of specificity,

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:30.665
but at the same time, a
generalizing that's happening.

00:04:30.665 --> 00:04:31.498
Steven: That's right.

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:35.167
He's given us enough specific so
that we know we've been there,

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:36.903
and yet, this could be anywhere.

00:04:36.903 --> 23:59:59.999
(piano playing)
