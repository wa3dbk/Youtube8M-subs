00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.600
One of the biggest factors in bringing more
jobs back is our commitment to American energy.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.809
The "all the above" energy strategy I announced
a few years ago is working, and today America

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:21.860
is closer to energy independence than we have
been in decades.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.369
One of the reasons why is natural gas.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.970
If extracted safely, it's the bridge fuel
that can power our economy with less of the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.810
carbon pollution that causes climate change.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.200
Businesses plan to invest almost a hundred
billion dollars in new factories that use

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.000
natural gas.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.461
I'll cut red tape to help states get those
factories built and put folks to work, and

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:49.030
this Congress can help by putting people to
work building fueling stations that shift

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.580
more cars and trucks from foreign oil to American
natural gas.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.780
It's not just oil and natural gas production
that's booming; we're becoming a global leader

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.250
in solar too.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.870
Every four minutes another American home or
business goes solar, every panel pounded into

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.680
place by a worker whose job can't be outsourced.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.330
Let's continue that progress with a smarter
tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.090
year to fossil fuel industries that don't
need it so we can invest more in fuels of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.280
the future that do.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.520
Our energy policy is creating jobs and leading
to a cleaner, safer planet.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.370
Over the past eight years the United States
has reduced our total carbon pollution more

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.120
than any other nation on Earth.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.920
But we have to act with more urgency because
a changing climate is already harming western

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.520
communities struggling with drought and coastal
cities dealing with floods.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.800
That's why I directed my administration to
work with states, utilities and others to

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.841
set new standards on the amount of carbon
pollution our power plants are allowed to

00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:10.019
dump into the air.

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:17.579
The shift -- the shift to a cleaner energy
economy won't happen overnight, and it will

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:20.000
require some tough choices along the way.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.079
But the debate is settled.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.749
Climate change is a fact.

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:29.400
And when our children's children look us in
the eye and ask if we did all we could to

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.400
leave them a safer, more stable world, with
new sources of energy, I want us to be able

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.809
to say yes, we did.
