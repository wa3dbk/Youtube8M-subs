00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.735
OK, so as scientists and
as psychologists study gene

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:07.770
and environment
interaction, they're

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.390
really beginning
to get as specific

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.750
as identifying the
particular genes which

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:13.500
are regulating our behavior.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.219
And this gives rise
to an entire new field

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.750
of science called
molecular genetics.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.740
And molecular
genetics as a field

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.067
is a science that looks at
the actual molecular structure

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:31.150
and the function of genes.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.810
So we're actually looking
at the segments of DNA.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.540
And it was actually
around the 1950s

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.630
that James Watson
and Francis Crick

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.420
helped discover the structure
of DNA, which gave rise

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.080
to really a whole lot of
brilliant discoveries.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.620
And one such discovery by
Crick, by Francis Crick,

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.590
gave rise to what we
call the central dogma

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.790
of molecular genetics.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.900
And the central dogma
of molecular genetics

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.910
essentially just says
that segments of DNA

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.060
called genes-- so
a segment of DNA

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:14.490
called a gene-- codes for
RNA or ribonucleic acid.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.230
And the little
units of RNA called

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.990
codons are going to code for
one of the 20 amino acids.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.730
So this is an amino acid.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.060
And at this point, it's
becoming a little bit more

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.400
of a biology concept.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.980
But these amino acids that
are being coded for eventually

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.320
become the building
block of proteins.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.950
And it's these proteins
that are being created

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.730
that actually
function in our body.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.400
So think of enzymes,
which are proteins

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.090
that speed up
reactions in our body.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.000
Or you can think of the proteins
that determine whether or not

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.970
a substance can cross
the different membranes

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.602
inside of a cell and on
the outside of a cell.

00:01:58.602 --> 00:02:01.060
And there are many different
types of proteins in our body.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.010
But the point is
that proteins kind

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.249
of form the intermediate point
between genes and our behavior.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.290
And I'm using the
word "behavior"

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.900
because in psychology
that gives us

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.950
a really nice, broad reference
to our body's functioning

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.850
and our response
to the environment.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.990
So the central dogma
of molecular genetics

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.970
really puts a heavy
emphasis on the role of DNA

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.910
in really determining all the
outcomes of these proteins that

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.270
cause our behavior.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.410
But actually subsequent
discoveries, especially

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.650
those in this
molecular realm, have

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.980
caused us to reconsider the
relative importance of DNA

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.790
sequence-- so our
gene sequence--

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.880
in determining the function.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.400
So as an example, think about
steroids, which are hormones.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.880
And you can think of that
as an environmental factor.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.706
And so you can think of
the steroid testosterone.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.270
And so we've heard that steroids
travel between different parts

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.600
of our body to elicit responses.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.980
But those responses are
actually the activation

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.340
of genes to produce proteins.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.990
And if we want an example
that's even more environmental,

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.470
we can think of a stimulus
outside of our body

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.810
like pheromones.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.980
And pheromones really
do the same thing

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.220
because they're
exciting the brain

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.110
and they're causing a
response inside of us.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.570
But that response
again essentially

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.400
is the turning on of genes
to make these proteins that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.020
are going to form a
function in our body.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.880
But if you think about
it, in both of these cases

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.630
the central dogma is kind
of being flipped over

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.860
because where at
one point we put

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.160
a really heavy deterministic
emphasis on the DNA structure--

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.350
so the gene structure-- in
determining the protein that

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.270
causes our behavior,
now we're actually

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.830
shifting that
determinism outside

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.720
of the DNA sequence
a little bit.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.960
So these phenomena are
going to introduce us

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.480
to the idea of gene regulation.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.550
And this idea of gene
regulation becomes

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.220
really important to our
discussion of environment,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.690
and heredity, and behavior.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.079
So there's kind of
this entire modulatory

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.210
world to genetic expression.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.450
And I say modulatory
because the gene expression

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.700
is being modulated by
an environmental factor.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.770
But one of the
greatest achievements

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.670
in clarifying these
modulatory factors

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:38.450
has been the mapping
of the human genome.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.110
And so in the last two
decades, scientists

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.350
have mapped our
entire genome, which

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.010
accounts for like
30,000 or so genes.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.880
And so here in the
background, I've

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.270
kind of drawn an example
of this mapping with all 46

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.210
of our chromosomes.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.290
And we can see that these
might be the genes here.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.660
And scientists
have mapped out all

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.440
of the genes that
contribute to our genome.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.730
And so while in
recent history, we've

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.200
relied heavily on twin
and adoption studies

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.820
to narrow down the heritability
of behavioral traits,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.100
now that we mapped the
entire human genome,

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.625
we can look at populations
which share traits

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.000
and essentially
look at the genes

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.950
that we expect to be
contributing to those traits.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.930
And we can compare and
contrast those genes.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.350
And these studies have given us
some really, really fascinating

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.880
results.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.110
As an example, we've discovered
that the vast majority

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.180
of our genes-- I think on the
order of 95% or so of our genes

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.510
don't actually
code for proteins.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.890
But rather, they regulate
how those proteins are coded.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.570
So instead of changing
the protein, they actually

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.040
change the context
of the protein

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.260
and when and how it's
expressed, so kind of

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.570
like little if-then statements.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.500
If we experience
sugar consumption,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.650
then we code for the
protein hormone insulin.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.140
And there's this whole
playlist in the biology section

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.410
that covers gene
control and covers

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.900
this modulatory world
of gene expression.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.280
So I'm not going to
go too deep into it.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.020
But it is an important point,
especially as we actually

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.690
see differences in the molecular
structure of genes contributing

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.670
to the heritability
of our behaviors.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.370
And then even outside of the
study of the DNA structure

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.900
and the gene sequence,
we've started

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.220
discovering other things at
this molecular level that

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.180
are affecting gene expression.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.110
And this is an entire
new field now concerned

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.590
with this called epigenetics.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:42.230
And so epigenetics is
the study of the changes

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.660
in gene expression resulting
from changes to something

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.560
other than the DNA sequence.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.030
And a classic example
of epigenetic influence

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:56.910
is methylation, so the addition
of methyl groups to the gene.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.910
And the addition of
these methyl groups

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:02.190
can actually make it more
difficult for the transcription

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.400
factors to come in and
identify and activate the gene.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.540
So the gene essentially
isn't expressed,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.200
not because the
sequence is irritated.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.190
But rather because something
is inhibiting the activation.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.010
And we actually see
this phenomenon in rats.

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:22.770
So different styles
of rat mothering

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.660
can nearly permanently
change the stress response

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.240
in our offspring
due to methylation.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.670
So we see our environment
causing this methylation,

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:33.910
which affects gene expression.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.870
And so in a sense,
these epigenetic factors

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.980
are capable of overriding
the DNA sequence

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.260
in determining our behavior.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.420
And so these ideas
are quite biological

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.270
compared to the
majority of psychology.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.880
But molecular genetics
and epigenetics really

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.240
represent the next
step in sorting out

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.840
the heritability
of our behavior.
