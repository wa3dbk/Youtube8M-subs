00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.210
Furniture style and different types really
range the span.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.960
I mean think about our history.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.020
The history of furniture and different types,
span the whole history of the world.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.000
You have your more Traditional, which is usually
found in the European countries, because you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.680
have your Louis XV.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.810
You have your pre-Italianate.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.490
You have all these different species.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.240
Then you come to America, which we started
a lot sooner than you did in other countries.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.760
So you have a lot of the Pilgrims and a lot
of the early-American furniture.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.550
And then it goes into my favorite, which is
Mid-Century Modern.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.320
You have the 60s, the 70s that are really
coming back again, because everything old

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.320
is new.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.270
And you walk into different people's homes
and you'll find a little bit of everything.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.890
You have your Modern with your sleek lines.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.170
The arms are really sleek.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.620
There's no ornamentation, which denotes that
it's Modern.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.950
You have your more Traditional, which have
the ornate carvings.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.820
The ball and claw feet sometimes, if you want
to go really Traditional.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.770
Sometimes you have this new Transitional that's
going on.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.349
Now Transitional, you have a mixture of Modern
and Traditional and what that means is that

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:13.759
you have clean lines, so it's not fussy.

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.899
There's not tons of pillows and things everywhere,
but you have Traditional elements.

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:20.520
So maybe you'll have a little carving here
and there.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.270
You have a little accent color on the pillows
and the fabrics.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.520
So it's a mixture of both worlds.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.280
You'll find that more prevalent today on the
different TV shows, in the different magazines.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.130
You'll see more of a transition in the furniture
and the way it's making it into the market

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.270
right now.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.050
Just be aware of what you feel comfortable
with.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.490
There's really no wrong or right and you can
mix your pieces.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.720
You can do Modern with Traditional.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.580
There is really no rules to it.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.460
The only thing you want to keep in mind is,
if you have a lot of heavy pieces, make sure

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.800
you do a couple of delicate pieces and vice
versa.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.410
If you have delicate, make sure you throw
in a nice bold piece.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.280
That's really it, other than that your home
is your own, and just make sure that you make

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.680
it personal.
