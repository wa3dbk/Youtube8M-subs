00:00:00.972 --> 00:00:02.720
(classical music)

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.905
(writing on chalkboard)

00:00:06.038 --> 00:00:07.366
- Hi there, I'm Josh Clark.

00:00:07.366 --> 00:00:08.571
And this is Brain Stuff.

00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:09.964
And this is the Brain Stuff where I

00:00:09.964 --> 00:00:13.468
explain to you why we don't ride zebras.

00:00:13.468 --> 00:00:14.455
Is that right?

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:15.808
Maybe you've seen somebody ride

00:00:15.808 --> 00:00:18.450
a zebra before, or, there's videos

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.462
on You Tube, and there's a movie

00:00:21.462 --> 00:00:22.796
called Sheena, Queen of the Jungle,

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:24.135
and all of it made you think,

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:25.958
why don't we ride zebras?

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.419
Why isn't it just a normal thing?

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.251
First, Sheena, Queen of the Jungle

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.724
actually had a painted
horse, not a real zebra.

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:34.456
And secondly, while it is possible

00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:37.812
to get a zebra, once in a
while, to let you ride it,

00:00:37.812 --> 00:00:39.983
you can't actually domesticate the

00:00:39.983 --> 00:00:41.530
zebra species, as a whole.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.466
Here's why.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:44.324
So an animal that's domesticated

00:00:44.324 --> 00:00:46.040
is actually a member of a species

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.278
that has been modified from its

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:50.921
brethren in the wild
by human intervention.

00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:53.026
Through selective breeding and

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.435
making a species dependent on us

00:00:55.435 --> 00:00:57.553
for their food supply, we make them

00:00:57.553 --> 00:01:00.388
pretty much compliant to whatever

00:01:00.388 --> 00:01:02.216
humans want them to do, whether it's

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:03.933
walk down a chute to their death,

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.378
or pull a cart, whatever.

00:01:06.378 --> 00:01:09.162
Domestication means we've
taken a wild species

00:01:09.162 --> 00:01:11.533
and made it utterly and completely tame,

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.325
as a species.

00:01:13.325 --> 00:01:14.587
With me so far?

00:01:14.587 --> 00:01:16.355
Now that you understand domestication,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.498
through that lens, it's
kind of not that surprising

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.022
that we don't have more
domesticated species.

00:01:22.022 --> 00:01:24.823
All domesticated animals,
including the big five

00:01:24.823 --> 00:01:27.222
that we humans have
really come to depend on:

00:01:27.222 --> 00:01:31.085
cows, pig, sheep, goats, horses

00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:34.081
have six main things in
common, as pointed out

00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:37.227
by Jared Diamond, who's
the author of a number

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:39.996
of cool books, including
Guns, Germs, and Steel.

00:01:39.996 --> 00:01:41.907
These six things are kind of big.

00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:45.040
They are that the animal is capable

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.869
of breeding in captivity.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.737
They aren't picky eaters, which means that

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:50.920
the average human can go out and get food

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.987
for these animals.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:54.509
They have a social
hierarchy, which means that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.741
a human can step in as
the leader of the group.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.225
They grow very quickly, so you can grow

00:01:59.225 --> 00:02:01.584
a bunch of them as
quickly as you need them

00:02:01.584 --> 00:02:03.365
and replace the ones that die.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:05.560
They tend not to panic which is

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.254
kind of important when you have something

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:08.682
in captivity that, you're saying,

00:02:08.682 --> 00:02:09.453
Breed, breed!

00:02:09.453 --> 00:02:10.568
Here's some food.

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:12.501
And probably most important of all,

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.903
they have a pleasant
disposition, which means

00:02:14.903 --> 00:02:16.525
they won't attack you every time you go in

00:02:16.525 --> 00:02:17.777
to take them their food.

00:02:17.777 --> 00:02:20.285
You put all these six factors together

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:21.733
and you have yourself a species that

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.732
could conceivably be domesticated.

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:26.388
But, if just one of
these factors is missing,

00:02:26.388 --> 00:02:28.358
that species will likely never

00:02:28.358 --> 00:02:29.943
be able to be domesticated.

00:02:29.943 --> 00:02:31.001
And zebras, it turns out,

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.359
do not match these
criteria in a lot of ways.

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.977
Probably most of all, zebras are jerks.

00:02:36.977 --> 00:02:38.369
They're very hostile.

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:39.234
They're very aggressive.

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.721
And that really means that you can't

00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:43.020
domesticate them easily.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.513
But you can't blame
zebras for their stripes.

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:46.277
(drum rimshot)

00:02:46.277 --> 00:02:48.909
See, zebras evolved on the African plains

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.185
and they evolved as a
food source for lions.

00:02:52.185 --> 00:02:54.071
Zebras don't want to be
a food source for lions,

00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:57.000
so since they have to fend
off these apex predators

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.787
on a daily basis, they learned to be

00:02:58.787 --> 00:03:02.055
very aggressive and to
kick really, really hard.

00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:04.658
In fact, a zebra can kick a lion to death.

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:05.935
So just think about what it could do

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.286
to a human head!

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:09.244
They also have a really nasty habit

00:03:09.244 --> 00:03:10.778
of biting and not letting go.

00:03:10.778 --> 00:03:11.334
(munching)

00:03:11.334 --> 00:03:12.739
You put all that together, if you

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.099
go to take a zebra its food,

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.644
while you're trying to domesticate it,

00:03:15.644 --> 00:03:17.649
you're in for a big surprise.

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:19.303
All of this about their disposition

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:21.253
and tendency to panic, frankly,

00:03:21.253 --> 00:03:23.084
is not to mention that they're

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:24.947
too small to ride.

00:03:24.947 --> 00:03:27.147
Zebras backs aren't evolved to allow

00:03:27.147 --> 00:03:28.855
a human to ride along, or to carry

00:03:28.855 --> 00:03:30.031
even a lot of cargo.

00:03:30.031 --> 00:03:31.839
And you can't properly saddle them.

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.164
So really, even if zebras were

00:03:33.164 --> 00:03:35.260
the nicest animal on the planet,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.496
we would just break their backs

00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:37.737
when we tried to ride them.

00:03:37.737 --> 00:03:39.902
This is not to say that
there is no such thing

00:03:39.902 --> 00:03:41.503
as a tame zebra, like we've seen.

00:03:41.503 --> 00:03:43.769
But a tame zebra is just an individual.

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.107
It's not a member of a
domesticated species.

00:03:46.107 --> 00:03:48.444
For example, the 2nd Baron Rothschild

00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:50.312
used to ride around in a carriage

00:03:50.312 --> 00:03:52.476
pulled by his train of zebras

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:53.682
in Edwardian London.

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:55.346
Must've been quite a sight to see.

00:03:55.346 --> 00:03:57.046
Plus there's another guy named Bill Turner

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:59.911
who's known to ride his
zebra around Dorset.

00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:02.096
Apparently it has a
stronger than usual back.

00:04:02.096 --> 00:04:04.765
But for the most part, you can do away

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:06.604
with your wild, wild dreams of ever

00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:09.673
riding a zebra at the park.

00:04:09.673 --> 00:04:11.582
It's probably not gonna happen.

00:04:11.582 --> 00:04:13.540
And now you know why.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.998
So what animal do you wish you could ride?

00:04:15.998 --> 00:04:18.737
I think I would look
awesome riding an ostrich.

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:19.889
It's just my thing.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.434
