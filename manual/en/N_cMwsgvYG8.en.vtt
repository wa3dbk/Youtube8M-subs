00:00:03.814 --> 00:00:09.010
So one thing I'm going to miss about being at RMIT is, yeah, the fantastic

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.591
lecturers, the tutorers and my great friends that I've met throughout my years here.

00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:19.016
Yes, I am happy that I'm graduating from RMIT, I'm nervous about the future but yes, I am.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:25.009
I think university and RMIT in general has been the most stressful, sleep-deprived and caffeine-fuelled

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.177
experience of my life but I wouldn't change it for the world.

00:00:28.177 --> 00:00:31.843
One of my favourite things is the barbecues that we have in Bowen Lane

00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:36.595
and just seeing the diversity of students into there. I mean, you've got fashion students, you've got

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:39.680
engineers and you get some really interesting minds.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.531
The one thing I would miss about university would be attending classes with your friends.

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:48.851
But that's where Alumni comes in, I'll be able to maintain those networks.

00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:54.426
Alumni is anybody who has graduated from an institution.

00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:56.448
Basically us after we graduate.

00:00:56.448 --> 00:01:01.680
The Alumni community is a place where you can maintain networks with people that you've met

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.812
whilst at RMIT, students, fellow lecturers and also, you know, past students as well.

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:12.762
The bonds that you build at university are ... they will last you a lifetime and it's always worthwhile

00:01:12.762 --> 00:01:14.250
to keep in touch with these people.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.700
You never know, you might end up meeting your boss or your manager who is sitting next to you as, oh, I studied with you.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.144
Your best friend right now might be, you know, a great business partner in the future, you know. You don't know that kind of thing.

00:01:28.435 --> 00:01:33.544
People should stay in touch because there's so much that the university offers.

00:01:33.544 --> 00:01:36.688
By joining on the website you can stay a part of the RMIT community.

00:01:38.212 --> 00:01:41.764
It's important to join the Alumni Community for free career development programs.

00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:44.013
You can stay in touch with old friends and lecturers.

00:01:44.013 --> 00:01:48.292
You get discounted access to RMIT climics, libraries and other services.

00:01:48.292 --> 00:01:51.502
You can attend events and network professionally and socially.

00:01:51.502 --> 00:01:55.413
Sign up, it takes no time at all, it's very easy and it's a great way to stay in touch.

00:01:55.413 --> 00:02:00.441
