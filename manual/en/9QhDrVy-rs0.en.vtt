00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.820
The formula of Coca Cola is secret, but researches show that 
 some substances of the drink may even cause cancer

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:15.614
Besides that, failures on the manufacturing process might have caused 
 irreversible damages on a man who consumed the drink

00:00:17.353 --> 00:00:19.353
Since 13 years ago, walking has been difficult

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:21.875
To work, impossible

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:24.072
The intoxication by rats poison left permanent sequels

00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:29.181
Wilson's muscles have spasms all the time

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:38.461
I have involuntary movements, anytime, I may fall forward or backwards

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.455
Have you ever fell on the floor?

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.538
Many times

00:00:40.313 --> 00:00:41.564
On the street?

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:43.376
A few times

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:52.707
He tries to hold it, but cries when talks about the moment when 
 he had his mouth, esophagus and stomach burned by a Coke

00:00:52.707 --> 00:01:04.450
I survive thanks to the help of 3 friends, 4 fellows, I'm 
 not going to cry...and my lawyer, who never left me

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.228
Wilson bought a package of 6 bottles

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:09.625
He couldn't take at least 1 sip

00:01:10.694 --> 00:01:13.751
It was so corrosive that I could take just a half sip

00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:14.611
And I spat the rest

00:01:16.717 --> 00:01:17.919
Then I tasted blood here inside

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:21.520
I warned the corporation, they didn't provide medical assistance to me 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.402
I looked for a doctor myself, who diagnosed me 
 as having an exogenous infection, at that time

00:01:28.402 --> 00:01:31.244
On the following day, a Coca-Cola's employee visited his house

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:38.327
And took 2 bottles, that the company claims to have been destroyed

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:38.327
And took 2 bottles, that the company claims to have been destroyed

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:38.116
Others have been sent to the justice

00:01:38.116 --> 00:01:40.120
But he kept the one that has the most shocking proof of the contamination

00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:50.740
Here inside this bottle, which he keeps carefully, even using a padlock

00:01:53.038 --> 00:01:54.520
Here, there is a mouse's head

00:01:55.002 --> 00:01:57.890
The thick hair shows up quickly

00:01:57.894 --> 00:02:03.620
At first sight, it's hard to identify

00:02:03.618 --> 00:02:06.120
But after rotating the bottle, the shape becomes clear

00:02:06.117 --> 00:02:08.490
Ears and nose

00:02:08.594 --> 00:02:13.710
The possibility of violation of the bottle was discarded by the analysis

00:02:13.714 --> 00:02:17.850
The report from the Technological Research Institute leaves no doubt

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:21.060
"Industrial lock intact"

00:02:18.078 --> 00:02:19.760
"Industrial lock is intact"

00:02:18.543 --> 00:02:21.130
The industrial lock was intact

00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:24.360
Wilson claims never had received assistance from the company

00:02:21.134 --> 00:02:24.840
Wilson says he never received assistance from the company

00:02:24.838 --> 00:02:31.110
I want Coca Cola to admit, at first place

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:34.140
indemnification doesn't make you rich

00:02:34.135 --> 00:02:40.970
indemnification makes a repair. I never wanted to be 
 a millionaire. I want my life back. 

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:46.040
The Public Ministry tried to close the factory where the bottles came from

00:02:46.044 --> 00:02:47.310
But the justice did not accept it

00:02:47.313 --> 00:02:53.730
Furthermore, Wilson's case against the company remains without a final decision

00:02:53.732 --> 00:02:54.840
The failures on the manufacturing process

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:59.460
Are as worrying as the effects of consumption of the drink

00:02:59.455 --> 00:03:10.750
It has been detected an exaggerated quantity of the dye 

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:15.730
Which is a product responsible for the color and the taste of the drink

00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:21.010
This product, in a high density, has been considered as potentially carcinogenic

00:03:21.778 --> 00:03:28.710
The Caramel 4, for example, used to produce this color, is 
 related to cancer on the lungs, esophagus and blood 

00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:32.700
But we, Brazilians, have one more reason to worry

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:42.920
The same pop sold here, has 67 times the Caramel 
 4 of the Coca Cola sold in California, USA

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:47.100
There, the reduction of the carcinogenic substance was enforced by the law

00:03:47.098 --> 00:03:52.120
As a consequence of research from the Science in the Public Interest 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:59.070
The director, Michael Jacobson, explains that the dye should be removed by the industry

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:04.520
As it represents a menace to health

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:10.010
Over here, the tiny text admits the presence of Caramel 4 on the formula

00:04:10.013 --> 00:04:17.480
But important information is missing 

00:04:17.475 --> 00:04:20.960
At least it should be informed for the consumer the quantity 
 of Caramel 4 and some kind of warning regarding

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:27.980
The risks against health, and developing a cancer case the quantity exceeds the limit

00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:36.480
But, for sure, if out there the products contain a lower quantity, 
 they should contain a lower quantity here in Brazil too

00:04:38.504 --> 00:04:44.690
The Coca Cola of Brazil informed that the use of 
 Caramel 4 respects criteria defined by the Anvisa 

00:04:44.686 --> 00:04:46.500
The international agency of health surveillance

00:04:46.497 --> 00:04:49.460
And that the quantity does not indicate any risk against health

00:04:49.462 --> 00:04:56.800
Regarding the case of Wilson, the company said it 
 respects the deadlines determined by the justice

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.400
And the manufacturing follows strict quality measures
