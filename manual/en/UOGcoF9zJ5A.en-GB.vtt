Hey guys, I'm going to be showing you how you can download forge mods for minecraft.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.000
So in my previous video I've already showed you how to download forge. And that should be linked somewhere on the screen.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:25.040
So I'm going to showing you how to download forge mods. I'm on Planet Minecraft and in the mods section.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:37.880
I'm going to be choosing a random 1.8 mod. I have 1.8 so I'm going to be finding a 1.8 forge mod.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.860
This one looks pretty cool, so go to the page and press download mod.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.700
You can tell that this mod is for forge because it says forge in the title.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.840
So once I'm on this website. I'm going to find the download link.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.480
Then choose 1.8 latest.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.180
It may take you to an adf.ly page in the download process so wait five seconds and press SKIP.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.640
Then save the file to your downloads area.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.900
And now, press CONTROL + C to copy the file.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.580
If you have minecraft open, exit out of it.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.980
Then press WINDOWS KEY + R.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.340
And then type in %appdata% and press OK.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:53.340
And now go into, .MINECRAFT and go into MODS. Right click and press paste.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:02.000
And the mod should be installed. So if I go back and open up minecraft.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.580
And then select FORGE 1.8 and press play.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:25.500
And now that mincraft is open. I can go to mods and it should say Xaero's Minimap.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.100
Then press done and it should take you back to the home screen.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.420
And now if I go to any world in single player. This random world.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
And play it, it should come up with the minimap in the corner.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:56.460
And now I have had a great minimap in the corner, for me to see where I am going and where mobs are.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.400
