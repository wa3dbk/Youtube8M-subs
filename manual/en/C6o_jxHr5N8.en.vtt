Pre-schoolers are full of wonder. They have
a lot of energy, they have developing gross

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.320
and fine motor skills, they have kind of short
attention spans, and they have some great

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.559
developing verbal skills. They love to tell
stories, learn new vocabulary, and run outside

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.460
and play. So when you're considering toys
for pre-schoolers, think about their developmental

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.429
needs. A pre-schooler for example really needs
toys that allow them to learn to coordinate

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.859
their muscles, especially their gross motor
skills. So consider trikes and bikes, and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.890
toys that are going to get them outside playing
with others. A soccer ball is a great gift

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.339
for a pre-schooler. You may also want to consider
toys that are gonna bring them inside, allow

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.870
them to calm down, and express themselves.
And a lot of these toys are great for working

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.109
their fine motor skills. So consider crayons,
craft supplies, and clay or modeling dough,

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.359
that really allow them to focus, calm down
and express themselves. You also want to consider

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.399
books for pre-schoolers. Now books are a great
opportunity for kids to sit alone and consider

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.860
the activity of turning the pages and get
into the pictures, and make up their own stories,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.970
but of course it's a great opportunity for
kids to sit on your lap still, bond with you,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.280
and go through the reading experience together.
Look for books that have a child as the main

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.040
character, or a main character with child-like
qualities, and also consider books that have

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.579
familiar problems, that kids can learn how
to deal with the problems. For example, an

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.509
unexpected rainy day, or a favorite toy that's
gone missing. As they go through the books

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.399
with you, they're gonna learn skills for coping
with those everyday problems. You also want

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.310
to find toys and books that are going to develop
their important cognitive skills. Pre-schoolers

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.539
really need to learn now how to count objects,
recognize numbers, learn to recognize their

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.840
letters, and letter sounds, so you want to
find toys and activities that can support

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.420
that. So for example our Tag line allows kids
to actually touch on the page and hear the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.750
letters and the letters sounded out, to support
developing reading skills. We also have our

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.960
gaming systems, and our tablets, that have
a ton of content that are going to support

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.020
your child's ability to recognize letters,
and numbers, and count, and get those skills

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.300
they need to get ready for kindergarten and
elementary school. So again, when considering

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.440
toys and books for pre-schoolers, consider
their developmental needs, consider safety,

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.480
teamwork, parallel play, and of course their
cognitive skill development. Thank you.
