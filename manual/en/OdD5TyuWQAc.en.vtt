Hi everyone I am Sandra with the DisneyCarToys
channel and today I’ve got my Baby Alive

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.130
dolls and I actually have two of them and
we are going to play with this awesome My

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.130
Very

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.980
Own Nursery play set and it is really cool
because it is a crib, a sink, and a high chair,

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.670
everything you will need for your little babies
nursery.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.170
So lets open it up and start building.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.720
Okay here it is out of the box and it is pretty
big and I like it.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.230
It is all-plastic and it was a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.980
little hard to build but not that bad.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.989
So let me show you everything you can do with
it.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:33.989
Okay

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.910
so right here is the little baby crib so actually
underneath there is a quilt and a plastic

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.800
molded pillow and there is a mobile and it
actually works so you can spin it really easily

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.329
and this is actually the best baby mobile
I have seen on a crib as a toy this is really

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.329
cool

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.370
because now our little baby can go to sleep.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.440
And oh yea we can brush her teeth before sleep

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.609
to she’s got it permanently attached to
her mouth or her jammies.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.540
The other area is our

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.150
high chair hopefully we can get our baby in
here, oh yea she fits perfectly and this is

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.610
actually really nice and it is just attached
to the side of the crib which is really convenient

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.360
and you can feed her right here.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.590
And right over here is the sick which is really
cool because

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.720
the knobs do move so we’ve got cold water
and hot water right here and then inside are

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.720
all

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.310
of our accessories that came with the set,
so we have baby powder for changing the baby

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.740
and then a little sippy cup which is really
cute and then a spoon fork and plate.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.740
Lets give out

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.860
baby some water she is growing up and using
a sippy cup muh that’s good.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.860
And there is one

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.590
more thing I want to try with the set I want
to see if you can fit two babies in here like

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.590
twins.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.720
And they kind of fit but it’s a little tight
she’ll probably be kicking her in her sleep

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.520
and she’ll be kicking her in her sleep but
they do fit.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.909
And the last thing I want to show off is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.350
there is a shelf down here for more baby accessories
but if you have tons of accessories,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.150
which you probably will have because babies
require a lot of stuff so you can put some

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.150
stuff

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.150
underneath the crib.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.459
The my very own nursery set is really cool
and is actually a really good

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.160
value too, I got it off Amazon and it think
it was only 25 dollars which isn’t bad at

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160
all.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.160
