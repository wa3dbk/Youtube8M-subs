Hi, I'm Eric from Rocky Mountain ATV/MC.com

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
And today I'm going to show you how to change the oil on a modern Honda four stroke.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.540
The supplies we'll need are rags, an oil drain pan, some common hand tools, oil filters.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.440
Today we're going to be using the Billy Who Man Funnel. A service manual and some quality oil.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.910
Rocky Mountain sells a wide variety of
oil and oil filters.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.420
CRF's have two oil compartments, one is the transmission, the other is the engine oil.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.920
We're going to start first with the transmission oil. We're going to take off the cap.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.060
We're gonna loosen the drain bolt.

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.839
The we're going to get our Billy Who Man Funnel and line it up underneath the bolt.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.320
Then we're going to go ahead and remove the bolt the rest the way and let the oil out.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.240
This funnel is necessary if you have a skid plate, but it also helps just making sure it's not as messy, even if you don't.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.590
Now that the oil is drained, we're going to remove the funnel and reinstall the drain bolt.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.560
We're going to torque this to 16 foot-pounds is what this
service manual calls for.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.730
To fill the oil we're going to take out our oil level check bolt first.

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.799
And then we're going to go ahead and refer to our service manual.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.980
Get the approximate volume that we need to put in it. And then we're going to watch our oil level check bolt.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:10.110
As we add oil, we'll notice the oil start to flow out. That's when we know we have enough.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.140
We'll go ahead and reinstall the oil level check bolt.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.850
Go ahead put the cap back on.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.980
And then we're going to move on to the engine oil.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.140
And the engine, we're going to go ahead and remove the cap.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.920
Sit it aside

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.350
Now we're going to drain the engine oil. The drain bolt is actually located underneath the engine.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.119
Go ahead and let the engine oil drain
completely.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.680
And then we're going to reinstall our drain bolt

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:13.920
We're going to torque that to approximately
18 foot-pounds. Always check your manual to double check that.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.000
And then we're going to change the oil filter and to do that we're going to go over on the other side of the bike.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.700
There's the oil filter cover. Go ahead and remove that.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.160
And when you remove it, there's a spring on CRF models that you want to make sure you don't lose.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.480
And also take note of how the filter was
mounted onto the cover.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.220
Go ahead and replace it with the high-quality oil filter like a Tusk Oil Filter.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.070
A little bit of oil on the sealing surfaces makes it so we don't tear anything when we install it.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.260
Put the spring on. If that spring won't stay there, a little bit of grease in that recess will hold the spring during installation.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.460
Slide it in, make sure everything fits in nicely.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.780
And then reinstall your bolts.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.810
Check your owners manual for torque
specs.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.259
Now it's time to add the engine oil.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.760
And once again the Billy Who Man Funnel makes it a no mess oil fill.

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.230
We've checked our owners manual so we know approximately how much oil to put into it.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.740
But you still need to check it with the dipstick or on the four wheeler
models there is also a sight window.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.760
So what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and run the bike for a few minutes.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.160
Now that we've ran the bike we're going to check the oil level.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.820
And you un-thread the dipstick. Clean it off.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.480
And then sit it back in the hole without threading it in.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.340
And this is how you get your correct oil level.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.600
The Tusk Oil Filter comes with a maintenance sticker to help keep track of your oil changes.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.220
Once you apply that, then you're done
