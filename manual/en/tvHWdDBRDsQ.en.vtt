00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.982
If the person who picked me up hitching said,
"You are going to be part of four national

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:06.982
championships."

00:00:06.982 --> 00:00:07.982
(Announcer) Davis wins it at 118 pounds and
The University of Iowa has clinched a national

00:00:07.982 --> 00:00:08.982
championship.

00:00:08.982 --> 00:00:17.730
(Kelly) You are going to wrestle in the Iowa-Iowa
State meet.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.039
(Announcer) Well, here we go.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.359
142 pounds.

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.359
(Kelly) You are going to get three degrees.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.589
You are going to be professor of the year
at Iowa.'

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.589
I would have thought they were insane.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:36.539
I've got nothing but him to thank for it.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:43.109
When I look at the big picture of all of this,
you know, I grew up in a house of seven people,

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.579
eight counting my mom and there were times
when our toilet didn't work.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.970
My mom was a bartender so we had this much
money, so you either get food or you hire

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.320
a plumber, so you get food.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.309
You go from that part of the world to hitchhiking
to college with a dream like hey I want to

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:58.930
wrestle for Dan Gable.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.930
And I talked to Coach Gable, we were in a
middle of a workout, which at the time I didn't

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.420
know I should talk to him then, but I talked
to him anyway.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.200
(Gable) I usually make them sit in the stands
for awhile so they can see what takes place

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.830
and really whether or not they want to be
a part of it.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.220
Once I get the feel for them, I pretty much
tell them they can't quit.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.740
That doesn't mean they won't, but I don't
like it when they do, but this guy didn't.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.910
(Kelly) I'm kind of a late bloomer I think
in wrestling and academics, and that has a

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.690
lot to do with my childhood I think, but I
pretty much stepped up to whatever was in

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.980
front of me and liked the challenge.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.730
(Gable) I've always like gravitated towards
a certain person.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.970
He was tough in practice, people liked to
work out with or didn't like to work out with

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.890
him depending on just how tough they wanted
to go.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.050
He was one of these guys that was motivating
in the room to everybody else and helped out

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.560
even though he wasn't the starter, but he
got his chance and he capitalized on that

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.560
chance.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.560
(Announcer) It's Mitch Kelly for Iowa down
at 142 again while Greg Randle takes care

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.560
of that bad hamstring and Michael Carr for
Iowa State.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.860
This should be a real run and gun.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.290
They both know how to throw.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.769
(Gable) Well he surprised me, I mean he really
stepped up.

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.340
(Announcer) Here again is a throw!

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.739
(Gable) He was strong, he was throwing people
around and doing some great things.

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.709
(Announcer) He says two now.

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:37.400
(Kelly) I held on and got a 15-11 win and
we ended up winning 18-15 and if I had lost

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.410
we would have lost 18-15.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.430
If you are going out any other way, that's
a hell of a way to go out as a walk-on.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:53.719
(Gable) He probably didn't surprise himself
as much as he surprised a lot of people.

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:58.049
People didn't really know, I didn't really
know.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.069
I learned lessons from certain things, you
don't know what you have until you put them

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:05.969
out in front of the lights.

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.900
(Kelly) I actually probably would not have
got my advance degrees without this guy here,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.670
because he hired me as a grad assistant and
I was able to do that and teach at at the

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.519
College of Ed and earn my advance degrees
that way.

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.200
So, I really didn't go into any debt which
would have been hard to do where I started,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.909
so it is a really great thing.

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.581
I didn't even think of him as a mentor really
when I was working for him, he was a coach

00:03:25.581 --> 00:03:29.450
for me and then as I started coaching with
him I started to see him more that way.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.770
As the years have progressed it's like we
are just kind of like friends, but also no

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.170
matter what he's always a teacher and always
a coach.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.439
I just think it is all about relationship
building and I think I learned a lot from

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.630
Dan Gable and I think maybe from my mom and
I you know anything she needs I want to help

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.630
her.

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.980
The reason is because she taught me to be
that way and she did that for years and years

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.980
and years.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.609
Then I meet him and he is the same way where
he took care of me way more about my social

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.659
needs or getting beat up in here so much that
I'm crying in the corner.

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.169
He'd wait until he thought moment was right
and come over and talk to me and build me

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.680
up for the next day or whatever.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.769
When someone does that for you I just feel
that you almost owe it to them to perform

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:10.690
well, or to try hard, or to work hard and
not give up.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.040
I think the same way with my teaching it's
like I want my students to feel like I care

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.470
enough about them that they don't want to
let me down.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.850
(Gable) You don't just focus on your ten kids
that make your starting lineup, if you've

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.700
got 40 kids like he said in the room, you've
got to focus on all 40 of them.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.860
I think good coaches, good teachers, they
get everybody to understand what is going

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.860
on.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.840
The ones that have a lot of problems are usually
the ones that don't really establish those

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.760
relationships and build that communication
to make sure everybody knows just how important

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.910
everything is.(Kelly) It's like you learn
things from your mentors and you kind of see

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.040
what works and what doesn't and what you like
and what you don't like.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.750
I consider anytime I win any award or I get
good feedback from a student that I had an

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.270
impact on their lives, I think about him pretty
much right away.
