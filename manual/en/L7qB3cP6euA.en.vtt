00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.330
Printing documents in Word 2013 is easy.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.780
You'll find everything you need in the backstage
view… under Print.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.070
As you can see, the Print pane offers a list
of options, and preview of the document on

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.200
the right.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.380
You can use the controls below the preview
to zoom in and out, or cycle between different

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.050
pages.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.410
Now, you could just enter the number of copies
you want, and click the Print button right

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:37.550
away.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.780
But if you want more control over the finished
product, you might want to take a look at

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.050
the options below.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.690
For example, you can select a different printer
if you're connected to more than one.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.680
You can also choose a custom page range if
you're working with a multipage document,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.010
and you only want to print part of it.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.559
Just enter the pages you want, separating
each entry with a comma.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.640
Next, choose whether to print on one side
of the paper, or both sides.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.400
Your options may vary depending on your printer's
capabilities.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.710
Here's another option that may be important
to you if you're printing a multipage document.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
If you're doing more than one copy, make sure
collated is selected, and each copy will be

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.460
printed in order.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.150
Next you can review options that have to do
with page layout, including orientation…

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.540
paper size… and margins.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.580
If you need to make any adjustments, just
click… then make your selection from the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.930
menu.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.439
Word also gives you the option of printing
more than one page on a single sheet of paper.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.310
This can be helpful in some cases, but take
note that the text will become harder and

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.520
harder to read the more pages you select.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.079
When you're ready, go ahead and click the
Print button.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:52.640
Remember, you'll find it at the very top of
the Print pane.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.259
Now you just have to wait for your document
to finish printing.
