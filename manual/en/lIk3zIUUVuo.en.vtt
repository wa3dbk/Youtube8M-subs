Gemma's Bold Baking Breakfast
Bacon &amp; Cheddar Cornmeal Waffles

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.660
Hi Bold Bakers! This is the second week of
our breakfast series where I'm showing you

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.800
how to create an entire breakfast menu leading
up to Mother's Day. I'm sharing with you some

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.690
of my favorite sweet &amp; savory breakfast recipes
to fuel you and start your day off right.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.850
And this week we are making Bacon &amp; Cheddar
Cornmeal Waffles. So let's get started!

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.159
When I used to have my breakfast catering
business, Friday used to be a big blowout

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.080
day where I'd create over-the-top pancakes
and waffles. And that's where this recipe

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.640
came from. Everybody used to love it and that's
why I wanted to share it with you today.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.830
We're going start out in a large bowl. Add
in your flour, cornmeal. Don't worry, if you

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:07.300
don't have cornmeal you can use all white
flour. Sugar, salt, baking powder and baking soda.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.800
And then mix them all together.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.110
In a separate jug, add in your milk and your
eggs and then whisk them both well together.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.530
We're going to set these aside and prepare
our savory ingredients to go into our waffles.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.650
What you choose to add in your waffles is
what really makes them shine and go over the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.670
top. I'm adding in scallions, or spring onions.
They have a nice mild onion flavor and they

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.520
also have really good color.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.650
I'm also adding in bacon because let's face
it, bacon makes everything taste better. But

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.500
if you don't like bacon and want to keep this
vegetarian you can totally leave that out and maybe

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.440
bump up some of the other ingredients.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.820
I like to add in sharp red cheddar. I really
love the flavor of this cheese, you can add

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.990
any that you like. I also like red cheddar
because it gives a nice pop of color as well. I also

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.280
like to add in corn. You can use fresh or
frozen. It gives a really nice sweetness to

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.440
your waffles and it works really well with
the other flavors.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.450
Now that we have everything ready, we're going
to add all of our ingredients into the dry

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.700
mix. Add your milk and your eggs, and follow
that will all of your savory ingredients.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.640
Now you simply want to mix all of these ingredients
really gently together. The less you mix this

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.540
batter, the softer and lighter your waffles
will be. So just mix until combined.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.450
Once your waffle batter is mixed, we're going
to drizzle in some cooled melted butter. Now

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.500
all you want to do is gently fold it into
your batter. You add your butter last so you

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.170
can evenly distribute it throughout your batter.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.380
At this stage, we're going to pop our waffle
batter in the fridge and let it set for around

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.590
15-20 minutes and our next step is to cook
these guys off.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.620
If you don't have a waffle machine, don't
worry about it. You can always cook this batter

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.910
off as savory pancakes and they will be just
as good.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.870
Before I use my griddle, I like to brush it
with a little bit of oil to get a nice crisp

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.760
coating on my waffles. Once your batter is
nice and chilled it's ready to be cooked off.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.930
I like to add in around a cup of batter for
my machine but it might vary in the one that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.819
you use. Spread the batter all the way to
the edges. Just in case you were worried that

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.899
your waffle isn't loaded with lots of flavor,
I like to add a little bit of extra stuff on top.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.000
Nobody said that waffles have to be sweet
and I think this is a great variation.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.599
I have a double waffle maker so I can make
two at once.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:20.599
Cook it until it's beautiful and golden brown.
I can already smell the cheese melting. These

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.390
waffles look amazing. I can't wait to try
them. If you have any baked waffles left over

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.500
then keep them for the next day and pop them
in the oven and they will be gorgeous again.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.709
To serve your waffles, I like to go really
BIG &amp; BOLD and serve some corn on top and even some

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.430
extra bacon and onions.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.520
I just love the combination of the salty bacon,
the sweet corn and the sharp red cheddar.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.140
This is my first savory addition to my breakfast
series so I really hope you like it.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.230
I know I do.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.760
And of course, my dog Waffles loves them too.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.540
Stay tuned for next Monday's recipe of Italian
Baked Eggs and of course, come back every

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.000
