00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.810
How to Repair Your Eyeglasses.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.460
Try these simple fixes to salvage your specs.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.640
You will need Duct tape Needle-nose pliers
An eyeglass repair kit 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.270
Superglue A wooden toothpick A paper towel
A miniature safety pin All-purpose glue A

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.460
metal staple A wire coat hanger A magnifying
glass and clear nail polish.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.370
Review the warranty for your eyeglasses.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.780
Making repairs yourself may invalidate it.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.860
Step 1.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.879
Holding your glasses by the nosepiece, closely
examine them to determine what needs repair.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.179
Use a magnifying glass for assistance.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:45.179
Step 2.

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.729
For an overstretched hinge, cover the tips
of needle-nose pliers with duct tape to avoid

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.100
any lens scratching.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.819
Then, use them to gently bend the hinge back
into place.

00:00:54.819 --> 00:01:00.429
If the hinge still feels loose, secure it
with a small rubber ring for reinforcement.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:01.429
Step 3.

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:06.070
If a hinge has broken off, dab a small amount
of superglue to the end of a toothpick and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.760
apply the glue to both the hinge and frame.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.970
Firmly hold it in place for 1 minute.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.750
Wipe away any excess glue with a paper towel.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.620
The earpiece should bend normally.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.030
Step 4.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.680
Replace screws that have fallen out with ones
from the repair kit.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.970
You can also fasten a miniature safety pin
through the hole, or slip in a metal staple

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.690
coated in all-purpose glue, bending the ends
with pliers to fit around the hinge.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.570
If you use a staple, you won't be able to
fold your glasses.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.290
Dab clear nail polish on top of the screw
after tightening it to keep it in place.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.360
Step 5.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.220
If you’ve snapped off an earpiece, reattach
it with superglue.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.220
Step 6.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.700
If you’re in a real bind, build a temporary
earpiece.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.570
Using pliers, cut a section of the wire hanger
to the same length of the original earpiece.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.640
Curve one end of the wire to fit your ear,
and glue the other end to the frame.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.400
Secure the earpiece to the frames by wrapping
a strip of duct tape around them.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.830
Save old glasses.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.090
While you might not have any use for them
now, their parts may come in handy for future

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.920
replacements and repairs.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.920
Step 7.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.959
While you can make simple, temporary repairs
yourself, multiple fractures, warped springs

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.880
or screw holes, or lenses with deep scratches
require professional help.

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.150
See your optician.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.219
Did you know In Europe during the 1300s, the
rich typically wore eyeglasses as a symbol

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.920
of their wealth and power.
