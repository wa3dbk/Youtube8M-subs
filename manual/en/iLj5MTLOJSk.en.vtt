00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.560
So we have seen how a Bo field gradient can
be used to spatially encode the frequency

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.349
of the spins along the direction of the applied
gradient, and together with a frequency selective

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:20.500
RF pulse we can select a particular slice
of spins. We can use this same idea to spatially

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.730
encode the signal from within this slice of
spins in each direction. If we were to detect

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.660
the signal while at the same time apply a
field gradient along one of the directions

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.199
within the plane of the slice, then we would
expect that the signal will be encoded as

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.749
a function of position along that gradient.
This is known as frequency encoding and the

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:50.199
frequency encoding gradient is also known
as the read gradient. This spatially encoded

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.569
signal will therefore consist of a projection
of the signal from all the spins that are

00:00:55.569 --> 00:01:02.210
in the same position along the read gradient
direction, so if a Fourier Transform is applied,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.440
the result will be a projection of the shape
of the object against the direction of that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.100
gradient. This is best illustrated with an
example. We have three samples of water arranged

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.710
in the magnet. A field gradient is applied
along the horizontal direction. The frequency

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.470
of the spins within the samples are therefore
different and are encoded with increasing

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.320
frequency from left to right. So the signal
from each of the samples will occur at different

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.870
frequencies, and within each sample, the shape
of the signal will be a projection of the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.940
spin density against the horizontal axis as
shown here. You can see that the projection

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.250
reflects the shape of the object. If we now
change the direction of the gradient to the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.780
vertical axis, then again, the signal would
be a projection against this axis which looks

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.180
like this. The projection is the sum of all
the signals at each point along the gradient

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.370
direction, so here, the large sphere and the
cube are superimposed and their signal intensity

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.890
adds together. We can apply this gradient
along any direction in the plane of the slice

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.459
and the projection will change as a function
of the direction. For simplicity in this animation,

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.019
rather than rotate the direction of the gradient,
we rotate the sample and show the projection

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:31.019
along the horizontal axis as the sample rotates.
The projections obtained in this way can be

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:37.379
used to back calculate the original shapes
of the three objects in a manner very similar

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:43.620
to that used in CT imaging. This technique
in known as back-projection reconstruction

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.150
and was one of the first proposed MR imaging
methods for which Paul Lauterbur received

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.680
the Nobel prize in 2003 together with Sir
Peter Mansfield who invented the slice selection

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.680
method we described earlier. Back projection
reconstruction is not used routinely in MRI

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.549
systems today. Instead, the second, orthogonal
direction in the slice of spins is also spatially

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.969
encoded with another gradient and a Fourier
Transform is applied along each direction

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:19.969
to produce a two dimensional image. We have
encoded the spins along one direction with

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.260
the read gradient. The orthogonal direction
can be spatially encoded by applying a gradient

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.310
in that direction before the read gradient.
This second gradient will also encode the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.389
frequency of the spins along its direction,
but this time, the encoding is performed before

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:43.049
the signal is detected and alters the so-called
"phase" of the spin vectors as a function

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.900
of their position along that gradient direction.
This gradient is therefore known as the phase

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.459
encoding gradient. How does this work? Here
we have two spheres of water and we show the

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.900
projection of the samples along the horizontal
or read direction. If we measure a series

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.969
of projections, each time applying a phase
field gradient for a short time before acquiring

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:13.299
the signal, then each point of the projection
that we observe will have an intensity and

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.449
phase change according to the position of
the spins along the orthogonal gradient direction

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.800
and according to the strength of the field
at each position. Here, the phase-encoding

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:33.700
gradient is zero and then increases for each
successive projection. You can see the intensity

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.800
change along the projection as a function
of the phase gradient strength. If we were

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.710
to plot the intensity of the same point in
each projection then we would observe a signal

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.560
which contains all the frequencies that contribute
to that point from the direction orthogonal

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.560
to the read gradient as shown here. So if
we then Fourier transform this signal then

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.069
the result will be a spatial profile of the
sample along the orthogonal direction at that

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:13.200
point. So if we Transform along each point
of the projection, then we build a two-dimensional

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.270
map of the spins showing the intensity of
the signal from each position in the slice.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:27.419
This represents an image of the slice of water
molecules in two dimensions. So we now have

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.479
spatial encoding of the spins in three directions:
A slice gradient together with a frequency

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:40.139
selective RF excitation pulse creates a slice
of spins with a certain thickness and position.

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.759
A gradient in the read direction encodes the
signal as a function of position in one direction

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:53.759
of the slice plane to produce a projection
along that direction. The phase gradient encodes

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.429
the projection intensity and phase along the
orthogonal direction in the image plane.
