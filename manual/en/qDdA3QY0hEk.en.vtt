Men's Waxed Cotton Jackets -- Wax Jacket Styles
- How To Re-Wax Jacket &amp; Buy Waxed Jacket

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:02.199
Hi!

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:03.730
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.410
Today, I'm going to be introducing you to
the waxed cotton jacket.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.650

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.110

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.590
And if you want to learn more about men's
style, I've got a great 47-page e-book which

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:21.841
you can just grab right down there.

00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:27.080
It talks about more formal men's style, but
I also talk about, well, a little bit of casual

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.910
stuff, but the rules apply.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.450
It doesnâ€™t matter how you're dressed.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.060
Okay, so the waxed cotton jacket.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.580
I'm wearing one right now.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.280
This one is more of a hunting design.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.260
They come in wide varieties.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.200
Waxed cotton more refers to the fabric and
the properties of the fabric, so if you think

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.800
about wax, what happens when water goes on
wax or it goes on a duck or any type of animal

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.850
or a piece of clothing which has a film on
it?

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.300
It just rolls off, exactly, so that is the
idea behind the waxed cotton.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.059
This has been with us for a long time, so
let's go back and look at history.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.590
We see the Egyptians and they had sails.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.409
They were out sailing on the ocean or the
Mediterranean or the Red Sea, and we would

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.609
see them that they figured out that if they
waxed the sails, if they took those paper

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:25.850
sails and they wax them, they did a much better
job of catching air and they were a lot faster.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.600
They were lighter than the other alternatives
out there and it worked for them.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.700
Now, modern day, we started seeing that -- well,
not modern day, but a few hundred years ago,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:41.259
we still saw sails that would use a film and
put it into the actual sheets and it would

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.649
do a better job of not letting the wind go
through and it would catch the wind pull.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.659
So we see a lot of fishermen and we actually
see a lot of clothing that would come from

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.009
old sails and it would still have a lot of
the same properties of being waterproof, which

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.100
is very good if you work out on the open water.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.289
So this was brought into men's wear.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.880
One of the famous examples is the trench coat,
so the trench coat used waxed cotton and that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.860
was used successfully in very bad weather
in the trenches during World War I and beyond.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.180
Now, in hunting, it plays a great role.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.360
You see I've got a hunting jacket.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.650
One of the most famous hunting jackets you
see out there is made by Barbour.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.650
That is an English company.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.150
In this case, I'm not wearing a Barbour.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.040
I'm wearing one made by Eddie Bauer.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.459
I like the style, but the style is pretty,
I would say, universal when it goes for these

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.049
hunting jackets, and this one in particular,
I'm going to use it as the example.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.209
So what we see is the style, and I've got
another one made by Timberland with another

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.209
waxed cotton.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.850
They usually have this green drab color, so
this is a little bit of kind of just blending

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.500
in to the natural environment.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.329
It's not really camouflage, but it's also
not sticking out, as many hunters know.

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.000
The color is less important.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.549
You could actually go with a bright orange
and that would probably be better.

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.180
I know a lot of hunting stores that do sell
it, or you could wear a vest with this and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.420
still wear this traditional jacket, but oftentimes,
what we see on these is placement for the

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.469
hands, so this is a big one.

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:15.310
You have a place where you can basically put
your hands in here on this jacket.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.140
I've got it right here.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.140
On this jacket, they do not have that button
over, but they do the same placement at this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.840
level for the arms and for the hands.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.090
It's higher so that if you have your rifle
slung over, you can still comfortably put

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.090
your hands in here.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.709
They also have these large lower pockets.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.140
And again, I see these on the Timberland as
well and you're going to see those on the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.140
Barbour.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.379
Can anybody guess what the large lower pockets
are for, anyone?

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.040
Ammunition, right, so that's where you would
actually open this up and you could put large

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.250
amounts of ammunition or anything else you
need when you're out hunting.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.989
Now, the inside of these jackets usually are
made with -- this one's got a bit of corduroy,

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:55.989
but they're insulated.

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.349
There are more pockets, but these are warm
jackets.

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.689
But the most important thing in getting back
to what we're talking about, the waxed cotton,

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:04.950
is the outside.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.560
These are water-resistant, not waterproof.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.230
Waterproof, you've got to have actual rubber,
something that you could leave the water on

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.480
there for a while.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.769
These are water-resistant so they will resist
a high amount.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.910
I mean, water is just going to roll off and
you could be caught in a storm and you will

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.770
remain dry underneath.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.410
It will absorb just a bit, but we're talking
a minute amount because the waxed cotton,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.850
another great thing about it is it's actually
woven with a type of cotton that already has

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:39.250
the film on it, so the wax is basically woven
into the actual -- well, it depends on who

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.440
made it and what mill it came from.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.970
But normally for these jackets, you're going
to see that they used a good waxed cotton

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.750
thread and afterwards, they treated it as
well.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.513
Now, one of the things with waxed cotton,
why a lot of people want to avoid it and they

00:04:53.513 --> 00:04:59.350
go with a modern equivalent or something different
is that they don't want to deal with the upkeep.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.080
Depending on how much you wear the jacket,
I would say maybe once every few years, you'll

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.300
probably need to send it in or get a small
kit in which you will apply a little bit of

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.470
wax to this to reinforce what was originally
put on these jackets, but overall, I think

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.410
they're very handsome jackets.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.130
This one again made by Eddie Bauer, I'm happy
with.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.770
It's harder in United States to find Barbours.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.690
They don't make them easy to find.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.410
You can occasionally find some in thrift stores
or in the larger cities where they actually

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.770
have stores, but you can find a lot of companies,
like I said, Eddie Bauer, Timberlands.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.170
I like the Eddie Bauer one more than the Timberland.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.320
I'm actually going to send the Timberland
back and keep this Eddie Bauer jacket, but

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.500
I would say a medium weight jacket.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.500
So right now here in Wisconsin, it was just
negative 20 the other day, and that's Fahrenheit,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.500
guys.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.990
So I know for you Canadians, that's nothing,
that you laugh at that, but here in the United

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.840
States, negative 20 is relatively pretty cold.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.450
This jacket I would not be wearing out there.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.730
I would be wearing a parka, which is a whole
another style.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.590
All right, guys, so hopefully you enjoyed
this.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.040
Hopefully you learned something and I will
see you in the next video.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Take care.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.041
Bye-bye.
