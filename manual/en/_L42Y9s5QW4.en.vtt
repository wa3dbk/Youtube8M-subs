00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.480
Hello everybody.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
Welcome to the product video of our CM Storm
Trigger Z.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.530
As you can see it looks a lot like our old
Trigger.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.490
This is because this is the new model.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.619
We listened to the community.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.310
We listened to all your feedback from you
the gamer and you can see the improvement

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.310
right here.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.779
For example: the fullsize USB connector.

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.800
Before our old Trigger came with a mini-USB
connector.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.539
We got a lot of feedback that this was a little
bit of a fragile connector and the connector

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.640
was a little bit loose so now we went with
a fullsize connector which is nice and sturdy

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.460
so it will not get loose.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.070
The USB hub has been removed and off course
you can see it is now a full black version.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.460
Where before our old Trigger was black and
gray.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.109
But this gives it a more clean look.

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.250
Going to the other side.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.940
As you can see the version I have in front
of me is with the Cherry MX Brown Switch.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.450
This Brown switch comes with a White LED backlight.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.920
We also have this available in a Blue Switch
with Blue backlight and a Red Switch with

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.989
a Red backlight.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.430
However availability may vary on your region.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.550
Talking about the backlight.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.590
By pressing FN and F1 you can turn the backlight
on and off.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.540
F2 and F3 is for the brightness adjustments.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.820
In total you have 5 brightness levels.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.190
And F4 is for the modes.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.140
You can cycle through a breathing mode, where
the backlight goes slowly on and off.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.430
A gaming mode where WASD is activated and
your macro keys.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.050
And offcourse the full on.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.270
3 modes in total.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.210
F5 to F11 is for your media control, so play,
pause, skip forward, backwards, volume up,

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.210
down.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.020
That is controlled with FN and F5 to F11 and
the F12 is your windows lock key.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.580
FN + F12, thats it, you will not get kicked
back during a gaming session to your windows

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.430
desktop.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.470
And now it is off again.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.610
One other feature is off course the removable
wrist rest.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.200
The wrist rest makes sure you are nice and
comfortable during gaming sessions but it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.750
is removable so it is easier to take with
you to LAN events.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.160
Something else this keyboard has is 5 dedicated
Macro Keys.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:20.049
You can store in total 5 different profiles
for 5 different macro keys.

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.549
You can do this with the software that is
downloadable from www.cmstorm.com.

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.530
There will also be firmware versions if there
is a newer one and new software versions if

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.830
there is something we tweaked about the software.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.271
So keep an eye on that website as well.

00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:37.999
That is everything for our CM Storm Trigger
Z, check out the website if you want to know

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:38.930
