00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.470
There’s 3 minutes left to play in the 2nd
period and your team is down by 3.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.510
You are all desperately trying to score to
turn the tide of the game.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.390
You take charge of the puck, but you lose
it in a breakout that could have easily set

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.380
up your top scorer for a perfect shot at the
goal.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.700
Your coach angrily calls you out and so you
can “think about your mistake before I put

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.870
you back in.”

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.080
You sit on the bench and beat yourself up
with thoughts like: “I bet I will lose my

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.010
spot”, “I can’t believe I did that”
and “I’m not as good as they thought.”

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.550
All equally mentally destructive thoughts.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.620
When you go back in, instead of being pumped
up, all you can think about is not making

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.730
another mistake.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.960
Your play is stiff and hesitant and you end
up passing off on an attack when you should

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.300
have taken the open shot.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.270
Your coach’s face shows the frustration
you both are feeling.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.270
Sound familiar?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.950
It gets replayed at just about every hockey
game on the planet, but fortunately, there

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.750
is an easy solution.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.229
You simply need to change your focus!

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.320
If you are out there on the ice thinking about
a mistake that happened earlier, you are focusing

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.420
on the past.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.090
The way out of that negative mental trap is
to focus on the present moment.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.290
Here’s an example of how you are already
able to do that …

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.750
When you go out to restaurant, do you stop
yourself from eating because sometime in your

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.090
past you ate a bad meal and maybe even got
sick from it?

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.120
Of course not.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.500
You read the menu, imagine eating what you
want (visualizing your success) and then you

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.500
order.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.159
When you are eating your food, you can stay
in the present moment by focusing on the smell

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.330
and taste of the food.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:06.621
Really look at the food and the scene in the
restaurant to be totally there in the present

00:02:06.621 --> 00:02:07.621
moment.

00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:11.680
Well that is exactly what you want to do after
a mistake on the ice!

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.590
Keep directing your thoughts back to the present
moment.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.219
This may sound like too simple of a solution,
but trust me if you can achieve this - it

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.650
will give you huge results.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.239
If your mind is in the present moment, your
past mistakes disappear - they don’t even

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.499
exist anymore.

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:39.200
Fear of making a mistake is nothing more than
your thinking stuck in the past and it certainly

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.410
does not help you avoid mistakes in the future-
it only hurts you!

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.169
So how do you do this?

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:50.760
When you catch yourself thinking about past
mistakes you simply re-FOCUS on the present

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.010
by drawing attention to your senses.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.700
Think about…How do my feet feel in these
skates?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.779
What does the puck sound like going across
the ice?

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.790
How does the mouth guard taste in my mouth?

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.439
Keep repeating to yourself “Get present,
right here, right now.”

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:17.819
Lot’s of athletes say, “I can do this
now, but my mind seems to run out of my control

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.040
during a game.”

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.849
This is what separates the top elite athletes
from the amateurs.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.150
They mentally train in advance and condition
their minds to stay focused in the present

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.029
so nothing rattles them game day.

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:39.620
Just like you practice and drill the mechanics
of the physical game, it is critical to train

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.500
your brain too.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.439
Every night before you go to bed or during
breaks in the day, practice taking your thoughts

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:54.879
back to the present moment by hyper focusing
on your senses.

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.839
Ask yourself what am I feeling right now?

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:03.269
It’s a skill that has to be practiced just
like a powerful slap shot.

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.120
You have to train your mind, just like you
train your muscles.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.079
If you train your brain to stay focused on
the present moment to block out any negative

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:26.510
thoughts, I promise it will make you unstoppable.
