00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:08.250
This video explains how to set up ePrint services to use on your printer or the HP ePrintCenter.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.120
ePrint is a free service that allows you to print documents and photos from any mobile

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.460
or network connected device to your HP ePrint-enabled

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.560
printer.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.820
In this step, we will show you how to enable Web Services. Web Services must be enabled

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.660
on your HP printer in order to use ePrint services.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.859
Before you can enable Web Services, you must have your printer connected to the Internet

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:36.070
through a wireless network connection. Because connecting

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.620
your printer to a wireless network is unique for your

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.750
system configuration, we will not provide those instructions here.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.110
On the printer's control panel, press the ePrint button.

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.149
Press the button next to OK to accept the terms of use and enable Web Services.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.020
Press the button next to OK again to enable automatic updates.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.930
At this point the printer will check for available updates for your printer.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.229
If a product update is pending, you must first perform the update to ensure that your printer

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.100
has the most up-to-date functionality.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.159
Touch OK to apply the update if one is available.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.770
After your printer has applied all product updates, an information page prints out.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.119
The information page contains the printer code you will use to register your printer

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.709
at the HP ePrintCenter.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:35.349
The next step is to register at the HP ePrintCenter. When you register at the HP ePrintCenter,

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:38.729
you can customize your ePrint settings, view and manage

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.959
your ePrint print jobs, and add new print apps to your printer.

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.770
From your computer open the web browser of your choice.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.329
Go to www.hpeprintcenter.com.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.709
In the upper right corner of the web page, click the Sign In button.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.719
A Sign In to ePrintCenter page opens.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.489
Click Create an account from the right side of the page.

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:11.640
The Create an HP Web Services account page opens.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.969
Enter your information in the text fields provided.

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:21.650
In the Screen Name field, use a name of your choice. This name is a unique identifier for

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.180
you on the HP ePrintCenter web page. If a name is already registered

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.030
by another user, you will be asked to choose a different screen name.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.810
Make sure to use a password you can easily remember.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.760
After entering all information and you have agreed with the terms of the site, click Create

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.150
Account.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.209
The Add a Printer to your Account page opens.

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.750
Using the Web Services information sheet you previously printed out, type your printer

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.920
code (listed on line 2) in the Enter Printer Code text box, and click

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.180
OK.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.730
A screen confirming your printer has been added to HP's ePrintCenter will display

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.219
on your computer screen.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.989
Click Next.

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.650
At this point you can enter a custom email address for your printer. You will first need

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.930
to clear the text box before entering your custom email address. You will

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.730
use this email address when you send print jobs to your printer using ePrint.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.060
Once you have entered a custom email address, click the Check button to verify the email

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.859
address you entered is available for you to use.

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:35.349
If the email address is currently in use by another ePrint user, you will be asked to

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.409
enter a different email address.

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.579
Once you have verified an email address that is available, click Save to add this email

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.889
address to your account.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.760
The HP ePrint Settings page opens.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.609
Using the menu on the HP ePrint Settings page, you can customize your ePrint options, including

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.879
printer options and adjusting who can send print jobs to your

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.180
printer. Once you have adjusted your desired settings, click Save.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.739
After clicking Save, you will return to the HP ePrintCenter where you can now manage your

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.959
ePrint settings, print jobs, and print apps.

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.859
Your printer is now set up to use ePrint services.
