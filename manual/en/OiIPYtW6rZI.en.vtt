00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.280
Hey check it out. You're looking
at the HP Pavilion ax6745

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.580
with a nice, like,
it's a special edition.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.820
It's a kind of a punk 
paint job right there.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.690
This is very cool.
It's not your typical black box

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.160
that you find everywhere else.
It's kind of a, I don't know

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.430
how well it comes across
from the studio here

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.520
but this coloring here,
this is not black,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.760
this is sort of a 
very deep green color

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.930
along with all the graphics
there in a ligher green.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.840
Which actually gives the case
a really distinct look.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.070
You don't usually see
that dark green

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.510
on a computer case
and it looks pretty sharp

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.380
if, you know,
if that's what you want.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.320
If you want a punk rock computer
it's finally arrived.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.050
Athlon Dual Core processor,
2.6 gigahertz, 4 gigs of DDR2 RAM,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.150
it has Vista Home Premium
64-bit pre-installed.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.850
320 gigabyte hard drive,
it has DVD-RW.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.760
It does support LightScribe
so you're going to be able

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.230
to burn all your labels 
directly on to those DVDs

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.730
without any problem.
Integrated Radeon 3200 Graphics.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.110
You know at least it's not
the Intel integrated graphics.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.730
It's going to be
a little bit better.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.840
You're going to be able to play
some of your older 3-D games,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.680
not any of the really 
new stuff but it's fine.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.250
You know if you're not
a heavy hard-core gamer

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.950
it's going to do you just fine.
And if you are,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.020
there's plenty of room
inside this case

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.260
to upgrade to a 
better video card

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.750
if you so desire. It has
b and g wireless built in

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.230
and it has 
Gigabit ethernet.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.530
So let's show you
the whole deal here,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.430
show you 
what's going on.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.830
Up here you have all of your
media card readers.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.400
You do have Express,
or you have Smart,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.030
you have Compact Flash,
you have SD,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140
you have memory stick.
Pretty much all the small format

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.640
and Compact flash
are going to work with this.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.940
That LightScribe DVD burner
located right here.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.650
A free expansion bay
right here.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.680
Underneath this 
little trap door

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.550
you've got a couple
of USB ports, Firewire

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.820
and microphone and 
headphone ports

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.690
located right up front
for you as well.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.590
Around the back this is 
what we've got going on here.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.130
Check it out. Surround sound
all right here

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.600
as well as a rear
microphone port.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700
You've got 4 USBs,
you've got Firewire

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.800
and your Gigabit
ethernet right here.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.920
You have DVI and D-Sub VGA
located on the back.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.380
You have coaxial 
digital output right here

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.680
and a couple of PS2 ports
round the back as well.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.130
Getting into the 
case very easy,

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.390
you simply have a
thumb screw right here.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.690
Pop off the side panel and this
is what we've got going on

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.060
on the inside.  There is your AMD
Dual Core processor right there.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:47.900
You've got 4 gigs of
RAM on board.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
As you can see all 4 of the
DIMM slots are being used

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.700
so if you want to upgrade 
this beyond 4 gigabytes

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.850
you're going to have to replace 
a couple of those DIMMs.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.070
Back there you're 
going to find

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.080
that 320 gigabyte
hard drive as well.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.780
One of the other things
you're going to notice

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.250
about this computer
is that the wireless

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.090
is not taking up
one of the PCI slots.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.160
In fact you see that 
every single PCI slot

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.060
on this machine is available.
You have 3 PCI x1 slots

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.330
and one PCI x16 slot
available to you.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.030
The wireless is actually
located right here

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.940
as you can see on the back,
there is an antenna

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.670
waiting for you right there 
but the actual wireless card

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.370
is right up here and that actually
attaches to the mother board

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.680
via USB so you're not wasting
one of your PCI slots

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.590
for your wireless connectivity
which is kind of nice

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.860
if you're planning on
expanding your machine.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.370
So there you have it, it's a
very basic, very simple computer,

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.500
but a great starting point for 
what could be a decent monster

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.200
or just a great computer
to have around

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.070
because it's simple 
and it's not super-expensive

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.610
and you know, darn it,
it looks pretty good.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.310
So it's the
HP Pavilion ax6745

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.500
and it's available right now.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.450
To get more info on the
HP Pavilion ax6745

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.350
go to any of these 
retailers you see here

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.950
and type in H25-10005.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.800
For ComputerTV, I'm Bauer.
