00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.110
jINXtaku13 asks

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.830
Since you guys didn't go to Korea for a study aboard program

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.040
how'd you make friends?

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.260
Did you guys have Korean friends before hand

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.780
or did you have friends at work?

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.290
Whooh that's actually a good question 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:16.890
Yes it is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.010
Actually being lonely in Korea

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.630
can be the major reason that someone might head home

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.680
Yet it seems if you come to Korea specifically 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.990
to like learn the Korean language

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.130
or go to an university here like on an exchange 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.140
You have a lot of people you can choose from to be friend with 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.040
and everyone is like

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.860
"GO KOREA"

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.060
because they are all here together 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.980
And you are all pretty much the same age group as well

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.990
if you are students in Korea

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.110
And it gives you many opportunity to meet Korea people

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.930
at your university as well as the foreign people living in your dorm 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.940
But here as a teacher there are two different options 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.960
Either in teaching privately or publicly 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.290
If you are teaching in a private school or hakwon 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.610
then you'll be lucky enough to have other foreigners with you 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.430
in the school

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.060
and they can initiate you to the happenings of the city

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.560
so they can show you where the foreigner bar is 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.780
they can tell you about the different clubs where they went out 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.790
so it's a little  easier for you in that way 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.810
BUT if you are a public school teacher 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.930
then you are the only foreigner at you job

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.740
If you work in a public school like elementary,middle or high school

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.390
You will be usually be the only person in the whole school 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.730
And from there you have to narrow it down to the some amount of people that 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:10.730
actually speak English 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.260
Because you are there to teach English 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.780
not there to learn Korean 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.690
So that pile of teachers at the school has now narrowed down to

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.510
significantly tothe people who speaks English 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.240
I would usually say it's between 3 and 8 people

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.660
Yah...my school had like 6 or so I think..

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.760
I had about like 8 people 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.590
maybe 3 of them had like really good English 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.990
Better than Martina though

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.730
there was 5 English teachers there 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.860
and 2 of them were like 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.360
"WTH! Which one of us suck at English?"

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.410
So what happened to my situation was that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.330
then I was in an awkward position  

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.560
because pretty much all the English teachers there 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.360
were older  married women with kids 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.880
So it was little bit awkward for me to be friends with them 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.890
because in Korea it's just not appropriate 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.910
for married guy to be friends with a married Korean woman  

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.540
And for couple of  the single girls 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.680
it was also inappropriate because I'm a married guy 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.890
and I shouldn't be making friends with them 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.590
Now of course, when we were teaching in Canada 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.610
that didn't really matter 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.330
you became friends with anyone in your office 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:01.840
like you went out with them

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.640
you had meetings with them

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.880
In Korea, you have like this social level 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.290
which creates a little bit of awkwardness when making friends

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.530
Even at your school

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.740
the person you became friends with 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.760
had like awkward social gap

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.190
Yah...actually the closest friend in Korea Seok Bok

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.710
Say hi to Seok Bok, everyone!!

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.430
We met in my school and she's older than me 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.640
so technically in Korea we are not suppose to be friends

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.880
She should be like an older person 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.890
but if she told me that if I called her Ajumma 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.090
She will kill me

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.930
You are suppose to, according to the rules of engagement

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.040
Be friends with people in your age  

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.690
but since she was older than you 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.030
that was little bit awkward sometimes supposedly at school 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.260
It wasn't awkward for us, of course we didn't really care

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.680
but other people were kind of like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.690
"Oh...that's really unusual that they are friends"

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.790
"Weird...."

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:43.410
Kind of an unusual thing 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.330
So outside of school which you spend most time in 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.140
If you don't find anyone that you mash well with 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.780
you go back to your apartment and that's it

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.880
There's literally no one around

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.030
You have to make an effort to go up and meet other people in Korea

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.160
and it's not as traditional as that you are used to 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.860
you know what I mean?

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.290
So for example, you've been here in Korea for a little bit awhile

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.510
and you haven't made many friends 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.010
and when you see a foreigner in the streets, you go like

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.660
"Ah!!! My god...It's someone like me.."

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.390
And then you run up to them and start talking 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.510
and you can develop a friendship that way

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.230
While in North America, if you ran up to a stranger

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.740
and be like OMG, It's a foreigner

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.980
it might be a little bit awkward 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.310
You're kind of  a crazy puppy, you're like  

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.740
"Would you be friends like me????"

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.540
"We can be friends.."

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.280
Actually good friends of us in Korea appoarch us that way as well

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.190
What's up Isabelle? We're talking about you!

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.210
Except for running around in the streets 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.930
if you are lucky enough to have a foreign bar nearby 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.840
that is a really great way to meet people  

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.660
But again, it's also socially weird 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.810
Because it kind of throws away those ideas of coming in with friends

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.710
and sticking with friends

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.230
You kind of like float, like you might go in there alone 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.860
and you might see a group of people 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.910
and go up to them and say 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.010
"Hi, I'm new, where are you from? What's your name?"

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.640
It's almost like being in junior kindergarden again, isn't it?

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.440
Yah...

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.660
Hey guys...can I have you toys...?Can I play with you?

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.780
Because if you don't do that..

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.390
you will not make any friends 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.230
There is no way to make friends without getting yourself out there 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.360
There are other ways to get involved with meeting other people in Korea

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.060
like different language cafes 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.290
or different trips that you can go on 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.190
to different programs

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.130
Yah, they have like adventure trips that you can get together

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.560
and go ski boarding and snow boarding 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.280
Ski boarding? 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.890
What's ski boarding???

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.390
Ski boarding is when you take your skis 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.210
and strap them on to your snow boards

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.630
and you snowboard like that 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.540
and then you go off like a jump

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.260
you let go off it and it's like a little rocket chipping out of it

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.980
and you're like....

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.810
and you hop on boards and you land on it 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.560
God.. did you just made that up? 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.780
I did make it up

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.790
oh......

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.330
That's why I don't have any friends

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.840
I'll be your best friend 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.060
Do you wanna go out on a date?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.160
That sounds like a really good time

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.580
Hey

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:32.080
Hey

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.290
Why don't we just get married  

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.410
We should do that 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.430
I like you...

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.440
Do you wanna get a dog?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.640
Let's get an ugly dog 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.960
Let's name him Spudgy

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.180
and dye him blue

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.410
and then we'll spend all of our time in our apartment making videos

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.830
and do not socialize

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.280
I'd just realized that we are really awkward people 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.990
WHAT??? Why would you say that

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.310
Turtle

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.040
I really think that being a foreigner in Korea

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.660
who has been here for awhile 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.680
somewhat being like a vampire 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.390
Is it because you are sexy and hot?

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.190
Well, that's one of them but there is another ...

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.440
Is it because that you sleep at your night time all the time?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.760
That was a trick question 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.280
because vampires sleep during the day

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.380
Is it because I burn easily on the sun?

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.410
That's one of them

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:08.330
Because my skin really pale?

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.640
No..actually there is a point I'm trying to get in

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:11.260
OH.....Please go ahead

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.080
Whenever you watch a vampire movie or a TV shows

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.090
you always hear about the older vampires saying about 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.410
how upset they are because they can't really make friends 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.830
or family with anyone because they are gonna die and just drop off

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.960
The same thing kind of happens in Korea

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.480
in  like in a micro level 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.990
because if you have been here a few years like we have

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.610
We have had friends like one year and then drop off

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:30.930
and then a new friend will come in 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.730
and they would like move away to another country

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.940
We have been friends with them for like two years 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.840
and then we're like

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.360
"We've found our best friends!!"

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.060
and they are like

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.660
"We are going to move away.."

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.380
We're like

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.710
OH......

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:39.630
We're like mini vampires here

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.030
That's one of the sucky parts 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.960
Get it???

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:42.690
SUCKY

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.710
VAMPIRE!!

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.510
So when you are 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.840
you have to be proactive when you are making friends in Korea

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.560
You have to go to them and find them 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.090
Anyways, if you've had other ways to make friends

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.190
let us know in the comments 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.830
Or if you want to be my best friends 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:54.730
let me know on the comment 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.360
oh let's leave a comment to Simon that his best friend is Martina  

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.180
Yes

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.780
YAH!!!

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.580
Beat you guys to it 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.490
We're best friends..

Let's go play Cantan, not that we're addicted 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.330
So that's it for today's TL:DR

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:07.960
If you have questions for next TL:DR 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.780
leave your question in the comment section below

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.790
And make sure you've checked out the the questions that were already asked

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:12.810
You can thumb them up

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:13.930
or thumb them down

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.030
And the ones that get to the top 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:16.360
we might just choose those 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.290
or we might choose another ones that has no thumbs up that we like

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.810
Were we suppose to answer about the babies last week?

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.930
oh...but we had to cut off for ....right

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:24.840
ok ...Let's try it again 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.760
Seriously... so.. here's the real thing

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.693
The thing about having babies...it should...
