Hi, I'm Agriculture
Secretary Tom Vilsack.

00:00:05.667 --> 00:00:07.233
I'm standing in the
People's Garden on the

00:00:07.233 --> 00:00:10.066
grounds of USDA's Whitten
Building in Washington DC

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.800
to update you about the
progress of our People's

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.500
Garden Initiative.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.834
This past summer, I
encouraged all USDA

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:18.967
employees to participate in
the People's Garden movement.

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:20.867
Hundreds of you responded
to this challenge.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:23.467
I'd like to thank all
of you who got involved.

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.834
Today, as a result of your
hard work and passion,

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:28.867
there are 124 USDA
People's Gardens around

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:32.400
the United States and 1
in Seoul, South Korea.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.200
And USDA employees are
planting new People's

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.266
Gardens all the time.

00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:37.934
I also want to update
you on our progress in

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:40.133
expanding the People's
Garden here in Washington to

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.166
include the entire grounds
of the Whitten Building.

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:45.266
Our plans include a wide
variety of sustainable

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.233
gardening practices that
can also be adopted at home.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.333
The finished garden will
help educate the public on

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.500
how to use water wisely,
how to choose the right

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.567
plant for the right
site and climate,

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.900
and how to create
habitat for wildlife.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.467
We've also been working
hard to prepare the

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:02.233
nation's demonstration plot
for the cooler months ahead.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:05.000
We're planting cover crops
like barley and winter rye

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.734
to provide soil cover
during the winter.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.000
Cover crops are one of the
most cost-effective and

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.633
environmentally sustainable
ways to improve soil health.

00:01:13.633 --> 00:01:16.300
They control soil erosion,
protect water quality,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.200
and provide food and
protection for wildlife.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.567
A garden is a terrific
way for us to connect with

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:25.400
local communities and
showcase what we do at USDA.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.200
In this garden, in just
the past few months,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.967
we harvested 300 pounds
of vegetables and donated

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:31.900
them to a local food bank.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.967
Chefs have come here to
share recipes and demonstrate

00:01:34.967 --> 00:01:38.967
nutritious and delicious ways
prepare fruits and vegetables.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.233
We also held weekly
workshops with helpful

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:43.967
gardening tips for
compost and fertilizer.

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:46.000
And just the other day,
my wife Christie helped

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.367
celebrate the creation of
a new People's Garden at

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.467
an elementary school
in Washington DC.

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.967
Let me end by sharing an
exciting story: Recently,

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:57.633
we heard from two
sisters, Jane Ray and

00:01:57.633 --> 00:02:00.967
Jill Burkindine,
of Carthage, Texas.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:02.667
Their father, who had
served as the Mayor of

00:02:02.667 --> 00:02:04.667
Carthage, passed away and
they had been looking for

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:07.300
an appropriate way
to honor his memory.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.533
Jane was ironing shirts
when she saw First Lady

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:11.767
Michelle Obama on
television addressing USDA

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.900
employees about the
People's Garden Initiative.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.600
This moment inspired Jane
and her sister to take two

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.900
acres of land that had
once belonged to their

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.667
father and donate them to
the town of Carthage to

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.900
create a People's Garden.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.800
They will dedicate the
garden next spring and all

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
of the fresh food they
grow will be donated to a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.033
local charity to
help those in need.

00:02:32.033 --> 00:02:34.200
This story demonstrates
the power that gardens

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.100
have to make a difference
in local communities.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.066
It's also a reminder that
now is a great time to

00:02:39.066 --> 00:02:40.900
start thinking about
planting a People's Garden

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.767
next spring - and that if
you have one planted - to

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:45.400
share your story
with photos or video,

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.734
with the People's Garden
contact in your agency.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:51.433
Please consider joining
the People's Garden movement.

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:54.166
You can be the face of
USDA in your community and

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:56.300
help us spread our
message about the value of

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.166
sustainable agriculture
and healthy lifestyles.

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.967
Thanks so much
for listening.
