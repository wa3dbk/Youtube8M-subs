00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.100
Hey I’m Stephen Schweickart with this episode
of ReelSEO’s ReelRebel.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.120
We’ve given you a brief rundown of how to
crush that depth of field, now let’s focus

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.110
on one of those elements, the F-stop.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:22.020
Here’s a lot of words for you so be sure
to take notes.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.529
On a lens, the f-stop number affects the size
of the lens’ aperture by controlling the

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:27.529
iris.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.529
Got it?

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.529
No.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.050
OK here’s a simpler explanation.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.480
Imagine your eye is the lens and the pupil
is the aperture, or size of the opening letting

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.720
light into your eye.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.660
Your iris changes size in different situations
to make sure your retinas (I have no idea

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.760
where those are so I can’t point to them)
don’t get fried from too much sunlight.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.960
On your eye, the iris controls itself automatically,
but on a camera it’s controlled on a scale

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.320
of numbers called the F-Stop scale.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.320
And it’s very important to understand how
the scale works in order to keep control over

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.320
your image.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.510
So let’s take a look at it, shall we?

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.430
The scale starts down here at one and can
go all the way up to 32 on a normal scale,

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.440
with the amount of light decreasing as the
number rises.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.650
So an f/2.0 will let in more light than an
f/11.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.040
That part is pretty straight forward.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.680
Smaller numbers equals more light, which you
know from our last depth of field video equals

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.650
shallower depth of field.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.350
You may think the numbers on this scale are
arbitrary, but they actually represent the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.720
ratio between the size of the aperture, and
the focal length of the lens, which is the

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.990
distance from the aperture to the film plane
where the image is captured.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.909
Using a DSLR to shoot gives you a lot of simple
options for maximizing your aperture so you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.950
keep that depth of field nice and slim.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.510
First, put the camera on Manual.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.920
If Terminator taught us anything it’s that
you can’t trust machines and they may try

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.409
to murder you in order to keep your unborn
son from leading the rebellion in the near

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.710
future.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.610
Not sure what that has to do with video, but
nonetheless putting the camera on Auto is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.650
the first step towards that future, do you
really want that?

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.920
Anyway, putting the camera to manual let’s
you first control the f-stop, which for now

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.389
we’ll assume you want as wide open as the
lens will allow, letting in as much light

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.560
as possible.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.569
From here, DSLRs have a handy dandy feature
that let’s you select what ISO or sensitivity

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.640
you want to shoot at.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.389
Now pay attention, this can get tricky.

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:31.939
While the lower the f-stop the more light
you get, the HIGHER the ISO the more light

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:32.959
you get.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.109
So with the f-stop all the way open, you’ll
likely need to lower the ISO to keep your

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.629
shots from being blown out.

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.359
It’s a simple process, but it will take
some tweaking.

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:43.359
PHEW!

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.930
That was a lot of information, but once you
process all of that mess you’ll have a better

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.980
understanding of f-stop, aperture, and iris,
and ultimately will achieve ultimate control

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.980
over your image.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.269
We’re talking about your camera image, not
your personal image... that one, not salvageable.

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.889
