Hi everyone,

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.689
so today we're taking a look at a new
application called Carbon that's been released

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.039
by the guys that created the Clockwork Mod

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.060
which is a popular roming tool.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.920
So this particular application is very
similar to Titanium Backup which if you're a 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.039
rooted user you will probably have used already for keeping

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.579
backups and restores of all of your Android applications and data.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.239
This app is much easier to use for the
general public

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.079
not as many settings to fiddle with not quite as confusing etcetera but 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.539
also doesn't quite have the same level of
power tools

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.960
as Titanium Backup but,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.880
what you do, install the application and it will then ask to sync to your Google drive account

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.670
you can also add your dropbox account
as well

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.560
and then all you need to do on backup
select the applications you would like to back up

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.750
to the cloud

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.470
hit the backup button and select where you're going to back up to.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.530
You can then set a password if you want to encrypt the data

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.040
or just start the back up running and off it goes.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.630
It will back it all up onto your dropbox folder
or into your Google drive into a separate folder 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.690
called Carbon

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.609
and then you can use this application to
read that folder in the cloud storage

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.160
and restore any of your applications as well.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.490
If an application has been marked as
protected

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.740
and it sits in your cloud storage, you have to 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.409
download the application manually to your device from the Google

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.390
Play Store then restore your data on top by the looks of it.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.280
But as an easy

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.820
to use tool

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.440
this is absolutely fantastic and I think
it's going to become the new Titanium

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.380
Backup as it were that everyone is recommending and talking about. It's so easy to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.450
use for the general public. It does still require
root access, you do need to be rooted,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.890
although the creators have said that  there will be a non rooted version 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.940
coming along fairly soon.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.000
If you want to get this check in my
description there's currently a closed

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.470
beta available and the file is available for download.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.390
It should be released in a couple of  weeks time, this beta actually times out I think

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.770
on the 22nd, 26th of January so you've only got a few days to really 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.500
test this out but hopefully there will be an updated file pushed out

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.699
with some bug fixes and making this an official
release.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.779
It really is a fantastic tool, it's going to save
people a lot of  time and effort and more

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:19.779
importantly this one is nice and simple to use for the general Android community.
