00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.574
Hello! I missed you. it's been so long.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.283
But I've been enjoying this summer in beautiful New York City.

00:00:07.283 --> 00:00:10.430
Here are some summer highlights.

00:00:22.626 --> 00:00:26.514
But yes, lets talk about the shameless, and how to actually be shameless.

00:00:26.514 --> 00:00:32.099
Utilize your network. And the best way to do 
 that is with the people you know.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.434
So I sent out my first mass email this week.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:42.594
And it was actually pretty terrifying. Because I've never 
 done it, one, and two, it's just like...

00:00:42.594 --> 00:00:44.966
I don't want people to like, think this is spam.

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.872
And these are your friends and family--it won't be spam.

00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:52.318
And there's always that unsubscribe button on the bottom, so... yes.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:57.722
There are a myriad of different emailing management tools out there,

00:00:57.722 --> 00:01:00.925
and the one that I decided to go with was Mail Chimp.

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:03.866
Yeah, come closer, I'll show you. Okay?

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:07.173
Let's go on a.. let's go on a journey on my iPad.

00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:09.852
So yeah, this is Mail Chimp guys.

00:01:09.852 --> 00:01:16.670
And it's cool, that's what it looks like. You can log 
 in with Facebook, and you can put in jpegs,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:23.046
write a little note to people, you can pick 
 the color, the font, all that nice stuff.

00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:29.123
And send--let them know. Now don't be, you know, tacky about it.

00:01:29.123 --> 00:01:34.064
Don't slam 'em over the head every week, but 
 once a month. Like, every other week.

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:35.423
I'm gonna do once a month.

00:01:35.423 --> 00:01:41.050
There is a lot of... happenings happening when I'm not here with you.

00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:48.360
I am re-branding because I want my name 
 to be associated with shameless. Shameless Maya.

00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:55.050
And that means I need to visually put together a 
 brand. Like a logo, a website, you know?

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.580
All that fun stuff. A Facebook like page.

00:01:58.015 --> 00:02:03.320
I haven't been promoting this site--this challenge I've been doing, because...

00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:07.530
I have to define what it is that I'm doing.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:13.020
So. I am actually gonna start a new YouTube channel, 
 because I have way too many social identities.

00:02:13.017 --> 00:02:18.200
As I'm sure you guys do, too. You 
 know, you got like, multiple identity crisis.

00:02:18.197 --> 00:02:23.900
We need to simplify. People need to be able to 
 be like, Maya? Oh, you mean that crazy girl?

00:02:23.901 --> 00:02:28.280
Because at the end of the year, I need to be shameless. 
 By the end of the year, I should be so shameless,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.930
that I explode.

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:36.390
So yeah. Thank you guys for supporting me, liking me, following me.

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:40.580
Do uncomfortable things. Things that you're afraid of doing. 

00:02:40.583 --> 00:02:44.590
That will benefit you and what you're trying to put out there.

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:47.320
Anyways I love you guys. I'm gonna have some fun now.

00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:04.120
Shameless! Tell em-- tell the people who's shameless.
