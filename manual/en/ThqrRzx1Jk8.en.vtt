Hi, I’m Drew.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.750
My name is John, we’re from a band called
Switchfoot, we’re going to be showing off

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.291
our favorite on the road iPhone apps rights
here on App Judgment.

00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:13.291
Awesome, can I see?

00:00:13.291 --> 00:00:14.291
Nope, nope.

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:15.291
That’s nice, that’s really good.

00:00:15.291 --> 00:00:16.500
Come on you guys, just a peak, I won’t tell
anyone.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.970
That is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.500
I’ve never seen that.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:41.020
Annie, you’re going to have to watch the
show to find out what apps we’re using.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:51.440
Hi guys, its Annie Gaus, welcome to App Judgment,
you’re source for mobile app news and reviews

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
from revision3.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.041
Let’s dive into some viewer mail with a
question from Ken who writes in “A very

00:00:56.041 --> 00:00:59.350
long time ago you reviewed an application
called YAP!

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.800
The second I got my iPhone I downloaded and
loved this app.”

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.900
Well apparently Yap is going away on 10/20
and I was wondering if you or anyone else

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.680
knows of another option (beside Google Voice).”

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.320
Thanks, a fan.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.440
Unfortunately it is true that Yap is going
away but the good news is there are some alternatives

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.080
even if you are not one for Google Voice.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.000
A couple of services that come to mind are
Voice Cloud and Phone Tag, though neither

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.040
are free.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.470
Assuming you are looking for something that
is free or free-ish, I’d check out YouMail.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.300
You can sign up for a free trial and there
are also premium plans available starting

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.190
at $1.99 per month but you do at least get
something for free with this one.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.310
And if you do end up downloading it, please
let me know what you think or if any of you

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.920
guys have a favorite way of managing your
voice mail please let me know on Twitter on

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.400
@anniegaust or the show @appjudgment.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.570
Now, between IOS 5 and the iPhone 4S coming
out, there have been a lot of changes in the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.229
mobile world and Jamie Hill asked the question
Find my Phone for the iPhone.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.979
He writes in, “so with the new update is
Find My iPhone now free to use or is there

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:54.979
a cost?

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.830
I want to know before I turn it on.”

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.869
Very good question, I too know the pain of
losing your phone.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.159
But the good news is, it is free.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.940
What used to be mobile me and was about $100
a year is now being absorbed into the iCloud,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.930
which gives you a basic minimum storage level
of 5 gigs and is free, so yes, the answer

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.569
is it is free, great news for those of us
who have a tendency to mis-place our phones.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.480
And finally, we get quite a bit of email here
at App Judgment, including many press releases

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.090
that we wish we had the time to review.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.700
So we are going to reach into the AJ inbox
and pass along some of these cool looking

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.689
ones along to you guys.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:28.959
