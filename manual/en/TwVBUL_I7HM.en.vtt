00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.258
This is the new Ford Escape. A top-to-bottom redesign of one of 
 the most important models in the red hot small SUV segment.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.610
Ford let us borrow this early example. So let's go take a first look.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.225
The previous Escape has been on sale for 12 long years.

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:23.015
It's utilitarian, unrefined and boxy. And it's time for a change.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.204
The new Escape is a lot sleeker. Styling and furnishings 
 made a big move upscale with the redesign. 

00:00:29.703 --> 00:00:31.895
The interior is nicely finished with a soft touch dash.

00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:37.504
The updated kinder, gentler MyFord Touch touch screen with 
 bigger buttons and fonts is available. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.394
But it's a long reach to the screen. And the dashboard 
 contours block your access to some of the buttons.

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:49.502
The rather firm rear seats have decent space but it's not 
 as roomy back there as competitors like a Honda CR-V.

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:53.586
There is a giant cargo hold, though, as well as a neat trick. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.190
You can wave your foot under the bumper to open or close 
 the rear hatch. That's great if your hands are full.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.993
Most Escapes are going to have an EcoBoost turbo-charged 4-cylinder engine.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.452
Either a 1.6L or the 2.0L that's in the car we're driving now.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:14.779
You won't be able to get an optional V6, but the 
 2.0L turbo, it has 240 hp in other applications.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:23.500
It's plenty quick. You're not going to miss the V6 even when it comes 
 to towing. Because the turbocharged 4-cylinder, it can tow the same 3,500 pounds.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.421
Our initial driving impressions are that the Escape feels quite 
 solid and substantial for this class. Rather grownup.

00:01:31.754 --> 00:01:37.558
The ride is better than you'd expect from a small SUV with the 
 19-inch wheels and tires that are on this top trim titanium version.

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:43.780
The interior is relatively quiet with subdued engine noise 
 in what is normally a noisy class. 

00:01:45.634 --> 00:01:48.630
Handling feels fairly responsive. It feels agile, it has good steering.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.580
The Escape is an extremely important model for Ford. We'll buy one when it goes 
 on sale to thoroughly test it here at the Consumer Reports Test Track.
