Hi this is Karen for Expert Village. Now we
will show you how to make your own designer

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.080
envelopes. What you would need is a piece
of paper eight and a half by eleven, it could

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.080
be a firm paper. It could be pretty much anything
that you want paper, a ruler, a marking pencil,

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.570
and exacto knife or some other kind of blade
to cut with and some double stick tape or

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:38.920
glue. We would start by folding up our bottom
edge one half of a inch. So take the ruler

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.469
and place it one half inch. Now if you want
you can mark it first like this, a half inch

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:56.960
in two spots. Then place the ruler on the
two markings and just fold that up holding

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:06.060
the ruler down firmly and creasing the paper
along the ruler. There you have that crease.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:14.730
Now you want to do the sides one inch. I'm
going to put a inch there and then also on

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:22.230
this side there is your one inch. Then move
down to the bottom and again mark a inch from

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:33.030
the outside edge to the inside a inch. Then
we are going to again crease; place the ruler

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.060
along the two markings and lift the paper
and crease it. Like this and turn it around

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:52.030
and repeat it over on the other side. Like
that and crease it. Okay! Now you are going

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.659
to fold them and fold them in just get that
crease nice and crisp.
