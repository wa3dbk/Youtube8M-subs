-Otter Pups Help Reduce CO2 Emissions-

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.680
The two otter pup brothers are going through their quarantine period.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.300
Before entering their sanctuary, keepers need to sanitize themselves and wear proper clothing.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.660
The otter pups rush forward excitedly.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.500
It's probably because they're expecting food!

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.860
The two brothers are healthy and active.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.700
They're so cute when they're pressed against the wall

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.020
that the keepers that care for them daily can't resist!

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.500
However, due to their claws and playful bites,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.920
they will accidentally leave "love marks" on their keepers!

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.640
Such a sweet burden!

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.020
Occasionally, the two brothers will play a game of nipping each other.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.980
"Watch me pin you to the ground!"

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.900
Now it's the two brothers' favorite activity: fishing.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.600
They realized keepers have bowls of fish in their hands.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.300
And they know it's time for "fishing!"

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.100
They dove in the tub full of feeder goldfish and newts.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.620
*Big Brother*

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.220
The older otter has improved dramatically on his fishing skills.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.960
He's faster than his younger brother!

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.080
The younger brother tends to bring his newt back to his "nest."

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.780
"Yum!"

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.600
"Yummy!"

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.440
The older brother likes to show off his appetite in front of people.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.480
"Now I can impress other people!"

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.700
After devouring the newts, now its time for feeder goldfish!

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.600
Due to the fact feeder goldfish are smaller in size,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.760
the two brothers usually finish all the fish in the tub.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.620
No matter what they eat, the two otter cubs will finish all their food.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.780
This portrays the fact that they are conserving resources.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.300
No wonder they are the spokespersons of "Zoos and Aquarium for 350."

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.220
They are working for the case of preventing global warming

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.160
and notifying people to lower the CO2 below 350PPM.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.280
Of course, the zoo is the first to take action!

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.320
Last year, solar panels have been installed in five sections of the zoo.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.660
It lower 45,068kg (99,358lb) worth of CO2. ("Impressive!")

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.980
The zoo also installed T5 energy efficient bulbs and rainwater collectors.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.180
From 6/5 to 8/31, the zoo will promote

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.960
an event called "Saving@zoo Taipei Zoo Saving Energy Program."

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.600
It could be seen on the billboard on facility 7.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.380
Welcoming you guys to come and participate! ("Welcome you guys!")

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.060
Second session of voting for the otter pups' names.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.640
Their names will either be:

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.400
OtÃ© and LutÃ©, Da-Qan and Xiao-Qin, Qin-Gu-Wei and Qin-Gu-Yi, Yu-Yo and Yu-Lu, Qin-O and Qin-Yah, Ping-Ping and An-An, Qin-Tze-Yo and Qin-Tze-Tsai, Qin-Yong and Qin-Tzan

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.080

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.240
