00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.700
Now that that's pit...

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:15.740
Hey guys, this is Lacey Baier with A Sweet
Peach Chef, and today, we're going to be making

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.830
my mashed sweet potato recipe.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.769
These mashed sweet potatoes are super duper
easy to make and get done ridiculously fast.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.429
Plus, they make a great side to any meat dish,
and they only take three ingredients to make.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.650
It's ridiculous.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.310
Let's get started.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.430
First, we need to steam the sweet potatoes,
so go ahead and fill a deep pot with about

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.449
two inches of water and then put that on the
stove top and cook on high heat until that

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.960
becomes a rolling boil.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.670
Next, start cutting up the sweet potatoes
and you want to try to make them all the same

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.050
size pieces so that they cook evenly on the
water.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.619
Now, steam the potatoes until they're super
tender when you poke them with a fork and

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.210
that should probably take about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.979
So now, either using a stand mixer or a food
processor or your muscles, go ahead and mash

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.310
everything together until it's fully pureed.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.720
There's no need to remove the skin, but if
you really aren't partial to the skin, you

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.590
can remove it at this time.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.540
Once it's pureed mix in the brown sugar and
the cinnamon.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.310
If you find that it's not sweet enough when
you add in just the first two tablespoons

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.610
of brown sugar, you can add in up until the
four tablespoons of brown sugar just to make

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.570
sure you get the right amount of sweetness.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.530
So, there you have it, super easy and fast
mashed sweet potatoes.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.530
Thanks guys.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.530

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.650
Thank you.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.400
Just super easy, so let's get started.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.400
No.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.100
Pea is sweet, so...

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.979
Pork and...Pork.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.480
Nice and whipped.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.530
Now that that's..

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.880
Hand mixer, or I don't want to say hand mixer.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.260
Standing mixer.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.700
Standing mixer.
