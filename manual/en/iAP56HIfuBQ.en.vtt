00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
We are American made

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.000
Whenever you use in your sharpener on
scissors, it's nice to oil up with some

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.330
three in one oil. Can get it in any store.
Just a little drip right in the cross section.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.520
should use it on knives and
everything you use sharpener on. okay, when

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.619
you're doing scissors, don't matter what
kind you got. open them up, you go against

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.880
the cutting edge on the sharpener. Just
eyeball it and follow your edge.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.050
What this does  it scrapes down just a
little bit each time you do it. Making it

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.180
flat and shiny again. When you see it
shining up, you'll turn it, you'll get a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.670
little burr right on this inside corner,
hold it tight, push the burr off. usly these

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.630
to four swipes will knock the
burr off. some of your scissors are going

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.309
to find you can hold them on the edge of
a counter, take the flat side of the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.520
scissors, hold it up against the pen. the
top pen will pick up on the cutting edge

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.670
push down to keep it flat and pull it
through the pin will adjust itself to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.959
follow the edge on your scissors
because we're  a round flexible

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:23.929
pin you can grab any angle on any blade

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.090
meat cutting scissors, same way edge of
the counter hold them flat pull them through.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:41.189
keeps the flat side flat. the
sharp side sharp, turn them around grab

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.959
bevel up on the other side, you can
take the screw out if you like but you

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.649
really don't need to

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.750
I found I can do the gardening Clippers
from out in the garage when they get rusty

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.500
from sitting all winter. use the side of
your pin. flow the cutting edge and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.979
they'll scrape it down making it flat
and shiny, turn them up, knock the burr off

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.660
If there real knuckled up.Put them on
the edge of the counter, undo your bolt if need.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:21.140

through,keeps the flat side flat grabs

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.430
