Okay folks, in this clip I'm going to teach
you how to draw a superhero. And the key to

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.990
drawing superheros is to know basically the
type of character that you're drawing. You're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.119
drawing essentially what is, you know, become
known in fiction as a god like heroic character.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.650
And there are traits that you give to these
god like heroic characters that really help

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.160
sell the fact that they are not your average
human beings. One thing, they're very strong,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.610
most of the times, at least relatively speaking,
they're very strong physical features, they

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:50.010
have, in a sense the perfect bodies. So when
you go in to sketch them, or to draw them,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.060
keep that in mind, that you're drawing essentially
a person that is not your average everyday

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.030
human being, and just kind of keep that in
mind as you draw the frame. Now the frame

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:15.160
of the average superhero, let me go back to
sort of the ancient, the old school style

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:22.190
superheros especially, they're very, not just
the type of body that they have, which obviously

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.810
you're going to want to draw a character that
has got a very impressively fit body, it's

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.670
also the pose that you create for them too,
sort of a heroic pose as well, it's equally

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:51.920
important when creating superhero. You want
to emphasize their best physical traits, the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.670
different body definitions, and give them
a pose that's really going to cause them to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.340
stand out. Like if for example, one heroic
pose, especially if you're going to be drawing

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.810
a character that can fly, I'm going to show
you that pose right now, it's all in the arms

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:18.319
really, this pose, strong powerful stance
and the hand balled up into a fist. And you'll

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.050
do both arms, less this way. Make sure you
clearly define the muscles as you kind of

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.550
come down, and the very end, as you draw the
thumb, and the clenched fist hand, you draw

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.880
it really clearly defined, just like that.
And often times they'll have some sort of

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.471
gloves or, I don't know, whatever their costume
is. But obviously, if you're creating your

00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:45.490
own superhero, you're going to come up with
your own costume. So as you work your way

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.430
down, just make sure again, that you clearly,
clearly define there bodies, and make sure

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:06.110
that they are impressive as you can make them.
And if you are creating a character that can

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:18.069
fly, here's a good fine pose for you, one
knee up, one leg down, and we're going to

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.531
do a little force perspective here. His leg
will seemingly get smaller, as it kind of

00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:34.480
goes into the distance there, but really it
is just a force perspective. And force perspective

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.430
are everything, especially in the comic book
world. Kind of get to know your poses, basically

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.650
is what I'm trying to say, figure out how
to draw the human body, and to really call

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.110
attention to the specific muscles and body
parts that you want to call attention to.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.879
And if you're going to create a fun pose,
like say this one, where the persons leg is

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.440
kind of coming behind their knee like that,
make sure you clearly define it so that everyone

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.870
understands what it is you're trying to do.
I often times do not recommend when you're

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.540
drawing superheros, using a permanent pen,
especially not at the beginning, and if you're

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.940
just kind of starting out, just learning,
but for the sake of visual demonstration,

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.500
I'm going to use the black pen here, because
obviously you can see it much clearer, and

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.650
it's easier to define the drawing this way,
instead of going over it with a pencil. If

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.770
you were creating a superhero from scratch,
which is essentially what I am doing, you'd

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.159
probably want to use a pencil to design your
early sketches. But yes, once you've got-

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:44.259
basically the whole idea of drawing superheros
is all in the pose, and in the body type and

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:48.610
the form. So what I'm doing here is, I'm going
over the details that I have already, and

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:57.559
I'm really making sure that everything is
very impressive and essentially perfect. And

00:04:57.559 --> 00:05:02.550
once you've figured out how to draw the perfect
human body, and the perfect heroic pose, you

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:10.220
are well on your way, my friend, to being
a professional superhero, graphic novel, artist.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:18.440
So get the pose down, understand the way the
human body is meant to look under a certain

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.899
physical circumstances, and you are well on
your way.
