00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:03.454
The ones that have seized the power
in this kingdom are the lions.

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:06.954
There are about 2,000 lions
in the Serengeti.

00:00:06.954 --> 00:00:09.864
The lion is the only one in 35 animals
comprising the cat family

00:00:09.864 --> 00:00:12.208
that live in a group.

00:00:12.208 --> 00:00:14.328
The group is matrilineal,

00:00:14.328 --> 00:00:18.133
and this family is composed of
the grandmother called "Namanga",

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:21.336
her 2 grown daughters
and 9 grandchildren.

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:30.102
One of the reasons lions
live in a group is

00:00:30.102 --> 00:00:32.548
that it helps
when raising their offsprings.

00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:35.084
A mother lioness does
not only feed its own offsprings.

00:00:35.084 --> 00:00:38.499
Offsprings are fed by many lionesses,
receive a variety of different antibodies

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.867
and this improves immunity.

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:44.263
In case the mother dies, the grandmother
or the aunt takes the mother's place.

00:00:53.524 --> 00:00:57.799
The community life is effective for
protecting the offsprings from predators.

00:01:06.387 --> 00:01:10.241
Hyenas are the most dangerous animals
to a mother lion with her cubs.

00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:13.994
A moment of not paying attention
will give the hyena enough time
to snatch a precious baby lion.

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:33.570
The grandmother, "Namanga",
decides to move to another place

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.824
for the safety of her offsprings
and to look for food.

00:01:46.492 --> 00:01:49.348
Herds of gnus are commonly
found in the Serengeti,

00:01:49.348 --> 00:01:51.752
and they are the favorite game
of lions.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.437
Namanga and her two daughters
chase the gnus.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:09.813
Namanga prepares to hunt.

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:18.853
The offsprings hide themselves
and watch this tense moment.

00:02:39.772 --> 00:02:43.714
The lion catches its game and bites
the nose or the neck to suffocate it.

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:46.610
After a desperate battle
with a 200kg large gnu,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.087
the lion is thoroughly exhausted.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:57.696
Now the offsprings come out
to feast alongside their mothers.

00:03:04.426 --> 00:03:07.139
The lions divide the food
evenly with everyone

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.883
whether or not
they participated in the hunt.

00:03:08.883 --> 00:03:12.208
This is another reason
why they live in a group.

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:15.291
An uninvited guest has arrived.

00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:19.959
There is no way to avoid the hyena
that can smell blood from 20km away.

00:03:21.483 --> 00:03:25.239
Another uninvited visitor has also come.
It's a vagrant male lion.

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:31.808
This vagabond can turn into a rampant beast
and snatch the food any moment.

00:03:37.355 --> 00:03:39.427
Attacking is the best defense.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:41.995
There's no chance of winning
if it's a one to one fight,

00:03:41.995 --> 00:03:44.984
but there are three,
they can surely defend themselves.

00:03:54.658 --> 00:03:58.081
Shooing away the enemy can
bring another danger.

00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:01.952
Namanga and her daughters
decide to eradicate the danger.

00:04:12.724 --> 00:04:14.154
When the lions are preoccupied,

00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:17.517
vultures and hyenas come and look for
chances to snatch away the lion cubs.

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.009
The offsprings are watching the fight
hiding inside the grass,

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.605
left behind without protection.

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:35.181
Namanga is exasperated at the intruders
and vents her anger at the vulture.

00:04:36.793 --> 00:04:40.830
She successfully drives away the intruders,
but she loses something greater.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.881
The little lion that only moments ago

00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.341
was doing tricks becomes
the prey of a hyena.

00:04:53.912 --> 00:04:56.245
It took only a split second.

00:05:09.831 --> 00:05:14.051
Namanga hurries to gather
the offsprings and leaves.

00:05:19.502 --> 00:05:21.998
The survival rate for a lion cub
is very low.

00:05:21.998 --> 00:05:25.618
8 out of 10 lions die
within 2 years after birth.

00:05:28.455 --> 00:05:32.716
It is tough to walk through
50cm or higher grass.

00:05:32.716 --> 00:05:35.986
The mother leads her exhausted
offsprings to the road.

00:05:43.406 --> 00:05:47.474
And the youngest one collapses
from exhaustion.

00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:57.063
But the offspring's childish ways
never work with mother.

00:05:57.063 --> 00:06:01.587
The child must learn
the patience and endurance
in order to survive in the plain.

00:06:08.543 --> 00:06:11.059
There is another danger
in the roadway.

00:06:19.631 --> 00:06:22.051
Fortunately, the youngest
one manages to stay safe.

00:06:26.215 --> 00:06:29.406
Lions are famous
for their parental affection.

00:06:29.406 --> 00:06:31.166
Although they were apart
for just a moment,

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:34.314
they spend a long time caressing
each other.

00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:51.730
Namanga's family decides
to take a rest for a while here.

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:53.787
It's a wood bush
beside the roadway,

00:06:53.787 --> 00:06:58.546
but it provides a great shade
under the scorching sunlight
burning 35 degrees Celsius.

00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:05.266
Lions live within a 60 square
kilometers wide territory,

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:09.021
but they continue to move around to search
for food and water within the territory.

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:14.978
The grandmother, Namanga,

00:07:14.978 --> 00:07:17.470
cannot decide where to go
and decides to return to the plain.

00:07:21.642 --> 00:07:25.741
To the adult lions, it's a brook,
but to the cubs, it's a quite a big river.

00:07:46.553 --> 00:07:49.124
The brave and oldest offspring
takes the lead.

00:08:00.727 --> 00:08:02.524
Two cubs are left behind.

00:08:06.103 --> 00:08:10.319
The smarter one finds a spot
with the shortest breadth.

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:14.051
This is how young lions learn the way
of survival one by one.
