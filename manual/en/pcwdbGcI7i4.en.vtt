00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.399
Hi, we are gonna start to
preserve these tomatoes

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:05.870
that we have gotten,
you know, right in season

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.490
from our organic farm.
So we have got a tomato,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.380
it has been in here about
30 seconds or so,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.610
and it is just enough time
to make the skin blister.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:15.139
You do not want to cook
the tomato at all.

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.180
But I drop it in an ice bath--
it has already been ready.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.310
You want to have that ready
just so you do not overcook

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.110
your tomatoes.
Skin is gonna peel

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.450
right off of these,
and we come to

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.470
the side board here
and we are gonna cut those

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.680
maybe in quarters
because we are gonna

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.700
take these out
and cut off the cores

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.040
out of these.
You are gonna need about

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.470
2 1/2, 3 pounds of tomatoes
to can about one quart.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.500
Well it looks like I have
enough tomatoes here,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.410
and these smell
fantastic.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.480
Lets get these
in the jars.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.650
What I have over here is
some jars that have been

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.570
in boiling water,
real hot water,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.890
just to sterilize them,
but the other thing it does

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.630
is help from--
preventing glass breakage

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.020
when you go to drop `em
into boiling water.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.700
So I have these quart jars.
The other thing

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.920
I have is the lids.
The lids are here

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.551
in that same
simmering water

00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.790
for 10 minutes
just so it kind of activates

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.270
that seal that is on there.
We are gonna take the tomatoes

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.790
and start packing `em
in the hot jars.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.151
Obviously you want to be
careful that the jar is hot,

00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:17.650
but we are packing
the tomatoes in cold.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.010
There are a couple different
ways to do it,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.060
but we are gonna pack them
in their own juice.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.680
So we are gonna pack these
in there kind of as tight as we can.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.040
And once I get a
fair amount in there,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.330
I am gonna take a spatula
and I am gonna kind of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.760
pack these down inside.
And you are almost bruising

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.770
the side of these,
so you are letting out

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.890
some of the juice
which is gonna help

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.360
to fill the jar all the way up
and preserve the tomato.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.620
I am gonna make sure
when I pack my tomatoes

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.590
I am gonna leave about
a quarter of an inch space

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.030
between the lid and
the level of the tomatoes

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.790
to allow for
some expansion.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.810
Because we are using
a boiling can method,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.729
as opposed to a pressure
cooked can method,

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.781
we are gonna increase
the acidity of the tomatoes

00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:54.631
a little bit.
So I am gonna add a little bit

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:57.520
of lemon juice over the top.
And if you like,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.600
we are gonna add about
a teaspoon per quart

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.270
of salt--sea salt I use--
to each one of the jars.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.549
Still packed hot.
We are gonna take our lids.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.509
You can use this great,
little tool.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.239
It is basically a magnet
on the end of a stick

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.230
that allows me to get into
this simmering water.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.090
You want to make sure
it is not boiling because

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.939
you are gonna get rid of that
kind of seal that we need

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.519
which is on the end
of this lid.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.959
Wipe the top just to
make sure we get

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.389
a good seal.
And we are gonna take the lid,

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.780
just kind of place it on there.
When you put the ring

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.220
on there,
I only want you to do

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.120
just finger-tight.
If you crank

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.459
these things on there,
you are never gonna

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.069
get them off.
So just finger-tight

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.969
on those.
To get your tomatoes done,

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.389
use one of these tools
just to make sure we are not

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:47.040
getting our hands.
Take the lid off.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.620
I have got boiling water here
going in a canner.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.900
Just kind of
place that in there,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.769
and we are gonna make sure
that we have got just about

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.299
an inch or so covering
each one of the lids.

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.579
We are gonna boil these
for about an hour,

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.620
hour twenty-five minutes
or so would be good.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.560
It has been that hour
and twenty-five minutes,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.180
it is time for our tomatoes
to come out.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.719
So we are gonna carefully
remove these with our tool.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.150
And we built up
some pressure over that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.689
hour and twenty-five minutes,
where as these cool down,

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.090
we will start to here that ping.
The middle of this is

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.420
gonna start to pull down
and that is kind of our indication

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.299
that we have safely packed
our tomatoes,

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.659
so you can enjoy these
maybe mid-winter.

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.370
And there you go.
Summer in a jar.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.381
Fresh heirloom tomatoes;
always in season.
