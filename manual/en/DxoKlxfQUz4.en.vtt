00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.820
the house armed services committee has
decided to approve an additional one

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.620
hundred million dollars in defense
spending and the reason why they wanna

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.700
inclu

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.839
you did this additional spending is
because they believe that it's important

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:12.950
to build

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.580
missile interceptors uh... on the east
coast

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.119
there very much concerned about here i
mean they believe that uh... if iran

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.900
does decide to you i want to missiles
and uh... declared nuclear war against

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.270
us at least will have interceptors on
the east coast

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.400
uh... the only problem is right now
iran's along this range missile travels

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.660
about eight hundred miles

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.950
headquarters in iran from the east coast
and confused

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.120
much of a rather than a hundred miles

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.280
no this is incredible sellout

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.560
house republican in say the extra
interceptors our last because here on

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.200
may the armed with an intercontinental
ballistic missile and i cbn

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.820
in just three short years

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.899
accepted back in nineteen ninety eight

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.090
don't romp rumsfeld said by two thousand
three

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.340
iran would have that capability and
really didn't

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.160
no it wouldn't seem so and all these
things

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.160
you know this is not strategic defense
initiative would let you down from space

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.690
at least presumably

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.079
don't know what the hell we're talking
about here

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.420
uh... in this just seems like a hundred
million dollars gift

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.760
you know look is here's what's gonna
happen veron worldwatch one missile at

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.460
the united states of america

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.720
we'd obliterate

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.150
absolutely ever happened to uh...

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.030
than

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.210
mad principle what and mutual assured
destruction in this case is not mutual

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.010
veron attacked us they might get
something through a network may be tear

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.130
but we would and nightly

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.280
but that's our protection at ar missile
defense

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.970
we would literally blow around off the
face of the map that we would kill

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.180
millions of people in the process and
that's just the way it goes because they

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.440
were the practice

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.830
so with

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.189
this is a if the won't work it's a waste
of money

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:03.759
and thankfully i can't uh... i i i hope
we won't get past the senate get to the

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.050
president's desk but you know

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.169
you get that house republicans are

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.379
whacked and so disingenuous when they
claimed to be obsessed about reducing

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.439
the deficit what about that what about
the reducing the deficit well this is a

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.680
national security issue and my national
security issue they want to find ways to

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.669
find private contractors

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:28.099
uh... what i'll weapons manufacturers as
much money as possible because that's

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.810
what this industrial uh... were
complexes yuck at

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.839
versus bedell i don't know how much
other stuff cost

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.639
but allot of money here's what it does
it cost a hundred million dollars i mean

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:41.510
it's more

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.339
so this is like uh...

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:48.959
announcing would come up with it's like
opening the doors to it right and eight

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.049
right now it contains good talk about
this on the current show tonight i think

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.259
it's a really great story

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:59.259
we're talking about cutting funding for
education cutting funding for our people

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:02.369
who by depend on the government in order
to keep

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:06.429
you know best students who are going to
school and taking advantage of our free

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:10.289
lunches because their families are poor
that's one of the only way that they can

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.580
eat

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.490
where cutting spending for those types
of programs

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.090
in order to find additional money to
defense spending

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.379
so much of our federal dollars already
goes to defense spending

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:21.989
and this is one of the things that

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.170
you know ron pollack

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.879
you know he comes up every once in
awhile to show and it's one of the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.610
things where it would ever use talking
about defense spending and how we need

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.249
to drastically cut it

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:32.169
unjustly cast guess

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:38.249
he such a mixed bag for me but it's
refreshing to hear someone be so

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.909
i guess outspoken about that

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:44.580
i don't think he's a mixed bag he's
definitely makes packets of baghdad

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.000
with halloween candy

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.239
evening at everything in their is like

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.809
at falls

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:52.489
razor blades in them

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:53.869
and so

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:58.599
poisoned energy drinks mobile horrible
things that or allegedly coming out and

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.749
how it and then

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.730
buried in there

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.099
here's a snickers bar

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.309
in but it's not a mixed bag

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:07.009
it's a horrible bag

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:09.359
with the bikes are specter's attitudes
to the ships

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.959
perhaps a little bit i didn't know and
when it comes in a lot of different

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.909
issues the defense budget i'd be with
him when it comes to the war on drugs

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.919
are angry with him when it comes to
international affairs

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.190
i think that out we get too involved in
what goes on internationally i do know

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.180
that he's a bit of an isolationist but
i'm so tired of meddling in the affairs

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.020
that happiness other countries and just
wanna get out of their yet rumpled

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.710
crackpot

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.870
and uh... and and the only reason that i
think we agree with him on uh... the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.800
defense spending is because he wants to
cut busily and things and the defense

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.110
budget is one of them

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.720
incorrect that's fantastic but i hear
period which is consistent in that he

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.500
was the got everything but he'd be a
disaster

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.330
we also by the way it should be pointed
out that's part of already has a plan

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.599
motion to launch missile education your
uscis

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.179
so that as it did to the east coast

00:04:58.179 --> 00:05:00.959
and a hundred million dollars again
there's no way that that

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.570
a missile defense system to intercept
missiles

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.020
all along the east coast

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.520
that's i want to make it up that's going
to cost

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.350
nineteen billion dollars

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.939
right if we were to do it if it were
necessary i think it's the kind of thing

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:13.949
and worked

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.470
it might actually cutting america to get
behind it might be a wise

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.659
military expenditure because of the week
of a lot of things really

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.939
repayment rejuvenating death

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.490
but give them a hundred million here

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.250
ashes paola man alicia let's just go
ahead and order

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.610
if they go to a strip club s without her
values like look if we're not going to

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.659
go to war with iran we might as well

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.540
puts certain systems in place

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.910
just in case they decide to attack us
first except they don't have the

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:47.180
capability to attack us in the first
place a wire when wasting our money

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.250
it drives me crazy makes my head explode
and you know in the grand scheme of

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.360
things i understand that a hundred
million dollars is not that much

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.749
spending right

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:55.459
but still

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:59.159
and the nine hundred million dollars can
go toward rendering education look good

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.469
on them to the point that it's uh... the
holdings dot census is to get the chance

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:03.680
to pay a

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.389
it's a few minutes were since the worst
kind of waste of a hundred million

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:06.999
dollars

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:11.219
and the status of the singer who was
budget budget budget screw you the wires

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:12.479
to talk about

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.400
suggest

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.050
they give a hundred million dollars
something we don't need to stop or never

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.889
use

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:17.449
and money we don't
