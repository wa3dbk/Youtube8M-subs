00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.837
"Dairy and Sexual Precocity"

00:00:02.447 --> 00:00:03.817
We've known for over a decade

00:00:03.817 --> 00:00:04.947
that women who eat meat

00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:08.327
have the highest levels of estrogenic 
hormones in their bloodstream,

00:00:08.327 --> 00:00:09.667
and vegans the lowest,

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:13.373
but maybe that's just because 
vegans are so much slimmer.

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:16.621
This year, the consumption of animal 
products was definitively linked

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:19.691
to the levels of circulating 
steroid hormones in the blood,

00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:22.311
regardless of body fat levels.

00:00:22.311 --> 00:00:24.130
The reason we're concerned,

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.580
is that the increased consumption 
of animal-derived food

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.080
may have adverse effects

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.175
on the development of
hormone-dependent cancers.

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:33.390
Among dietary risk factors,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.380
these investigators were most concerned

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.860
about milk and dairy products

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.006
because the milk we drink today 
is produced from pregnant cows,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:44.416
in which estrogen and progesterone 
levels are markedly elevated.

00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:46.062
That may be why milk-drinkers have

00:00:46.062 --> 00:00:49.632
five times the rates of 
twins compared to vegans

00:00:49.632 --> 00:00:53.222
-- that's how much of an effect 
dairy can have on our hormones.

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:55.526
A landmark study was published this year

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:57.726
in an international pediatrics journal

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:02.006
on just how much estrogen we're 
exposed to when we drink milk,

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:06.733
given that the majority of commercial 
milk comes from pregnant cows.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:08.236
During the 60s and 70s,

00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:10.146
genetic manipulations of dairy cows

00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:13.796
enabled them to lactate throughout 
almost their entire pregnancies.

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:15.688
That's why commercial 
cow's milk these days

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:19.238
contains large amounts of 
estrogens and progesterone.

00:01:19.238 --> 00:01:20.521
During the same period

00:01:20.521 --> 00:01:24.351
there's been "a dramatic increase in 
estrogen-dependent malignant diseases,

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.171
such as ovarian cancer, 
uterine cancer, breast cancer,

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.961
testicular cancer and prostate cancer."

00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.477
Eating and drinking estrogen is 
not just a problem for women;

00:01:33.477 --> 00:01:35.747
research shows that 
among various food items,

00:01:35.747 --> 00:01:37.967
cow's milk and cheese 
had the highest correlation

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:43.090
with the incidence and mortality 
rate of these male cancers as well.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.734
Especially for prepubescent children,

00:01:46.734 --> 00:01:50.684
there is particular concern about 
exposure to exogenous estrogens

00:01:50.684 --> 00:01:54.274
in commercial milk 
produced from pregnant cows.

00:01:54.274 --> 00:01:57.980
So what they did is have 
young men, ages 19-21,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.680
and children, 
ages 7 through 9,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.690
try to chug a quart of cow's 
milk in under 10 minutes.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.060
This is what happened to the men.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.180
The levels of the 
pregnancy estrogen estrone

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.900
started to shoot up 60% within 
an hour of drinking the milk.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.361
And their testosterone levels,

00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:18.011
significantly dropped.

00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:20.550
You know, there are men who 
don't want to drink soy milk

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.060
because they have an irrational 
fear of phytoestrogens,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.692
even though soy does not have 
feminizing effects on men,

00:02:27.692 --> 00:02:30.132
yet they're perfectly 
willing to drink cow's milk

00:02:30.132 --> 00:02:33.402
which has actual estrogen estrogens in it.

00:02:33.402 --> 00:02:35.740
Within one hour of the 
milk hitting their intestines,

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.580
estrogen levels go significantly up

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.510
and testosterone levels 
go significantly down.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.780
What about the children?

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.440
Same thing, but even more dramatic,

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.910
because they start out 
with such low levels.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.310
Within one hour of drinking cow milk,

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.630
the level of sex steroid hormones in 
their little bodies more than triples.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.410
And half the kids couldn't 
even finish the whole quart.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.080
Why should we care?

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.600
Because some of these powerful estrogens

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200
could be categorized as carcinogens,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.470
and milk is a rich source 
of these hormones,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.220
and concentrates in mammary drainage.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.260
Never seem to see that 
in the advertisements...

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.884
The corresponding suppression 
in testosterone secretion

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:25.974
means that men are certainly 
affected by commercial cow's milk.

00:03:25.974 --> 00:03:30.043
And height, growth, and sexual 
maturation of young children

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:33.743
could also be affected by 
normal intake of cow's milk.

00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:35.650
As I talked about in the last volume,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.400
recent surveys on the onset of puberty

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.880
show an alarming trend of 
earlier sexual maturation in girls.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.894
During this same time period,

00:03:43.894 --> 00:03:46.544
exposure to exogenous -- 
meaning external -- estrogens

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:49.484
through intake of commercial 
milk produced from pregnant cows

00:03:49.484 --> 00:03:52.054
has spread around the world.

00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:54.391
They think that this intake 
of pregnant cow's milk

00:03:54.391 --> 00:04:00.551
is one of the major causes of early 
sexual maturation in young children.

00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:05.600
This "relationship between 
estrogens in pregnant cow's milk

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.960
and sexual maturation in children

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:16.130
must be acknowledged 
as an important theme."
