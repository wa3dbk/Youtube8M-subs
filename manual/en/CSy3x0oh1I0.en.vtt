Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.349
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the agitator in your washer.

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:09.790
It’s a pretty easy job; all we’re going
to need is a 3/8ths drive ratchet with a half

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.160
inch socket and an 8 inch extension.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.019
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.210
Now the first step in this repair will be
to lift the main lid, leave it in the open

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.210
position.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.340
We’re going to remove the fabric softener
cup off of the top of the agitator, it’s

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.640
just a friction fit so it’ll snap out.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.730
Next with our half inch socket locate the
bolt that is in the center of the agitator,

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.409
remove that bolt.

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:56.069
Now 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:00.389
with both hands lean into the tub, grasp the
bottom of the agitator and pull upwards on

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:05.780
it.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.920
Slide it up through the opening.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.350
Now drop the bolt out of the center.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.619
If the old bolt doesn’t want to drop out
just take a long bladed screwdriver and just

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.490
tap it through from the bottom.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.270
Now inspect that bolt carefully and make sure
that the rubber gasket on the bottom of it

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.180
is still in good shape; if it isn’t you’ll
need to replace that.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:52.270
Now slide the bolt onto the extension and
insert it into the new agitator.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.090
And we can drop the new agitator into place;
line up the splines on the agitator shaft,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:08.380
push it firmly all the way down, and then
we’ll tighten the bolt.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.260
We don’t want to over tighten that bolt
or we’ll damage that rubber washer.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.200
Give it a visual inspection, everything looks
fine there.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:30.370
Put the fabric softener dispenser back on
top of the agitator, snap it in place and

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.420
our repair is complete.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.510
Told you that was an easy job.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.640
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
