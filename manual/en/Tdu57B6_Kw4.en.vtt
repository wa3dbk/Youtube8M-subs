00:00:00.481 --> 00:00:05.399
ANNOUNCER: This is Hollywood Trend Report,
the latest, cutting-edge celebrity trends,

00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:09.810
and the best luxury living, culture,
and lifestyle news in Hollywood.

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.227
Now, here's your host, Ann Shatilla.

00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:15.944
ANN SHATILLA:  Hi and welcome to Hollywood
Trend Report. I'm Ann Shatilla in Los Angeles.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.673
This is the number one show for the luxury life.

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:23.965
Coming up on this week's show, I take you into
the world of anti-aging in Hollywood,

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:28.909
the latest beauty buzzwords making headlines
today, what the celebrities are doing and buying,

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.828
and how they get that eternal youth.

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:36.634
In conversation this week with the top
dermatologist to the stars, Dr. Harold Lancer.

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.626
He's the big man when it comes to knowing
what the celebrities do to keep young,

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.451
known in Hollywood for his pedigree, his
knowledge and extreme attention to patient care.

00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:50.465
DR. HAROLD LANCER:  When people look better,
they feel better and it's very rewarding.

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.932
I get phone calls, letters, gifts all the time,

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:58.546
saying, "You know, it's amazing, that vanity,
to a certain extent is a good thing."

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.627
ANN:  We sit down this week and devote an
entire half hour to Hollywood beauty trends,

00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:06.994
everything from the hot celebrity products
on the market today that really work,

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.812
to the latest, non-invasive facelift.
This one is amazing, no pain, no downtime.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.433
I did it, I loved it.

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:17.836
It's called Venus Freeze, and it's the
number one skin tightening treatment today

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:23.516
in the world, and we take a look at the
anti-aging buzzword for 2012, stem cell serum.

00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:27.747
What exactly is it, and why can't
celebrities seem to get enough?

00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:30.954
That and more this week on Hollywood Trend Report.

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:34.979
In the meantime, check out our website,
HollywoodTrendReport.com,

00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:39.456
and our syndicated radio show, which is
posted on the site weekly in case you miss it.

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:42.721
Okay, here we go. Let's get started.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.199
[music]

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.448
The latest and brand new FDA-approved
anti-aging technology on the market today

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.074
is called Venus Freeze.

00:01:57.589 --> 00:02:01.305
It's now used for wrinkle reduction and skin
tightening, and people just love it,

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.856
because there's no downtime and it's painless.

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:09.334
The state-of-the-art device is safe for getting
rid of wrinkles without injections or lasers.

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:14.592
Venus Freeze creates a synergy of magnetic
pulses and radio frequency to the body,

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:19.163
the face, the stomach, under the neck, jowls,
cheeks, under the eyes, the arms, and the legs.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.744
As well it helps with cellulite improvement
and circumference reduction.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.732
The treatment penetrates into
the multiple layers of the skin.

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:28.680
It heats the target tissues
while treating the wrinkles

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:32.587
And it even creates enough thermal effect
to induce collagen remodeling.

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:36.856
I sat down again with the anti-aging expert
to the stars, Hollywood's top beauty doctor,

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:42.028
Dermatologist, Dr. Harold Lancer.
I asked him, what exactly does this do?

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:47.263
DR. LANCER: The most popular treatment currently
anywhere in the world is the Venus Freeze.

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:52.677
The one that we use, called the magnetic-driven
Venus Freeze, is the most advanced model,

00:02:53.147 --> 00:02:59.777
but basically, it's an instrument that painlessly,
in a warm, fuzzy manner will get the skin to lift.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:05.882
When it does that,
especially on the neck, jowl, jawline area,

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.213
it causes the shape of the face to improve.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.085
It's like causing that inverted pyramid look.

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:16.940
It's painless. It's something that, actually
there's a waiting list for to do.

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.960
It works by using magnetic-driven radio waves,

00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:25.582
to firm and heat the skin,
all the way down to the muscle.

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:30.399
We're using it in particular now,
to not only help the neck and face,

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.633
but we're using it to lift the bust line,
the chest line.

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.881
And so it's a safe manner to heat that skin,

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.658
make it a little bit firmer
and make the cleavage line crisper.

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.232
ANN:  The treatment increases blood flow

00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:43.811
to the treated area, changing the overall
condition of the skin.

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:48.252
Improving circulation supplies more oxygen,
vitamins, and minerals to the cells,

00:03:48.644 --> 00:03:50.389
while also removing toxins.

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:52.247
A more youthful look emerges.

00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:56.736
The eight energy waves combine into a single
matrix, to reduce the temperature peaks.

00:03:57.176 --> 00:03:58.624
So I decided to try it myself.

00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:02.792
I had two sessions. And truly not painful at all.
I actually liked the experience.

00:04:03.194 --> 00:04:04.804
My goal? Smooth skin.

00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:09.606
There's the device, shaped the size of a PC
mouse applicator. It slides across your body

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:11.545
easily and very comfortably.

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.993
Most patients notice immediate results
after the first treatment.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.333
I noticed my skin did look better.

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:20.994
The procedure penetrates and triggers the body
to produce the collagen and the elastic fibers.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:26.335
And the building begins immediately, and the
collagen production continues for months.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.539
VANGIE EQUINA:  It's like a flat iron for
the hair. So this is an iron for the skin.

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:36.361
ANN:  This is so relaxing, I could fall asleep.

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:43.477
VANGIE:  Yes, and the good thing about this,
it doesn't hurt, but it works.

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:49.594
ANN: It doesn't hurt. It feels warm.
It's soothing, I like the movement up and down.

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:51.858
Will you come home with me?

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:52.951
VANGIE:  Oh Sure.

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:55.506
ANN: I would just like to have this every day,
done at home.

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:56.415
VANGIE:  [laughs] Sure.

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:57.477
ANN:  It's beautiful.

00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:03.009
VANGIE:  It will tighten your skin, firm your
skin, tone your skin, especially on the neck.

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.383
The women here, it's always the problem here.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.314
ANN:  I feel the heat,
and what is the heat doing, Vangie?

00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:17.184
VANGIE:  It increases the collagen and elastin
synthesis. It's just massaging your skin.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.081
There's a patient the other day that I did.

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:26.228
She said, "It feels like a stone massage.
That's how it feels like", so she fell asleep.

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.160
ANN:  You're right, it feels like a hot stone
massage. That's exactly what it feels like.

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:35.164
I do feel it getting hotter,
as the time is going on.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.411
So, the increase in the heat is when
it becomes beneficial, correct?

00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:40.202
VANGIE: Yes.

00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:45.601
ANN:  For 34-year-old Mary Murphy, a publicist
from Los Angeles, she had a little extra

00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:48.518
tightening she wanted around the waist.
She was excited to try the latest trend.

00:05:48.863 --> 00:05:52.109
She said she felt the same way I did.
She enjoyed the soothing effect.

00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:58.335
MARY MURPHY:  It was warm to very warm.
It fluctuated a little bit, and rather tingly.

00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:02.981
It felt kind of nice too. It glided around.

00:06:03.277 --> 00:06:07.741
It was almost like a massage on my stomach,
so I actually enjoyed the feeling a little bit,

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:09.396
and you feel like the magic is happening.

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.127
ANN:  The word is, people get addicted to this.
Once they do one part of the body,

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:14.547
they want to do the next part.
Can you see that happening to you?

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.354
MARY:  I can see why people say that,
and I definitely would like to do it again.

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:23.020
ANN:  Compared to Thermag, Venus Freeze is
painless, repeatable and less expensive.

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:28.527
