Desteni Interdimensional Interview: Animals and Regret - Lion

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.950
Animals and regret

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.500
I am currently in a manifested physical form of and as a lion

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.670
and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.320
I'm here speaking as, the animal kingdom

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.100
the animal kingdom, as much as 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.340
every manifested expression that existed within this existence is

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.080
self responsible for

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.380
how everything turn out to be

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.050
and become within this world, we currently exist

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.490
the regret 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.170
that had to be faced, in the animal kingdom is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.440
the point where we, instead of standing up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.700
and making a definitive absolute statement of, what we would accept and allow

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.120
and what not

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.120
we

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:56.950
fell

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.700
into despair of, fear

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.810
we justified why we, did not stand up

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.110
by

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.100
saying to ourselves that, we are animals

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.310
what can an animal possibly do?

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.860
to stop what has been accepted and allowed, to be done onto this existence

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.670
onto (sigh) each other 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.370
and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.150
we justified why we did not stand up

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.520
absolutely by, stating that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.630
we, apparently fear death

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:11.140
because if an animal, would for example attack a human being

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.040
we'd immediately be killed

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.490
which is fascinating that such, an act is being done onto animals

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.690
as yourself one and equal, yet

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.430
within the human race, when

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.340
one human being attack another, they are merely punished

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.140
they are not killed

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.650
human beings, harm each other abuse each other physically, emotionally

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.390
extensively, day in, and day out

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.460
yet the only punishment that exist is human beings being locked into a corner

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.600
as thought they had simple done something bad

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.600
yet

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.330
human being's behavior and nature expression towards the animal kingdom

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.620
it that of deliberate, murder

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.420
yet

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.130
you don't see it, or realize it as that, in anyway whatsoever

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.830
and human beings kill and murder animals, because of fear

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.910
the same fear that we, as the animal kingdom accepted and allowed 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.080
to enslaved us for eons of time

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.880
because we feared you

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.320
the animal

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.560
would, or have through timed attacked because of fear

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.500
to protect themselves to protect, their children just as human beings

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.810
act in fear, to protect themselves to protect their children

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.420
to protect others as themselves

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.990
see that herein, the animal kingdom the human beings

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:50.730
all that exist is self-responsible, for how we have become

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.860
toward ourselves and each other as ourselves

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:55.930
because of fear

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:04.640
but in that fear itself, is also justification- because of regret

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:13.920
because we know, that we are how we are

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.990
that we are what we have become both within and without

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.270
because we did not stand up

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.370
and I speak of we as all manifested expression within existence

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.810
nature animal kingdom, human beings planets

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.390
stars water, everything all that exist

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.040
that we have existed, in this regret

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:49.350
hidden within shame, presented as fear

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.430
when the real reason is, the real core the real origin is not fear

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.500
it is regret

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:03.940
and shame and sorrow

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.780
therefore I suggest

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.400
realizing within yourself that the fear you experienced

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.850
and the fear you exist within and as towards anything or anyone within existence

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.590
do not act upon it

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.020
access it within yourself and realize

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.530
why are you accepting and allowing yourself to exist in fear?

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.000
what is the regret the shame the sorrow that has been hidden

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:33.060
within yourself

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.560
and stop existing in the past 

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.240
and be here in self-honesty one and equal as Life

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.240
thank you

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.290
