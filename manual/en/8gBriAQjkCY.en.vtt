00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:04.972
[sound of chains clanking]

00:00:11.062 --> 00:00:16.967
[rhythmic acoustic guitar music]

00:00:16.967 --> 00:00:19.632
I've always had a 
real connection to...

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:21.035
to being in the woods,

00:00:21.035 --> 00:00:25.632
and care about what's going on 
with our environment.

00:00:30.368 --> 00:00:34.005
About...oh 16, 17 years ago,

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:36.833
our neighbors lived 
on the Cedar River

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.684
and a logger came through 
and just tore their woods up,

00:00:39.684 --> 00:00:43.015
and I asked them if I could 
take out the firewood.

00:00:43.015 --> 00:00:46.414
So I took the horses 
down to the river

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:50.099
and started pulling logs out,
and pulled them out to the road

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:52.779
and when we got a wagon load 
we'd load them up with the horses

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:56.468
and get them out on the road 
and haul them to the mill.

00:00:56.468 --> 00:00:59.290
[sound of chain saw]

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.532
The issues we have here is...
we have some oak wilt issues.

00:01:02.532 --> 00:01:06.281
So we're going to cut out the
oak wilt, or the infected trees

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:08.896
try and do minimal damage 
when we're felling the trees

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:11.318
and then skid the logs out.

00:01:11.318 --> 00:01:16.539
[sound of tree falling]

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:18.785
[directing horses] Haw a little!

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:20.280
[sound of chain saw]

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.784
[directing horses] Back up!

00:01:22.784 --> 00:01:25.814
[sound of chain being wrapped]

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.514
[sound of chain on metal]

00:01:28.514 --> 00:01:31.627
[directing horses] Come on!

00:01:31.627 --> 00:01:34.805
Good boys...whoa!

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:40.840
I'm going to go get 
another team of horses

00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:44.970
and we'll put four on and
see if I can get up the hill.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.800
You know that log 
probably weighs 4,000 pounds,

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:50.067
then you're pulling it up a hill,
you're doubling the weight of it

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:51.775
then you're pulling it up a hill,
you're doubling the weight of it

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:55.380
so they had all they could do 
to get it where they got it,

00:01:55.377 --> 00:01:58.320
I was surprised they got it there.

00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:02.030
We'll just put more horses on...
we'll get her.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.699
It's like working 
a jigsaw puzzle...

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:07.630
what comes first, 
what comes second,

00:02:07.634 --> 00:02:10.668
and if this don't work 
what do I do next.

00:02:10.668 --> 00:02:14.470
It's just a constant process 
of problem solving.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.680
[directing horses] Whoa...whoa!

00:02:22.352 --> 00:02:26.710
Good boys...good boy...
good boy Travis!

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:30.930
Yeah! Good boy Travis!

00:02:30.926 --> 00:02:34.520
Look at today, it's just 
absolutely beautiful.

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:36.730
I couldn't ask for a better day,

00:02:36.734 --> 00:02:38.850
and then on top of that 
working with the horses,

00:02:38.852 --> 00:02:40.957
they teach me something 
every day so...

00:02:40.957 --> 00:02:44.850
I couldn't get a better job!
