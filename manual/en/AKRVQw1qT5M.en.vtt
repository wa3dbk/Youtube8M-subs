00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.820
Little nervous, but pretty excited. It's
been a long road and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.360
finally made it.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.000
Towson's been so accomodating so welcoming to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.470
every single person I've met. And
being a student-athlete here is just a small

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.970
community and it's nice that we get recognized at graduation and I'm really excited.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.460
I'm just I'm really excited. It's been
a long time coming.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.920
These past four years have been awesome with this guy. We killed it. We killed it, we killed it.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.180
Go Tigers!

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.910
ROTC was never a plan for me I kinda fell
into it but

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.620
its really given me a lot of motivation.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.240
I'm very excited.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.150
Four great years at Towson. I'm excited to go into the workforce.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.190
I feel really prepared.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.520
I'm just super excited.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540
I can't believe it. I really had to hold
back the tears while I was walking on stage.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.960
I'm excited for the future.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.720
Towson was a great school to me. Both my parents have Mass Comm degrees from Towson.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.200
So, happy to be an alumni.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.940
I'm feeling a lot of emotions but they're all happy emotions.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.380
I'm very excited.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.720
Well when I realized that I had a
passion for teaching I really wanted to go

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.590
to a university that had a very strong
educational program

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.850
and Towson is nationally known for the turning out of

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.400
really good teachers, really great
teachers in some cases and I wanted to be in a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.640
place like that that would help make me a great teacher as well.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.540
Definitely very nervous. But also very
hopeful I think the university was very

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.140
good about you know spreading hope

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.900
and encouraging the students.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.060
For me

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.480
and listening to our students talk about the feel of the place.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.830
It's that it's a caring place, it's a
concerned place.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.130
And it's a concerned place by everybody. Everybody who works here

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.430
is interested in how our students do,

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.140
how our students succeed. But they're also
interested in helping each other

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.820
and making sure that it's a wonderful
place to live, a wonderful place to grow,

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.480
a wonderful place to work.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.320
I'm really fortunate to be able to go to school

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.940
and to be surrounded by people that love me

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.340
and I would love the opportunity to give back to people.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.820
So I automatically got involed with Students Helping Honduras

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.780
and I was surrounded by people that were empowered and excited to do something

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.820
that would make a difference in this world and I would not want to be any other place.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.150
I think we're all just hopeful.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.270
We spent four years working our
tails off

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.790
and trying to have a good time and now all we got in front of us is the world so it's ours to take.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.280
I ran into a burning building to save
someone and it turned out that she

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.780
helped to save me.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.260
So as I read this name I want

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.700
everyone here to know never stop dreaming.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.920
Never stop hoping. And one person can make a difference.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.440
I'd like to present to you

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.760
the most beautiful person

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.750
that I have ever met.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.880
Jacqueline

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.000
Tiffany

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.680
Miller

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.890
What will you dream about and later

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.690
build from the ground up?

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:19.120
What can you now accomplish because of the education you have received here

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.150
and as the result of a vision that was

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.189
first built here more than a hundred and fifty years ago

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.429
on your behalf and on our behalf.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.380
What will be your bold idea and your
impact on the world?

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.020
How will you let it be known that you have passed this way?
