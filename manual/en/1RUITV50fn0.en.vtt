00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.350
Hello and welcome back to LOOT! Today we're checking out Project Cars.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.930
And we try to crash a car which is more a gimmick

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:16.139
gimmick in the game: The go-kart. And there we go.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.790
I have a blue go-kart. You should be able to see it very well, I think.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.490
Full Speed!

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.270
It had gotten nothing. Not yet. Ok, let's see if we can

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.899
get the other drivers, I would like to hit another car.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:40.230
There we go again. WHOOOOO

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.690
That was more than 37 miles per hour, this  should crash hardly...

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.659
That looked a little more dynamic I have to say.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:49.059
And now step on the gas...

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.359
Streight ahead!

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.319
This is raising a bit of dust...

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:59.579
And how does it looks now from the side? Yet the guy didn't move at all.

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.079
No!

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.570
There's not even a scratch on it... 57mph.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.620
Now let's drive streightly into the wall.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.630
That has, at least produce a really nice dust cloud. Looked very nice though.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.690
Turn around!

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.340
Let's check it out from the front...

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.950
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. ) The game has at least advertised

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.420
that it will be very realistic and that it would have a very nice damage modell.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.360
Maybe they didn't about it to do it with the GoKart as well.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.090
Maybe they couldn't create an animation where the the driver is flying out

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:45.420
of the go-kart and cannot move afterwards....

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.450
These were at least rubber tires.
- Yeah these rubber tire.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.460
But even there the driver must have... He is still sitting in the car.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.650
Exactly, completely disinterested.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.080
He's is still sitting in his Gokart and he's not even moving.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.950
Neverless, I believe that the Gokart has at least some mechanical errors.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.230
It means that I feel that it's not moving exactly how I want it.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.050
Maybe you just can't see it from

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.520
outside that the Gokart is damaged.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:28.380
Maybe but still, it doesn't look good.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.450
This is absolutely true.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.530
They should recreate that.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.020
Ah now I reached the goal.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.120
I'm putting it on record that I caused one crash in every curve with 60mph.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.130
Against concrete and against tires.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.670
And also against other drivers. But I still reached the goal. No lost tires,

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.760
no engine damage.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.980
No metal sheet flying off. And the driver is also completely undamaged.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.370
The Gokart is indestructible.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.950
We couldn't destroy the Gokart today and the car is still driving pretty well.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.900
But maybe You can do it better and You are even able to destroy it.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.400
Then please send us a Screenshot.
