the most idiotic decision

00:00:07.329 --> 00:00:10.679

was sick

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.500

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.589
fused to take their son to the doctor

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.419
at the first son was a two year old by
the name of tents

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.780
and uh... he had to be

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.470
uh... infection that they were a few
subjected to the doctor for and the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.430
recent case involving eight month old

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.930
severe diarrhea

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.160
and uh... they decided to pray for him
as well as opposed to taking to the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.880
doctor that child died as well

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.580

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.390
note and i just realized already know
their fundamental as christians they are

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.579
not just any you know when you go
freaking out there and and

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.100
they believe that their interpretation
of the bible was all of the bible says

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.219
that we can take our child doctor
because the doctors evil we should

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.080
depend on jesus instead you have not
worked out for you

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.250
that was jesus we receive

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.360
but usually the appraisal right with
this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.860
where a sikh

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.930
where your case

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.300
their debt

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.049
cell they

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.639
were actually on probation after their
two-year-old died four years ago lock

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:07.880
'em up

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.160
and i should note that he died from
backed from bacterial pneumonia not from

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.199
infection

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.589
and uh... you know if the judge sent it
to them after they lost their eight

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.229
month old

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.059
you guys

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.959
should've learned your lesson from the
first case how are you still doing this

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.739
after you lost a child they have seven
other children by the way uh... nasa

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.919
rights even placed in foster care uh...
and uh...

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:35.950
a are not going to they might serve time
in prison but right now the are are free

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.390
and the reason why is because the judge
says that they're not threat to society

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.599
their threat to their children so their
children have been placed in foster care

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.589
for the moment being we'll see what
happens and later

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:46.290
icn lock 'em up man

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.239
duma walang sentence

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.379
and my too harsh to group

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.699
uh...

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:54.579
assad's

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.710
yeah agree they're crazy but

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.010
blocking was indicted for views was very
devoted

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.760
so send a message they don't pay any
anyting till your kids as you say

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.230
they're praying together and sure
cheeses serve on the world we're praying

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.189
to a day

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.399
take your kids the doctor always you
know like a family were put in prison

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.219
for forty five p is for the day

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.430
so that i heard on the safe if you
believe that you go for a way the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.099
diarrhea

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.529
to get you know we're not about
listening you say oh i'm not supposed

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.239
those other people because they are

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.649
this is a reason why see-through
commercial hard instance way it is

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:30.709
important people coming just to take it
away from that

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.099
from now the lease on life she say

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.809
you need to go through the labor with
seven of them they are of course you

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:39.800
know the price status like say murders
every murder anyway

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.190
solution amaryllis

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.419
though some of them will go ahead of you
know what

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:47.510
uh... my kids again i have a moment they
care about the so maybe i don't but i

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.590
care about my own people asking more
than i care about my kids

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.809
or should i wear a present for years

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:56.309
you'd be surprised how many people care
hello more about their own that's than

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:59.730
they do about their kids or adults
herons do serve uh...

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.239
trip like prison sentences if they've
been neglected kids right

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.360
maintenance of the year neglect and yes
it is really severe but yes outsell i

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.810
don't know maybe someone can argue that
this is legal act

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.999
uh... blackmun's bonanza

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:16.479
important to note that you know they art
of threat to society they definitely

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.849
shouldn't have custody of their kids

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:21.709
uh... and as long as they don't have
custody of their kids that's all i care

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.189
about because obviously they haven't
learned their lesson into one of the

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.039
city's committed a needed yesterday and
they'd be out there in the world in her

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:29.530
make more kids without papers away

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.199
bearing work isn't it goes away they're
gonna be in foster care

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.199
but it is not only do about that it's

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.329
life is life i dot blots on item where

00:04:38.329 --> 00:04:41.979
here trip and i did take away their
reproductive rights it is that's

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.370
american i got to get at the freedom

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.929
but they don't have the freedom
entertainer or in that

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:49.599
in the world

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.090
after they were tilted its so

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.770
will be added to our forsake you

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.720
but i don't think so

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.890
i think that if they do about that
they're alive

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.020
they purposely

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.739
didn't take them the doctor

00:05:01.739 --> 00:05:03.559
falwell knowing they could dot

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:05.210
strongly the second one

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.380
i'm another first one and why they made
a mistake at being

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.910
slightly sympathetic or these are morons

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.040
and hehehe is a liberal radiation watch
out for more on to something right base

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.439
try to help them out

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:19.999
uh... but no now and apparently they
never learned a lesson that they do it

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:21.429
again and again i a lot more
