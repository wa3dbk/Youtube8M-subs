00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:04.110
We're so pleased to have Frida Kahlo's self-portrait from 1940 

00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:05.960
back with us here in Austin. 

00:00:05.982 --> 00:00:07.690
Over the last two decades, 

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:12.540
the self-portrait has traveled the world from New York to Australia,

00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:19.440
Paris to Barcelona, San Francisco, and right back here to Austin, Texas.

00:00:19.461 --> 00:00:21.290
Frida Kahlo, since I've been here,

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:26.150
has gone out I think I had about 30 times.

00:00:26.174 --> 00:00:30.670
When we travel the Kahlo, she has a number of restrictions that are put on her. 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.150
She always travels with a courier from the Ransom Center. 

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:38.300
If that entails airplane travel, which it generally does, she gets her own seat. 

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:41.070
She has her own traveling case. 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.330
The security, of course, at the borrowing institution has to be very stringent.

00:00:45.348 --> 00:00:49.640
She is very important to the collection, she is a very high value item, 

00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:52.410
and so she gets particular care.

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:56.110
The role as a courier within the Frida Kahlo painting 

00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:01.990
was to go to El Paso and pick up the painting. 

00:01:02.014 --> 00:01:05.390
After loading the vehicle and preparing it for shipping

00:01:05.406 --> 00:01:11.060
and bringing home the masterpieces of the Ransom Center,

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.390
we left El Paso at approximately 8:30 in the morning.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:22.310
The vehicle itself is also not advertising the fact that it is carrying a priceless cargo.

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.330
It is a very unique truck. 

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.940
It also carries 300 gallons of diesel, 

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:32.770
so therefore we can drive more than 10 hours without ever stopping.

00:01:32.786 --> 00:01:46.560
Once we arrived, the pieces were immediately brought to the 4th floor and locked. 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:53.170
Once the Frida Kahlo painting is unwrapped, then Ken Grant comes in and assesses

00:01:53.188 --> 00:01:59.180
the work and makes a comparison with the condition report documents.

00:01:59.196 --> 00:02:03.930
The painting itself now is in extremely good condition. 

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:11.740
And there are only sort of residual condition issues with the painting itself, 

00:02:11.757 --> 00:02:14.920
that we make note of, but they're stable. 

00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:18.010
So there's some minor cracking in the paint. 

00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:21.140
Of course, a painting of this age would probably have that sort of 

00:02:21.165 --> 00:02:23.650
condition no matter what. 

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:28.960
Frida Kahlo's self-portrait is part of a series of works that she did in 1940.

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:32.590
There were other self-portraits that she completed that year. 

00:02:32.607 --> 00:02:37.730
What makes this particular work important is not only the subject matter 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.250
in the work but also the context within which it was created. 

00:02:42.272 --> 00:02:47.790
It is a wonderfully symbolically rich self-portrait, 

00:02:47.806 --> 00:02:54.580
as well as a work that was created during an important crossroad in Frida Kahlo's life.

00:02:54.598 --> 00:02:58.940
She had divorced with her husband, the muralista

00:02:58.964 --> 00:03:04.120
Diego Rivera in 1939 and she broke her love affair 

00:03:04.137 --> 00:03:07.950
with the collector Nickolas Muray in 1940. 

00:03:07.973 --> 00:03:12.630
Later on in 1940 Rivera and Kahlo remarried.

00:03:12.653 --> 00:03:18.110
So there is quite a bit going on in her life as well as in the painting itself. 

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.620
And in that painting we see a variety of things; 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:27.410
we see Frida Kahlo looking not necessarily at the viewer but out off in the distance 

00:03:27.434 --> 00:03:31.470
as if she were in great or deep thought, 

00:03:31.487 --> 00:03:35.490
the thorn necklace with its religious connotations, 

00:03:35.506 --> 00:03:39.770
and certainly the animals and the flora and fauna of Mexico 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.000
that surround her create this claustrophobic space. 

00:03:45.018 --> 00:03:50.930
The other works in the Kahlo collection include Diego y Yo which is a wonderful drawing 

00:03:50.948 --> 00:03:55.420
that was created within months after her marriage to Diego Rivera 

00:03:55.437 --> 00:03:57.820
was created in California

00:03:57.844 --> 00:04:02.940
where and when Rivera was working on his murals in San Francisco. 

00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:08.380
The other work in the collection, a still life from 1951, 

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:14.390
was essentially a work at the apex of her series of still lifes that she created, 

00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:21.050
the last series of works that the artist created before she died in 1954. 

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:24.730
I think we're very fortunate to have three of her pieces here in the collection, 

00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:28.590
I'm thrilled to be able to be around Kahlos and 

00:04:28.613 --> 00:04:33.300
I think that the audience that comes to see her is going to be as well. 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:37.710
While she only created less than 200 works over her lifetime,

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:43.150
really she had become at the time and now is a complete artist,

00:04:43.167 --> 00:04:50.850
someone who represents fully her country as well as established a place for herself 

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.670
in the traditions of modern art. 

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:54.640
It's going to be wonderful. 

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:59.340
Everybody loves to see this painting. 

00:04:59.363 --> 00:05:01.900
So it's gonna be great. I mean, I'll love to see her up. 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.910
You know, I only get to see her laying on a table. 

00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.540
It willl be good to see her installed the way she's supposed to be seen. 

00:05:07.565 --> 00:05:31.980
So Frida would be happy.
