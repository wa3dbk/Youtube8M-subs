00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:02.219
- Hey guys, today I'm gonna share with you

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:04.658
a terrific recipe for Valentine's Day

00:00:04.658 --> 00:00:06.262
that's perfect for gifting.

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:08.131
So if you have a special Valentine

00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:10.123
that you wanna bring a sweet treat to,

00:00:10.123 --> 00:00:11.890
whether that be a boyfriend, girlfriend,

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.064
or a teacher, or really anybody you love,

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:16.787
a linzer heart cookie is a great idea.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:18.858
They're also really simple to make too,

00:00:18.858 --> 00:00:21.054
and most of it can be made in advance.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:22.334
So let me show you how to make them.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:23.653
Alright, so the first thing we're gonna do

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:26.599
is beat up a cup of butter
in an electric mixer.

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.225
Now you're basically just
looking for that butter

00:00:28.225 --> 00:00:29.932
to become pale in color,

00:00:29.932 --> 00:00:31.821
and basically double the volume.

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:33.954
At that point we're
going to add the sugar.

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:37.123
So for these cookies I really
like to use powdered sugar,

00:00:37.123 --> 00:00:38.973
or confectioners sugar as you may know it,

00:00:38.973 --> 00:00:40.455
because it's a lighter sugar

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.137
and will incorporate a bit
better into the butter.

00:00:43.137 --> 00:00:44.844
Because this is a sandwiched cookie

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.611
where you're dealing with two cookies,

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:47.830
you wanna make sure that those cookies

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.147
are nice and light, and
kind of melt in your mouth.

00:00:50.147 --> 00:00:52.036
Otherwise it can be a bit heavy.

00:00:52.036 --> 00:00:54.678
You wanna just add it slowly and in stages

00:00:54.678 --> 00:00:56.059
because it is pretty dusty,

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.298
and if you put the whole thing in there

00:00:57.298 --> 00:00:58.924
you're gonna make a big cloudy mess.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.366
So just go ahead and take
it in probably thirds.

00:01:01.366 --> 00:01:03.173
And then you're just gonna beat that up

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:05.042
until it's nice and incorporated.

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:08.720
At that point we're going to
add one egg and one egg yolk.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.609
The egg yolk is just
gonna create a really nice

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:12.519
rich flavor to our cookie.

00:01:12.519 --> 00:01:14.978
At this stage I also
like to add two teaspoons

00:01:14.978 --> 00:01:16.562
of almond extract.

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:18.493
You'll find it'll get a really nice subtle

00:01:18.493 --> 00:01:20.157
almond flavor to these cookies,

00:01:20.157 --> 00:01:22.372
which I think is such a
great flavor combination

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:24.261
with the raspberry jam.

00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:26.212
Then we're gonna prepare
our dry ingredients.

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:28.082
So in a small bowl you're going to add

00:01:28.082 --> 00:01:30.864
one and a half cups of almond meal.

00:01:30.864 --> 00:01:32.897
Now almond meal or almond flour

00:01:32.897 --> 00:01:34.929
is essentially just ground almonds,

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.106
so if you can't find it,

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:37.934
I'll put some information
in the description

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:39.865
on how you can actually make your own,

00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.160
but I find, especially if
you live in the states,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.253
you can find it easily at Trader Joe's.

00:01:44.253 --> 00:01:45.736
And it's such a time saver.

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:47.342
But in fact you should
know that it's never

00:01:47.342 --> 00:01:49.210
near the baking aisle or near the flours,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.979
it's always in the nut section.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.217
So you can go and find it there

00:01:52.217 --> 00:01:53.142
and you 'll find a big bag of it.

00:01:53.142 --> 00:01:54.105
It's great.

00:01:54.105 --> 00:01:55.811
Then to that we're also going to add

00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:57.884
two cups of all-purpose flour,

00:01:57.884 --> 00:01:59.549
half a teaspoon of salt,

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.784
and a quarter teaspoon of baking powder.

00:02:01.784 --> 00:02:04.628
Go ahead and just whisk that
up until it's all combined,

00:02:04.628 --> 00:02:06.762
and then we are going to
add this flour mixture

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:09.708
to our butter mixture just in thirds,

00:02:09.708 --> 00:02:11.659
beating in between each addition

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.244
until it's nice and combined.

00:02:13.244 --> 00:02:15.803
Then we're gonna remove
our dough from the bowl

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:18.281
and we're going to
separate it into two mounds

00:02:18.281 --> 00:02:20.294
and place it on some wax paper.

00:02:20.294 --> 00:02:22.040
Then you can flatten it into some discs

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.523
and wrap it up.

00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:25.251
And we do need to refrigerate this dough

00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:26.734
for at least two hours.

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:28.135
Overnight is even better.

00:02:28.135 --> 00:02:29.802
Just because it's gonna be so much easier

00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:32.320
for us to roll out and cut
out our little cookies.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.068
So you do wanna plan ahead and make sure

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:36.323
that you refrigerate it in advance.

00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:37.257
Now to make our cookies,

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.883
it does make it a bit easier if you have

00:02:38.883 --> 00:02:40.305
a linzer cookie cutter.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:42.926
So you can usually find
these at your kitchen stores,

00:02:42.926 --> 00:02:44.876
or I've also put a link in the description

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:46.787
to where you can find them online.

00:02:46.787 --> 00:02:49.102
And if you like to make these
kinds of sandwich cookies,

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.261
they are a great investment

00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:51.947
because they usually come with a base

00:02:51.947 --> 00:02:53.328
and several little inserts

00:02:53.328 --> 00:02:56.802
that you can swap out to
make different cutouts.

00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:58.611
So we're gonna be using the heart cutout

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.663
to make our heart shaped cookie.

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:02.958
So we're gonna take our
first batch of dough,

00:03:02.958 --> 00:03:05.133
roll it out on a floured surface

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:07.855
just to about an eighth of an inch thick.

00:03:07.855 --> 00:03:10.293
And then we're gonna cut
out all of the bottoms.

00:03:10.293 --> 00:03:11.168
And you'll see it really helps

00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:12.629
when the dough is nice and cold

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.535
because it will help us
get a nice clean cut.

00:03:15.535 --> 00:03:17.749
And then once you've done about 12 bottoms

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.228
you can go ahead and just
pop that in the refrigerator

00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:21.670
while you prepare the tops.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.458
I find if the dough becomes too warm

00:03:23.458 --> 00:03:26.100
it begins to lose its
shape as it starts to bake.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.111
So it's better that the
dough is nice and cold.

00:03:28.111 --> 00:03:30.286
So at this point we're
gonna take the heart insert

00:03:30.286 --> 00:03:31.464
to our cookie cutter.

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:33.312
We're gonna insert it in the center

00:03:33.312 --> 00:03:35.628
and then we're gonna cut out all the tops.

00:03:35.628 --> 00:03:36.705
Then you'll see it'll have a beautiful

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:37.826
little heart in the center.

00:03:37.826 --> 00:03:39.694
So you can go ahead and transfer that

00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:42.031
to a parchment lined cookie sheet as well.

00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:43.595
And then take the bottoms,

00:03:43.595 --> 00:03:44.977
pop those in the oven,

00:03:44.977 --> 00:03:47.191
and we're gonna bake at 350 Fahrenheit

00:03:47.191 --> 00:03:49.203
for just 10 minutes.

00:03:49.203 --> 00:03:50.137
You'll know when they're done

00:03:50.137 --> 00:03:52.067
when they start to just
rise up a little bit

00:03:52.067 --> 00:03:54.444
and become puffed and
look like they're set.

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:56.050
You actually don't want
to take them all the way

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.736
where they begin to get golden brown

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.931
because then they'll just get
a little too crumbly on you.

00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:01.596
So just go ahead and take them out.

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:03.588
And what we're gonna do
is allow them to cool

00:04:03.588 --> 00:04:04.826
on the cookie sheet.

00:04:04.826 --> 00:04:06.147
And the benefit of allowing the cookies

00:04:06.147 --> 00:04:08.200
to kind of continue to cook this way

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.435
is that the cookies will
firm up due to the heat

00:04:10.435 --> 00:04:12.892
of the cookie sheet, but
they won't become extra brown

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:15.331
as they would if we'd
left them in the oven.

00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:16.781
Then we're gonna pop the tops in the oven

00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.895
at 350 for just nine minutes.

00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:20.316
They take less time to bake

00:04:20.316 --> 00:04:22.958
because they don't have as much
surface area as the bottoms

00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:24.401
because we've done the cutout.

00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.006
So they're a little bit quicker to bake.

00:04:26.006 --> 00:04:27.916
And then we're gonna allow
them to cool the same way,

00:04:27.916 --> 00:04:29.622
just on our cookie sheet.

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:32.955
And this whole stage can
be done the day before.

00:04:32.955 --> 00:04:35.393
So all you have to do is
just lightly cover them

00:04:35.393 --> 00:04:37.160
with foil and allow them to just stay

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.256
on your counter tops,

00:04:38.256 --> 00:04:40.329
and they will be all
ready to go the next day.

00:04:40.329 --> 00:04:42.341
Then to assemble, here's
what we're gonna do.

00:04:42.341 --> 00:04:43.964
We're gonna dust all the cookies lightly

00:04:43.964 --> 00:04:45.671
with some powdered sugar.

00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:48.495
Then we are going to
transfer some raspberry jam

00:04:48.495 --> 00:04:49.856
into a pastry bag.

00:04:49.856 --> 00:04:52.619
I find that it's really a lot
easier to work with the jam

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:53.940
when it's in a pastry bag

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.830
'cause you'll get a lot
more precision that way.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.150
But you could just spoon it out too

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.308
if you didn't have a pastry bag.

00:04:58.308 --> 00:05:00.624
And then we are going to
take the raspberry jam

00:05:00.624 --> 00:05:03.001
and just create a little
dollop in the center

00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:04.701
of each bottom.

00:05:04.701 --> 00:05:06.837
Now the cookies are ready for their tops.

00:05:06.837 --> 00:05:09.011
So we're gonna sandwich them all.

00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:10.616
And then you'll start
to see that beautiful

00:05:10.616 --> 00:05:14.456
raspberry jam come through the
center of that heart cutout.

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:16.833
You could take your cookies and
place them on a cookie plate

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:19.515
or you could package them
up in a decorative tin.

00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:21.384
I find that these are
such charming cookies,

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:23.253
especially around Valentine's Day.

00:05:23.253 --> 00:05:24.817
They're not that hard to make

00:05:24.817 --> 00:05:26.626
and they are so delicious.

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:28.718
The combination of that crumbly cookie

00:05:28.718 --> 00:05:30.567
with that faint almond flavor

00:05:30.567 --> 00:05:32.355
mixed with the raspberry jam

00:05:32.355 --> 00:05:33.798
is just the perfect little treat

00:05:33.798 --> 00:05:35.829
to enjoy on Valentine's Day.

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:37.658
I hope you give this to somebody special

00:05:37.658 --> 00:05:39.568
and catch their attention with these.

00:05:39.568 --> 00:05:40.949
And I will see you next week

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:42.453
for another easy recipe.

00:05:42.453 --> 00:05:43.667
Until then, bye.
