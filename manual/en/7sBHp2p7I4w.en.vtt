ohio is not a play ohio state so they
invite him to do a little pep talk for

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.889
the football team

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.889
that makes it so much sense is obviously
an important alumni that's cool he goes

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.609
there and he gives by all accounts uh...

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.689
speech full but and

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.450
uh... one organization or what
publication called

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.939
or poor pluses also to six and they
decided like a pet

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.219
it was uh... john turner sporting news
writing that and uh... for slowly comes

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.060
and says this kind of quote

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.420
they tell me that i like the state has
unbeaten and instinct even about a

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.360
hundred years

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.300
let's change that day

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.029

governor rivers ways

rizzo all heightens the hasn't beaten
and in-state email de beers

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.060

and of course a resistant of course
that's not true him close the door

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.280
he's lying in the middle of a pepsi

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.780
now i think he misstated it to be fair
because he said let's change that today

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.580
sock he either man miami of ohio has
indeed in in seeking a hundred years it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.990
is possible that might be actually a
thousand years

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.240
or him at a meadow higher state has a
loss

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.360
to an insanity minority views which i

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.120
also can't believe either way he screwed
up a royal

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.630
then you go to by his walker speech he
says

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.770

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.320

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.409
cisco not exactly ed reed at halftime

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.960
but the payton

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.180
so

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.130
well they don't work

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.120
i'll tell you what

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.759
they seem pretty motivated

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.379
they lost fifty-six that uh...

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.009
sale

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:13.540
technical

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.049
groups

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.339
worst that speech of all time

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.949
yeah

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:24.389
uh... using or i'd like to third quarter
if you stuck around here to instantly

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.049
anyways gotta go

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:27.829
uh...

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.150
carpet is that the first time that uh...

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.079
he is a false face that about sports

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.169
you know he talked about how he ran the
marathon and you know he's really in

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:36.750
shape

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.100
you deathly out again that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.549
and so you think if you know what he
probably a pretty good time in fact

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.629
he said he had a really good time is on
a radio show and he said

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.309
uh... did it was quote under three
height to zei tik to howard

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:49.889
fifty-something

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:50.689
wow

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:52.939
in order for a arm and for read

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.799
luggage somewhat believable disguise an
amazing shape

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.989
that so really really good time so
people fought okay at what we got a fact

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.759
check that 'cause that's kind of amazing
for a vice president joe tended to be

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.790
able to do that

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.309
turns out he only ran the marathon wants

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.549
not on the three hours

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:18.159
not under for hours

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.539
four-hours one minute in twenty five
seconds which is not a bad time so why

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:25.609
bother lying about it

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:29.680
this guy's incorrigible he can't himself

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.449
when s explains that the that's more
than twenty years ago but my brother

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.949
tobin who ran boss unless he reminds me
that he is the owner of the first

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:42.469
marathon in the family and has never
himself runner some three if i were to

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:45.949
do any rally being it would certainly be
to four hours not three

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:51.499
he gave me a good reading over this had
dinner tonight with and its

00:03:51.499 --> 00:03:53.579
look if you run a marathon

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.039
you know it acts would have run into
three hours or four hours from don't

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.169
forget that that's not it

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:01.829
come off me

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.469
that's clearly allies

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.360
wind bobek politicians or using man

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.809
their first incentives lot brag about
yourself

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:13.840
put yourself out there was shivam

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.100
uh... tab david turns out you have to be
exist back takings is these days

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.350
that caught me again

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.630
that part of the best for you know about
the issues of also run the marathon

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.360
so how they'd

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.199
well we look at this

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.919
frazzled john edwards three hours on
thirty minutes kick paul reiser

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.460
but george w_ bush three hours and forty
four minutes

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.000
kickball rise that's

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.120
ewww

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.260
serpent

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.819
three hours and fifty nine minutes

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:48.179
meeting for a

00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:50.249
that's called the fail

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:54.449
uh... now though that a hale is
incredible separately to lesser or

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.820
doesn't excellent

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.280
uh... al gore and

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.509
for hours and fifty

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.520
as it here in america okay

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.770
are cat

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.770

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.580
uh... right

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.889
and they were here where where id

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.389
that's what i was a bit of a

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:17.940
and a half a reminder that

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.439
our dog

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.680
