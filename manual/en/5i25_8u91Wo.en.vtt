00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.501
&gt;&gt; WHO CAN REMEMBER WHY WE MADE THIS TOP FLAT
INSTEAD OF A BIG HILL?

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:08.720
WHAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS?

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.860
SOPHIA.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.110
&gt;&gt; AT AUSTIN DISCOVERY SCHOOL, A TUITION FREE
CHARTER SCHOOL SINCE 2004, CHILDREN DIG INTO

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.060
DIGS,
DISCOVERIES IN GARDENING AND SCIENCE.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.520
ALONG WITH A RIGOROUS ACADEMIC PROGRAM, CHILDREN
LEARN TO RESPECT THE COMMUNITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.820
IN WHICH THEY LIVE.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.040
OUTDOORS, THE CHILDREN APPLY CLASSROOM CURRICULUM
TO DESIGN AND BUILD GARDENS THAT ENCOURAGE

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.570
IMAGINATION
ALONG WITH STEWARDSHIP

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.679
IN THEIR SCHOOL.

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:42.069
&gt;&gt; WE'RE TRYING TO PULL A WEED HERE.

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.000
&gt;&gt; AUSTIN DISCOVERY INCLUDES A JUNIOR MASTER
GARDENER PROGRAM, BUT TEACHER AND MASTER GARDENER

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.801
REBECCA VORE WANTS EVERY STUDENT TO LEARN
THAT FOOD COMES FROM THE GROUND, NOT A STORE.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:59.060
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU OPEN A CHARTER SCHOOL, YOU HAVE
TO PROVE THAT YOU PROVIDE A SERVICE OR COVER

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.890
A NEED THAT IS NOT PROVIDED OR COVERED BY
YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.290
AND OUR EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY IS VERY DIFFERENT.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.810
WE HAVE THE KIDS OUTSIDE, GARDENING IS WRITTEN
AS PART OF THE CHARTER.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.250
&gt;&gt; THE CHILDREN PLANT WINTER AND SPRING, THANKS
TO HELP FROM LOCAL FARMERS, GREEN CORN PROJECT,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.979
AND THE MASTER GARDENERS, ALONG WITH NURSERY
DONATIONS.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.520
THE WORK IS ALL WORTH IT WITH THE MEALS THEY
MAKE FROM THE FOOD THEY'VE GROWN.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.500
&gt;&gt; THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO EVERYBODY IS HOW
MUCH THEY LOVE CABBAGE.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.159
AND PARENTS WILL COME UP TO ME AND SAY, I
CAN'T BELIEVE MY CHILD ATE CABBAGE.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.729
AND I SAID, WELL, YOUR CHILD GREW CABBAGE
AND EVERYTHING TASTES GOOD WITH SAUTÉED ONIONS.

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.909
WE TALK ABOUT HOW THE ONIONS CARMELIZE AND
PRODUCE THE SUGARS, AND SO THEY LOVE TURNIP

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.960
GREENS WITH ONIONS, CABBAGE WITH ONIONS, SO
OF COURSE WE HAVE TO GROW OUR ONIONS TOO.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.009
&gt;&gt; BUT THE GARDENS ARE ABOUT MORE THAN FOOD.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.450
THEY'RE A CONNECTION TO THE RHYTHM OF THE
SEASONS.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.619
THE STUDENTS LEARN TO PAY ATTENTION AND NOTICE
FINE DETAILS IN THE WORLD AROUND THEM.

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.780
AND THE GARDENS ARE LESSONS IN PLANNING, ORGANIZING
AND CREATING SOMETHING FOR THE FUTURE.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.520
PLUS INDOORS CURRICULUM GETS TO GO OUTSIDE.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.470
&gt;&gt; TODAY WE'LL BE PLANTING THE STRAWBERRIES,
WHICH WE'LL BABY ALL THE WAY TILL SPRING.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.200
AND THE STUDENTS ARE DRAWING
THEIR STRAWBERRY PLANTS RIGHT NOW, SKETCHING

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200
IN THEIR JOURNALS.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.830
AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE TRANSFER
OF ENERGY FROM THE SUN TO THE PLANT TO THE

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.970
BODIES, AND THAT'S A PART OF OUR NUTRITION
CURRICULUM, PLUS PART OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.190
CURRICULUM.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.580
&gt;&gt; TO GET READY FOR A NEW GARDEN, KINDERGARTENERS
HONED THEIR LESSONS IN ESTIMATING AND MEASURING.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.580
&gt;&gt; WHAT IS AN ESTIMATE?

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.940
NOW THE GARDEN HAS TO BE FIVE FEET BY 10 FEET.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.580
YOU WANT TO HELP?

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.540
TIM, WHAT DOES THAT ONE SAY?

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.410
&gt;&gt; AND WHAT CAN BEAT NATURE FOR INSPIRATION
AND IMAGINATION?

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.010
&gt;&gt; ¶ I SEE A LITTLE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN...

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.069
&gt;&gt; IT TOOK MORE THAN IMAGINATION TO TURN DUSTY
GROUNDS INTO A COLORFUL LABYRINTH.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.430
&gt;&gt; THE LABYRINTH CAME ABOUT AS A COLLABORATION
WITH THE ART TEACHER AND MYSELF AND WHAT THE

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.330
STUDENTS WERE LEARNING IN MATH.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:18.400
AND THIS STARTED THREE YEARS AGO AND THE STUDENTS
WERE LEARNING MANDALAS AND LABYRINTHS IN ART

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.329
CLASS, AND THE ART TEACHER HAD THEM ALL DESIGN
DIFFERENT LABYRINTHS.

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.299
THEN THEY CHOSE THE ONE THAT WAS THEIR FAVORITE
ALONG ALL THE STUDENTS, THE STUDENTS GOT TO

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.160
CHOOSE, AND THEY CHOSE THIS PATTERN, WHICH
WAS DESIGNED BY ONE OF OUR STUDENTS, GABRIEL.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.020
&gt;&gt; THE MATH CLUB MEASURED THE SPACE AND OUTLINED
THE PATHS.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.829
ONE PARENT CONSTRUCTED THE METAL BEDS PER
GABRIEL'S DESIGN, WHILE OTHER PARENTS DUG

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:49.790
THE PATHWAYS WITH A BOBCAT AND LAID CRUSHED
GRANITE.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.349
ANOTHER PARENT DESIGNED THE COLOR WHEEL THAT
THE CHILDREN PLANTED WITH DONATIONS FROM LOCAL

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:04.459
NURSERIES.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.670
ON A FALL DAY, FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADERS WENT
TO WORK CLEARING WEEDS AND LOOSENING THE SOIL

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.709
FOR DONATED SPRING WILDFLOWER SEEDS.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.470
&gt;&gt; THE GROUPS WORK IN TRIBES TO FACILITATE
COMMUNITY, TO FACILITATE COLLABORATIVE WORK,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.590
WHICH IS ONE OF OUR 21st CENTURY SKILLS.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.620
&gt;&gt; OH, WHOA, WHOA.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.290
WHOA.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.960
&gt;&gt; AND THEY GET TO RETEACH THE OTHER CHILDREN.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.750
THAT REALLY HELPS TO CEMENT THEIR KNOWLEDGE
IF THEY GET TO TEACH WHAT THEY'VE ALREADY

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.750
LEARNED.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:46.680
THAT'S ANOTHER WAY OF GETTING IT IN THERE
AS WELL AS THE PHYSICAL MEMORY IN THE WORK.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.830
&gt;&gt; AND PARENTS HELP TO MAINTAIN IT.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.410
CHILDREN DO NOT WANT TO WEED EVERYDAY IN GARDENING.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.600
IF THEY JUST CAME OUT HERE AND WEEDED EVERYDAY,
I WOULDN'T HAVE 'EM.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.790
&gt;&gt; LIKE THE CHILDREN, THE PARENTS CONTRIBUTE
INDIVIDUAL SKILLS AND INTERESTS.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.510
ONE FAMILY DESIGNED AND BUILT THE RAMMED EARTH
CHICKEN PALACE, WHERE EGG SALES FROM FUTURE

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.510
RESIDENTS
WILL

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.560
HELP FINANCE THE GARDEN.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.160
ANOTHER FAMILY DESIGNED AND BUILT THE CHIMNEY
SWIFT TOWER TO SUPPORT THE JUNIOR MASTER GARDENERS'

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.580
LESSONS IN BIRD MIGRATION AND AIR QUALITY.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.820
SINCE THE CHILDREN HAVE AS MUCH ENERGY AS
BIRDS, THE GARDENS CONTRIBUTE TO PHYSICAL

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.910
EDUCATION.

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.760
&gt;&gt; IT JUST BRINGS THE WHOLE STRESS LEVEL DOWN.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.710
ADULTS KNOW TOO THAT YOU SPEND TIME OUTSIDE,
YOU WORK WITH YOUR HANDS, YOUR BODY LEARNS

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.740
WHAT YOUR MIND IS LEARNING, ALSO YOUR BODY
MUSCLES PUTS IT IN MEMORY AS WELL AS YOUR

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.800
MIND.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.710
AND SO IT'S TEACHING THE WHOLE BODY.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.600
IT ALSO GIVES THEM A STEWARDSHIP AND AN OWNERSHIP
OF THIS PLACE AND MORE RESPECT OF THIS PLACE

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.430
THAT THEY'RE DOING THEIR LEARNING.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.139
IT'S A HOLISTIC EDUCATION.

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.790
&gt;&gt; A GARDEN ALSO TEACHES HOW TO ANALYZE AND
RESPOND.

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:55.890
&gt;&gt; IT'S STILL GOT THE ROOTS IN THERE.

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.810
IT CAN REGROW.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.490
&gt;&gt; DO YOU THINK IT WAS JUST IT JUST GREW OUT
LIKE THIS?

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.140
LOOK AT THE BOTTOM.

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.430
HAS IT BEEN INJURED?

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.570
NO.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.680
&gt;&gt; LEARNING TO NURTURE A RESPONSIBILITY IS
ANOTHER OBJECTIVE.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.200
TO NURTURE THEIR WILDLIFE, THE CHILDREN DESIGNED
A POND, INSTALLED THANKS TO A GRANT FROM THE

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.440
NATIONAL WILDLIFE FEDERATION, PARENTAL HELP
AND A LOCAL NURSERY.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.280
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO BE THE CENTER
SPOT OF OUR MAIN OUTDOOR CLASSROOM.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.760
&gt;&gt; EVERYDAY THE CHILDREN SEE HOW THEIR HANDS
HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.190
&gt;&gt; THEY COME OUT AND PLAY IN THIS SPACE AND
ENJOY THIS SPACE AND KNOW THIS SPACE, SO THAT

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.000
WHEN THEY COME OUT TO WORK IN THIS SPACE,
THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE WORK.
