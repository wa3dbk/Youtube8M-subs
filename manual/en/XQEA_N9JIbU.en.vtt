00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.360
Quarter 3 2015 is shaping to be a big couple
of months for gaming in 2015.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.640
For the months of July, August, &amp; September
we're seeing a couple huge blockbuster games

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.470
coming to PC and Consoles.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.599
Let's take a look at the Top 5 Most Anticipated
Games of Quarter 3 2015.

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:32.710
Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain
The first and most anticipated game is Metal

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.940
Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.250
It�s been years since the 2008 release of
Metal Gear Solid 4 and the new game is a huge

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
leap forward.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.860
This game is intended to be truly open world
with a massive environment that you can explore.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.570
There�s traveling through cars, tanks, horseback,
or even on foot.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.010
Like Ground Zeroes, there are multiple points
of entry that you can scout out.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.810
There�s base building and a real time day
and night cycle.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.490
This game will be very comprehensive and not
just a linear run through.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.270
Kojima himself stated that the game is no
longer going from Point A to Point B and that

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.080
it�s 200 times larger than Ground Zeroes.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:23.320
Mad Max
The new Mad Max trailer finally shows some

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.790
detailed gameplay and the open world game
is looking incredible.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.290
The game stays true to the story the movie,
you are a renegade warrior who has lost everything.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.520
You lose your family and your car to raiders
and now you have to rebuild everything.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.510
You build your new car, the magnum opus, piece
by piece with the car crafting system.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.740
You customize both the weapons and the performance
as you complete missions.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.020
But it's not just about the car combat.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.810
You upgrade your own weapons and armor because
there is tons of close quarter combat.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.120
The combat looks medium paced and methodical
similar to the Batman Arkham series.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.220
There's finishers and counters and you will
always be swarmed by bandits.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.890
You have special skills to develop as well
that will help you on your journey.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.870
You'll be using melee weapons just as much
as guns because ammunition is very scarce.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.230
Gathering materials is a big part of gameplay
in order to create new weapons and armor for

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.400
yourself and your vehicle.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.670
Car combat looks really cool and is reminiscent
of Just Cause 2.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.650
The objective is to be as ruthless as possible.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.040
It's truly a survival post apocalyptic game.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.430
The trailer also shows several different factions
that you will fight against or make deals

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.430
with.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.770
These different groups control territory and
resources of the wasteland, so you have no

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.041
choice but to work with them.

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:48.110
Still scheduled for release September 1st
alongside the movie, this game should be a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.379
wild ride.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.879
God of War III Remastered
God Of War is finally coming to the Playstation

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.879
4.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:59.340
The classic God Of War 3 game originally released
for PS3 is being remastered for 1080p 60 frames

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.520
per second with all the previous DLC costumes
and content.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.660
The environmental lighting, the character
details, and facial expressions have all been

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.650
tweaked for the new remaster.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.020
The remastered version promises to bring epic
battles to life with stunning graphics and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.230
the epic story of Kratos in the center of
all the mayhem.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:29.459
This remaster is scheduled to be released
on July 14, 2015 only on Playstation 4.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:42.310
LEGO Dimensions
LEGO Dimensions follows multiple characters

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.860
from various Lego sets after a masked villain
is breaking into multiple worlds.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.530
It follows the same format as both�Activision's�Skylanders�franchise
and�Disney Infinity, where the player has

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.720
Lego figures and a portal which can be played
within the game itself.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.849
There's not a ton of gameplay available yet.

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.010

actor Joel Mchale interacting with the famous

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.310
LEGO Characters.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.090
There is an ancient planet at the center of
the LEGO Multiverse inhabited by an evil mastermind,

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.090
Lord Vortech.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.079
It is said that he who controls the Foundational
Elements that this planet is built upon, controls

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.889
all of the Multiverse.

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.280
Lord Vortech has vowed to be that ruler, summoning
characters from a variety of LEGO worlds to

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.819
help him find these building bricks of LEGO
civilization.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:26.840
Some have agreed.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.419
Others have rebelled.

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.199
And only the combined powers of the greatest
LEGO heroes can stop him.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.319
When a mysterious and powerful vortex suddenly
appears in various LEGO worlds, different

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.889
characters from DC Comics, The Lord of the
Rings and The LEGO Movie are swept away.

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.430
To save their friends, Batman, Gandalf and
Wyldstyle bravely jump into the vortex.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.340
As they journey to locations beyond their
wildest imaginations in search of their friends,

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.539
they soon realize that Lord Vortech is summoning
villains from across different LEGO worlds

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.729
to help him gain control.

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.740
As his power grows, worlds mix, unexpected
characters meet and all boundaries are broken.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.949
Our heroes must travel through space and time
to rescue their friends before the vortexes

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.460
destroy all of LEGO humanity.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:21.360
Mighty No 9
Mighty No 9 is the successor to the original

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.449
Mega Man games created by Keiji Inafune.

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.199
This game brings the classic style run, gun,
and jump gameplay but with modern updates

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.699
and wonderful graphics.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.099

who happens to be the only one not infected

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.539
by a mysterious computer virus that�s causing
creatures to go crazy.

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.100
This game focuses more on speed and momentum.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.860
Boosting and chaining combos simultaneously
gives you points towards a mighty combo.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:06:00.429
The combat will prove to be fluid and very
challenging.
