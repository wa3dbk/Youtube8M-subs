Hi, I'm Allison from ImagiKnit in San Francisco.
We are now going to talk about gauge or tension

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.980
for your knitting project. Here I've completed
a swatch, on the bottom half is garter stitch

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.420
which is knitting all rows. On the top half
is stockinette stitch which is knitting a

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:22.140
row, pearling a row, and then alternating.
Gauge or tension is one of the most important

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.300
things in knitting. If you get that correct
then the pattern that you make will come out

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.079
the proper size. In order to measure your
gauge or tension you want to have a swatch

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.429
that's large enough, and you want to make
sure that you're measuring not too close to

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:46.270
the cast on the bind off edge. So that you
can really assess the proper gauge. You can

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.460
use a ruler or a knit check like this, place
it on your knitting. If you're looking at

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.590
stockinette stitch, you want to take a look
at the Vs inside the box here. It's given

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:09.860
over a two inch space so we'll count how many
Vs. One, two, three, four, five and a half.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.030
So we have five and a half stitches in two
inches, so that means that we will have two

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.250
point seven five stitches per inch. To measure
gauge or tension for garter stitch, you will

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.510
go ahead and use your knit check or a ruler
or tape measure, here we have a two inch box

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.440
and we'll want to just look at the pearl stitches
here and count how many are in the two inches.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.630
We have one, two, three, four, five and a
half. So that means over a one inch space

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.570
we have two point seven five stitches per
one inch. Gauge or tension can also be determined

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.950
for the rows and not just the stitches horizontally
but the rows vertically. So to take a look

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.799
at the rows here for our stockinette stitch
area, you will also do the same thing, we'll

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.629
place our knit check here, and we have a two
inch space, we'll be back up here and we'll

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:24.370
count the Vs. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight Vs in the two inches, so

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.180
that means we have four rows per inch.
