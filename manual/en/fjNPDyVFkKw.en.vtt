Hey! It's Mel.  So... in this screencast
what i want to do just real quickly show

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.590
you... what i do to clean up my
desktop

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.779
if you look at my desktop right now
it's a mess, right? There's all kinds of

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.019
icons, there are folders and all that
stuff that's in there

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.089
and this is important for screencasting
because whenever you're

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.419
showing something on your desktop

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.769
when people see things in a folder that
has an interesting name, or they see

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.109
the trash bin, at some point they
want to know what's in there.  It takes

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.000
away from the attention of whatever it
is you're trying to communicate

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.390
otherwise in your screen video

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.600
Now there are different utilities
that you can use to make

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.470
this very easy.. for example, in windows...you can see
i'm using a macintosh hereÉ but if i had

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.730
to look at windows for just a second

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.280
so in the windows environment

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.170
--this is my nifty little desktop on
the windows side about my macintosh

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.440
right? Anad it's also very busy with
all kinds of icons.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.140
In Windows seven you actually have the
ability to right click anywhere on your

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.109
desktop, you then look at the View menu

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.689
and then you can quickly see where it 
says "show desktop icons."  And then if you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.270
just deselect that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.140
it then hides all the desktop icons.  Okay?  So 
that's a real quick tip.  It's real nifty in

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.150
Windows seven.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.660
uh... And then of course if you want to show
the icons again, then you just re-enable that 
checkbox 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.170
whenever you're done with your screencast.
So that's a
real quick tip.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.749
But that's for Windows seven.  If you want
to see some of the other objects and so

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:26.289
on, then Windows has a website
where they will actually show you how to do 
that for Vista and some

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:27.090
of the other

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.820
platform.  So Windows has a solution.  The
thing is

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.000
"no can solution" when you get to a 
Mac environment.  What's up with that?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.750
Wo there's nothing really built-in
inherently for Macintosh.  However, there

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.540
are a couple of utilities, or a couple
of resources that i would like to point out.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.920
If you go to uh...

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.850
Brooks Andrus' site, he has actually created a
nice little 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.540
Automator that you know is a 
script that you can basically copy and basically

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.479
"glue" into an automator script inside

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.789
Macintosh. It allows you to be able to 
do this.  So that's one way to do it.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.170
I'd encourage you to take a look at that.  
Here's the URL for his website.  You can 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.569
take a look at
that.  He has a nice tutorial.  He has also got

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.849
a screencast that goes along with it.  And it shows 
you in step-by-step fashion how to do all that. So take a

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.459
look at what Brooks has done. 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.489
The other thing that you can do is to use
a utility I like and that I use

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.869
quite a bit.  It's called Backdrop.

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:22.829
And you get it is to go to John Haney's site.
And here is the URL for his site

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.599
that you would use to get there.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.349
And when you go there, and when you click "download"
it actually takes you to the apple store.

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.259
(Let's go ahead and minimize that.) So it takes you to Apple
store where you can download the application.

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.549
And notice the price here.  The price is Free.
So that's always a good price, right?

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.209
And what this allows you to
be able to do is, once you download and

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.819
install it, is to have it my docking
station someplace like where i have here

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.969
anytime I'm ready to shoot a screencast, I can 
just go down and here and click that "puppy"

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.569
and then notice what happens on my
desktopÉ everything just kind of goes away.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.559
But here's what's actually going on.  What
it's doing is actually putting an image

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:56.489
file as a wide window.  So

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.239
what that's actually doing is it's
putting

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.119
an image layer
on top of anything else that you might

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:04.379
have going on.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.379
In the same manner that perhaps you
might have something like this, right?

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.540
This windowÉ and then let's bring up 
another windowÉ 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.900
Okay, so you have this windowÉ and then you
have another windowÉ so when you click these 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.909
guysÉ one

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.020
goes up in front of the other.  You can kinda get
lost a little bit, but

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.620
it's important to note that in the same
way that you would have a window

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.459
that's totally maximized, like this is, right?

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.140
You can easily get lostÉ and thatÉ well, if 
I click off of this for some

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.849
reason

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.150
and accidentally click on another
windowÉ that other one comes in the

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.180
foreground, much like if you notice when
I click the blue area here for 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.889
Backdrop.  I'm doing the same thing there.  So 
just be aware of that.  It can be a

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.540
little bit disconcerting whenever you're
doing a screencast.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.370
But the other thing you can do with Backdrop 
is that you can also click, and in the preferences

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.059
menu you actually do have the ability to
change whatever image it is that you're

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:49.649
using, as well.

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:53.149
Okay?  So I just wanted to put that little quickstep
to you, and put that in your hot little

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:55.910
hands.  Again, the application is called
 Backdrop.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.970
You can get it from the, uhÉ I'll put the 
URL in the screencast and at the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.239
bottom of this video, as wellÉ in the post.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.139
So, you can take a look at that, allright? 
This is Mel.  I'll talk to you next time

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:04.389
take care.
