Sesame Street Explores
National Parks.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:03.520
[HIP HOP BEAT PLAYING]

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.960
(RAPPING) We are park rangers.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:05.895
We take care of the park.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:08.995
We look at rocks and animals,
investigate tree bark, observe

00:00:08.995 --> 00:00:10.935
butterflies that flutter, look
for fireflies that spark.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.920
We are park rangers, and
we explore the park.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.060
Yeah!

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.280
Want to play park ranger
with Elmo and Murray?

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.730
Great.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.630
Come on!

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.530
Come on!

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.778
[LAUGHS]

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:27.658
Say hello to Ranger Shalini
from the Gateway National

00:00:27.658 --> 00:00:29.146
Recreation Area.

00:00:29.146 --> 00:00:30.140
Hi.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.680
Hi.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.010
We're all ready to be rangers,
Ranger Shalini.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.596
What are we investigating
today?

00:00:36.596 --> 00:00:37.880
Habitats.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.836
Ooh, habitats.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:41.604
Yeah, habitats.

00:00:41.604 --> 00:00:43.375
That makes me think
of a question.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:44.565
Elmo too.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:45.824
What is it?

00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:47.752
(TOGETHER) What's a habitat?

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:48.720
[LAUGHS]

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.080
Hey, same question.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.270
That was weird.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.640
Yeah.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.010
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, guys, a habitat is a place
where animals live, find

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.120
food, water, and a
place to sleep.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:57.450
Oh.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.860
Well, can Ranger Shalini give
us an example of a habitat?

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.489
Well, at Gateway, we have salt
marshes, where different kinds

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.580
of animals live.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.630
Don't just tell us about
it, Ranger Shalini.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.800
Show us the habitat.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.760
Great idea.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.750
Use your binoculars and check
out the habitat at Gateway.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.672
OK.

00:01:14.672 --> 00:01:16.516
OK.

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:18.480
Ooh, cool.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.090
Salty.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.910
A lot of gateway is made
up of salt marsh.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.560
The land in this habitat is
flat, with tall grass and

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.540
salty water.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.860
There are many types of birds
that live together in a salt

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.340
marsh, because there is a lot
of food for everyone.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.120
Egrets and herons look for
fish in shallow water.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.280
Piping plovers are one of the
smaller birds that you can see

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.820
in a salt marsh.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.950
Plovers have tiny beaks to eat
worms, small crabs, and

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.680
insects in the sand.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.240
Oyster catchers use their long
beak to dig in the salt marsh

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.890
for food such as mud snails.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.950
Ospreys are big fish-eating
hawks.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.520
They have sharp beaks that help
them eat the fish they

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.370
catch in the salt marsh.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.210
A salt marsh habitat is a
great place to do bird

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.320
watching, because there are so
many birds together sharing

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.410
food, water, and shelter.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.610
[LAUGHS]

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.323
The salt marsh is
a cool habitat.

00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:21.736
And a wet habitat.

00:02:21.736 --> 00:02:22.678
[BOTH LAUGHING]

00:02:22.678 --> 00:02:24.976
Elmo wants to see
more habitats.

00:02:24.976 --> 00:02:25.950
Great idea.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.520
Let's look for more habitats.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.820
Right here, in our own park?

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.710
Oh, yeah.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.760
You can find lots of
excellent habitats

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.070
right here in the park.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.720
In fact, you're standing
in one right now.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.860
Let me show you.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.226
Come on, ranger.

00:02:39.226 --> 00:02:41.870
Let's explore this habitat.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.735
Yeah.

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:46.300
[LAUGHS]

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.990
One way rangers can tell how
healthy a habitat is is by

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.680
counting the number of animals
in that habitat.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.230
There's a group of roly polys.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.800
Look at that!

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.210
Now, let's count together.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.042
OK.

00:03:00.042 --> 00:03:07.760
(TOGETHER) One, two,
three, four, five.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.510
Now, that's a healthy habitat.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.981
Wow.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.910
There's so many cool habitats
everywhere.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.750
Yeah.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.470
So be like a ranger.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.080
Get outside and observe all the
animals in their habitats.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.800
[LAUGHS]

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.890
See you outside on
Sesame Street.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.165
And at the park.

00:03:23.165 --> 00:03:24.670
Peace.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.525
Bye bye.

00:03:25.525 --> 00:03:26.510
Bye.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.300
Sesame Street Explores National
Parks is produced in

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.760
partnership with the National
Park Service and the National

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.140
Park Foundation, who would
like to remind you that

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.250
national parks belong
to everyone.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.440
So be like a park ranger, and
help keep our parks clean,

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.260
safe, and healthy.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.170
