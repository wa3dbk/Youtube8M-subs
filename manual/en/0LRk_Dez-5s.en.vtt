00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:06.259
Ok, I'm just going to make a real short video
here.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:15.279
I made another video of how to replace the
pin and bushings in the door hinges of these

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.050
square bodies.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.390
73-87 pickups, blazers, suburbans, stuff like
that.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:34.839
Anyway, I am going to make a video of how
to remove this one bolt from the upper door

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.780
hinge of the passenger side of the truck.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.410
Just because it's kinda tricky to get to.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.710
It's the only one.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.499
The rest are on the outside.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:54.870
There would be two there, three there, three
attached to the door at the bottom, and also

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.620
three attached to the door at the top.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.100
But, I'm just focused on removing that bolt
which you've got to get to from the inside

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.629
of the truck.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.770
So here we are, inside the truck.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.649
And you can see I've got the glovebox open.

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.600
And if you can see right there, it looks like
someone has already tried to come in here

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.920
and remove that bolt.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.090
I'm going to try to get in here with the flashlight
and the camera.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.990
See if I can get a good picture of it.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.360
Right back there behind that little, it's
a metal disc, little plug.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.440
That's where the bolt is.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.960
It's right back there.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.570
Just take a screwdriver and pop that off.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.909
And I'll do that real quick.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.600
Now to make this a little easier you can take
off your glovebox door.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.180
You can get to that bolt back in there.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.180
Usually what you do is loosen you little catch
wire.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.049
Just philips head screw, loosen it and it
should drop down enough.

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.770
But I'm going to take the whole glovebox door
off.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.570
And there's just four bolts.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:15.570
Four bolts under here.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.400
They are 1/4" inch.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.950
Unfortunately I cannot find my 1/4" socket,
so I'm having to use a box wrench.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.240
But, 1/4" socket or 1/4" wrench and a philips
head screwdriver, and that's really all you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.390
need to get your glovebox door off.

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.100
Alright, so there's the little plug.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.940
I've got the glovebox door removed.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.220
And that's that little metal plug I was talking
about.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.950
Let me see if I can get a screwdriver in here
from the side.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.630
That's not working too well right there.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.760
There we go.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.980
Can't quite get to it.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.890
There we go, we've got something.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.800
Yeah, it's starting to come off.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.580
There we go!

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.280
That's getting it.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.990
There it comes.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:29.410
Let me see if I can get in there with my fingers.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.800
And there it is.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.700
Just a little metal plug.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.120
Just like on the other side.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.650
Now, there you can see, there's the head of
the bolt.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:51.850
Just need a 9/16" socket, and an extension,
and your ratchet, and that will come right

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.590
out.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.350
You'll need a relatively long extension on
your ratchet.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.510
This one on here is an 8".

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.100
And this is it!

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:11.520
You just stick your ratchet in there and start
turning.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.180
But anyway, you get the picture.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.100
And that's how you remove that bolt from the
inside of the cab.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.750
Hope this helps!
