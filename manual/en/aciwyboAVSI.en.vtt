00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:01.599
Hey dudes!

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.320
I am Hilah, and today on Hilah Cooking I am
gonna to show you a basic risotto recipe.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.460
If you you don't know what it is, risotto
or risAHtto, I have no idea how to pronounce

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.790
it because I am not Italian, but it is a short
grain rice that's cooked up in broth until

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.750
it's nice and creamy and then we add some
cheese to it, and it's a really comforting,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.340
easy, filling and a really pretty cheap dish
to make, and it doesn't really take very long,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.340
so let's get started, synchronized watches.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.690
I've gotta go get some watches guys.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:40.910
Before you start anything you want to get
eight cups of stock up to a simmer like so.

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.121
I am using a homemade chicken stock, but you
can use vegetable stock or whatever, and we're

00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.499
just gonna keep that simmering while we work
on the rice.

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.249
So I've got a little bit of butter here melting.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.350
Don't run out on me now olive oil or you're
dead to me.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.420
Okay, we're gonna sauté about a cup of onion.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.519
You could use shallots too, and we're just
gonna cook these until they are soft with

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.490
a little bit of salt and pepper.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.490
Once your onions look like this, they are
not brown, but they are soft and translucent

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.310
we can add the rice, and this is an arborea
rice.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.509
It's sort of a medium, short-grained rice;
really really starch.

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.560
The same family of rice that you would use
to make paella or something like that, similar

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.560
to sushi rice in that it's got a lot of starch
in it, and it's kind of short, fat little

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.950
grains, and we're just gonna kind of toast
this in the butter.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.200
Well, not, no we don't want to get it toasted,
but we do want to get the grains sort of covered

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:44.189
in oil and fat and looking shiny and they'll
start to turn opaque before they toast, and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.249
that's what we're looking for.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.929
I mean they are already pretty opaque, but
you'll see a difference.

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:55.509
Once your rice is looking like this, so it's
all white as opposed to like having a little

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:58.030
white center and then being sort of translucent
around the edges.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.079
We're gonna add half a cup of white wine,
and let that cook off, and if you don't drink

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.300
alcohol, sorry buddy, you're up shit creek.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.300
I am just kidding.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.510
You could just use like half a cup of broth
instead just to kind of get this started I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.720
guess, but you probably could actually just
skip right ahead to the cooking part since

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.340
this really for flavor I think.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.620
So we're just gonna cook it off until it's
evaporated.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.360
Okay, so once your wine is absorbed and/or
evaporated, now is the time for the simmering

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.360
stock.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.590
You want to add it about a cup at a time at
first and having it hot like this is gonna

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.180
make the risotto cook a lot faster, and it
helps it get super-duper creamy.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.640
So we add a cup and then we stir and we wait
until that is all absorbed, and the stirring

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.790
is very important.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.200
The constant stirring helps that starch form.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.220
It helps it release and form a really creamy
thing that's almost.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.890
It has the consistency when it's done that
like the rice has been cooked in heavy cream,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.590
but surprise, it's actually pretty dietary
except for all the butter and the parmesan

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.900
[laughs], and it take a lot of patience.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.900
Sorry guys.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.070
This is probably like the worst recipe I myself
could try to demo because I lack patience,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.270
but I will do my best.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.080
So we've got it over kind of a medium-low
heat which is tortuous for me, but it's happening.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.150
Things are happening.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.550
All right when it's about absorbed like this.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.140
I mean you don't want it to like dry out,
but mostly absorbed.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.150
We can add another simmering stock and stir
it again.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.260
So you just want to keep adding the stock
a cup at a time until you've added six cups,

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.670
and it'll take about five minutes or so in
between each addition for it to absorb into

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.390
the rice, and then once we get to where we've
added six cups, we'll watch it a little bit

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.390
more carefully.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.870
So I am just going to keep doing that, and
I will see you in four cups worth of time,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.080
four more cups I mean because we already did
two.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.900
Okay after our six cups of stock has been
added and it's looking like this, that's when

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.310
you want to give it a taste, and we're looking
for tender rice.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.600
Okay, this is great, so it's like al dente
basically.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.750
The center is cooked through, but it's still
a little bit chewy, so we might not need to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.720
add all eight cups, but now we're gonna start
adding it in smaller increments like just

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.220
a half a cup at a time, stir that in just
until the rice is cooked through, so like

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.311
when you taste it, it doesn't like get stuck
in your teeth like the last little bite that

00:04:36.311 --> 00:04:41.130
I got did a little bit, but not that it's
mushy, like the rice grains should still maintain

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.410
their integrity and still look like rice grains,
and if you wanted to add like sautéed mushrooms

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.371
to this and do a mushroom risotto or whatever,
sautéed asparagus or anything like that,

00:04:50.371 --> 00:04:52.640
you could add that in at this point.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.980
Like, once your risotto is almost finished
cooking is when you can add some sautéed

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.380
vegetable or something, and you'd also be
tasting for salt when you taste it now.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.220
My broth was really well-seasoned, so I don't
think I need to add any salt to the risotto,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.389
but if you're using a low sodium stock or
something you made yourself without salt in

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.580
it, then you might want to add some salt.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.240
Nice, so you can see how thick this liquid
is becoming.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.080
God, it's beautiful.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.920
It's like mesmerizing.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.870
This is cooler than a lava lamp.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.651
I am gonna stick my same gross old spoon in
there and contaminate everything and get a

00:05:31.651 --> 00:05:34.600
shit ton of comments about it.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.639
I don't care.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.639
Almost there.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.510
Okay, our risotto is done.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:48.010
I tasted it, and my rice is fully tender throughout
and also you can see like, it seems kind of

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.550
like a sudden change in the rice pieces and
there's suddenly like a lot more swollen than

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:58.080
they were maybe five minutes ago, so that's
good, and I am gonna add a little bit of butter

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.340
now, and let's get that stirred in, and I've
got the heat turned off now.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.420
It's okay to turn it off when it's a little
bit wet because it's gonna thicken up a little

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.919
bit as it stands, and this is best if you
serve it right away, but if you have leftover

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:15.130
risotto you can make little patties out of
it and fry them in butter and it's real good

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.260
guys, and then some parmesan cheese.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.270
The amount is variable.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.600
This is about a cup which is some might call
excessive, but.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.600
. . whatever.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.470
I think it's fine, and we'll stir that in.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.340
My goodness.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.940
Smells like clouds of popcorn and cheese in
heaven.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.180
Sorry that was probably a place that I dreamed
about.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.180
Okay, we're done.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.180
We're ready to serve.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.540
Look at how creamy and delicious that is.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.170
Mmmmmmm.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:55.470
Lovely, and you can top it with a little additional
cheese, some peas would actually be really

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:02.490
good in this too, and a little bit of black
pepper, or maybe a lot, so this is like on

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:09.670
par with macaroni and cheese to me as far
as like comfort food stuff.

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.460
Mmmmmm!

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:13.250
Mmmmm.

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.040
Man!

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.870
It's so simple, so like delicate.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.240
It's just really mildly flavored.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.710
You could add all kinds of different sautéed
vegetables or meats to this.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.081
It would be really, really good served with
like some spicy sausages alongside of it I

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:33.889
think because it's such a mild thing, just
sort of like a blanket that you can use to

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:36.090
accentuate anything else that you want to
serve.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.090
So there you go.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.900
There's how to make a basic risotto.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.900
I hope you try it.
