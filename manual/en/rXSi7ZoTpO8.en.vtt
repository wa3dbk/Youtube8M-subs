Hi, I'm Michelle Renee here in Tampa, Florida
with the Michelle Renee Makeup Artist Group

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.540
and on behalf of Expert Village I'm here to
demonstrate makeup for Summer. The sixth step

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:20.500
is going to be concealer. Now normally I like
to put the foundation first and then the concealer.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:29.519
I do that because I like to bring the concealer
over the foundation and maybe the little areas,

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.670
blemishes, uneven spots, marks, etc. Also,
with the concealer you want to go a couple

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.050
of shades lighter than your actual skin tone.
This brings lightness to the eye. Makes you

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.809
look young and fresh. This is great for Summer.
Again, with concealer you could use a couple

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:57.329
of different tools hands, brush, sponge. I
normally like to use my hands when, on myself.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.280
When you're using your hands you want to remember
to use your weakest finger, which is gonna

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.150
be your ring finger. You don't want to tug
at the skin. When working around the ocular

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.670
of the eye, you want to go from the outside
corner in. I'll go ahead and do that now.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.050
Also, with a sponge if your quite not yet
a professional yet. The sponge has a perfect

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.960
little area, you could place concealer on
and then just get right underneath the eye.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:39.409
With my brush I'm gonna apply the concealer.
Remember from the inside out in. "Close your

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.549
eyes." With a sponge you could just go in
there perfect. Bring the color down a little

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:50.930
bit to blend. It's Summer and you don't want
to look like you have a cake of concealer

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:59.469
on. Look at the other areas, see if they needs
any concealing. Here is a little guy right

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:12.790
there. Also, with my left over concealer in
the corner of the nose. The last step to the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:21.420
concealer is putting it on the lids. "Close
your eyes, perfect. " Now this does two things;

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.370
it helps bring brightness to the eye area
and when applying shadow this concealer accents

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:44.730
to glue to keep the shadow on and keeping
it lasting longer. As you can see from the

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.450
two different eyes, the one with the concealer
looks bright and fresh. Perfect for Summer.
