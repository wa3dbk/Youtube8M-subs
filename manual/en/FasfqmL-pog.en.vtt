00:00:00.868 --> 00:00:02.569
(squeaking)

00:00:02.569 --> 00:00:03.637
(pop)

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:08.942
(♪♪♪)

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.745
JULIE:
The quill pen.

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.982
It's responsible for much
of our written history,

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.684
medieval transcripts,
Shakespeare's sonnets,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:19.253
the Declaration
of Independence,

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:21.555
and the
United States Constitution

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:24.825
were all created with
a feather quill.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:29.162
The earliest use of the quill
was somewhere around 600AD,

00:00:29.162 --> 00:00:30.931
and it was the primary
writing instrument

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:32.833
until the 19th century

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.370
when metal pens began to
be mass produced.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.205
They were long lasting
and versatile,

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.508
so the quill pen
was set aside.

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.710
What if we were to combine
these two pen types

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.279
into a hybrid tool,

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:47.247
and then turn it into
a work of art?

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:49.616
Can you imagine
the stories, poems,

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:53.287
drawings, and sketches
a pen like this will make?

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:55.255
We'll start with a feather.

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.257
Naturally shed ones
could be used,

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.726
but for the sake of time,
and purity,

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.595
we'll use these
turkey feathers

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.363
that have been
thoroughly cleaned,

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.000
cured for strength,
bleached, and then dyed.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.102
Next we're going to
need a pen.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.873
These are steel dip pen nibs
in a variety of shapes

00:01:12.873 --> 00:01:14.341
and sizes.

00:01:14.341 --> 00:01:15.642
Some of them still carry
the name of

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:18.845
the bird feather quill
that they imitate.

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:22.482
This is a crow quill,
this is a hawk quill.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.852
You could also take an
inexpensive ball point pen,

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:29.456
and remove the barrel.

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:36.229
We'll start by gluing
the nib to the feather.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.298
Then we'll hold it in place
with a little piece of

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:44.738
masking tape
while it's drying.

00:01:44.738 --> 00:01:46.673
Now there is a right way
and a wrong way

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.710
to attach this nib.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.982
You want to hold the feather
so that it arches back over

00:01:54.982 --> 00:01:58.919
your hand
when you're writing with it.

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:02.122
so the nib will be on top of
the feather as you grasp it.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:07.094
The ball point doesn't
need to be glued first.

00:02:07.094 --> 00:02:11.164
Just use a little bit more
masking tape as you attach it,

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.467
and this should go on
the back side of the feather.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.168
Next we paint a design
on the feather

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.837
using acrylic paint.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:19.172
I like to use
very opaque colours,

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.608
especially on the darker
coloured feathers.

00:02:21.608 --> 00:02:24.177
Blick Matte Acrylic
and Jacquard Lumiere

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.480
are two that
I highly recommend.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.317
The surface of the feather is
not the easiest thing to paint.

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.486
It does have
a little bit of a texture

00:02:32.486 --> 00:02:34.021
and it tends to move around

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.189
as you try to
paint on it.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.158
I usually paint designs
and patterns

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:41.662
that are a little
more abstract.

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:46.867
Here's one that I painted to
look like a peacock feather.

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:49.202
You can paint the backside
of the feather too,

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.272
but it has even more
texture than the top side,

00:02:52.272 --> 00:02:55.308
and it tends to resist
the paint a little bit.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:02:58.412
Now the barrel of the pen
can be designed

00:02:58.412 --> 00:03:00.881
in some very
interesting ways.

00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.484
I recommend
putting black first,

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:05.952
near the nib,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:07.621
because that's where
the ink is going to

00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:10.924
come in contact
with it most.

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:14.828
I'll tie a knot first.

00:03:14.828 --> 00:03:18.131
The top of the feather.

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:21.868
Tuck the end of
the thread down,

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:26.473
and just wind it around.

00:03:26.473 --> 00:03:28.575
If I wrap it closely enough
I don't need to remove

00:03:28.575 --> 00:03:36.316
the masking tape.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.351
This is a waxed thread.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:42.189
I find it easiest to use because
it tends to stick to itself

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.425
and it doesn't slide around
that much.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.794
At the end of my thread
I'm going to tie on

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.830
my next colour,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:56.336
which I'm going to use a piece
of lime green hemp cord.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:04:07.180
We'll just tie it right around
the end of my wax thread.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:15.122
And then wrap that as well.

00:04:15.122 --> 00:04:18.792
Up here at the top,
I'll finish with

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:35.542
a little bit of
a gold wire accent.

00:04:35.542 --> 00:04:43.817
Cut the end off.

00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:45.519
Okay, now the ball point
would be designed

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:48.588
in much the same manner.

00:04:48.588 --> 00:04:50.991
The barrel's tightly secured,
but it's going to be

00:04:50.991 --> 00:04:58.064
partially exposed
on the backside.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.368
It can be further decorated
with the addition of

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:04.070
some small glass beads,
some sequins,

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.740
rhinestones,
even some glitter glue.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.010
So it looks lovely,
but what are the benefits

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.112
to writing with a quill pen?

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:14.481
Well the first major benefit
is the ink.

00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:16.816
There's so many beautiful
selections that you don't get

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.151
with a regular pen.

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:21.521
There's metallic, pearlescent,
opaque, transparent,

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:23.757
and like paint,
the colours can be mixed

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:27.294
to achieve
just about any shade.

00:05:27.294 --> 00:05:31.598
Now writing with the quill pen
is a very sensory experience.

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:33.900
You need to hold it loosely
between your thumb

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.303
and your middle finger,

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:39.372
placing your
index finger on top.

00:05:39.372 --> 00:05:42.742
When I dipped it
in the inkwell,

00:05:42.742 --> 00:05:45.745
it went about
halfway up the nib,

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:49.282
made sure that it wasn't going
to drip before I moved it,

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.586
and start with some light
strokes across the paper.

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:57.691
Keep the nib in
the same position.

00:05:57.691 --> 00:06:00.894
Move it by turning your hand,
and as you grow more confident

00:06:00.894 --> 00:06:02.495
in your writing,

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:05.131
you'll find that
writing with a quill

00:06:05.131 --> 00:06:08.335
involves using your
entire hand and arm.

00:06:08.335 --> 00:06:11.238
Using a ball point pen usually
just involves using

00:06:11.238 --> 00:06:16.042
your wrist and your fingers.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:19.379
Now sketching with
a quill pen is great.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:24.651
You can achieve a lot of fine
detail and delicate lines.

00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:28.955
If I apply a little bit of
pressure as I'm using the nib,

00:06:28.955 --> 00:06:35.395
see how the line gets thicker.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:39.032
This makes for
wonderful calligraphy

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:44.738
because it's so expressive.

00:06:44.738 --> 00:06:47.641
Now to clean the nib
or to change colours,

00:06:47.641 --> 00:06:51.378
simply dip it in water,

00:06:51.378 --> 00:06:55.749
or clean it with
a damp paper towel.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:07:01.788
Then dry it off,
and try to store it

00:07:01.788 --> 00:07:03.023
in an upright position

00:07:03.023 --> 00:07:05.592
until it's ready
to use again.

00:07:05.592 --> 00:07:07.227
It's a lot like
a painting brush.

00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:09.863
Keep it clean,
it'll continue to be useful.

00:07:09.863 --> 00:07:12.299
Now all of the materials
I used her today

00:07:12.299 --> 00:07:16.169
and a free lesson plan are
available at DickBlick.com,

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.139
