Hi! I"m Karen for Expert Village. For wood
products, covering wood boxes and other wood

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.950
things, you can use regular white glue to
do this. You don't have to use the special

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.890
decoupage glue. The white glue will work just
as well. You might want to water it down.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.829
You have to play with the texture a little
bit. You could add a little bit of water to

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:35.860
bring it down to a nice workable thing. Just
try it out first and see how it goes. The

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:45.240
decoupage glue gives a little bit of a harder
finish and it will resist water so that when

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:56.329
you do the dishes, you can rinse it off. It
can get it wet, but you can't soak anything.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:04.920
For something that's never going to get washed
or wet, using a regular white glue or craft

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:17.689
glue will work just fine for wooden products.
You just work your way around into the corners.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:26.119
Look for air bubbles. The wrinkles are part
of the character or the decoupage. A little

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:42.700
bit of a wrinkle texture.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:51.979
Now, if you have trouble getting down in the
corner, you can use a tool or anything. Very

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:12.500
gently just to tap it into place. Okay, just
check it. When you're going over it again,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.360
if you see a lump or a bump, you don't push
down hard. You go very, very gently, very

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.640
lightly, because any of the napkin that has
been soaking in the glue any time becomes

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.490
just too delicate to play with so you want
to be very, very gentle with it. Okay, that

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.280
looks nice.
