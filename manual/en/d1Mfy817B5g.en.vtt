[music]

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; ANNE: My name's Anne Hall and I'm the Programme
Leader here for hairdressing at the college.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.510
&gt;&gt; SIMON: My name's Simon Smith and I'm curriculum
leader for hair and beauty.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.190
&gt;&gt; ANNE: The students on a day to day basis
learn all the underpinning knowledge, the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.960
theory, that underpins shampooing, setting,
colouring, perming, reception,and they also

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.540
learn the practical skills that go along with
those.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.100
&gt;&gt; SIMON: We have over 300 students on over
20 courses ranging from level 1 right through

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.440
to level 3 so there's something in there for
everyone.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.790
&gt;&gt; ANNE: The tutors help the students through
the course with everything from the theory

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.770
knowledge in the classroom with the practical
skills, starting with the lower end skills,

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.780
the shampooing, building up into things for
competition work. Tutors are there just all

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.479
the time to support the students with everything.
&gt;&gt; SIMON : Through our links with industry

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.509
we do have apprenticeships, work based learning
apprenticeships at level 2 and level 3. We

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.530
are also very keen on students entering competitions
and traditionally we've done very well in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.829
the regional competitions and certainly the
national competitions. We've had students

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.200
who have won national competitions in The
Winter Gardens in Blackpool. And that obviously

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.720
looks excellent on their CVs.
&gt;&gt; HOLLY: My name's Holly Terry and I'm on

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.619
Hairdressing NVQ level 2.
&gt;&gt; BIANCA: My name is Bianca Starkey and I'm

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.090
on level 2 Hairdressing course.
&gt;&gt; HOLLY: I decided to come and do the course

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.080
because me mam's a hairdresser, she's got
her own business so hopefully in the future

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.659
I'll be able to take over her business.
&gt;&gt; BIANCA : On our course on a day to day

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.149
basis we normally do theory first then we
go into the practical room and do each other's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.450
hair and do clients and stuff and it's really
fun. I enjoy it.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.840
&gt;&gt; HOLLY: The facilities are really good they
have everything and more that you could ask

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.950
for.
&gt;&gt; BIANCA : The tutors have really really

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.950
helped us really because they couldn't be
nicer and if we ever need to have a question

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.970
or need to ask them I know that they're gonna
help us out.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.040
&gt;&gt; HOLLY : Sandra fast-tracked me from my
course and that was because I did have experience

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.439
from a workplace before.
&gt;&gt; BIANCA: All the students on the course

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.250
are really lovely and really nice and friendly
so it's like a friendly environment. Later

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.870
on the course I'll be looking forward to doing
shows and competition work.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.040
&gt;&gt; ANNE: I think as a lecturer at the college
out main aim is to get these students ready

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.069
for commercial hairdressing for the high street.
That's our passion, to get them ready for

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.689
work. We all hope that we are role models
for our students. Some of our students after

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:53.071
finishing the course have really been successful.
Most of the local businesses are students

00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:59.879
who have been trained at the college. We have
a few students working in Toni &amp; Guy. We also

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:05.140
have a student that was here that did very
well, went out into industry and then has

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.010
come back teaching. So you know, we have many
success stories of the students that have

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.349
been here over the years.
&gt;&gt; BIANCA: When I finish the course I'd love

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.970
to have my own shop and be really famous or
even do a celebrity's hair. I'd love that!

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.129
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; BEN: My name is Ben Anderson I'm on hairdressing

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.720
level 2 VRQ. Some advice for the lads? I would
say don't be scared to do it. If you're actually

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.549
feeling like you might feel a bit daft because
it's class full of girls or not a class full

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.180
of girls at the end of the day I'd say go
for it. At the end of the day the girls, the

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.860
tutors, everyone just makes you feel comfortable
and it's a really good course to be on it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.730
to be honest with you. I'm enjoying it I've
never looked back.
