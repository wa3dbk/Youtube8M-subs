Okay, so the first step before you apply any
makeup is to make sure your skin is cleansed

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.330
and moisturized. So make sure you've washed
your face. If you don't have a sink and water

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.470
handy. Than take a makeup remover wipe and
just make sure you get off all your makeup.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.810
All your foundation your eye makeup especially.
Make sure you take that off. Make sure that

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.660
your whole face is cleansed so that you can
begin on a clean pallet. After your face is

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.820
pretty much free of makeup then you want to
start with your moisturizer. And you want

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.809
to do that immediately after. Right after
you cleansed your face you'll feel it's tight

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.820
and your skin is gonna be calling for some
hydration. So you want to put your moisturizer

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.890
all over your face. If you're oily, use an
oil free. If you're really dry use a more

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.300
hydrant moisturizer. Put it completely all
over the entire face, blend it in really really

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.340
well. Don't neglect your neck. You want to
take all the way down the neck and you just

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.100
want to blend it in blend it in really really
nice. And then once it's all blended into

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.880
your face you want to use an eye cream. I
firmly believe in eye cream no matter how

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.859
old you are. Eye cream just helps your makeup
go on smoother. It helps hydrant your eyes.

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.939
I mean the first thing that is gonna start
showing age is your eyes. So you just want

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.099
to take a little bit of eye cream and just
gently put around the eye, not on top of the

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:51.029
eye but around the eye. And then lastly, lip
moisturizer, you don't want to forget your

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:58.409
lips either. Especially if you are going to
be using dark pigments of colors and especially

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.319
in the winter time when your lips are just
naturally dryer any way. You want to you want

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.840
to definitely put a coat of lip moisturizer
on before you start. And by the time you get

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.150
to your lips your moisturizer will be all
soaked in. Alright and now we're ready to

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.450
begin the foundation.
