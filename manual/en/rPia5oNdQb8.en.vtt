00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.212
Humans,

00:00:02.213 --> 00:00:05.265
an amazing word.

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:10.129
We are considered the most intelligent spieces in the planet

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.760
but also we are the worst.

00:00:13.768 --> 00:00:16.348
what do we do in this world?

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.006
who brought us to here?

00:00:19.007 --> 00:00:22.063
What is our mission in the earth?

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:25.316
may be, we will never know it.

00:00:25.317 --> 00:00:28.067
even when seems to be

00:00:28.068 --> 00:00:32.489
that our mission is just destroy it join with its spieces bit by bit

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.038
do you ever thought that maybe this planet does not belong us?

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.890
even so, its care is in our hands...

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:47.373
they were here a lot of time ago before than us

00:00:47.374 --> 00:00:51.201
and only we are their guests

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:54.512
we have come to invade their territory

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:57.510
and we are destroying their home

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.647
we have been tolerated for ages

00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:07.118
we have been forgiven countless times

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:10.875
but we still ignoring its situation

00:01:10.877 --> 00:01:14.252
we have been their kidnappers

00:01:14.254 --> 00:01:15.953
their killers...

00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:18.955
and however

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:20.743
they accept us like their owners

00:01:20.744 --> 00:01:23.618
we are the unique spieces that attacks,

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.622
destroys,

00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:25.747
annihilates,

00:01:25.748 --> 00:01:28.248
pollutes and exterminates just for ambition.

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:31.876
or just to live a little bit better...

00:01:31.877 --> 00:01:33.959
the world is yours

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.802
it is ours

00:01:35.803 --> 00:01:37.677
it is for all of us

00:01:37.678 --> 00:01:39.344
but,

00:01:39.345 --> 00:01:41.730
remember also is their world

00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.730
and we must understand that they can't do nothing to be safe

00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:50.110
and much less to save the planet

00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:53.110
the planet earth is dying

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:55.960
we are destroying it quickly

00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.660
and it is starving for love

00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:00.370
it does not have more strenght

00:02:00.372 --> 00:02:02.870
and however

00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:08.730
it still given us the best and spectacular things since we arrived in it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.930
the planet has been the best host of our spieces

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.590
perhaps is it deserves an acknowlodgement?

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:21.030
if we gave the gift to talk

00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:22.140
think

00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:23.310
create

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.870
build and help

00:02:26.043 --> 00:02:27.730
why just we keep quiet?

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.640
we ignore

00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:30.420
destroy and kill?

00:02:32.424 --> 00:02:33.771
open your eyes

00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:36.300
you are dying too

00:02:36.303 --> 00:02:38.450
together with your planet

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.770
the only planet in the solar system

00:02:41.771 --> 00:02:45.020
where we were given the privilage to live

00:02:45.022 --> 00:02:48.800
we are thousands of millions on this planet

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.400
we are a thinking race

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.030
rational,

00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:54.990
dominant

00:02:54.991 --> 00:02:57.620
why we have not noticed about these?

00:02:57.621 --> 00:03:01.000
we got the capacity to conquer countries

00:03:01.006 --> 00:03:02.160
the moon

00:03:02.164 --> 00:03:04.080
even planets

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:06.040
nevertheless

00:03:06.044 --> 00:03:09.080
we are unable to conquer our own hearts

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:10.760
touch your heart

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:13.230
feel that its try to tells you

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:15.460
listen its says aloud

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:18.260
and understand

00:03:18.263 --> 00:03:21.220
that we must to coexist in the same planet

00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:26.395
begin changing yourself

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:27.760
propose yourself

00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:30.300
make sure your kids know  about it and understand about it

00:03:30.304 --> 00:03:32.580
and than older generation remember it

00:03:32.581 --> 00:03:38.000
so when arrives one day that humanity dissapears

00:03:38.002 --> 00:03:41.290
and some other species find our planet

00:03:41.292 --> 00:03:44.370
they realize that we were a species that failed

00:03:44.372 --> 00:03:45.660
that fallen

00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:48.420
but got up and amended the mistakes made

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:51.510
the planet is not the same

00:03:51.511 --> 00:03:53.510
and we can not wait more time

00:03:53.632 --> 00:03:56.590
all of us know that we must to do

00:03:56.592 --> 00:03:58.640
its time to start

00:03:59.393 --> 00:04:01.770
the future of the planet is in your hands

00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:03.350
help it

00:04:03.351 --> 00:04:05.310
let's help it

00:04:06.642 --> 00:04:17.080
because planet earth is you...
