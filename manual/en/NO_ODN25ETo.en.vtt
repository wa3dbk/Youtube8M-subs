00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.320
Hello friends, I'm Andrey Soloviev from the MobileImho.ru project

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.020
In a world where any smartphone obsolete maximum for the year,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.660
gadget, which we will discuss today, can already be called a survivor.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.180
Its history began in the summer of 2012. 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.680
Then on the Kickstarter website began fundraising campaign for creating a smart and lightweight watch 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.080
with the functions of a personal assistant, living on the wrist.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.820
The device was named Pebble Smartwatch. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.060
The guys who invented this gadget originally wanted to collect not more than $70,000 for its implementation, 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:18.440
however, applications received more than $10 million, which was an absolute record of all crowdfunding projects in the World.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.400
This record lasted almost two years.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.120
What is most interesting in Pebble smartwatch? 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.900
Why these wristwatches are so excited people and became a catalyst for a new industry wearable gadgets?

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.560
In the field, which today tries his hand Wear Google Android, and coming soon watch from Apple.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.840
The success is in well-implemented idea. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.480
The developers managed to properly combine different features and quality of the gadget, 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.140
so that they bring maximum benefit

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.040
For example, the instant receiving any notifications from a smartphone:

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.560
voice call, SMS, message from WhatsApp or status updates on Facebook. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.760
You can configure whatever you want and however you want.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.200
You can silently get notifications on the screen and then to read them, or activate vibrate mode

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.940
You for sure don't miss anything. You don't need to get the phone out of the bag or pocket

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.380
Addiction happens surprisingly quickly. 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:24.440
After a couple days of regular use of these smart watches, the first reaction when there is an incoming call or notification will be raising the wrist with the watch.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.580
Another important feature of this model is that the screen is perfectly readable under the sun, it does not require external illumination

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:41.200
It uses Sharp MemoryLCD - a similar "e-paper", which is now used in all portable readers.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:49.040
Yes, the screen is black and white and has a modest resolution of 144x168 points

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.400
In the dark time to use the gadget you need to activate the backlight, as in conventional electronic clock.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:04.920
On the other hand fully charge the device lasts for 5-7 days. And this is with always-on Bluetooth and sync all activity on your smartphone

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.840
This result is still unreachable for any models for Google Android Wear, who live, well, a maximum one day.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:23.240
Let's see that in early 2015 we will offer Apple, but something tells me that the color touch screen in hours priori more greedy, 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.460
and this autonomy, we do not see there too.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:35.180
Additionally, Pebble Smart Watch has built-in accelerometer that automatically turns on the backlight when you pick up wrist at night, 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.900
but this feature doesn't work stable through time.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:48.020
But what I really liked here is silent vibration alarm clock, which starts to shake your wrist without interfering with the neighbor on the bed, 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:56.600
and allows you to wake up quietly, get up and go about your business. The motors are quite powerful; you will not miss such a signal

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:06.440
It is also convenient that the application on the smartphone, through which controls communication with the gadget allows you to choose the appearance of the clock face from dozens available,

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.900
and install any of the hundreds of useful, but often useless programs on all occasions

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:21.980
Many will like, for example, to manage your music on your smartphone, select the track, stop and resume playback, without taking your phone out of your pocket

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.140
Cycling computer app will show the speed and distance traveled. The gadget is completely waterproof;

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.780
you can not just wash their hands, but also to swim, not afraid to miss something important

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.700
For Pebble already created games, but this is, in my opinion, already too much.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:47.320
 The main advantage of just such a smart wristwatches that it works equally well with the iPhone and Android, Windows Phone smartphones and even BlackBerry

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.780
Now for the cons, and here the most controversial, in my opinion, is the design, or rather its complete lack

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.300
The first Pebble generation is available in various case colors, looks more like a toy

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.240
It is not easy to imagine such a gadget on hand of trendy man or stylish businessman

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:18.180
In the summer of 2014 in Pebble realized that their gadget lacks solidity and released a new model of the Pebble Steel in a metal case and metal bracelet, 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.400
which looks much more effective, though, and is much more expensive.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.080
The second disadvantage is unusual charger in the form of a magnetic cable. Its pad is jumping on the left side of the gadget

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:40.560
This cable is better not to lose, and leaving the house in the smart watch, with vague plans for the next few days, it is best to carry

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.000
 because neither party nor the travel you will not find such a cable. I do not at all sure that it is sold separately?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.460
Note that this gadget «out of the box» still does not understand the Russian language

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.300
The corresponding firmware you need to search and download yourself or with friends

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.020
Not difficult, but may deter those who are absolutely not familiar with the issue

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:17.540
Importantly, these gadgets are becoming a new global trend, and sooner or later, get ready to try something similar on your wrist. Bye!

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.200
Eugeny, by the way, I have always wanted to know how hard they are.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.900
For example, if they fell from a height human growth. Watches work and even did not scratch.
