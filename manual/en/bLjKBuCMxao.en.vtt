00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Finally on the Wii VC yesterday, Strider Hiryu was delivered.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.400
Strider Hiryu in this Mega Drive version. Looking at the screenshots and movies, I know, "Strider Hiryu" the same. I think so.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.600
So, Mr.Teraminato is "X68000 version of Strider Hiryu" only know. Do you know the X68000.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.500
Try opening. Should be surprised. What's this? You would think so. This is 5 inches floppy.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.700
Containing the software in it. how to use it. Maybe turn in front of the screen.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.600
Are reproduced very well. Huge characters work well. Screen will change violently. Situational music.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.800
So I think it can be pretty good. However, compared to the version I X68000. A little uncomfortable.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:55.800
Two similar grapes. This is Muscat. This is Seto Giants. Completely different taste than eat.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:02.900
Can be installed on the Wii Channel. At any time, you can quickly play a short time. It is a quick and happy. But...

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.600
If possible, I would like the arcade version or VC X68000. What also like Strider Hiryu.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.900
I think everybody does not know.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.600
To tell the story of Strider Hiryu today, I entered the attic, So...

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.100
Yes, "Ohohtsuku ni kiyu". Applying the model of what? . For PC-6001 "Ohohtsuku ni kiyu".

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.100
So, what would the media

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:34.600
Cassette. What I listen to a cassette. oops! know? Did you mean everybody does not know the cassette? Topics lonely cassette.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.500
Oh! To note is found, phone number of LeBlanc etc written.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.300
Apparently, some written by  lovely umbrella. Everybody, You don't know lovely umbrella?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.600
After complete the game, my mood became residents of Hokkaido. That everyone has feeling of "Do-min".

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:01.400
ta da! What's this picture? It's Andorgenesis. The Xevious. Tiny Xevious. That evolution Tiny Xevious Mark 2.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.300
Only uses three colors (note: truth is 4-color). This is one of the best games I was crash in my life.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.200
Tiny Xevious media check. Oh! Cassette too. Of course, the "cassette-style music player" old man to enjoy.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:25.500
So, "Mono do-mo-". This Bokosuka Wars. "Bokosuka Wars" is a masterpiece. It is a super ultra-high-level RPG.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.000
So, what do Say? Only use the numeric keypad or joystick. Story of Go right "the king with servants,". (Note: The truth is left).
0:02:32.600,0:02:33.500
Story of go right "the king with servants,". (Note: The truth is left).

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.400
How to combat? Select the menu command? A mistake. Action? Misunderstand. Collisions. Collision only.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.000
When I walk, hit the shoulder. This Yarrow. You bastard! Say sorry. Say sorry defeat.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.900
No, life is not simple. Sometimes wins apology. "Bokosuka Wars' is like that.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.200
-listen-

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:02.400
What is this song? But even this cassette. The cassette containing software, can not play anymore.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.300
If you set the cassette deck, you can hear. It is not a game BGM. Piiiii.... zaaa......

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.800
Yes, the developers of Mario Where is everyone? Repeat after me..

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.600
Is correct. Of course. By Hudson. This is Mario's clay pipe. game hitting push push.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.500
Hudson is a unique interpretation. Punchbowl Mario.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.500
Super Mario looks normal. (NOTE: There is no super)

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.500
Mario and Luigi have a Bouncy Balls. Fire is not on. The Bouncy Balls.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.500
I hope it released on Virtual Console. Mario is good at dodge ball too?

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.500
Yes. Check the contents. What is this? Application environment is the PC-6601.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.500
Software of the most wanted classic game, it's "fruit panic" is. Pony Canyon is made.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.300
The cassette. Please let me say bluntly. It's similar product Mappy. Hopping &amp; hopping, jumping around uncontrollable.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.500
So, the topic about the game now. Needless to say. It Skyward Sword.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:06.700
Want fast! Nintendo is now too Spoiler. "Asked the president," "Everybody's Nintendo Channel", such as video.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.500
Out too. Excessively. Bad bad.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.900
Apparently, The first episode the most in The Legend of Zelda series. As such, Nintendo is the self-promotion.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Until now, fans have been discussed, What is the first story. It's...

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.500
The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap. Link first encounters a hat. So perhaps the first episode, it was an opinion.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:37.500
On second thought, the link is sometimes encountered hat. In Wind Waker is not wearing the hat first. Hat gift from Grandma.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.500
The Game Boy Advance. There are two of the early Nintendo DS. Will also work with GameCube.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.600
The old software is no longer employed with the media unusable. It's a little lonely.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.500
Really, is excited to Skyward Sword.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.500
The sword is not in the swing button. Swing with the motion. So, wait for the release and then committed to health.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.300
see you!
