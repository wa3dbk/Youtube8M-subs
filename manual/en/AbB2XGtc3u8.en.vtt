00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.620
A name of a rudiment which you may have heard
before but you're not really sure what it

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.691
is, is called a flam.

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:17.830
A flam starts out with one of your hands or
arms up in the air, and the other one as close

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.320
to the snare as you possibly can get it, and
it's going to be what's called a grace note,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.949
it's going to fall right next to your main
note.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.060
The objective of this is to do a normal full
stroke, and to land your upper hand on the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.760
down beat, or on the number you're counting,
with the other hand throwing in a little tiny

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.969
grace note right before that, right as you're
striking the other hand.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.840
Now the most important thing about a flam
is the setup, or what I mean by setup is to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.039
get your hands in the right position first
before you strike it, and that would be one

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.499
hand up, and the other hand close to the drum
as I mentioned, and this is what we call a

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.690
right flam, with the right stick up and the
left stick closer to the drum.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.870
When you play it, you want to basically set
these down as close as you can to each other

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.840
without hitting them exactly at the same time.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:18.020
It sounds like this.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.470
Now it's important to understand that flams
alternate, so after you strike a right flam,

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.470
your hands will reverse themselves, your right
hand will start up high, you'll strike, and

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.520
everything will reverse for your left hand
that will become high, and the right stick

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.460
is back towards snare drum head.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:53.360
It will sound like this.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.560
As I mentioned, the most important part of
the flam is the setup, and you want to make

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.540
sure that they're either not too separated,
or too close to each other where they land

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.000
right on top of each other.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.500
Remember, as you alternate, make sure your
sticks reverse themselves, and go for that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.329
even sound on either side of your body.
