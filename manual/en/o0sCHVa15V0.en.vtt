00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.960
The circle closes

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.420
The end begins

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.280
Do you think you're making a difference?

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.860
In the end the Emperor wins

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.880
Dark days lie ahead

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.620
The darkest days

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.300
If my error can't be undone everyone will pay the price

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.260
If you defeat the Emperor whatever sacrifices are required will not be in vain

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.360
In time he will consume all life in the galaxy

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.960
Every living thing in the entire galaxy? It doesn't seem possible

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.100
You mistake me for your own weak flesh

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.560
I do not end

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.680
My life spans millenia, legions have risen to test me

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:21.440
The scores of dead have nourished me, I am awakened, and i bring with me, Death!

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.760
You are mine, servants, slaves, weapons

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.200
Pettiness, fueled by self righteousness

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.820
You are master of nothing!

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.700
Till the Emperor is destroyed for good, the entire galaxy is in danger

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.000
If you won't surrender I will destroy you

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.080
You are a blind insect, let your death be the same!

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.380
The deaths you've caused

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.840
The war you fueled

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580
It is all mine!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughs)

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.180
This galaxy, is mine!

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.840
It's time I claim it, once more!
