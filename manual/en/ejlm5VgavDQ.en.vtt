00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.410
 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.120
I am getting ready to have a little
outdoor lunch with a few of my friends.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.240
Sort of an end of summer tea.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.380
The weather is just perfect outside it's
the in the summer,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.070
and before it gets too cold I really want to
take advantage of my deck. I want to set up

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.470
my table really beautiful,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.710
have lots of great food and drink

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.440
and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.040
good conversation. So I'm getting
everything ready so it's just perfect.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.000
First i want to show you how I
created my centerpiece. Here it's

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.560
beautiful decorative,

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.110
glass candle holders.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.080
These were made with pieces I found at
the dollar store and i'll show you how

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.570
easy it is to create these yourself.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:03.290
Ok so let me show you how I made my
centerpiece, and all of these items I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.780
bought from the dollar tree.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:17.990
I use about seven of these glass
candlestick holders, a large candle Bowl,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.460
three of these, and I found these great
glass beads that I use as a mosaic around

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.450
the bowl.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:34.340
I got this from the hardware store this
is an epoxy for glass and its really

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
great it binds minds really strong.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.470
You're also going to need a little
container to mix the epoxy in, something

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.149
that you could throw away and you'll
need a hot glue gun.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.409
Ok so already let's get started.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:58.670
Ok to start off just to let you know the
way I made the different sized pieces,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.720
the first level, the first size I used
two candlesticks like this up a one on

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:12.410
top of the other and a bowl on top like
that. For the next level

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.530
I used the two pieces but in the center,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:25.730
I put the smaller sized candlestick and
brought it a level up with the bowl on

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:36.620
top and for the largest sized one, I used three
candlestick holders

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.049
like that! So let's start by binding the
glass pieces together, we'll do the first

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:58.530
level a little bit there is two solutions
that come together and you're going to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.970
mix it together for 20 seconds.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:14.400
Smear the glue on top of the first
candlestick,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.360
and put the other candle stick right on
top you're going to make sure it's lined

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.360
up.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.510
You're going to sit the bowl on top.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.990
Right in the center make sure it's centered

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.810
and you're going to let that sit for
about an hour.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:57.180
Ok so the piece set for about an hour
and now it's nice and dry, and strong, and

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.080
bind it together so it's ready to put
the glass beads on.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.600
So I want to make sure that the bowl is
really nice and clean and dry so

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.060
that the piece of the stick.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.420
I'm going to start from the top and I
used a hot glue gun and put like just a

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.420
little bead.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:44.740
Press it down to spread the the wax out.
Now when you get close to the end of the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.610
line,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.410
you might find that two pieces will fit there.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.660
So what you want to do is find a nice
large piece and you're going to Center

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.840
it in between the two pieces.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:14.620
Ok here is the less piece! There you have it, a
beautiful glass mosaic candle holder.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:27.070
That will make a great centerpiece on my
table. Put some little tea candles in the

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:35.260
center of each of them light on and
really great

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.260
shimmering on the table especially at

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.960
night and for something this beautiful
you may find in little boutique

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.139
it will only cost you about fourteen
dollars to make

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.319
