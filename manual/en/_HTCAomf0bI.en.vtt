00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:11.710
The iPhone conspiracy is something that Gizmodo
has been writing about for the past day and

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.050
basically they found out that iPhone is secretly
tracking you everywhere you go and they collect

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.650
that data and it's accessible to people who
have access to your computer now how does

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.339
this work if you have an iPhone usually you
sync it to a computer so the computer holds

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.050
all of your information that you have on your
iPhone right while you sync it your computer

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.620
also all the information that's been tracked
about you so all of the specific places that

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.010
you've all the specific cities, the specific
streets, the specific street corners so here

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.480
is a map showing you the activity of Sam Bittle
he is one of the Gizmodo writers who commented

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.340
on the story so basically there's now this
software available where as soon as you have

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.879
access to someone's computer you can download
that software on the computer and you can

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.300
find the specific places where the iPhone
user has been to okay so Gizmodo is basically

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.670
saying look this is disastrous if you have
an ex girlfriend ex boyfriend or someone in

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.110
your family or a close friend who has access
to your computer somebody that you're trying

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.500
to hide some sort of information from they
can easily download this software and find

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.110
out where you've been okay the disastrous
part about this I don't think it's that bad

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:34.030
but the part that's bad at this point is the
fact that if you're an iPhone user you can

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.520
not opt out of it okay you have no choice
iPhone is tracking you okay they're climbing

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.990
in your windows they're snatching your people
up no okay they're not doing that but they

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.190
are keeping track of where you're going and
when you sync that on to your computer that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.560
information is now on your computer yes listen
if they look at that information it gives

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.910
them the information of where your iPhone
was within a stretch of a week so it's not

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:08.070
like you were there at some place at 8:21
p.m. but apparently that's also being recorded

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.220
somewhere you're not going to be able to get
that off your iPhone or your computer based

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.340
on that software but it does exist somewhere
and of course people are beginning to ask

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.970
why are they keeping track of it at all and
Ana made a great point the biggest problem

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.170
is it's not like you're turning on a tracker
if you turn on a tracker okay everybody gets

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.040
that and you can't even turn it off if you
wanted to so they are involuntarily tracking

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.510
you and if did want to whether it's cops or
someone else they could go in and say alright

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.780
well it turns out at 8:30 John Smith was at
a strip club or he was in a brothel or he

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.049
was gambling or he was doing something he
shouldn't have been doing and they could find

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.890
out because you took your phone with you disaster
no it is a disaster and you know I I should

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.409
note Apple isn't the only company that's doing
this okay there are other phone companies

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.579
that are doing similar tracking but right
now all of the details on this are sketchy

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:12.180
for instance Gizmodo attempted to talk to
Google about this they attempted to talk to

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.900
Apple about this and they're very very hush
hush okay they will not release any details

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.579
they're not explaining why they're collecting
this information they're not explaining what

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.310
they plan on doing with the information later
on they're not asking it they're not answering

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.310
any questions about why people are not allowed
to opt out of this okay but regardless of

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.269
all of that this is a disaster it should not
be allowed okay I'm very uncomfortable with

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.910
the idea of not just phone companies but also
websites compiling all of this data on us

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.400
all of this personal information about us
and then selling it to advertisers so they

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.400
can you know sell specific ads to us every
time we visit another website I think that

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.629
it invades our privacy and you know with a
lot of different websites you can opt out

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.109
of it right but when it comes to the phone
company when it comes to Apple when it comes

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.650
to the iPhone if you're not allowed to opt
out of it then well I then I don't want an

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.579
iPhone and this is information that everyone
should know because a lot of people are unaware

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.290
about this right and and by the way I should
make clear that Ana's right that we're not

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.290
entirely clear what the other smart phones
are doing they might be doing the same exact

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.661
thing they're looking into that and the answers
are sketchier but it's a problem with you

00:04:20.661 --> 00:04:25.580
know possible problem with all the smart phones
a definitive problem with iPhones just to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:37.630
be clear I'm telling you man like when I started
seeing those commercials where they said you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.400
can buy Starbucks with your iPhone you can
scan your eyes with your iPhone it takes your

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.230
finger print and stores it somewhere that
way you never have to carry a wallet anymore

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.810
if you if you don't have an iPhone well if
you don't have an iPhone I said all that shit

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.620
if I don't have an iPhone good because there's
something going on the reason you can do everything

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:01.960
from your iPhone it ain't worth it you can
start your care with your iPhone shit that's

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.610
what I got keys for what do we are we five
years old we can't keep track of two things

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.430
in our pockets at the same time this is ridiculous
somethings wrong I'm not surprised no and

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.130
you know what some people are going to listen
to that Jayar and they're going to be like

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:18.480
ah grandpa Jayar he's slow to catch on to
this new technology but no I also feel very

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.540
uncomfortable depending on one tiny part one
tiny piece of technology to do everything

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.710
to control every single aspect of my life
the fact that people can keep track of where

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.080
I'm going and when I'm going there that's
unacceptable and I don't want that and I should

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:39.610
have the ability to opt out of that you know
Pandora got in trouble because they were selling

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.300
personal information to advertisers they were
selling information about the users gender

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.610
age preferences so advertisers can target
them with very specific and specialized ads

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.860
okay Pandora got into a lot of trouble for
that I think Apple should also get into trouble

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.640
for that my personal information and my whereabouts
are none of Apple's business well they're

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.900
going to screw up with me if Pandora's giving
away my information I have a Lady Gaga channel

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.110
but there ain't nothing I'm buying that's
got anything to do with Lady Gaga boy are

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:14.820
they going to hit the wrong demo okay until
you see me coming out of an egg and you're

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:22.030
like oh could you imagine alright anyway look
Jayar you don't understand with an iPhone

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:30.920
you can start your car you can pay your bills
and you can get tracked by Dick Cheney think

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:44.560
of all the advantages it pays your bills it
whips your ass shit man you can do all this

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:53.240
I don't get it anytime I'm sorry one last
thing because now I'm totally grandpa on this

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:03.580
if anything says do what the masses the masses
are doing it get along everyone's got it shit

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:12.490
be one of the one percent that doesn't something's
wrong they're herding everybody don't do it

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:20.110
man so you can run and tell that homeboy [laughing]
okay let me tell you something when they come

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.560
to snatch everybody up here's who they're
not going to get Jayar Jackson he's gonna

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:31.180
