00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.049
Next, let's come to the Chinese word for pineapple.
Actually I am going to teach you two words,

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:14.679
one is "bo luo" and the other is "fung li",
because both words are commonly used. First

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:28.490
is "bo luo".

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:36.250
They have something in common that is the
grass radical in both characters. And the

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:45.070
lower part of the first character "bo", is
actually the pronunciation of "bo" in "bo

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:55.239
luo". And the second character is the same,
the lower part, it's exactly the pronunciation

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:03.530
of the whole character, "luo". Bo luo. And
the second word I would like to teach you

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:16.390
is fung li. People in the south, in the south
of China they call pineapple fung li, but

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.150
in the north, we would like to say bo luo,
but both characters are very common. Fung

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:35.410
like we know, that is in such kind of enclosed
structure we write the outside structure first,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:45.060
and then something inside. And this li, I
don't know if you still remember, li means

00:01:45.060 --> 00:02:00.680
pear. Fung li. Okay. Let me write the two
words for you again. From top to bottom, from

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:22.811
left to right.
Bo luo. This is one stroke. And fung li for

00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:23.709
pineapple.
