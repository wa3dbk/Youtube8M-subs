00:00:00.813 --> 00:00:03.460
- We're told to look at
the rational numbers below,

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.596
order them from least to greatest.

00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:07.094
They really didn't have to
tell us this first sentence,

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:09.311
I would have known to look
at the rational numbers

00:00:09.311 --> 00:00:11.110
to order them from least to greatest.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.722
Well anyway, they tell
us 1/2, negative five,

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.460
three point three, zero, 21 over 12,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.247
negative five point
five, and two and 1/8ths.

00:00:20.247 --> 00:00:22.708
So the easiest way to
visualize this might just be to

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.865
make a number line that's long enough that

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.384
it actually can contain
all of these numbers,

00:00:28.384 --> 00:00:30.625
and then we can think about
how we can compare them.

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:34.224
So let me just draw a huge
number line over here.

00:00:34.224 --> 00:00:38.043
So, take up almost all the entire screen.

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:40.446
I'll stick with, we have
some negative numbers here,

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.524
we go as low as negative five point five,

00:00:42.524 --> 00:00:44.498
and we have some positive numbers here,

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:47.087
looks like we go as high
as three point three.

00:00:47.087 --> 00:00:48.979
This thing is still a
little less than two,

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:50.685
so we go about as high
as three point three,

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.506
so I can put, I can safely I think put

00:00:53.506 --> 00:00:55.561
zero right here in the middle,

00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:57.024
I can go a little bit to
the right since we have

00:00:57.024 --> 00:00:59.183
our negative numbers go more negative.

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:01.702
So zero, and let's make this

00:01:01.702 --> 00:01:06.601
negative one, negative two,
negative three, negative four,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:10.386
negative five, and well
that should be enough.

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:12.882
Negative five, and then in the
positive direction we have,

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:17.455
one, two, three, in
the positive direction.

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.418
And let's see if we can plot these.

00:01:19.418 --> 00:01:24.015
So, to start off, to start
off let's look at 1/2.

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:26.360
Where does 1/2 sit, so it sits,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.562
let me actually make the
scale a little bit better.

00:01:30.562 --> 00:01:35.490
So this is one, two and three, and four.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.294
Alright, so let's start with 1/2.

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:41.997
1/2 is directly in-between zero and one,

00:01:41.997 --> 00:01:43.402
it is half of a whole.

00:01:43.402 --> 00:01:46.049
This right here would be one whole.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.103
This would be one whole,
let me label that.

00:01:48.103 --> 00:01:50.123
This over here is one.

00:01:50.123 --> 00:01:52.944
So 1/2 is directly between zero and one.

00:01:52.944 --> 00:01:56.021
So 1/2 is gonna sit right over here.

00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:59.562
So that is, let me write
that a little bit bigger,

00:01:59.562 --> 00:02:01.047
you probably have trouble reading that,

00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:03.079
Alright, one over two,

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.366
which is also zero point five.

00:02:05.366 --> 00:02:07.398
So this is also zero point five,

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.185
anyway that's where it sits.

00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:11.893
Then we have negative five.

00:02:11.893 --> 00:02:14.839
Negative five, well this is
negative one, negative two,

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:17.625
negative three, negative
four, negative five.

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:21.096
Negative five sits right over there.

00:02:21.096 --> 00:02:24.440
And then we have three point three.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.597
Positive three point three,
I'll do that in blue.

00:02:27.597 --> 00:02:29.106
Positive three point three.

00:02:29.106 --> 00:02:31.579
So this is one, two, three,

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:33.738
and then we want to do
another point three.

00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:36.385
So point three is about
a third of the way,

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:37.836
a little less than a third of the way,

00:02:37.836 --> 00:02:40.181
it would be three point
three three three forever,

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:41.563
if it was a third of the way.

00:02:41.563 --> 00:02:43.084
So a third of the way,

00:02:43.084 --> 00:02:45.185
that looks like about right over here.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.261
This is three, this
right over here would be

00:02:48.261 --> 00:02:51.721
three point three, let me label.

00:02:51.721 --> 00:02:53.717
What I'm gonna do is I'm
gonna label the numbers

00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:57.734
on the number line up here
so it's one, two, three,

00:02:57.734 --> 00:03:01.855
four, this is zero,
negative one, negative two,

00:03:01.855 --> 00:03:05.721
negative three, negative
four, negative five,

00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:07.393
and so on and so forth.

00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:09.633
And then we get to zero,
which is one of the numbers

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.177
that we've already written down.

00:03:11.177 --> 00:03:14.382
Zero is obviously right over
there on the number line,

00:03:14.382 --> 00:03:16.436
so I'll just write this zero
in orange to make it clear,

00:03:16.436 --> 00:03:17.737
it's this zero.

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:20.997
Then we have 21 over 12,
which is an improper fraction,

00:03:20.997 --> 00:03:23.019
and to think about where
we should place that

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.818
on the number line,

00:03:24.818 --> 00:03:27.256
to think about where to
place it on the number line,

00:03:27.256 --> 00:03:29.137
let me do this in this blue color.

00:03:29.137 --> 00:03:30.692
To think about where to
place this on the number line

00:03:30.692 --> 00:03:32.759
let's change it into a mixed
number, makes it a little bit

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.895
easier to visualize,
at least for my brain.

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:39.399
So 12 goes into 21, well
it goes into it one time.

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.512
One times 12 is 12.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.857
If you subtract you get a remainder of,

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.794
well we could actually
regroup here, or borrow,

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:48.454
if you don't want to do this in your head,

00:03:48.454 --> 00:03:50.835
you would get nine, but let's do this.

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:54.409
So if we borrow one from the
two, the two becomes a one,

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.114
this becomes 11, or we're
really regrouping a 10.

00:03:57.114 --> 00:04:00.713
Anyway, 11 minus two is
nine, one minus one is zero.

00:04:00.713 --> 00:04:02.234
So we have a remainder of nine.

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:05.438
So this thing, written as
a mixed number, 21 over 12

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:09.536
written as a mixed number
is one and 9/12ths.

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:11.115
You get one 12/12ths in there

00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:13.193
and then you get 9/12ths left over.

00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:15.712
So one and 9/12ths we can also write that,

00:04:15.712 --> 00:04:18.289
actually we could've simplified
this right from the get go,

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:22.631
cause both 21 and 12
are divisible by three,

00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:26.372
but now we can just divide
nine, we can simplify

00:04:26.372 --> 00:04:29.040
9/12ths, divide both the numerator

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.693
and the denominator by three,

00:04:31.693 --> 00:04:36.016
we then get one and three
over four, one and 3/4ths.

00:04:36.016 --> 00:04:37.514
And just to make it clear,
I could have simplified

00:04:37.514 --> 00:04:40.734
this right from the get
go, 21 divided by three,

00:04:40.734 --> 00:04:44.328
is equal to seven, and
12 divided by three,

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:46.093
is equal to four.

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.345
So this is the same thing as 7/4ths,

00:04:48.345 --> 00:04:51.491
and if you were to divide four into seven,

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.429
four goes into seven one time,

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:55.566
subtract, one times four is four,

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:59.025
subtract to get a remainder
of three, one and 3/4ths.

00:04:59.025 --> 00:05:01.533
So going back to where do we plot this?

00:05:01.533 --> 00:05:05.073
Well it is, it's one,
and then we have 3/4ths,

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:06.443
we're going to go three
fourths of the way.

00:05:06.443 --> 00:05:09.891
This is half way, this is
one fourths, two fourths,

00:05:09.891 --> 00:05:12.526
three fourths, would be right over there.

00:05:12.526 --> 00:05:17.526
So this is our 21 over 12,
which is the same thing as

00:05:18.246 --> 00:05:21.465
7/4ths, which is the same
thing as one and 3/4ths.

00:05:21.465 --> 00:05:24.228
And then we have negative five point five.

00:05:24.228 --> 00:05:27.833
Negative five point five,
I'll do that in magenta again,

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:29.081
running out of colors.

00:05:29.081 --> 00:05:31.089
Negative five point five,
well this is negative five,

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.784
so negative five point
five is going to be between

00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:35.106
negative five and negative six.

00:05:35.106 --> 00:05:37.381
So let me add negative
six to our number line,

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:39.448
right here just to make it clear.

00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:41.781
So let me go a little bit further,

00:05:41.781 --> 00:05:44.080
let's say that this is negative six.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.401
Negative six, and our
number line will keep going

00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.201
to smaller values.

00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.279
Let me scroll to the left a little bit.

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.682
Negative six, so if we go
to negative five point five,

00:05:52.682 --> 00:05:56.722
it's smack dab in-between
negative five and negative six.

00:05:56.722 --> 00:06:00.123
So this is negative five point five,

00:06:00.123 --> 00:06:02.317
right over there.

00:06:02.317 --> 00:06:05.390
And then finally we have two and 1/8ths.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.505
I'll do that in orange again,

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:09.782
or I'll do it in blue.

00:06:09.782 --> 00:06:13.984
Two and 1/8ths, so it's
two and then 1/8th.

00:06:13.984 --> 00:06:15.958
And so if we want to find the exact place

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:17.664
we could divide this into eighths,

00:06:17.664 --> 00:06:21.019
this would be 4/8ths,
this would be 2/8ths,

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:23.260
and that would be 6/8ths,

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.744
and then 1/8th would sit right over here.

00:06:25.744 --> 00:06:29.239
So that right over there is two and 1/8th.

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:31.502
So we've actually plotted,
as best as we could,

00:06:31.502 --> 00:06:32.559
the exact locations.

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:33.940
You didn't have to plot
the exact locations

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.415
if you were just trying to order them,

00:06:35.415 --> 00:06:39.002
but it doesn't hurt to
see exactly where they sit

00:06:39.002 --> 00:06:40.464
when we order them.

00:06:40.464 --> 00:06:41.939
So now we've essentially
ordered them cause we

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.831
stuck them all on this number line.

00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:46.466
The order is negative five
point five is the smallest,

00:06:46.466 --> 00:06:49.345
then negative five, then a zero,

00:06:49.345 --> 00:06:54.345
and then positive 1/2, then 21
over 12, then two and 1/8th,

00:06:54.813 --> 00:06:57.228
and then three point three.

00:06:57.228 --> 00:06:58.679
And we're done.
