00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.250
[Narration]
Just east of El Paso lies sacred ground.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.080
Hueco Tanks.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.380
A state park with the history of humankind
here for all to see.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.340
Ancient pictographs painted on these rocks
dating back hundreds if not thousands of years

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.340
ago.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.820
[Wanda Olszewski]
There really is no other place like Hueco

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:38.559
Tanks in terms of the nature and the number
of pictograph images and for a tiny place

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:44.039
of only eight hundred and sixty acres there’s
just an amazing number of separate pictographs

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.039
sites

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:46.039
{Wind}

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.719
{Spray paint}

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.620
[Narration]
Unfortunately vandals damaged several pictographs

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.620
with graffiti.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.300
The thought was they could never be restored
back to their original glory.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.420
That is until now.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.500
{Computer bangs into rocks}

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.620
[Narration]
Scientists have a theory and they are here

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.200
to put it to the test.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.000
[Narration]
This is the key to analyzing the graffiti

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.540
…a Raman spectrometer.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.010
[Tom Tague]
What we want to do is use the chemical information

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.730
to ablate off the H and C and not touch the
yellow of the pictograph.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.960
And the chemical information that we get from
the Raman spectrometer allows us to do just

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.960
that.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960
[Narration]
Did you catch that?

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.640
They can figure out what the paints made out
of with this machine.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:51.130
So later, they can use a laser to remove just
the paint and leave behind the original pictograph.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:04.980
[Andrzej Dajnowski]
We need to understand first what’s there

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.750
before we can address removal process.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.501
The removal process has to be safe and in
order to make sure that it is safe is to analyze

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:15.590
what we have on the stone.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.950
[Narration]
To see the laser in action tune in to Texas

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.139
Parks and Wildlife Television the week of
October 21-27, 2012.
