Hi! I am Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village and today we are going

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.260
to talk about training dogs. So now we will
talk about how to properly fit a no-pull harness.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.270
Now keep in mind that this is a special type
of harness. Now there are several on the market;

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.499
this is the premiere pet product, easy lock
harness. Most harnesses have a hook in the

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.650
back, a ring in the back that you attach the
leash to and it actually teaches your dog

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.319
to pull worse. All you can do with that type
of harness is try to physically control your

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:36.120
dog and they learn to pull harder and harder.
This harness has a special mark what is called

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.239
a Martingale action in the front that does
not trigger that reflex that causes dogs to

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.870
pull. So the advantage of a no-pull harness
is that it is a very, very gentle way to have

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.390
some control over your dog. The disadvantage
is that if you have a really really hard puller,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.989
who is determined, you are going to have a
hard time controlling them with this. Be sure

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.079
to check out the video on heeling for some
tips for dealing with hard pullers. Now I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.329
am going to show you how to fit this. On this
particular product, the odd color piece goes

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:13.600
under the dogâ€™s chest, and this part goes
in front. I am going to come down here to

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:23.680
Zute. The first thing is to fit is actually
this top part. You want the ring to be about

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.540
right there, so I need to tighten this up
several inches, then we can adjust the bottom

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.850
strap, we are just about perfect, I am just
going to tighten this up a little bit more,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.289
now sit. As you can see Zute is getting little
agitated; she is not sure exactly what this

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:54.049
thing is. For actually putting it on, I recommend
having the back part of it latched, give the

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.150
dog treat as you put it over their head and
then underneath. If dogs are uncomfortable

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.680
having things put over their head, if they
have not been properly conditioned to that,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.370
then you can always have them walk into it
and buckle the top part. This right here is

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:26.830
a little bit too loose; we want it to be a
little snugger. So we have a nice little V-action

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.340
here and Zutey is ready to go. Right Zute?
