00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.899
• From giant armoured animals to human beings
packaged, stamped and shipped off across the

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.730
world, we count 15 of the most bizarre things
that've ever turned up in regular postage

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.849
15 - Severed Ear,
• Jared Leto the famous actor once had a

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.770
fan send him their severed ear for what is
believed to be absolutely no reason

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.050
• The ear was sent anonymously with only
a small note that read, "are you listening?"

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.660
which he proved by posting a photo of the
ear to his instagram account

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.920
• Jared then strung up the ear and now wears
it as a necklace, because if someone goes

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.280
to the effort of carving off their own ear
Van Gogh-style, this is merely the polite

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.570
thing to do
• Though some believe it to be a fake ear

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.910
sent as a prank
14 - Piece of Titanic,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.499
• Over 90 tons of the famed unsinkable ship
was sent via FedEx from Milan, Italy all the

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:56.409
way to Atlanta, Georgia
• They did it for the "Titanic: The Artifact

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.409
Exhibition" showcasing bits and pieces of
the Titanic wreckage in a public museum, often

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.870
travelling all over the world to do so
• Included in this giant FedEx delivery

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.689
was a 3000 pound piece of the ship's hull,
along with Leonardo DiCaprio's resume found

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.869
washed ashore
13 - Single Brick,

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.780
• This is something you can send to anyone,
right now, and it's perfectly legal - if you

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.689
ask the post office to send it, they're legally
obliged to do so

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.630
• In some parts you don't even need to package
it, just slap on a label, a stamp and hand

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.320
it in at the local post office
• They might look at you funny, but just

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.770
tell them you're building a house - very,
very slowly

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.140
12 - Chameleon,
• It was December of 1954 when a man named

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.320
David from Ohio decided to mail his pet chameleon
through to Orlando, Florida

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.120
• Despite his hopes, the post office has
a strict policy on live reptiles and this

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.350
particular chameleon bore no exception
• David received a note from the postmaster

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.939
which read: "Dear David, I received your chameleon
yesterday and he was immediately released

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:02.930
on the post office grounds.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.259
Best wishes for a merry Christmas!"

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.280
11 - Unmanned Aircraft Drone,
• By itself it's not too strange, but when

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.840
you consider the drone worth $350,000 was
sent to the wrong person alongside a weightlifting

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.870
bench, it gets a bit crazy
• The man who received the drone took photos

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.159
and posted them to reddit, where they went
viral until the mystery of this misdelivered

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.480
drone became a bit clearer
• The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.900
left a note informing him it was federal property
and the return address

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.379
10 - Rhino,
• Another FedEx parcel carried from Switzerland

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.930
to Ireland as a transfer from Basel Zoo - but
for a very particular reason

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.580
• One of the infant rhinos in Ireland had
only just lost its mother, and without a parent

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.460
supporting it, this rhino Hoovie wouldn't
make it for very long

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.379
• They shipped the Swiss rhino Heidi to
act as a surrogate mom for Hoovie, and so

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.879
they shipped her off with a considerable postage
fee

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.840
9 - Dead Cat,
• This was sent by a couple in Yorkshire

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.379
who loved their cat dearly, but when it died
on them while travelling abroad they felt

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.470
so bad that they decided to give it a proper
burial at home

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.689
• Since they couldn't afford to wait until
they came back home since the cat would decompose,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.129
they chose the next logical step - by sending
it via mail

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.360
• When one delivery website asked them to
explain, they gave a long, overly lengthy

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.489
explanation about why they felt the need to
seal up their deceased animal in an envelope

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.170
and send it to themselves
8 - Live Cat,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.079
• And now to mirror the previous story,
let's talk about the old system of sending

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:45.400
mail - such as with pneumatic tubs during
the early 1900s that sent mail whizzing through

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.770
the air direct your home address or business
• In 1931, some guy thought it'd be a great

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.360
idea to send an entire cat through this tube
- which he did, to great success, and one

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.689
attendee who witnessed the event claimed the
cat seemed dazed, but unharmed

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:06.300
• As unharmed as you can be after you've
been sent hurtling through a pressure tube

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.709
at 35 miles per hour like you're the feline
equivalent of Augustus Gloop

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.079
7 - Children,
• In 1913, the parcel postage system officially

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.970
begun in the U.S, and so people immediately
began to test the limits of what types of

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.430
packages could be sent
• A couple from Ohio realised they could

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.280
send their son via parcel instead of by train
in order to save money, so they paid for stampage

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.410
and insured the kid for $50 - because apparently
that's what a human life is worth

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.139
• Another sent a small baby to its grandma
by post, and at that point the Postmaster

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.740
finally stepped in to say, well, infants aren't
exactly immune to the general wear and tear

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.780
from standard postage, let's just abolish
live human mailing shall we

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.040
6 - 25,000 Sea Turtle Eggs,
• These were only delivered about 4 years

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:00.430
ago after a great tragedy would've seen their
population obliterated if it weren't for postage

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.060
• A massive oil spill on the Gulf of Mexico
polluted the water these turtles called home,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.260
so the eggs found all over the place were
scooped up and shipped off to the Atlantic

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.320
Coast in Florida
• Luckily the plan was successful and over

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.710
14,000 hatchlings were safely released into
the Atlantic Ocean

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.389
5 - Live Hamster,
• This one comes in from a father who tried

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.150
to have his daughter's hamster delivered from
their home in Essex all the way to Devon - their

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.410
holiday locale
• According to an official description,

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.330
this hamster appeared to be under great stress
while left at home and, to ensure the rodent

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.980
wouldn't develop emotional trauma, they arranged
its delivery

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.430
• The father hired a delivery service instead
of relying on traditional postage to make

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.850
sure the hamster was comfortable and in good
health

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.669
4 - Pillow,
• Just like the brick, you can mail yourself

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.880
an entire pillow by writing your details on
the front in permanent marker

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.900
• This is great if your friend has insomnia
and you want to send him or her a giant piece

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.860
of irony in the mail because - you're a jerk
3 - Diseases,

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.419
• The late 1800s in New York City, Daisy
James from the New York post office noted

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:14.330
that physicians delivered various strains
of disease to the national Health Board, including

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.009
smallpox, scarlet fever and diphtheria frequently,
all over the country

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.310
• Of course, back then you didn't have the
luxury of different types of postage - if

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.849
you wanted your disease, you had to find the
shmo willing to carry it next to their milk

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:30.650
bottles
2 - Slave In A Box,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.800
• Henry Brown was a slave that came up with
the ingenious plan to mail himself to freedom,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.950
by shoving himself in a wooden crate and getting
shipped to Philadelphia

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:44.509
• He touted his escape, which in turn caused
slave owners to get riled up and pass what

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.010
would be known as the Fugitive Slave Act,
forcing all escaped slaves to be returned

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.319
to their owner under penalty of law
• Slaves that escaped through this method

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:56.080
really wish they'd kept their mouths shut
after this

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.910
1 - Building
• This goes hand-in-hand with bricks, since

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:05.319
in 1916 the young businessman William H. Coltharp
mailed an entire building through standard

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:08.919
post
• He did this by packing up all 80,000 bricks

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:14.130
used for construction and placed them in crates,
40 crates shipped each time weighing over

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.069
a ton collectively
• The U.S Postal Service got pissed and

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:22.870
decided to create a rule preventing this,
a maximum of 200 pounds of goods per day

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.319
• They went on to further inform: "It is
not the intent of the U.S. Postal Service

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:42.439
that buildings be shipped through the mail."
