00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.300
(♪♪♪)

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.167
DEE:
Hi, I'm Dee Solin,
creator of

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:09.567
the Magic Palette Colour
Mixing Guide.

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.367
I'm an active
professional artist,

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:14.567
and I spend a great deal of
time working in my studio.

00:00:14.567 --> 00:00:17.033
I've been painting
for over 35 years,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.300
and working with colour
is my passion.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.200
Today, I'm going to
tell you about

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.867
the Magic Palette Colour
Mixing Guide,

00:00:24.867 --> 00:00:26.033
why I created it,

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:28.067
and to show you
how it works.

00:00:28.067 --> 00:00:30.267
There has never been
anything like it,

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.033
and once an artist uses it,

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:35.400
they'll wonder how they ever
painted without it.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.733
Colour is the focus
in my work,

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:39.967
and I felt there was a need
for a guide

00:00:39.967 --> 00:00:41.833
that an artist can
comfortably use

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.700
while painting in the studio

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.000
or outside to
help with the selection

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and mixing of colour.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.233
I set a goal to
once and for all

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.567
take the guesswork out of
mixing colour,

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:53.933
to make it simple.

00:00:53.933 --> 00:00:54.833
That's why I created

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.767
the Magic Palette Colour
Mixing Guide.

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:00.700
There are many books that
deal with the issue of colour,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
and I have a library
full of them,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.633
but there's never been
anything as easy to use

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.200
as Magic Palette.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.967
So portable, it can be taken
with you and used anywhere,

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:14.200
and you can refer to it
while actually painting.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.800
Let me show you how
the Magic Palette works.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.667
It works on a very
simple grid system.

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:24.000
An artist can select any
colour from the guide.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.867
From the selected colour,

00:01:25.867 --> 00:01:29.200
you follow the row
to the left margin

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.367
where you will find
the dominant colour.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:34.567
In this case,
it's Cerulean Blue.

00:01:34.567 --> 00:01:36.500
Then, from
the selected colour,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.967
you follow the column down
to bottom margin

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.000
where you'll find
the mixing colour.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.567
In this case, it's Sap Green.

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:49.100
So this colour is a mixture
of those two colours.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.167
Now you place a dab of
the dominant

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:54.400
and the mixing colours
separately on your palette.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.000
I add a little white to
the colours

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.567
to make them opaque
and easier to see,

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:00.000
since many of
the tube colours

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.900
are dark and transparent.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.800
To both the Cerulean Blue
and the Sap Green,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.233
you slowly add a small
amount of Titanium White,

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.600
and blend until each of
the colours closely match

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.700
the mixing colour on the chart.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.100
Once they closely match,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.400
you slowly add the mixing colour
into the dominant colour

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.100
in very small increments
and blend

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.433
until the selected colour
is achieved.

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:30.500
It's that simple.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.767
When I'm outside
painting a landscape,

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:34.600
I'm often overwhelmed by
the range of

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
beautiful colours before me.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.667
Looking at the sea and the sky,
I see endless shades of blue.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:43.433
With the help of
the Magic Palette Guide

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:46.967
you can begin to differentiate
the variations of blue,

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:49.767
the turquoise sea
approaching green,

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:52.467
the Cerulean Blue sky
becoming more purple

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:55.567
as you look up to
the atmosphere.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:57.933
You can select each of these
beautiful shades of blue

00:02:57.933 --> 00:03:00.300
on the Magic Palette
Colour Mixing Guide,

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.867
and easily mix the colours
to capture the magic

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:05.600
you see before you.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600
Magic Palette is
available in two sizes.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.400
The Personal Mixing Guide
shows you how to mix over

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.533
300 colours using 18
essential artist tube paints.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:18.300
These are the paints that
are most typically found on

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.267
an artist's palette.

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.733
The Personal Guide is
small enough to take with you

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:25.300
wherever you paint.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.933
The Studio Mixing Guide is
much more comprehensive,

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:31.933
and shows you how to mix
over 800 colours

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:36.300
using 29 popular
artist tube paints.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.133
This is for artists who

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.000
want to see a greatly
expanded colour palette,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.067
and it is ideal for
use in the studio,

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:46.567
workshop, or classroom.

00:03:46.567 --> 00:03:49.967
Both are very affordable
and will not stress the budgets

00:03:49.967 --> 00:03:51.800
of working artists.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.033
Magic Palette is
truly a unique

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:56.167
and meaningful product.

00:03:56.167 --> 00:03:58.967
It is also a great educational
tool for artists

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:02.867
of all experience levels,
and ideal for use by students,

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:05.733
beginners,
experienced artists,

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.300
and teachers.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.933
It also makes
a wonderful gift.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.467
Thank you, and happy painting.

00:04:12.467 --> 00:04:15.200
