00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.399
Hey youtubers it’s charlie, since everyone’s
been asking me to do a legend of korra q&amp;a

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:06.399
I decided it’s finally time.

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:08.310
Since my last korra video the production team
has downsized a little as they’re working

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.040
on finishing up book 3 and 4 and the sound
designer Benjamin Wynn is going to be releasing

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.840
some non-korra original music this year.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920
He hasn’t announced when yet.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.490
If you haven’t seen yet, I started doing
weekly anime club videos to fill the giant

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.070
hole that avatar content leaves when it’s
not on TV.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.610
I’ll be posting a new video for that later
today.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.010
Be sure to subscribe to get it.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:34.749
Just like last time I picked 20 of your questions,
so here we go Number 1 - injustice warrior

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:39.280
241 asks who do you think the new villain
is going to be and what type of bender? will

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.969
we see toph and her children?

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.199
So grey delyle implied in a radio interview
that she would be playing an evil female water

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:48.469
bender.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.879
That doesn’t mean that she’s the main
villain, but it’s going to be a similar

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.820
situation to book 2 where there’s a super
evil person and then there’s just a medium

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.820
bad person.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.010
The creators kind of implied that the big
problem that korra will have to solve this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.280
season won’t have anything to do with her
bending abilities.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.940
So I would guess the main villain is not that
evil waterbender.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.440
As for toph, since we haven’t seen her grave
you could assume that’s she’s on walkabout

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.630
like Zuko or she’s living with her family
in the earth kingdom.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.630
Because she’d be super old.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.013
Book 3 will be all about the earth kingdom
and lin’s family.

00:01:12.013 --> 00:01:15.610
So even if we don’t see toph, we’ll see
the rest of the beifongs.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.540
Question 2 - Jellybeans7854 asks can korra
go into the spirit world and find her past

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.100
lives like aang did?

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.150
Right now I would say that’s the only way
she’s going to be able to communicate with

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.150
them.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.920
The concept of people’s spirits going somewhere
besides the spirit world when they die hasn’t

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.960
been explored a lot.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.700
So until confirmed otherwise let’s say that
they’re somewhere on the other side of the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.700
portal.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.430
Question 3 - Alan Michael asks do you think
we’ll see a new series after Korra book

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.810
4, with a new avatar?

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:42.856
Not on nickelodeon and not for 3-4 years minimum.

00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:44.740
The creators said that they’re taking a
long break after book 4 is over.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.740
So the avatar content you see after that will
be all in the comics.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.740
That will keep going longer than the show,
just because it costs less to make and doesn’t

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.740
take as many people.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.380
Honestly I think that unless Nickelodeon changes
it’s mind during 2015 whenever book 4 is

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.170
over, the creators will do a different non-korra
animated show.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.820
They’re both still really young, so they’ll
definitely have a follow up project eventually.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.360
Question 4 - Marwa elmasri asks when will
they release the book 2 soundtrack?

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.650
They haven’t announced it officially yet,
but sometime before the premiere of book 3,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.140
and I expect that late this spring or early
summer.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.640
So you’ll probably see that soundtrack in
a couple months if not sooner.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.352
Also, they put the book 1 soundtrack on spotify,
so you don’t have to buy it if you don’t

00:02:10.352 --> 00:02:11.352
have money.

00:02:11.352 --> 00:02:12.352
They’ll do the same thing for the book 2
soundtrack.

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:13.352
So you’ll be able to listen for free.

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.060
Question 5 - jojo allen asks, can you explain
what happened to zuko’s mom?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.480
She changed her identity, her face and her
memory and eventually started a new family.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.430
Zuko found her, but he didn’t reveal himself
to her when he saw how happy she was with

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.430
her new life.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:26.640
But he did find her, so he got some closure.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.590
Question 6 - James Kung asks, who’s got
the balls to tap Toph beifong?

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.129
You’re asking about lin’s father.

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.980
That’s a pretty common question.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.239
The most likely candidate is the The Duke.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.510
My second guess would be a character that
wasn’t part of the original series and someone

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.510
we haven’t met yet.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.650
There’s also a rumor that Lin was adopted,
but we won’t get an answer until book 3

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
premieres.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.889
Question 7 - darkwintre asks, what would you
like to see in book 3?

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:52.480
Actually I’d like to see mako and bolin
get more involved in the central plot.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.070
During book 2 they mostly got stuck in capital
city dealing with Varrick.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.659
If you saw the hobbit then think about how
the dwarves work as a single unit when they’re

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:00.799
throwing people around or cleaning dishes.

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.840
I’d really like to see some good fire ferrets
action either in a fight or when they’re

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.840
just snooping for clues.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.750
Question 8 - Tommy Shen asks, will they go
deeper into the concept of energy bending?

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.249
I know what you’re asking, will they give
us a very descriptive analysis of the mechanisms

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.249
behind energy bending.

00:03:12.249 --> 00:03:13.980
And no, I don’t think so.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.930
I don’t think there are enough experts in
energy bending for that to happen.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.599
Only the lion turtles could really explain
it better and I don’t think we’ll see

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.359
another one until book 4.

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.000
Question 9 - Izzy Goggin asks, do you think
they’ll make an episode where Korra and

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.120
Asami have to help each other.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.790
I think we’ll see some different character
match ups.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.569
But I don’t think we’ll see a lot of scenes
with just asami and korra.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:45.769
Secondary characters on korra don’t get
a lot of screen time, just because the episodes

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.540
are so short.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.150
I would recommend you start writing some fan
fiction.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.189
As long as it’s not too gross I’ll totally
give you a shout out.

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:56.860
Question 10 - Matthew Levis asks do you like
last airbender or Korra better?

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.409
We’ll there’s a lot more airbender content
than korra right now, so I’m really waiting

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.269
to see book 3 and 4 before I definitively
say which I like better.

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.540
My opinion tends to change year to year based
on new things I see.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.889
So I try not to get hung up on old series
too much.

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.980
Question 11 - Timelord tennant asks, who would
win in a fight.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.840
Toph Beifong or the weeping angels?

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.570
If the angels could make toph afraid enough
to hesitate, they could definitely get her.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.660
Plus since angels can only move when you’re
not looking at them, toph would have to continuously

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.650
pound the ground with her feet to get visual
sensory information using the soundwaves.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:40.630
If they fought and she wanted to win, she’d
have to be running in place the whole time.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:48.420
Question 12 - adam tolentino asks what was
your least favorite thing about book 2?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.200
The amount of time allotted for developing
secondary characters.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:05:00.510
Because they only have half the episodes of
last airbender, secondary characters get almost

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.850
no time on screen.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.690
So they just don’t feel as real as a lot
of the characters in last airbender.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.940
Question 13 - kristine silmaro asks if the
creators ever did an animated movie which

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.310
characters would you want to see?

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.560
All of them of course.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.870
Really though I’d like to see the story
move forward in time.

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.851
But I’d want to see all of the classic characters
in flashbacks.

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:25.430
a 90 minute movie has a lot more room for
extra characters.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:39.250
If we do see a movie it would be whatever
that next thing they do after book 4.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.460
Question 15 - lilly anne kitten asks, do you
think the earth queen will be beifong’s

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.460
sister?

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.300
I think the new opal character played by alyson
stoner is the earth queen, but I don’t think

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.490
she’s related to beifong.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.990
I think beifong’s family is really tied
up in the politics of the earth kingdom though.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.000
Question 16 - Sara Johansson asks what happened
to zuko?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.400
It’s implied that he’s wandering around
the world.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.092
I think we’ll see him again in book 4 briefly.

00:06:02.092 --> 00:06:06.030
The biggest characters will always be korra,
mako and bolin, but that doesn’t mean that

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.670
Zuko couldn’t show up and help them out.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.650
Question 17 - sweetkitty 013 asks variety
was saying that paramount dedicated a big

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.190
budget to planning a bunch of animated movies
in 2012 and last airbender was one of their

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.190
ideas?

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.191
What does this mean?

00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:25.600
It means that the creators have met with paramount
about doing an animated movie.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.040
They probably had to pitch an idea, meaning
they know what they want the movie to be.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.420
But since there’s so much money involved
and those big deals fall through a lot I would

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.900
wait to hear something official from the creators.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.570
Question 18 - Ivo Aboiltes asks do you think
bolin will ever learn metalbending?

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.630
Yes, they’re going to be in the earth kingdom
next season, so what better place to learn.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.780
It would mean he’d need a lot of scenes
with beifong so I can’t wait to see super

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.070
serious lin and silly bolin try to communicate.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.920
Question 19 - Randal Fisher asks, are they
going to deal with Korra being cut off from

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.920
her past lives?

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:09.080
Yes, that will be a big part of the plot before
korra learns about what’s going on in the

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.210
earth kingdom.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.910
They wouldn’t travel there unless something
really important was happening.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.790
Last question number 20 - Roberto Mileiro
asks, are we ever going to learn how aang

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:18.790
died?

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.300
It’s implied that he died of natural causes.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:28.450
If it had been murder or a giant battle the
characters probably would have mentioned it

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.270
during book 1.

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:43.190
But everyone seems fairly peaceful about it,
I just think that means that he died of old

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.190
age.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:45.190
Thanks so much for submitting your questions
again!

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.190
This was a lot of fun.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.010
I’ll be posting my anime club video tonight
