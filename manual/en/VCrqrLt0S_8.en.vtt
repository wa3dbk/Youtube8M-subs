00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.670
DR: So we are geriatricians. What do you think
geriatricians do?

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.030
#1. It doesnít have anything to do with Jerry
Lewis I guess.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.799
#2. I have no idea. I would think jury atrician?

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:02.839
DR: Geri, geriatrician.

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:09.369
#2. Geriatrician....its gotta be something
in the sciences. Really I have no idea. If

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.970
you had
said jury atrician I would think it had something

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.520
to do with the courts but now that youíve
corrected me I would have to say it has to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.509
do something with science or medical.it
makes me think of pharmaceutical but I really

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:23.240
donít know.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.569
#3. First word that came to mind was Gerrymandering.

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.399
DR. Gerrymandering, hmm, hmm.
People who make sure that that does not happen.

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:32.229
DR. O.K.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.880
#4. Ice cream. Laughter.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.119
DR. Ice cream?

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.780
#4 Ben and Jerryís.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.780
#5 I was just gonnaí ask you what a Geri
atrician was. A Geriatrician????? WOW, I

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.939
have not heard that. Uhm, sounds like something
in nutrition. Choosing foods certain foods

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:08.539
that are healthy. Yes, I just finished taking
care of my aging parents and actually they

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.539
passed away but in the midst of it all Iíve
read things about taking care of the elderly

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.970
and I have not come across that word. Geriatrician...so
I have  learned something today.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.410
#6. Uhm, actually Iím not too clear on what
geriatricians do. Uhm, yea.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.410
#7. The thing that initially pops out is jury
so I am thinking jury.law and then atrician.the

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.549
only thing I can think about in my head is
like dietitian or atrician or but I have

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:55.260
no idea how those could possibly come together
to form a career

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.260
#8 And geriatricians I would guess would have
something to do with like diet like nutrition diets. diets like

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.459
dietitian may be a person who specializes

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.870
DR. You heard of the term before?

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.400
#8: I havenít thatís actually the first
time. So I donít know if thatís a new thing

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.019
going on cause when I was in college I did
not have that.

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.480
DR. O.K.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.760
DR. Have you heard of the term beforeÖ.geriatrician?

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.170
#9 No never. Never in my life.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:36.170
#10. A geriatrician .it sounds like it sounds
like it would be some form of nutrition, diet,

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.099
something related to the intake

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.069
#11 Something to do with Geriatrics. Nutrition

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.069
#12 I mean, I would, I would think it would
have something to do with being on a jury

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.989
or something I donít know, Iím just guessing.
I donít know. I never heard the word

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:04.239
DR. that is fantastic

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.060
#13 I would go with the same thing, I honestly

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:14.060
#14 Geriatrician. Well I think of geriatricians
 geriatrics .children .childrenís doctor pediatricians,

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:29.169
but geria .that would be my guess. Now that
I'm thinking about it... does geriatrics have

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:39.469
to deal with old people or young people? Gosh
I think maybe geriatrics is old people though

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:48.810
so this has something to do with our older
generations? That would be my best guess.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.940
#15. Geriatrics. Geriatrics for what they
do like, itís like being a juror basically.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.080
DR. So it could be physicians, nurses

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.080
#16. Geriatircian that doesnít sound medical
although I donít know what the word would

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.450
be for a physician in geriatrics. Is that
the proper term?

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:26.450
#17. I donít want to sound really dumb. Is
that a Dr. who works with elders? Yes. Yeah.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.800
Dr. yea, fantastic.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.419
Dr. What does a geriatrician do?

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:39.419
#18. Honestly. I would say nutrition for geriatrics
people so it would be the elderly.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.190
DR. o.k. great.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.190
#19. I think that helping the elderly with
their nutrition and taking care of their body

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.779
through nutrition.

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.279
DR. Have you ever heard of the term geriatrician
maíam?

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:03.279
#20. Yes, I heard of a geriatric aide. O.K.
DR. But the term geriatrician itself?

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.940
#20. No.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.039
DR. Have you ever heard of the term before?

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:10.919
#21. No.

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.209
DR. Youíve never heard the term geriatrician
before?

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:22.209
#22. Well it sounds kind of like dietitian
except for old people so I would think it

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.820
might be related to how older people maybe
eat

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:35.000
#23. Nobody knows what a geriatrician is.
Itís usually a geriatrics doctor. Itís not

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.929
a geriatrician. First time Iíve ever heard
of it.
