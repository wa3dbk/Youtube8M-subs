00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.450
I'm not a big fan of book covers in
general

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.110
and i'm not talking about the sexy
hardback covers we all drool over

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.189
on Tumblr and Pinterest

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.979
no i'm talking about what most of us
can actually afford when we walk into a

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.159
bookstore

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:21.130
paperback covers like this

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.769
My problem with book covers stems from the
fact that it's usually not the author

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.880
making the final decision on the cover

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.070
it's the publisher

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.420
and i often feel that the publisher is
trying to pigeonhole books into

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.850
categories to make things easier to
market. The book cover says: this is what

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.650
this book is about, no more, no less. i
mean this is not a new problem. it's been

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.920
going on for a long time.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.460
For example when Agatha Christie said she
wanted to branch out from mysteries

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.190
she wrote six novels under the name
Mary Westmacott

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.230
her publisher decided to categorize these
as romances not only got one it's called

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.770
accidents for him

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.640
and let's look at my covers shelley

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.120
so i have to say what this book is about
based on this caller

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.670
i'd say it's about this money to use
your oldest line chick trees have

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.670
homosexual angst because she ccd
mysterious letters

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.090
the nationally died in the background
what is the story actually found without

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.350
these overbearing their way to make sure
i could get stranded in the military and

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.110
household

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.200
decision company about her relationship
with your family

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.020
i think it's a masterpiece

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.700
back at me when i was non romantic books

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.410

other spaces to converse

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.150

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.680
double-checked

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.770
alexander and this story okay

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.240
let's get back to discover rabbits just
skip overheard the romance trip but they

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.100

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.620

sick

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.240
the first

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.040
it turns out to me is that ships
anti-depressants in our that leads up to

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.120
this typically in these cases are should
have just been his sword fights

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.360

a way that would have to awkward to do

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:25.490
and to make it so that his chest remains
experiments at all times

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.380
summit government un self-consciously
sexy to being consciously douchey

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.880
cutbacks that when we say fast m_v_p_
typically don't in fact flat we actually

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.209
need these conjures you know the whole

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.779
