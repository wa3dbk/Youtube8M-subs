00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.150
I'd like you to rewind this video and just
stare at that title card for a bit longer.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.150
Y'know what?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.449
Here it is again, just to save you the time
and effort:

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.011
I've studied words all my life, read Shakespeare,
Chaucer, Bryson, Gerstman... but nothing in

00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.120
my years of training could've possibly prepared
me for the task of describing to you, dear

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.890
viewer, the majesty that IS McDonalds Monogatari.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.940
Sure, I've covered Kisekae Monogatari, and
Hamster Monogatari, but this time our shift

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.540
manager and official fry-salter Felicity in
Worcestershire has decided to up the stakes...

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.600
and by "stakes," I mean pre-processed patties
that I'm led to understand once contained

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.940
beef or beef byproducts.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.390
In TDK's magnum opus, McDonalds Monogatari...
um, you work at a McDonalds.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.450
And apparently, the entirety of McDonalds
boils down to five minigames: flipping burgers,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.360
stashing fries in fry vessels, running the
register (which involves that most accursed

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.620
of inventions, MATH), filling cups, and...
this arcane practice of delivering orders

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.280
directly to customers' tables.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.280
Man.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.869
I can't think of the last time I've seen that
in practice.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.260
You, as Mr. or Mrs. Protagonist of our story,
have recently moved into the creepily-named

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.550
Happy Town, home to a beautiful amusement
park, marina, and a that bastion of fast food

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.890
at reasonable prices, McD... hold on.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.509
65 yen for a hamburger?

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.890
In year 2000 yen?

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.490
That's like 60 cents!

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.280
Scratch what I said about reasonable.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.690
Anyway, your meager existence boils down to...
well, visiting things around town and working

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.020
at McDonalds, which cost hearts.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.899
Because apparently flinging fries and, y'know,
actually enjoying yourself in the context

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.950
of a rollercoaster take exactly the same stamina
or something.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.882
It should be mentioned that you don't actually
get PAID for working at this McDonalds, you

00:02:08.882 --> 00:02:12.620
just kinda show up and magically change into
your uniform as soon as you walk in the door,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.410
and then go up to someone on a station and
relieve them of their duties until you pass

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.010
or fail at a task.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.290
I ranked up once.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.130
I leveled up in a damn McDonalds game, and
I have no idea what bearing that had on absolutely

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.180
anything.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.433
Much like life, even the most joyous moments
can be destroyed if you have to immediately

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:34.469
get back on the grill.

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.079
So.

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.060
Outside of talking to people and doing exactly
the same five minigames over and over again,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.989
there's... well, that's it.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.799
When I said "meager existence" I wasn't kidding.

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.019
You've got a PC where you can see which stations
your coworkers will be working, and potentially

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.260
receive email... that is, if anyone actually
wanted to talk to you.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.909
Nope, if your phone goes off it's because
your walk just HAS to be interrupted by...

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.769
dude who can't figure out the fryer.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.420
Economics of the shop, personnel decisions,
and the like are completely outside the scope

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.060
of this game: You just do five minigames over
and over again, for 365 days, until the game

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.120
takes pity on you and ends itself.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.001
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hug
my nearest fast-food employee.

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:27.400
And then complain to myself that they got
my burrito wrong.
