Hello, this is Yolanda Vanveen from vanveenbulbs.com.
and in this segment we're going to learn about

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.450
flowers for a hummingbird garden. How to grow
a hummingbird garden and what kind of flowers

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.439
should we select for a hummingbird garden?
The first thing to consider when we're planting

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.279
bulbs for a hummingbird garden, or planting
any kind of flowers, is what is going to attract

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.839
a hummingbird. What types of flowers attract
hummingbirds? I'd used to think it was only

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.390
red flowers, but as I've watched them over
the years, I'd learned it's not really the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.450
color of the flowers, it's the shape. They
love anything that is a trumpet shape. So

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:47.469
any flower where they can stick their beak
into the flower, to grab the pollen, and come

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.890
back out, they've seemed to love it. So whether
it's yellow or red or purple, it doesn't matter,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.180
they love all the colors; it's the shape.
So pretty much anything that's trumpet-shaped,

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.690
they've love. So this a Crocosmia George Davidson
and they've seemed to love all my Crocosmias,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.360
whether the Oranges or the red Lucifer, they
love all of them. They also love unusual plants.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.400
This is a Galtonia from South Africa and it's
a, in the hyacinth family; they say it's kind

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.880
of an elongated hyacinth but it has little
bell flowers and I've noticed my hummingbirds

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.450
love it too. It's almost like a fuschia; hummingbirds
love fuschias too. They just come right into

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.150
there and they'll get the pollen out. So this
is a great plant for hummingbirds and there's

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.860
a lot of other vines and plants that you don't
even think about that hummingbirds would like

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.580
but they love. This is my Mandevilla, or Mandevia
or Mandeville, there's so many different ways

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.810
that people pronounce this, but the hummingbirds
just love it and again it's trumpet-shaped

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.360
and it's red, they especially seem to like
the reds the best of all the colors. But,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.119
again, they go in and get the pollen out and
it works really well and it's a beautiful

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.259
vine plant that can be grown pretty much anywhere
and I just protect it in the winter and it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.369
will come back every year even in cold climates.
And this is also a beautiful plant; it's called

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:16.000
a Peacock Orchid or Acidanthrea or now officially
it's Gladiolus Murielae, so it's a beautiful

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.670
plant that's very fragrant, smells sort of
like Kool-aid, I just love it and it's white

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.220
with burgundy stripes but my hummingbirds
love it too. It's got a really nice funnel;

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.950
they've seemed to like anything that's a long
funnel; it's one of their favorite plants.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.410
Agapanthus or Lily of the Nile, they come
in whites and purples and blues; the hummingbirds

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.030
love this plant too; they love to get their
little beak into the middle of them. So again,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.620
it's a trumpet shape and they'll just hang
out in my Agapanthus or Lily of the Nile for

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.970
hours, they love it. And when considering
what kind of flowers to grow for your hummingbirds,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.420
consider also what kind of trees to grow for
them Because you can have flowers alone but

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.981
if there's no trees or bushes for them to
make their nest, there's no where for them

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:06.590
to live. So plants like eucalyptus or maples
or vines or trees or shrubs of pretty much

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.230
any kind, are great for hummingbirds. So never
forget to give them a home too. So having

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.560
a hummingbird garden is really easy. You can
collect a lot of your favorite plants and

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.170
there's so many more you can decide from;
put them in your garden and you'll find that

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.640
the hummingbirds will come to your garden
every year, more and more and you can enjoy

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.310
their company for years to come.
