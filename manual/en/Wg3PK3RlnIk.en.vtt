00:00:00.113 --> 00:00:02.137
- Hey guys, today I'm gonna show you

00:00:02.137 --> 00:00:05.359
how to make a really
fantastic summertime treat,

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.506
my version of a soft-serve
ice cream sandwich.

00:00:08.506 --> 00:00:10.545
They are really easy to make at home,

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.986
and you don't even need an ice
cream maker to master them.

00:00:12.986 --> 00:00:14.725
Let me show you how to make them.

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.977
So first thing we're gonna do
is make the chocolate cookie

00:00:16.977 --> 00:00:19.206
that's going to hold
our sandwiches together.

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:20.486
So we're gonna electric mixer.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:23.888
You want to beat together
one cup of unsalted butter,

00:00:23.888 --> 00:00:26.758
and one and a half cups of sugar.

00:00:26.758 --> 00:00:28.943
Just go ahead and beat that
up for about five minutes

00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:31.483
until your butter is nice and fluffy,

00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:35.071
and then we are going to add one egg

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.488
and one egg yolk.

00:00:37.707 --> 00:00:38.705
And then you're also gonna add

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.455
two teaspoons of vanilla extract.

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.065
Go ahead and combine that,
scraping down the bowl as needed.

00:00:47.065 --> 00:00:48.400
You can set that aside,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.815
and then we're gonna
combine our dry ingredients,

00:00:50.815 --> 00:00:52.297
and it's a really simple mixture.

00:00:52.297 --> 00:00:56.280
All we're gonna do is add
two cups of all-purpose flour

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.890
and one cup of unsweetened cocoa powder.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.154
And then to just punch up
all of that chocolate flavor,

00:01:02.154 --> 00:01:06.926
we're also gonna add three-quarters
of a teaspoon of salt.

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:08.368
Go ahead and just give that a whisk

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.676
until everything is combined.

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:14.031
Then we're gonna add the flour
mixture to the butter mixture

00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.489
just in thirds, beating it
in between each addition.

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:20.779
Then you're gonna end up
with a very sticky dough

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.279
on your hands, and you're gonna wonder

00:01:22.279 --> 00:01:24.487
how this thing is actually gonna roll out.

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:26.313
That's where we need to refrigerate it.

00:01:26.313 --> 00:01:28.945
So you do need to take the dough,

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:30.873
put it on some parchment
paper or plastic wrap,

00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:33.845
whatever you have, roll it into two balls,

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:37.966
flatten it into a disk,
and then wrap it up,

00:01:37.966 --> 00:01:39.557
and pop it in the fridge.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:40.831
This is a great thing that you can do

00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:42.357
actually the day before.

00:01:42.357 --> 00:01:43.970
Then once your dough is ready to go,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.850
you're gonna roll it out
on a floured surface,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.256
and you do want to make sure
you have extra flour on hand

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:50.611
because these do get sticky

00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:52.286
and it does help to do it quickly

00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:54.617
so that that dough does not warm back up.

00:01:54.617 --> 00:01:56.196
And then using a cookie cutter,

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.100
I like a cookie cutter
with a little scallop

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.667
because it does just sort of remind me

00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.059
of that soft-serve style
sandwich, but really,

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:04.323
any cutter you have will do.

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:07.028
I'm using a three-inch cookie cutter.

00:02:07.028 --> 00:02:09.681
I don't think you really
want to go bigger than that,

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:10.883
but you could go smaller.

00:02:10.883 --> 00:02:13.623
You want to place it on a
parchment-lined cookie sheet,

00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:15.318
and if you help transferring it,

00:02:15.318 --> 00:02:17.500
a little cake server
really does the trick.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.754
But we do want to take our baking sheet

00:02:18.754 --> 00:02:21.262
and pop it in the freezer
for at least five minutes,

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:24.176
just to allow that
dough to harden back up,

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:26.006
and the reason we want to do this is

00:02:26.006 --> 00:02:28.528
this is going to preserve a
beautiful scalloped detail

00:02:28.528 --> 00:02:29.625
on our cookies.

00:02:29.625 --> 00:02:31.193
If we popped it in the oven now,

00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:32.715
they are a little bit too soft

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:35.270
and those edges would not be as precise.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.950
Then we're gonna bake our
cookies at 350 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.680
for just eight minutes.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.948
Now I say just eight minutes,

00:02:41.948 --> 00:02:44.859
because we do want to preserve
the chewiness of the cookie,

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.217
because we are going to be
freezing these sandwiches

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:49.203
and if they're too crisp,
they'll just kind of crumble,

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:50.956
so eight minutes, they're good to go.

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:52.735
You'll know that they're
ready when you start to smell

00:02:52.735 --> 00:02:56.528
that delicious chocolate
aroma coming from your oven.

00:02:56.528 --> 00:02:57.486
When your cookies are done,

00:02:57.486 --> 00:02:58.867
you can take them out of the oven,

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.503
place them on your cooktop,
and allow them to cool.

00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:03.093
You can leave them just as is.

00:03:03.093 --> 00:03:04.579
No need to actually take them off

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.949
and put them on a cooling rack

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.469
because I find that they
actually set up a little bit more

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.323
just from that remaining
heat of the baking tray.

00:03:12.323 --> 00:03:14.935
Okay, here comes our little
cheat for homemade ice cream

00:03:14.935 --> 00:03:16.003
without a machine.

00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:19.277
We are basically just going to
prepare a heavy cream mixture

00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:21.521
that we are going to
freeze, and when we do,

00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:23.553
it is going to create that similar texture

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:27.744
so associated with that
soft-serve style of ice cream.

00:03:27.744 --> 00:03:28.918
So in an electric mixer,

00:03:28.918 --> 00:03:32.598
you're going to add two
cups of heavy cream,

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:34.421
and then we're gonna
use two types of sugars,

00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:35.897
and the reason we're gonna do that

00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:37.338
is they each will do something different.

00:03:37.338 --> 00:03:40.705
So you want to use a half a
cup of just plain white sugar.

00:03:40.705 --> 00:03:43.317
Now this is the most refined
processed sugar you can get,

00:03:43.317 --> 00:03:44.873
and the reason why we want it for this

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:48.495
is it's going to give our ice
cream a nice smooth texture.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:49.947
If you've ever tried to
make homemade ice cream

00:03:49.947 --> 00:03:52.002
and it's kind of crystallized and icy,

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:53.720
usually it means there's not enough sugar,

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.100
so the sugar really
helps with the texture.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.075
And then we're also gonna use

00:03:57.075 --> 00:03:59.142
a quarter cup of powdered sugar.

00:03:59.142 --> 00:04:02.184
So powdered sugar is really
just finely-processed sugar

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:03.995
with a little bit of corn starch in it,

00:04:03.995 --> 00:04:06.479
and we want the corn starch
because that is going to give us

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.778
great stabilization for this cream,

00:04:08.778 --> 00:04:11.413
which is going to help
when we go to pipe it out.

00:04:11.413 --> 00:04:12.528
And then to flavor our cream,

00:04:12.528 --> 00:04:16.731
we're going to add two
tablespoons of vanilla extract.

00:04:16.731 --> 00:04:21.108
So we are going to beat that
up until very stiff peaks form.

00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:22.594
Then once your cream is ready to go,

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:23.964
you want to take a pastry bag

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.820
and fit it with a large star tip,

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.071
transfer the cream into the pastry bag,

00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.416
and making sure that those
cookies are nice and cool,

00:04:32.416 --> 00:04:36.191
you're going to flip
them over on their backs,

00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:38.072
and then you're going to pipe some cream

00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:39.965
just on half of them.

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:41.117
And the way you want to pipe it is

00:04:41.117 --> 00:04:42.881
you want to do like a little nest.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:45.685
Then do one row, and then a second row,

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.237
and then a little dollop in the center.

00:04:48.237 --> 00:04:51.244
And just go ahead and do
that on all the bottoms.

00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:53.996
And then here is the
other secret to success.

00:04:53.996 --> 00:04:57.432
You do not want to put your top
onto the cream at this stage

00:04:57.432 --> 00:04:59.708
because then you have to
move it into the freezer

00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.995
and they do have a tendency
of kind of shifting

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:03.075
while in flight.

00:05:03.075 --> 00:05:05.513
So you want to actually put
it in your freezer first

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.347
and then put the cookies on top,

00:05:07.347 --> 00:05:08.531
because once it's in the freezer,

00:05:08.531 --> 00:05:10.795
you know it's not gonna
move and you'll start to see

00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:13.465
your beautiful little ice
cream sandwiches emerge.

00:05:13.465 --> 00:05:16.647
And you do need to freeze these
for a minimum of two hours.

00:05:16.647 --> 00:05:18.388
That will do the trick.

00:05:18.388 --> 00:05:20.638
But these are really great
to make the day before,

00:05:20.638 --> 00:05:23.378
so you could also just leave
them in there overnight.

00:05:23.378 --> 00:05:26.064
I love this recipe idea because
you've got that richness

00:05:26.064 --> 00:05:29.291
of the chocolate cookie that
has a wonderful chew to it

00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:32.159
mixed with the creaminess
of that homemade ice cream.

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.143
It really is such a fun
and festive thing to serve

00:05:35.143 --> 00:05:36.605
when you're entertaining in the summer,

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:38.881
and they're especially great
if you have kids and adults

00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:39.926
coming to your party,

00:05:39.926 --> 00:05:43.153
because everybody in that crowd
loves an ice cream sandwich.

00:05:43.153 --> 00:05:44.953
I hope you guys give this one a try,

00:05:44.953 --> 00:05:46.242
and let me know what you think,

00:05:46.242 --> 00:05:47.774
and I will see you back here next week

00:05:47.774 --> 00:05:49.829
for another easy and delicious recipe.

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:51.176
Until then, bye.

00:05:51.176 --> 00:05:53.759
(folksy music)
