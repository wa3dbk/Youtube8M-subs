00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.922 line:0%
(Lynn Ellsworth) The beauty
of some of these woods its

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:26.392 line:0%
incredible and no two pieces are
like so when a person buys one

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:28.795
of our guitars
it's one-of-a-kind.

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:33.266
&gt;&gt;Creating one of-a-kind guitars
is a passion, that 71 year old

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:36.969
Lynn Ellsworth has carried
with him for over 40 years.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:41.107
With a love for music coupled
with a knack for woodworking and

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.677
a yearning to learn from the
best, Lynn has managed to be a

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.514
force in the music business by
being an innovator in a time

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:51.984
when guitar
manufacturing needed innovation.

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:55.655
With a medical background and a
job that was based in Seattle in

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:59.525
clinical laboratory research,
Lynn was drawn to creating and

00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:03.830
innovating in wood, carved from
a close relationship with his

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:07.100
father who taught him
woodworking, and the help of a

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.234
close friend.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.737
(Ellsworth) Wayne Charvel and I
had a band when we were in high

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.039
school.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.776
I grew up in southern
California; he was doing the

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:19.178 line:78%
refinishing work for Fender.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:23.616 line:83%
Wayne showed me how to take
and cut out guitars and intonate

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.986
guitars and why it's important
the frets had to be a certain

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:31.390
distance from one another, so
Wayne asked me one time I was

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:35.695
living up here in Washington
and doing cancer research and he

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:39.565
asked me to make a replica of
the Fender Stratocaster but out

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:41.467
of some exotic woods.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.405
I came up with two beautiful
pieces of East Indian rosewood

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:51.277
so I made two bodies exactly
like the Fender Stratocaster

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.414
sent them down to California
well John Kay of Steppenwolf he

00:01:55.447 --> 00:02:00.520
wanted one then Pete Townshend
from the WHO he saw it and he

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:04.257
wanted one then I started doing
them for Jefferson starship and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.927
Eric Clapton, Nazareth
some of the big names.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.098
Wayne and I were the first guys
to come out and offer different

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:16.602
bodies different necks and so
forth and at that time no one

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:20.907
was doing hot rodding I mean
we went to the music store you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.211
either bought a Fender
Stratocaster or a Gibson or Les

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:31.250
Paul so Wayne and I started
putting, hum buckers which were

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:37.390
pickups that were synonymous
with the Les Paul in the Strat's

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:40.960
so he'd get a Strat sound out of
it, get a Les Paul sound out of

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:45.765
the same guitar so that
started the hot rodding.

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:49.769
&gt;&gt;The relationship between
Ellsworth and Charvel blossomed

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.671
in the mid 1970's.

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.807
Under the company named Boogie
Bodies they created innovative

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.777
instruments for a
distinct guitar market.

00:02:58.777 --> 00:03:01.814
One of the most notable was a
guitar they both created that is

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.250
recognized worldwide.

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:07.053
(Ellsworth) The one that we
did for Van Halen is called

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:12.592
Frankenstein I made the body and
the neck sent it down to Wayne

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:16.495
Charvel who was in Azusa
California well Eddie Van Halen

00:03:16.528 --> 00:03:20.132
lived in Pasadena California
he would go on occasion down to

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:27.039
Wayne's because Wayne was a very
skillful Luthier and then Van

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:30.910
Halen saw this body and neck
which were by the way seconds

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:33.679
weighed a ton because that's
before I started hollowing them

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:38.985
out and he bought those and
took it home and painted it up

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:43.056
himself and it's the most
recognize guitar in the world.

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:47.793
&gt;&gt;Today Lynn along with partners
Patrick Coleman and Mark

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:51.631
Martini, have created a business
and a line of guitars with the

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:54.834
Ellsworth name and
reputation attached.

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:57.703
Guitars that stand out from
the ordinary, like one of

00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:01.974
Ellsworth's favorites, the relic
master, an instrument built

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.844
around wood that was
destined to be destroyed.

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:07.113
(Ellsworth) I could say that
these new ones that we've got

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:11.984
were thousand-year-old Redwood
was part of a boat dock on Lake

00:04:12.017 --> 00:04:16.289
Pend Oreille that wood was given
to me by the gentleman that

00:04:16.322 --> 00:04:20.993
owned the dock because he was
going to get rid of it I needed

00:04:21.026 --> 00:04:24.497
some firewood so I brought it
back to my house and started

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.467
chopping it up for firewood one
of the pieces fell down and hit

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.038
the pavement I could hear that
piece of wood resonate clear

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.408
across the street and I go,
gee you know this would be

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.878
incredible wood for a guitar.

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:44.650
What we do is seek out the woods
and we look for the lightest

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:49.288
pieces that we can get we then
bring them in here we sort them

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:55.127
then we cut them then we match
them try to get as many of the

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.566
rustic knot holes as we can
in these old relic masters.

00:05:13.645 --> 00:05:16.582
&gt;&gt;Since his retirement from the
medical field and his relocation

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:20.353
to Spokane, Lynn's mission
in creating the best guitars

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:24.890
possible for an ever-discerning
clientele has met success, as

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:27.693
evidenced by the talented
musicians that want to play his

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:28.695
instruments.

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.237 line:23%
(Ellsworth) When you're a good
guitar player get them in the

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.507 line:23%
hands of guys that really can
play then you can really hear

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.509
what the instrument can do.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:48.247
&gt;&gt;Craftsmanship, expertise and
an exact attention to detail.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.450
Each Lynn Ellsworth guitar
strives to meet standards that

00:05:51.483 --> 00:05:53.586
were set in a young
man many years ago.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:10.903
(Ellsworth) My dad was a great
man a great teacher he was a

00:06:10.936 --> 00:06:15.741
perfectionist and stuff doesn't
leave here unless it's to the

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.877
best of our ability to build it.

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.580
When they're all put together
be put into an amp and everybody

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:22.915
goes wow!

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:26.919
That's incredible that's
what it's all about is the end

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:30.289
product has got to
perform this one performs.
