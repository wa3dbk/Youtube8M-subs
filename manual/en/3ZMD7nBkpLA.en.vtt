00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:27.110
I realized something.

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.946
Pursuing the Princess all day is not so good.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.784
Because plumbers, we're always covered in human waste. We always carry around the plunger with us.

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.287
 It's no wonder she hates me!

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:40.206
No, no, Brother! She doesn't a hate you!

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.126
It's more of a -- a very strong distaste!

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.170
That's very nice of you to say, Brother!

00:00:45.253 --> 00:00:47.714
Anyway, the doctor thing. That didn't work out.

00:00:47.797 --> 00:00:50.842
So what I do is I wanted to find a job that was more professional.

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.720
More respectable. Something a Princess could admire, no?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.181
A lawyer. A policeman.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.141
A teacher! You teach the kids!

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.852
No, Brother. You know what it is. We work here!

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.271
Oh! Right.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:04.397
We fix your car.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.734
Princesses might like that, no?

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:09.652
Hey guys.

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.862
Think you can take a look at my car?

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.906
Ah! She's a beauty, isn't she?

00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:19.329
Uh, yeah, so anyway. I think it might be the suspension or...

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:22.207
Brother! This car! She has no green shells!

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.584
You mean to tell me you used up all your green shells?

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.378
I don't have any green shells in my car.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.508
Tell you what. I'll give you three red shells to rotate around your car for you. You'll make everybody around you pay!

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.802
Pay? I don't want to make anybody pay!

00:01:33.885 --> 00:01:37.597
I just want to take this on a nice leisurely drive through the countryside tomorrow.

00:01:37.722 --> 00:01:39.474
Maybe listen to some tunes. Relax.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:42.227
I don't need this bouncing up and down like some damn pimp mobile.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.606
You going through the countryside? You're going to need invincibility to fight a the cows.

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.776
We can also upgrade your radio for you. It play all the hits.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.444
We get you in the mood to drive!

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.867
Uh, yeah, let me give my wife a call. We'll see.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.831
Hi, honey. The suspension.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.250
Yeah, about that...

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:09.170
Some people, they don't understand my brother.

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:12.173
He knows all of the tricks for winning the game.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.425
Brother, to which game are you referring?

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.262
The game of safely driving on the streets.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:18.847
Oh yeah! That game!

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:20.181
I like a that game.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.891
Yeah, what's not to like?

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.727
Excuse me. Do you guys fix cars?

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.062
Uh, sure we do.

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:27.272
Eh, why not?

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:31.151
I accidentally put diesel into my tank and now my engine's all seized up.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.652
You use an engine like a chump?

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.904
You do know there are so many better alternatives.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.824
Of course. The electric cars are starting to sound better and better.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:40.618
The electric car, what? Brother, have you ever heard of anything like this before?

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.704
It sounded like ghost talk. Get him!

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:44.497
Oh no! Electric never!

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:47.208
What you really need is the propulsion of a golden mushroom.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.128
You put one of them in the car and you can just drive for infinity.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.129
That sound dangerous.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:53.089
Oh, no. The lakitu. You die. They pull you back.

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.090
Oh wait. I die!?

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.510
Yeah but then you owe him one like a Satan.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:58.720
That sounds horrible!

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.681
Brother! We could turn his car into one of them giant bullets.

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.934
You can plow right through civilians.Through firey pits. Through pedestrians.

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.396
I do not want my car to turn into a giant bullet and kill people!

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.149
Well, not all of us are able to afford gasoline.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:14.652
Yeah, what do you think we are. Douglas J. Falcon?

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:18.865
Every once in a while, we find a customer who knows a what's up.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.201
And that's when I can work on my charm.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:24.412
Son of a bitch! This a damn thing!

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:28.208
We are the worst Italians ever.

00:03:29.042 --> 00:03:30.960
Yeah, the app said this place was good.

00:03:31.085 --> 00:03:33.046
Oh, good. I could really use a...

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.425
Oh no. Not here. Anywhere but here. Mmm mmm.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.093
What? Him?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:41.429
Aww, he looks so innocent.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.181
He's not. Trust me.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.307
Oh stop.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:46.434
Excuse me.

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:49.312
Our car broke down at the diner next door.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:52.607
And I was wondering if you could maybe rescue us.

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:56.736
Uh, sure. I could a give it a shot! What a seems to be the...

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:57.820
It's a me!

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.949
Oh my goodness! It's a two Princesses! Yahoo!

00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.576
So how can I help you two Princesses today?

00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:05.286
He called us Princesses.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.663
Yeah, that's nothing new.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:10.124
Oh my. You got your hat embroidered. And it's still spelled wrong.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.209
So let's have a look, huh?

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.085
No thanks. We're good.

00:04:12.126 --> 00:04:13.211
- But our car...
- I'll walk!

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:14.754
But it's 37 miles away.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.673
Good! It'll give me a chance to break in my new shoes!

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.008
Don't be silly! Show me the way, Princess! 

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:20.218
Yahoo!

00:04:34.357 --> 00:04:36.109
What the hell just happened?

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.737
He a gonna get a the blue shell tonight!
