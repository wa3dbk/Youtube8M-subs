00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.870
Good morning, good afternoon, good evening!
This is Andy from wholesale-help.com. In today's

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.870
video, we're going to be talking about how
to spot a fake wholesaler. Welcome along!

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.300
All righty, then. Welcome everyone over to
the Wholesale Help private Facebook group.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.649
This is where we're hanging out everyday,
chatting about eBay, Amazon, e-commerce, generally

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.309
buying and selling online, and you can, too.
If you haven't already, you can sign up

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.329
for free to the Wholesale Help Member's
Club by clicking on that thing that's just

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.210
appeared on your top-right of your screen.
It's free to sign up, and you'll also

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.250
get access to a load of audio interviews,
video guides, e-books, and much, much more.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.720
So come over, sign up, and hang out with us.
It's a lot of fun, and you'll learn a

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.840
lot, too.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.830
So, this is a post that came up this week
on the private Facebook group, so I thought,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.030
"What a good opportunity to have a look
at a fake wholesaler". Now, as you can see

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.030
here, we have a very nice-looking young lady
called Alyssa Woodby. She would be a nice

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.940
young lady if she existed, but alas, she is
not real. Her picture is obviously of some

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.550
poor lady who's had her picture stolen and
put into this fake Facebook account.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.560
There's a good clue that this is fake in
that it's totally empty apart from that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.870
picture and another picture of a poor girl
that's had her picture stolen from somewhere

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.770
else. It's empty. There are no friends,
there's no about profile, there are no other

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.110
photos, there's no nothing. So that should
set alarm bells ringing if you ever get talking

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.200
to people with nothing in their accounts,
then you've got to ask yourself why that

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.020
is.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.860
Anyhow, this person, Alyssa, put a post on
the group saying, "Oakley wholesale, just

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.780
for you! Come and pick what you like, $16,
just two days left. Miss or never!" I don't

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.570
know what, "miss or never" means. This
is another early sign that this person may

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.700
not have the best command of the English language.
Incidentally, if you're thinking about coming

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.880
over here and spamming the Facebook group,
then don't bother, because I'll simply

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.360
do this -- "delete post" and "ban user".
I've already banned Alyssa, unfortunately.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.000
She's been kicked to the curb, or the purveyor
or that has been kicked to the curb, and I've

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.990
left the post just as something that we can
all learn from. Why not?

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.980
Let's go and have a look at this Oakley
website, shall we?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.450
Here, we can see the Oakley website. At first
glance, it doesn't look too bad at all.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.600
It's been relatively well put together;
it's got all the Oakley labels on it and

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.450
all the Oakley logos. It says, "Welcome
to Oakley Outlet Online Shop! Free shipping

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.430
on any three purchase." Again, grammatically
incorrect. Now, let's have a look at another

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.130
few clues.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.040
As we scroll down, you can see that, on this
website, you have the opportunity to buy just

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.069
about every different model of Oakley sunglasses
there is known to man. They have everything.

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.069
And look, every single model is discounted
95% from nearly $300 down to $16. It's almost

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.060
too good to be true, wouldn't you say? That's
right -- it is too good to be true. You can't

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.400
get these sort of discounts from a normal
wholesale account. It probably costs Oakley

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:56.250
more than $16 to produce their glasses. They're
state-of-the-art, they use the best material,

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.060
iridium lenses, very, very high-quality optics.
That costs a certain amount of money to produce!

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.459
Certainly, they wouldn't devalue their own
brand by offering a 95% discount off their

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.860
entire range. That just doesn't happen.
That's another big warning sign.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.660
I know sometimes, it's easy to ignore the
obvious warning signs because you're thinking

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.560
of how much of a great deal it is, and you
want it to be true because you want to profit

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.840
from it and you want to get on and build your
business, but use your common sense. Once

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.880
you start looking at the details of a website
like this, it should become clear to you that

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.900
you need to stay well away.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.820
I hope this short video has been of use to
you! Keep your eyes open. When you're looking

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.710
for wholesale contacts, use your common sense.
Take your time. Ask for references. If they're

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.940
a decent supplier, they will always have contact
numbers of people you can get in touch with

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.990
that are previous customers and are happy
to recommend them. Do your homework. Use your

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.070
common sense.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.310
Be careful out there, people!
