00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:04.520
-I??m Sue with the Better Homes and Gardens
test kitchen. Ganache is a classic French

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.999
chocolate icing or glaze. It??s looks impressive
and taste even better, but the fact is the

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:15.919
silky chocolate is super simple to make especially
if you follow our secrets to success, but

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.929
fist thing you need to do is choose your chocolate.
Most chocolate will give good results except

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.070
white baking and unsweetened. If you like
the way chocolate taste on its own, you like

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.399
it in the Ganache. Chips are the easiest to
use, but bars are good too. You??ll just have

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.559
to break or cut them up in smaller pieces
before blending. Ganache is nothing more than

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.510
blending good chocolate with hot cream. To
begin, over medium high heat, bring whipping

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.910
cream just to a boil. You may have heard the
old cooking term scalded milk. Well, this

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.210
is it. Small bubbles around the sides, but
before rolling boil. Here in the test kitchen,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.839
we tend to baby sit and stir the heating cream
to make sure it doesn??t scorch or boil over.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.720
And sometimes in the test kitchen, we heat
the cream on a double boiler. It gets us around

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.590
any possibility of scorching or boiling over.
Now, remove the hot cream from the heat and

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.390
then on the chocolate and here??s the secret,
don??t stir. You wanna get the chocolate a

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.030
little time to get use to its new warm environment
and melt gently into the cream. 5 minutes

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.490
should make both ingredients happy. Okay,
now, you can stir until it??s silky smooth,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.420
then let the Ganache sit until it thickened
slightly. Ganache shouldn??t too thick or

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.430
too thin. It just needs to be pourable, yet
spreadable, so it drips gracefully over the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.110
side of a cake. We love Ganache in the test
kitchen. We use it to dress up all kinds of

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.390
desserts from drizzling over eclairs to dipping
cupcake tops and cookies, just spreading over

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.890
tart, bars, or brownies, to beautifully finishing
a pancake. With Better Homes and Gardens Secrets

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.840
to success, you??ll love Ganache too.
