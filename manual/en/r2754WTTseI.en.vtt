00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.570
this is incredible yeah the performance
in that neck me

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.370
you really did not say anything and tell
like

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.380
day 6 yeah known as the work but also

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.450
it's the hague yeah he get there are
many to take a while

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.470
there's a few lines were easy they're
trying to shout for help a radio for

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.910
help but

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.590
be on that no dialogue in this movie no

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.670
other people other people in this movie
no flashbacks

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.880
no name no name nothing I mean they'll
release strip it down we don't know this

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.920
guy's backstory

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.920
we don't know why he's on this boat I
you know how long he's been on this boat

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.970
you-know-who

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.560

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.310
cute puppy or apparent that he can

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.150
explain things pile of yeah I know no
Wilson

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.430
I and it works yes its it's a great film
making is the JCC and/or

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.880
who did margin call which could not be
more opposite that was a movie

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.790
with a million people in all talking
talking talking talking about the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.380
financial crisis so at this is Brooke

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.539
total polar opposite and yeah I I was
riveted

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.750
does it bother you that we don't know
even his name is a bother you that we

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.130
don't know his backstory or do you feel
like

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.280
his actions speak for him cuz I kinda
feel like they did go ahead

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.690
10 I mean I feel like that's the story
the story isn't

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.520
you know bill Henderson on a boat

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.069
the story is this guy on a boat this
shits going down how's it going to

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.860
survive and that's yeah I mean he is

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.220
totally paring away whether or not he
has a good relationship with his

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.770
daughter does not impact whether or not
the boats gonna sing grease gonna

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.120
fix things are he's going to manage to
you know survive somehow

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.520
so um I mean get that oh wait that's all
way to tell a story and if you give you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.630
choose this way

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.930
then you are committing to really making
it all about

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.380
the mechanics of survival and for an
actor

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.910
you know the your stripping away
everything you are you are not given

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.590
dialogue you are given all these

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.590
thing so it is all about what's in his
face what's in his eyes

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.950
his is literal a you know action
determines character in this case

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.810
I yepper Italy working review it didn't
work for me because

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.480
as you go along you can surmise get
closer to the man have

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.610
intelligence and well and Polly some

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.650
respect and prestige in whatever
industry did he got his gun and shot

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.310
if you've got this yacht it has the
wherewithal to go out by himself

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.230
the mill the ocean me and in there is a
bit and explanation at beginning

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.980
tiny bit where he's it a voice-over and
he's saying goodbye

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.659
yet this catalog am an and see you you
know the humic knowledge is that this

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.180
choices in the state but you don't know
why he left but

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.310
every single thing he does every single
and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.329
trouble that comes his way whether it's
a hole in the side the bell

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.099
or a sale or something falls in the
water whatever it is he

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:54.099
quietly I'm very calmly in very
methodically goes about doing it so you

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.370
know that whoever he is

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.730
he must've been a man a great respecting
great in lacked in you know what he did

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.260
and and do we know his name during his
family

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.140
now I i'm looking at because yeah
actions speak for him

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.469
its is beautifully shot I'll really
tough to make because so much of it is

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:12.670
within the close-quarter

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.819
up to vote I don't know having to
actually go out to

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.239
economy where does not think it was like
between here in Catalina

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.600
you're not not really all that at the
way I think it's love digital trickery

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.300
to arrange things and to add clouds and
what not but

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300
you know yeah like for example there's a
there's a scene where

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.630
he's climbed up the massive really
really high

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.610
scary kinda vertigo inducing um and in
the distance he sees the storm clouds

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.560
and you see in his face or registering
what that means I have to do next

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.130
exactly and I just thought okay so the
he's not you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.910
they don't even have him say storms come
in you know or something like that like

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.270
we have to pay attention

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.690
there are things that happen the I don't
know why he's doing like way

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.580
um the thing with the bucket and the
thing stretched on top of it like that

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.360
somehow going to convert salt water into
drinking water I did

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.800
I didn't know but I didn't care I
figured whatever he was doing was he

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.060
knew what he was doing it all the time
yeah he can't take the thought like he

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.530
now realizes that his little portable
thingies contaminate right I think he's

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:11.800
taking the sunlight

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.250
and using the heat in the sunlight with
that I'm

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.630
whatever saran wrap whatever it is to
boil it

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.590
and make it clean okay we've learned so
much I'm telling you

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.009
yeah restraint I in the nation but

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.789
them the moment a heartache when a giant
ship comes by

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.789
only are there opportunities for him but
what I could afford it was the pope from

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.370
Captain Phillips it to you for the same
lines American

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.270
10 membership so and in it who beat him
for the Oscar this year to thank

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.780
anybody on me well I do know it it'll be
interesting to see how

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.229
that place because certainly i meeting
the academy likes acting they can

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.660
quantify and he's acting the shit outta
the settings that you know

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.380
and I'm bird any driver ever um it
interesting to look at this

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.490
in through the through the lens of
gravity yes which is also a kind of a

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.419
one-man show to ask dad about

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.340
about being a bad thing either but
totally different in all the people that

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.560
complain about how

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.139
you know they love the effects of
gravity but they didn't like the writing

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.220
on the back story well

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.870
not that many yeah this is all surviving
sup so you know that was an issue for

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.120
you

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.120
gravity check this one out which is more
heroin do you think the idea things

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.410
training base up in space in the idea
being stranded by itself in the middle

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.190
of the ocean

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.759
well they both kinda suck I I will I
will say the ocean

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.870
Republic you have a little more
providing chances are actually on the

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.840
planet but no

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.270
as we know the tumbling above it exactly
but as we know from like a pie that's no

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.080
picnic either

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.130
if they're there is no %uh CDI tiger and
doctor he and I said what is your number

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.099
II give the city point eight this is a
really really strong film I very highly

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:44.870
recommend I think I didn't go high
enough

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.630
I missed a 92 to make them at your
average is 8.9

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:53.360
is ninety-four percent made me asap
please please rush out and see this

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.699
it's beautifully shot you to act yeah
this is it was gonna turn up on a lot of

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:57.830
top 10 lists

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.080
I
