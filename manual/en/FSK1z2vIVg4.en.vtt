Hello Captain Phasma!

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:05.742
I don't know about you, but the look of this character along with her name?

00:00:05.742 --> 00:00:08.692
Really just screams "Saturday Morning Cartoon"!

00:00:08.692 --> 00:00:10.778
Which could be AWESOME by the way

00:00:10.778 --> 00:00:13.286
because if you're a fan of genre filmmaking

00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:16.737
then odds are you're a fan of Saturday Morning Cartoons.

00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:19.911
I'm very excited to finally get a look at Gwendoline Christie

00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:22.570
even though I'm not actually getting a look at Gwendoline Christie.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.213
Because she's beneath this storm trooper armor.
