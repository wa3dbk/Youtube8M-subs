00:00:00.107 --> 00:00:03.675
- Greetings, I'm Elijah
and you're watching

00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.584
Elijah's Excellent Edibles.

00:00:08.752 --> 00:00:11.034
So today on Elijah's Excellent Edibles,

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:14.687
we are going to be making
chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:14.687 --> 00:00:17.701
What you will need for
this tasty experiment is

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:20.570
a bag of Betty Crocker
Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix,

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.819
a bowl for mixing,

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:22.423
milk,

00:00:22.423 --> 00:00:24.319
one dozen eggs,

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:25.702
one stick of butter,

00:00:25.702 --> 00:00:27.419
one glass of water,

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.987
some measuring utensils,

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.354
one teaspoon,

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:31.870
one mixing utensil,

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.285
which I have now been informed

00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:35.193
that it's called a wooden spoon.

00:00:35.193 --> 00:00:37.112
One ungreased cookie sheet,

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:39.523
or a pampered chef pizza round.

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:42.030
And they say, the blacker, the better.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.930
So now that you have
all of you ingredients

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.526
and your cooking utensils,

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:49.008
let's turn the over on to 375 or 325

00:00:49.008 --> 00:00:50.809
for a blackened, ungreased cookie sheet,

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.536
which I have a blackened
one so let's turn it on 325.

00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:58.664
So now that you've turned on your oven,

00:00:58.664 --> 00:00:59.716
let's get started.

00:00:59.716 --> 00:01:01.375
So since we are using Betty Crocker,

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:03.802
you actually won't need
this milk or these eggs,

00:01:03.802 --> 00:01:05.235
so I'll move them out of the way.

00:01:05.235 --> 00:01:06.169
Now that you have done that,

00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:11.169
you can open up your Betty
Crocker Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix

00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:15.377
and pour it in your mixing bowl.

00:01:16.812 --> 00:01:18.663
Now you need to put half
of your stick of butter

00:01:18.663 --> 00:01:23.035
into the mixing bowl and set that aside.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:27.066
Now you need to add one
tablespoon of water.

00:01:27.066 --> 00:01:28.252
And now we mix.

00:01:28.252 --> 00:01:30.901
Stir until soft cookie dough forms.

00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.901
("On Top Of The World" by Parlomanic)

00:01:45.677 --> 00:01:47.300
Once your cookie dough
is mixed really well

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.457
and into a soft form,

00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:51.875
you can make little balls of cookie dough.

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:56.875
("On Top Of The World" by Parlomanic)

00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:59.834
So now that we have
gotten our cookie dough

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:03.283
onto our cookie sheet, get
your potholders or oven mitts,

00:02:03.283 --> 00:02:08.283
open the oven, put your cookie
dough onto the metal rack

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.844
for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.

00:02:12.844 --> 00:02:15.017
So while you wait for your
cookies to bake in the oven,

00:02:15.017 --> 00:02:19.174
you can waste time by
eating your cookie dough

00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:22.885
that was not used in the
making of this experiment.

00:02:22.885 --> 00:02:27.885
("Cookie" by Chanel West Coast)

00:02:39.065 --> 00:02:40.649
So while you are letting your cookies cool

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:43.301
for one to 17 minutes,

00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:45.233
you can pour your glass of milk

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:48.425
that you set aside earlier.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.459
Now that your cookies have cooled

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.391
for one to 17 minutes,

00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:54.011
they are ready to eat.

00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:57.688
("On Top Of The World" by Parlomanic)

00:02:57.688 --> 00:03:00.278
Doesn't this look delicious?

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:07.220
Didn't expect that.

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:10.494
These are the best cookies
I've had in my life.

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:15.081
Now you take your glass
of milk and you drink.

00:03:17.232 --> 00:03:21.237
Farewell, this has been
Elijah's Excellent Edibles.

00:03:21.237 --> 00:03:23.896
Time for more cookies.
