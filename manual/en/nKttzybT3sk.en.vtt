00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.300
Welcome to SBOBET.com Split Handicap Betting Tutorial

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.871
In split handicap betting,
your stake is automatically divided 
 equally and placed on 2 separate bets

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.000
This means that every handicap point represents a ticket 
 handicap which your bet was placed on

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's use 0.25 handicap, 
sometimes referred to as a quarter goal handicap, as an example

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
If you're backing the favorite team for a hundred euro at odds of 1.80

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.800
Half of your stake will be placed on a -0.50 handicap

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.500
And the other half, on a draw handicap shown as 0.00

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:59.500
If the final score ends in 1:0 in favour of Germany,
you will win 
 the first bet with a handicap score of 0.50 against 0.00

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.900
You will also win the second bet with a handicap score of 1:0

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.661
Which means you will win the full amount of 80 euros

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:21.542
If the final scores ends with 0:0,
you will lose the first 
 bet with a handicap score of -0.50 against 0.00

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And draw the second bet with a handicap score of 0:0

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.750
Which means you will only lose half your stake of 50 euros

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:44.610
Finally, if the final score ends in 0:1  in favor of Portugal,
you will 
 lose the first bet with a handicap score of -0.5 against 1

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And lose the second bet with a handicap score of 
 0:1
resulting in a total loss of your full stake

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.700
Let's reverse the rule and place a bet on the underdog,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:10.600
Betting with a hundred euro with odds of 2.11 on a 0.25 handicap
will result in 
 your bet being split on a draw handicap and a 0.5 goal advantage

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.600
If the final score ends in 1:0 in favor of Germany,
you will 
 lose the first bet with a handicap score of 1:0

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You will also lose the second bet with 
 a handicap score of 1 against 0.50

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
Which means you will lose the full amount of a hundred euros

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:45.200
If the final score ends in 0:0 inclusive of the handicap given,
you 
 will draw the first bet with a handicap score of 0:0

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And win the second bet with a handicap score of 0.00 against 0.50

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Which means you will win half the winnings amounting to 55.5 euros

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:05.500
Finally, If the final score ends with a 0:1 in 
 favor of Portugal,
you will win both the bets

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:18.000
One with a handicap score of 0:1
and the other, 0.00 against 1.50
resulting with the total winnings of 111 Euro

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.970
And that is Split Asian Handicap Betting

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.180

 and excitement through a more level playing field
