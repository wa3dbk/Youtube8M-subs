Joel Hickerson, grindog.com. Today we're going
to learn how to draw butterflies. First thing

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.080
you want to do is you want to think about
on your page where you want to draw your butterfly.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.350
And start with the middle part of your butterfly
which is the body. And like any insect it's

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.550
going to be segmented. Start with a shape,
get you an action line. And then maybe break

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:33.589
it into the elements like the head, the upper
torso and the lower torso. Draw one circle

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:39.660
for your upper wing, another circle for the
bottom wing. Circle for the top, circle for

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.769
the bottom. Okay. Keep it simple. Draw your
construction lines very lightly so you can

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:54.979
come back and erase the lines you don't want
after you come back with your marker, okay.

00:00:54.979 --> 00:01:01.309
So now that we have all our construction elements
in place, we want to stop, get your marker,

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:14.630
and come back and just outline the lines you
want to keep. Okay. You got your butterfly's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.860
head. Another wing. Now you'll need to look
at a picture of the butterfly specifically

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.690
that you want to draw. If you want to draw
a specific butterfly. And that way you'll

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.110
get the wing shapes and the wing markings
just exactly how you want them. Now this is

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.790
our more cartoony sort of butterfly but all
the elements are still the same. So once you

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.700
have the major outline in place you can come
back and if you can draw on your construction

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:04.920
lines light enough, very easy to come back
and erase the lines that you don't want anymore.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.239
So there you have like a basic shape. Now
you can come back and especially on a cartoon

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:19.480
if you wanted to make a cartoon butterfly,
you could give it eyes, maybe a big old grin.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.599
And again if you have a specific butterfly
in mind you should look at the picture to

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:36.719
get your wing decorations. And you can color
it instead of doing a pencil, kind of like

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:58.319
I'm doing. And that's pretty much your basic
shapes of your butterfly. I usually shadow

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.560
just the lower side to kind of give it a little
weight and you might do a motion line if they're

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:08.510
flying or background. And that's how you draw
butterflies.
