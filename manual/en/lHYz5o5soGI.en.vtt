00:00:00.156 --> 00:00:03.917
(cheerful music)

00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:06.216
- Hi guys, welcome to my bedroom.

00:00:06.216 --> 00:00:09.221
So today's video is
going to be the first one

00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:11.754
for my bedroom decoration series.

00:00:11.754 --> 00:00:14.459
And I'm thinking about
doing like a bedroom series

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.919
since a lot of you guys
have been asking for

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:20.739
more room decoration decor and DIYs,

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.281
and also for me to do a room tour.

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.475
I'm not completely done
decorating my room,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.318
so I thought of doing
a series, and as I go,

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:32.279
you guys can kinda see the
new stuff that I'm making,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.471
and I can also introduce
you guys to new DIYs.

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.875
At first I was thinking
about making, like, one video

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:41.520
filled with a whole bunch
of DIYs that you can make

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.517
for this upcoming Valentine's Day,

00:00:43.517 --> 00:00:45.270
and for decorating your room,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.718
but then the more I thought about it,

00:00:46.718 --> 00:00:47.787
I was just like, you know what,

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:49.415
I want to be able to provide you guys with

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.313
quality instruction and a quality DIY,

00:00:52.313 --> 00:00:55.611
instead of making disposable
things that you will get of.

00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:57.946
I want to make things that
you can feel proud of,

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:00.244
at the end of all my videos,

00:01:00.244 --> 00:01:03.623
and also for you to keep around for,

00:01:03.623 --> 00:01:04.923
you know, the long term.

00:01:04.923 --> 00:01:08.441
So let's start off the
series with a DIY canopy.

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.642
So let's run down the list of materials

00:01:12.642 --> 00:01:14.638
for this DIY canopy.

00:01:14.638 --> 00:01:16.021
First off, to set the look,

00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:18.445
you will need a fabric
that suits your taste.

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:21.882
I'm using about eight yards
of lace see-through fabric.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.681
Next, I have two one-inch
thick wooden dowels.

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:27.897
You can use smaller and
thinner ones as well,

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:30.160
if you use a lightweight fabric.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.644
You can find these at your
home improvement stores,

00:01:32.644 --> 00:01:34.038
or craft stores.

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:35.256
They're pretty lightweight,

00:01:35.256 --> 00:01:39.180
and cost between 50 cents
to two dollars each.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.525
Preventing the fabric
from sliding off the ends

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.382
are these one and a
half inch wooden plates.

00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:45.740
Craft stores should carry this

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.025
in the wood or dollhouse making section.

00:01:49.025 --> 00:01:51.916
To hang up the canopy, you
will need four screw-on hooks.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.379
And this should depend on the weight

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:55.561
of your canopy and fabric.

00:01:55.561 --> 00:01:57.663
If you are using something heavier weight,

00:01:57.663 --> 00:01:59.497
then I would suggest for
you to get bigger hooks

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:01.702
that can withhold the weight.

00:02:01.702 --> 00:02:03.444
If you want to prevent
your hooks from tearing

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:04.964
through the Sheetrock ceiling,

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:08.424
find anchors that matches
your hook screw thickness.

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:11.303
Next, I will be using about
three yards in ribbon.

00:02:11.303 --> 00:02:13.219
And this should all be determined based

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:16.504
on how low you want to hang you canopy.

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.734
Lastly, I will be using pins, a needle,

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:22.402
and some thread to match my fabric.

00:02:22.402 --> 00:02:24.399
So for step one, determine
where you would like

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:26.721
your canopy to hang on your ceiling.

00:02:26.721 --> 00:02:29.438
You will be using two
sets of screw-on hooks,

00:02:29.438 --> 00:02:31.295
a pair for each dowel.

00:02:31.295 --> 00:02:34.581
Measure out four holes,
evenly spaced apart.

00:02:34.581 --> 00:02:38.156
What I first did, was determine
how wide I wanted my canopy.

00:02:38.156 --> 00:02:40.920
Now with a marking pencil,
measure about ten inches

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.404
in on the edges of your bed,

00:02:43.404 --> 00:02:46.261
and 12 inches from the wall.

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:47.861
The second set of measurements will also

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:52.078
be measured from the wall
out, going 32 inches.

00:02:52.078 --> 00:02:54.061
You can also use different
type of measurements,

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.487
depending on where you would
like to place your canopy.

00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:58.100
I will have more specific information

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.446
on how you can measure this

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:02.500
on my blog, lifeannstyle.com.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.706
Step two, drill holes into the ceiling

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:06.924
and press in your anchors like so.

00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:09.745
Then, screw in the hooks.

00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:12.043
Step three, let's make up the canopy.

00:03:12.043 --> 00:03:14.121
Start by tying some ribbon to the hooks

00:03:14.121 --> 00:03:16.281
that you screwed in earlier.

00:03:16.281 --> 00:03:19.520
Then, drape the uncut fabric
into the ribbon on both ends.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.843
Adjust it on both sides

00:03:20.843 --> 00:03:23.201
until you get the look that you want.

00:03:23.201 --> 00:03:25.383
This will also help you know if you have

00:03:25.383 --> 00:03:28.622
any excess fabric to cut off.

00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:31.025
Make sure to place pins
where you need to cut,

00:03:31.025 --> 00:03:35.321
and also tie the ribbon as
you take off the fabric.

00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:37.619
The ribbon will help
mark where you will need

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.972
to hang up the canopy, and
sew pockets for the dowels.

00:03:43.485 --> 00:03:46.528
Alright, so step four,
cut off the excess fabric.

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:48.860
I purchase about ten yards of fabric,

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.809
and end up only using eight yards.

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.202
With the leftover material I think

00:03:53.202 --> 00:03:56.801
I will make a curtain with it.

00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.309
Step five, it's time to
spread out the fabric

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:03.163
and make sure to leave your marking spot.

00:04:03.163 --> 00:04:04.649
Now take out one of the dowels,

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:07.041
and place it into the
wrong side of the fabric.

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.838
Fold the fabric over it.

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:11.986
Now it's time to
double-thread your needle,

00:04:11.986 --> 00:04:15.087
and tie at the bottom.

00:04:15.087 --> 00:04:20.059
Go ahead and hand sew in the
fabrics together, like so,

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:21.867
and basically what we're doing

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:24.422
is sewing a pocket for the dowel.

00:04:24.422 --> 00:04:29.407
(cheerful music)

00:04:32.424 --> 00:04:34.980
Make sure to repeat this on the other mark

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.595
where you tied your ribbon.

00:04:36.595 --> 00:04:40.628
(cheerful music)

00:04:41.753 --> 00:04:43.287
Once you're finished with your sewing,

00:04:43.287 --> 00:04:44.907
you should have something like this.

00:04:48.686 --> 00:04:51.925
For step six I decided
to prime and spraypaint

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:55.048
my wooden plates a metallic silver.

00:04:55.048 --> 00:04:58.078
Then, once that's dry,
I go ahead and glue them

00:04:58.078 --> 00:05:00.644
onto each ends of my dowels.

00:05:00.644 --> 00:05:04.003
(cheerful music)

00:05:05.676 --> 00:05:06.924
For step seven I'm going to cut out

00:05:06.924 --> 00:05:09.585
two sets of 30 inch length ribbons.

00:05:09.585 --> 00:05:12.151
This length allows me to suspend my rods

00:05:12.151 --> 00:05:14.263
15 inches from my ceiling.

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:15.680
Find the middle and then tie them

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.408
to each ends of the rod in a simple knot.

00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:22.459
Then tie the loose ends together
with a square knot like so.

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:26.295
Alright, so now we are
on to our last step,

00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:30.184
and that is step eight,
hang up the canopy.

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:32.459
I'm very pleased with how this turned out.

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:34.443
If I was to do anything differently,

00:05:34.443 --> 00:05:37.416
then I would probably
cut the dowels shorter,

00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:39.436
or either paint them silver.

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:41.282
Other than that, I'm still very happy

00:05:41.282 --> 00:05:42.733
with the way this turned out,

00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:45.985
and I hope you enjoy your canopy as well.

00:05:45.985 --> 00:05:50.738
(cheerful music)

00:06:03.341 --> 00:06:05.267
Okay guys, thank you so much for watching,

00:06:05.267 --> 00:06:08.262
don't forget to thumbs up
and subscribe if you haven't.

00:06:08.262 --> 00:06:10.758
Also, for my January give-away,

00:06:10.758 --> 00:06:15.008
I will be giving away a painter
set since a lot of you guys

00:06:15.008 --> 00:06:18.189
liked my last video DIY on painting.

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.518
I bought the exact acrylic paint
that I used for that video.

00:06:22.518 --> 00:06:25.341
And then, a brush set,
so I think you guys will

00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.383
have lots of fun with these.

00:06:27.383 --> 00:06:31.458
Yes, and then I also
included, you know, some more

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.467
DIY stuff in here.

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.104
This is the wolf felt thing

00:06:35.104 --> 00:06:38.400
that I was talking about
in my last hall video.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.618
So I'll show you more in my next video,

00:06:40.618 --> 00:06:43.625
but as for now this is some of the things,

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:45.424
the goodies that will be in the package,

00:06:45.424 --> 00:06:47.893
and I will talk to you
guys next time. Bye!
