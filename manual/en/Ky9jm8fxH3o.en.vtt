00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.380
Hi, I'm Andrea, and this is Sarah, and we're
from peanutbutter.com.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.810
Welcome back to our Keep Calm and Bake series,
and today we're going to be making a hybrid

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.640
of a tart and a brownie.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.920
[music plays]

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.541
First, we're going to pour in the chocolate
chips.

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:25.699
And also the butter, I'm just going to melt
it.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.749
And this is in a double-broiler over some
boiling water, and just make sure you don't

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.300
let the water touch the bottom of the glass
bowl.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.160
So while that's melting, I'm just going to
show you,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.230
we have actually bought some pre-made pastry
shells,

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.780
which is cheating a little bit.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.220
You can make your own pastry from scratch,
your favorite recipe.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.920
Who would want to waste time doing that?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.260
If you're time-poor, like we pretend to be,
then you can just use the pre-bought ones.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.490
So that's melted down nicely now, we're going
to pop it into our mixing bowl.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.470
Get it all out with the spatula.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.470
You're a stickler.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.470
Getting every last drop.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.710
Don't waste chocolate!

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.260
For the full list of ingredients, and the
method, check the description box below.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.850
Okay, so now we'll add the rest of our ingredients.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:26.159
Sugar, cocoa powder, some milk, two eggs,
and some vanilla extract--just a teaspoon.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:39.420
We'll leave the flour for now, and get this
on the mixer to whisk it 'till combined.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.689
That's looking good, and we're going to add
our flour now.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.729
It smells amazing, a chocolate waft just hit
me.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.549
And I forgot to say earlier that it also needs
a pinch of salt [whimsical laughter] sorry

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.560
about that!

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.329
So we'll just add that in now, that's not
a problem.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:03.200
We'll add a little bit of the flour, whisk
to combine, and then add the rest.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.330
Just going to add the last little bit of flour,
and one final mix.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.310
Right, that's looking perfect.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.980
Last thing to do is fold in the chocolate
chips.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.620
There we go.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.050
Thank you!

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.240
Just more chocolate.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.060
Yeah, it definitely needs it.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.250
We love making this
We love making this townie recipe, and we're

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.690
really really into the hybrid theme at the
moment, aren't we?

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.690
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.670
When the Cronut came from New York to England,
a little bakery in White Chapel made one called

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.880
the Crodo,
and we were there at what like 8 o'clock in

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880
the morning?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.940
We were at Ring Cross bakery, having Crodos
for breakfast.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.940
Yep, our faces pressed against the glass,
so we're just as excited about this recipe.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:03:00.700
We will spoon the brownie batter into these
shells, just a heaped tablespoon.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.460

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.150
Okay, so we're going to keep filling these
up until we're all done, and then we will

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.380
put them in the oven.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.680
We've just taken these out of the oven, we
left them in for 15 minutes, you just need

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.010
to watch them closely.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.080
Once the tops are cracked, like you can see
here, and the insides are still nice and chewy,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080
that's when you take them out.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.140
We've allowed them to cool a little bit, but
you still want them a little bit warm, because

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.410
that's when they taste the best.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:38.510
We're just going to dust them a little bit
with some icing [mutters under breath]

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.710
[laughter]
If you try this recipe at home, we'd love

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.250
