Hi guys,
Today's tutorial is gonna be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.520
a ponytail which is really good
for parties and nights out

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.960
or formal events
because it's a bit more dressed up

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.640
than just a plain old ponytail.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.760
So all you're gonna need
for this look,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.560
we're gonna be doing
a lot of backcombing,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.200
so you're gonna want a backcombing brush
or a teasing brush.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.640
You're gonna want some small
hair elastics

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.640
to tie off the French braids
we're gonna be doing.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.560
And you're gonna want some bobby pins

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.680
and then also a larger hairband
to secure a ponytail.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.680
So to start off with,
I'm gonna do the backcombing.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.320
So I'm gonna section off
the hair on the top of my head

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.040
right from the front
to the crown.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.400
And to do this, I'm gonna use
the end of the backcombing brush

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.040
which has a rattail comb on it.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.200
So I'm gonna go kind of...

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.240
um, like when I do
deep side partings,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.280
I always go from the arches
of my eyebrows,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.200
so I'm gonna kind of
do the same for this.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.280
So I'm just gonna go back
and section that side...

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.440
and then the same with the other side

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
and then I'm just gonna
use the bigger hair elastic

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.480
just to tie back the rest of the hair
for a bit,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.400
so it doesn't get all caught up.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.440
So taking my backcombing brush,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.880
I'm gonna start at the back
of the hair,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.320
and I'm gonna pick up some hair.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.520
So I'm gonna backcomb the hair.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.280
So to do this, I'm gonna go in
kind of 'c' shaped motions

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.880
down the hair

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.160
just to add loads of volume
and lift...

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.680
like so, and then I'm just gonna move
forward

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.120
through this whole section of hair
just picking up sections like this

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.640
and then just backcombing them.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.680
So once you've backcombed
that whole section,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.440
you want to just with the backcombing
brush again,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.240
we're gonna just gently smooth
it out,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.600
just to kind of neaten it up
so it doesn't look such a mess.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.480
So I'm just smoothing it over the hair,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.360
but you don't want to lose any
of the volume that we've created.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.840
And then I'm just pinching it
together with my fingers

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.120
at the crown of my head...

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.360
and pushing it forward
so we get all this volume on top.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.880
And then you just want to take
a load of bobby pins

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.320
and just pin that into place.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.960
So once you've got it all pinned
into place,

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.560
you want to take some hairspray
and just give it a quick spray over

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.320
just to hold it all in place.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.520
So now I've got that done,
I'm gonna take out the ponytail

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.200
and I'm gonna section off two pieces
of hair on the sides,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.680
kind of underneath the backcombing
and above my ears.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.440
So you can use the rattail comb
again to do this.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.800
So I'm literally just going behind
my ears and taking all this hair

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.120
that's in front there
and then the same on the other side.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.240
So on these two sections of hair,
I'm gonna do two little French braids

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.960
just on the side,
which I like the contrast that it gives

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.840
of having kind of the flattened
French braids compared to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.960
the volume on top.

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.880
So I'm just gonna start by
picking up some hair at the front,

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.440
a smaller piece of hair,
and splitting it into three,

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600
and the just starting a French braid.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.320
So you're gonna pass one
of the outer sections over the middle

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.640
and each time you want to be
picking up hair

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.600
with the new outer sections

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.360
and then just passing it
into the middle.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.680
And then I'm just gonna carry
the braids down a little way

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.880
so that they all kind of meet
and join into the ponytail

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.520
when we do that step.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.600
So when you've plaited it down
a little bit,

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.440
we're just gonna take the small hair
elastic and just tie it off.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.960
So now I'm gonna do exactly the same
on the other side,

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.720
just do another French braid.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200
So now we've got the French braids
done,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.280
the final step we're gonna do
is the ponytail.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.560
So I'm gonna take out this rough one
I did earlier.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.360
And I'm gonna gather all the hair
including the French braids

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.520
and bring it up
into a really high ponytail.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.160
So once you've got it in position,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.880
you just want to tie it off
using that hairband.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.480
So you might find that once you put
your hair in the ponytail

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.200
you have to kind of readjust
the backcombed section,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.360
just play around with it until
you've got it how you like

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.560
and just use bobby pins
and hairspray

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.560
and the brush to kind of
tame it into place.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.320
And then to finish this look off,

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.280
I'm gonna remove these small
hair elastics with the braids

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.720
'cause we don't need them anymore

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.680
'cause the larger hairband
will hold the French braids.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.200
So also as a finishing touch,

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.760
I'm gonna hide the elastic
which is holding the ponytail

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.400
just because I think it can look
a bit messy, and especially

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.120
for this kind of look
which is more dressed up for evening,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.840
I think it's nice
just to hide it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.720
So I'm just gonna take
a small piece of hair from the ponytail

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.120
and I'm just gonna wrap it around
the base of the ponytail

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.840
so it hides that hairband...

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.080
like so, and then I'm just
gonna take a bobby pin

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.600
and secure that into place.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.960
So that is the finished look, guys.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.480
I think this is perfect way
to dress up a ponytail

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.400
for an evening out
or special occasion.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.600
I think it looks really cute
and classy.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.640
And, yeah, I see loads of
celebrities wearing this kind of look.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:08.800
it's a bit Kim Kardashian.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.960
Um, yeah, but I love the contrast
with the braids as well.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.520
It just really adds a little bit
of interest to the ponytail.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.880
