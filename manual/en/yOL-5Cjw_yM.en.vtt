00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.190
Okay, so let's talk about the soldering iron,
why do you need a soldering iron? Because

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.080
what a soldering iron does, is is a very hot
tool and it actually can be very dangerous

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.089
for that reason. So I want to talk about kind
of soldering safety, but what it does, is

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.800
it is able to melt a metal with a low melting
point such as the solder that you will be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.509
using and its uses. It does that to bind together
either the joints for pieces of lead cane

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.280
if you are using the lead cane method of making
a stained glass panel or project or alternatively

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.550
for the using the copper foil method. You
have to coat the copper foil with a liquid

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.649
flux and then the solder will join those pieces
of copper foil together and because the glass

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.140
is embedded in the foil so now the glass is
stuck together too and we will go through

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.320
all of that. But that is what the soldering
iron is for, it heats up solder so that you

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.720
can either solder joints in lead cane or you
can solder pieces of copper foil wrapped glass

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:03.309
together. There are all kinds of soldering
irons you can get. One thing about soldering

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.070
irons is that they can get, they can get very,
very hot, obviously they need to but some

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.150
soldering irons get hotter than you might
want them to get for stained glass. You don't

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.520
want soldering, a soldering iron to get so
hot that it instantly melts the solder when

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
it touches it. You want it to have sort of,
slightly gradual kind of melting process where

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.240
it kind of maybe takes just a few seconds
maybe to melt that solder. So the point I

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.619
am getting to is, soldering irons that plug
straight into the wall, you don't have a lot

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.759
of control over the temperature but if you
can buy or get one of these soldering iron

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:43.070
control kind of boxes, you see this has my
soldering iron plugged in right into it and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.330
I have a full range of numbers from you know
off, all the way up to ten and I can set this

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.380
kind of where ever I want, and so. So if I
find that my soldering iron is too hot plugged

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.720
straight into the wall I can turn it down
and for my particular soldering iron that

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.159
I have, I have this set at around eight and
a half but that is just something that you

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.000
can experiment with and play with. So it is
good to have soldering iron control, it is

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.410
good to have a stand for your soldering iron,
that is kind of what I have got here. I will

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.380
turn it around so that you can see it, it's
you see it is very hot, this is a nice stand,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.500
it is keeping my soldering iron safe, kind
of away from the table where it could burn

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.120
my wood table or away from me where it could
burn me. You see it has a sponge underneath

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.262
it, a wet sponge that you kind of use to kind
of clean the tip right, and so it is also

00:02:33.262 --> 00:02:37.650
kind of nice that when you get a soldering
iron to have a stand and to keep it safe and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.330
kind of you know internal sponge to clean
it off. Although there are other kinds of

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.040
stands and systems that are not quite this
complex but it is nice to have heat control,

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.990
it's nice to have the stand, a sponge to clean
it off and so in the next clip I am going

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.740
to tell you a little bit about the tip of
the soldering iron.
