00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:10.343
Is Ruby on Rails hard to learn?

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:14.962
Ruby on Rails is evolving so fast that it
is hard to sort out the latest and greatest

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.722
from the edition you are working with.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:19.682
That makes it harder to learn.

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:23.623
Then again, I should get good money if I’m
on the bleeding edge.

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:27.543
You’ll learn it faster if you know the MVC
model.

00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:30.543
Can I learn Ruby from the documentation or
books?

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:35.903
Ruby on Rails is the biggest, inconsistent
mess of documentation on the web.

00:00:35.903 --> 00:00:41.023
And its rapid evolution means most books are
outdated by the time they hit stores.

00:00:41.023 --> 00:00:44.302
Is all object oriented programming this hard?

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:49.602
If you have experience with other languages
that use data types, conditionals and variables,

00:00:49.602 --> 00:00:51.613
Ruby is easier.

00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:55.282
If you only know functional programming, it
is harder.

00:00:55.282 --> 00:00:57.602
I could skip learning Rails.

00:00:57.602 --> 00:01:02.832
You can learn Ruby without Rails, but the
code will be more complex and verbose.

00:01:02.832 --> 00:01:05.712
And Ruby is hardly used without Rails.

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:10.393
I can speed up the learning process with a
lot of practice on my own machine.

00:01:10.393 --> 00:01:14.003
Windows development will knock Ruby off the
rails.

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:17.173
And the Ruby community has little out there
to help you.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:22.863
I might as well start studying Objective C.
That’s iOS specific, too.

00:01:22.863 --> 00:01:24.873
If you want to learn Ruby, get a Mac.

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:26.743
That’s quite an investment.

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:30.323
It takes months to years to get good at Ruby
on Rails.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:32.653
That’s a major time investment.

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:37.864
But developers who learn Ruby on Rails tend
to whip out new applications as fast as the

00:01:37.864 --> 00:01:39.893
internet demands them.

00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:44.543
The Rails framework makes working with Ruby
faster, but learning the framework slows down

00:01:44.543 --> 00:01:45.973
your learning.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:51.263
Learn the framework along with the code, and
you’ll get up the productivity curve faster.

00:01:51.263 --> 00:01:55.833
Build a framework and you can learn code fast
enough to hang yourself.

00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:56.333
Only technically.
