Today is a good day to die

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.080
Grey times tests your patience &amp; dignity

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.020
And the wait is the most testing of all

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.860
I've had enough of your whining

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.400
Calling my dream's too big, for me to just quit

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.680
Everything's a trap, a conspiracy
Be careful and take note

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.780
You won't make it

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.540
You can't win this

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.800
Mumbling beside me "retreat retreat retreat"

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.180
Forget it I'm leaving this hole

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.260
Gonna end this stalemate

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.100
This eternal dread

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.340
Now watch me Superman

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.320
Leaping forward, not hesitating

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.680
Tell me who's setting the rules

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.460
I'm invincible

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.460
I won't be quiet until victory

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.180
The path ahead is full of obstacles

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200
