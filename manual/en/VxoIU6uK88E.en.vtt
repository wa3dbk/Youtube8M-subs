Hi my name is Lucy Spain on behalf of Expert
Village here to talk about cheerleading stunts.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.600
Now once you're flying high up in the air,
how to do you get down? We definitely don't

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.740
want to just drag them down to the ground,
there's got to be a better way to do it. That's

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.380
why we invented the cradle. Now the cradle
is mainly up to the bases. You as a flier,

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.089
your most important responsibility is to just
ride it out, is what we usually say. Now the

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:33.600
main base who has both hands on each side
of the foot is going to take control of the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.100
cradle. As far as calling the cradle, that
responsibility is up to the back spot, just

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.640
as the responsibility is for getting in a
stunt. The cradle starts the same way as getting

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.989
into a stunt: ready, one two. After the one
two comes what we like to call the pop. Now

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.100
it's really important for your bases to keep
eye contact the whole time. A lot of times

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.041
you're doing cheers while you're doing your
stunts, so you can't say, OK, you ready? You

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:05.080
ready to do it now? Let's go, let's go. You've
got to make sure you maintain this eye contact.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.480
After the one two is called, you want to bend
at the knees, and when you hit the top, give

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.230
a shoulder shrug. That's just going to give
a little bit extra pop for your flier. Now

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.050
we don't want to launch our flier into the
air, that's not the point. We just gently

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.360
want to bring her out of it. After we've launched
the pop is the catching point. Now as bases,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.140
your arms need to be flat out like this. Your
other base is going to interlink their arms

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.720
with yours so our flier has a nice cushion.
After we've cushioned her fall, we're simply

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.570
going to pop her out forward, and then all
face our crowd as a unit. Now the back spot,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.170
you've got your hands on the ankles, when
you call the ready one two, it's important

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.840
for your to ride the pop with the bases, give
your little flick and the end, and you're

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.340
going to catch the girl underneath her armpits.
So both of her armpits are going to be right

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.020
up here at the top of your arms. Your most
important job to do is just to cushion, cushion,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.530
cushion, because if you just shove your arms
up under there, she's going to have bruised

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.280
armpits and she's not going to like it very
much. After she's come down, let's give her

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.040
a nice pop out. No need to fling her out,
just let her cradle out herself. Fliers, your

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.310
most important job to do like I said early
is ride it. Now how we're going to do that,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.810
most stunts we've got our arms up in the high
V position. When your cradler calls ready

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.061
one two, you really need to clear your mind,
because if a flier jumps out of your stunt,

00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:32.560
the whole thing's ruined and she's going to
end up hitting the floor on her feet if she's

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:40.600
lucky. So basically you need to go with your
pop, pull your hands up like this, just ride

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.980
it, enjoy it, and this is how we're going
to land. We're going to land with both feet

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.900
out in front of us, like we're sitting in
a chair. And each arm is going to go around

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.099
your bases necks, so you've got a nice little
cushion down and pop forward.
