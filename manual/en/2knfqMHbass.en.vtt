Hi this is Chuck Byers from Expert Village
at Fazio's Restaurant. Welcome back, Joe.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.440
Thank you, you've been very patient, and your
patience will be rewarded. Oh the patience

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:23.750
tantalizes the senses. I would like you to
try the wine and see how you like it. We will

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.890
give it a bit of a swirl, allowing air to
mix with the wine and the vapors start to

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:40.450
rise. Then what we do is we give it a whiff,
just to get the general smell. Smell again,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:57.900
very clean, nice cherry bouquet. Then you
allow air to mix in the mouth, and around

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.160
the senses of the tongue. And then you swallow.
Divine, thank you Joe! This is some of the

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.860
finest of Tuscany, and I hope you'll enjoy
it. Thank you Joe, thank you very much. It's

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.540
going to great with the steak. I should hope
so. Enjoy. Thank you very much. So there you

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.100
have it. Now did you see the process I just
went through? That's what most wine tasters,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.850
wine writers, sommeliers go through when they're
judging a wine. First they swirl it to allow

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:39.090
the wine to mix with the air and allow the
vapors to rise. Then they sniff it, smelling

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.730
the wine, smelling the bouquet. Making sure
it's nice and clean and crisp. Then they taste.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:55.670
Make sure the tongue, all facets of the tongue;
get a chance to taste the wine and then of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:06.390
course the swallow. A residual wine sticks
to the sensors of the tongue to give you what

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.140
they call a finish. And throughout this wine,
it's perfect presentation and perfect finish.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.310
Thank you for being with us for this part
of Expert Village "sommelier".
