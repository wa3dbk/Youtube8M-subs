My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today, I'm going to show you how

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:09.259
to shuck an oyster and how to prepare them
a couple of different ways. Alright, the first

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.780
thing you're going to want to do with your
oysters is clean them off. Because you'll

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.571
see, these I just got these from a local market
and they look pretty clean on the outside,

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.840
but when start running water over them, you'll
see a bunch of like dirt and mud. As you can

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.490
see on my fingers right there comes off of
them. You don't want to serve anybody dirty

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.630
oysters 'cause that's just gross. One other
thing I recommend, is when you go to buy these

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.730
oysters, only get them from reputable sources.
I wouldn't really buy them at the grocery

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.200
store. I'd go to a specialty, like a seafood
market, or if you have like a high-end, like

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.070
a gourmet grocery store near you, I'd recommend
something like that. So, clean these off.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.410
It's pretty simple. And you still see, I've
still kept them on ice the whole time. You

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.480
want to keep them as cold as you possibly
can until the point you're going to use them.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:58.290
So, sit them in the sink here and start running
some water over them. And I've got a brush

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.469
here that I keep pretty much for oysters and
potatoes. There you go. So what I'm going

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:14.590
to do, I'm going to take this brush and brush
the outside of each one. You see the water

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.920
is turning a really, pretty nasty color. You
don't have to scrub too much. You want to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.680
scrub enough to get all the really nasty stuff
on the outside. There's a couple of different

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.759
kinds of oyster out there. A couple of thousand
different breeds of oysters. Specifically,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:42.280
there's four major types of oysters and, of
the four classes of oysters, all of them fit

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.719
into three categories. Three different classes.
There's one oyster called the kimono oyster,

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.270
which is from Japan originally. It's grown
on the West Coast here now, in California.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.869
But that one occupies a class all its own
and those are pretty much the best oyster

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.530
you're going to get and they're really expensive.
They're about three or four dollars a piece,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.050
if you're lucky. I've seen them as high as
eight dollars a piece, depending on availability

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.710
and seasonality. So you can see, there's a
whole lot of this silt and mud and something

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.690
else out of these oysters. So what I'll do
now, I'll put them back in here and give them

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.320
another rinse just to make sure I got everything
off the outside, and we'll move on to shucking

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.510
them.
