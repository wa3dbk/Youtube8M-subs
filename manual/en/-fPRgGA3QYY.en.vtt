LAURA BANFORD: Now, I'm going to illustrate
some basic hand positions and movements with

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.730
the chef's knife. This is my 6-inch chef's
knife. It's the one I go to for most utilitarian

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:22.480
tasks. And I've selected celery because it
has nice even stalks and it's a good, good

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.180
way to practice. And again, celery is inexpensive
so if you want to practice yourself, it's

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.250
a good way to do it. Okay. I have two celery
stalks with the bottoms and the tops, bottoms

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.350
and tops cleaned off. What I'm going to do,
actually it should be like this. Let's say

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:50.890
you want to make diced celery. I'm going to
cut down with the tip of my knife. So we're

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.940
going to make kind of a uniform, it's not
too uniform, uniform dices there. I have my

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.741
knife in my hand, okay? Knife lies like this
across your fingers. You wrap your fingers

00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:11.780
around. Turn your knife perpendicular to your
cutting board. Make sure your cutting board

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:19.079
is not going to move. Anchor it nice and tight
there, okay? With your left hand or your non-dominant

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:26.609
hand, you're going to have your fingers curved.
And you're going to slice starting with about

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:31.740
an inch from the tip and rocking down. You're
going to use a rocking motion. And then you're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:45.319
going to slide your knife slightly ahead.
As you do that, and do it slowly to learn,

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:49.670
you're going to move your non-dominant hand,
your fingers or your non-dominant hand, back

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:57.940
so they're always out of range of the knife.
Again, they're curved under, and the knife,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:09.229
you have a rocking motion. As you pick up
confidence, you can increase your speed. I

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.860
made a mistake there. Never drag the edge
of your knife along the cutting board. It

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.000
dulls it. Always use the spine of the knife.
Let's turn them over this time so that they

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.910
don't move as much. A little rocking motion.
Those are coming out more uniform. I guess

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.840
we should do it cupped down, see? Those are
coming out nice and uniform. Always moving

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.440
your fingers back. When we come back, we're
going to use a cleaver.
