00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.560
Activity 18 is called
Sketching Complex Objects.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.440
And the complex object I've chosen to
represent is this child's toy.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.520
It's not so complicated that it makes it
very difficult to draw,

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.600
but it does give me a chance
to represent

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.120
much of the things we've looked at,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.880
the crating, the ovals,
the use of outlining and perspective.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.160
So, where do you start
with an object like this?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.280
Well, we need to decide what sort of
view we're going to produce, first of all.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.560
And, if you remember back
to some of the previous activities,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.280
it was up to us what sort of box
we started with.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.520
There's the Y shape I started with.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.640
But I could represent it
in a very different way.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.640
I could represent it like this.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.520
I saw much more of that top surface.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.960
The way I draw it is entirely up to me,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.680
as the graphic designer
of this particular image.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.160
So, having thought about it,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.840
I've decided that I particular want to be
able to see the top, and the side,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.800
I like the wheels very much,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.920
but I want to be able to see this front
surface, as well.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.680
So, I need to produce a crate which
envelopes the entire object.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.400
Now, it might be that I chose to spend
some time measuring this object,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.240
to get it exactly understood.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.400
And just, for the purpose of this
sketch activity,

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.080
I'm just going to go straight in
and produce a shape like that,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.680
which more or less envelopes
the whole of the object.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.120
Clearly there's wasted space up here,
but let's see how that unfolds.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.440
I know that the object has a thinner front
than the back,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.240
so I need to begin to put in some of this
shape over here.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.480
And I'm beginning to construct now
the front nose of the tractor.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.320
And I'm using my crate guidelines to
help me construct

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.520
the basic shapes that appear
in this tractor form.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.200
The roof is going to come over
something like that.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.560
It's going to come about there.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.960
And the wheel is going to be about
there. Let's put in one of the wheels.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:42.440
Now, remember the principle of drawing
these ovals was to find the axis.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.640
And I'll put that in as a construction
line there.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.240
And, at 90 degrees to it,
I put in a line,

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.200
which will be the major axis.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.560
And I'm going to use that to help me
construct a line like that.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.320
That's a representation using an oval
that represents the circle of the wheel.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.880
And I'll do the same for the front wheel,
let's see how that would look.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.480
I have a look at this, I can see it's just
beneath the underside there.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.720
It seems to go through a little sort of
plastic housing there.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.960
I draw in the axle.
I draw a line 90 degrees to it.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:36.160
And I allow that to become
the guidelines of my ellipse, my oval.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.880
So, I can now project those lines out
and draw another oval,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.200
because I want the wheel to have
some thickness.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.160
And the same for the front wheel.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.480
Join that up to there.
Let's put some of those lines in.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.680
So, you can see what it is.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.560
And we can begin to continue
with this now.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.680
It looks like my original crate was a little
bit ambitious at the back there.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.600
It's not a problem, because I'm
just going to foreshorten that a little bit.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.960
And obviously I've got my funnel
coming out of here.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.680
And how are we doing for that?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.400
Right, we need to put in some
back wheels â€“

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.760
sorry, some wheels at the rear of that.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.040
I can't quite see the other one.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.160
And those little headlight things on here.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.800
I'm not going to put too much detail
into this sketch.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.760
This, after all, is a first sketch,

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.760
that I can now use as an underlay, using
that overlay technique.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:58.480
So, now we've got a sketch of our child's
toy, which is a plausible starting point.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.720
But it's used many of the techniques

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.560
that we've developed
in this modelling workbook.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.280
The idea of crating, to help us establish
a perspective.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:12.600
The use of guidelines, to help us get
accurate ovals for things like wheels.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.160
The use of shading to give
three-dimensional form to an object.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.000
If you can end up with rough sketches
like these,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.520
then they're going to be really valuable
to you,

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.200
not only in communicating the design
ideas, amongst other designers,

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.160
and showing them to other people,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.640
but the act of visualising them
to improve your own creativity.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.240
So, these are the techniques that you
need to practise

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.360
to be able to use sketching effectively
in design.
