If you know your way around google analytics
you you may or may not have tried the E-commerce

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:14.251
ah tool but I'm using this as a way to illustrate
ah why patience is important when you are

00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.320
dealing with search engine optimization and
I have a lot of clients that contact us and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.619
they say you know we need to be at the top
of google for this key word in 60 days or

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.210
90 days and other firms have guaranteed that
they will do this and ah we usually tell them

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.290
to go with those firms ah and then contact
us when that doesn't work out ahhhhum this

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.090
isn't an advertisement just so you know I'm
not trying to sell you anything I'm actually

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.890
not taking clients right now this is purely
a lesson in patience when it comes to search

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.260
engine optimization so this is one of my clients
I'm not going to name names they like to remain

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.851
anonymous ah March 7 2009 to April 7th 2009
1 year ago 20 day period one year ago ah they

00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:05.189
took us on in January 2009 and we have been
working for them on retainer for the past

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.600
year ah and they we told them they knew day
one that this is a long term process its going

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.159
to take up to a year sometimes clients get
lucky and they see results in six months in

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.840
this case the client didn't really see results
until eight months in of their SEO plan so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.289
um they had to shell out money on a monthly
basis to us on pure faith um knowing that

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.450
there was a light at the end of the tunnel
and its really taken a full year to see a

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.590
fantastic impact so I want to show you the
difference between that 30 day period a year

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.450
ago and the last 30 days in 2010 so in 2009
they generated 657 they sold 657 Products

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:01.810
a total of 277 individual transactions and
they generated $28,000 roughly in revenue

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:14.300
So if we go ahead to the same period in 2010
Sorry there we go March 7 to April 7 2010

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:24.689
you will see that the jump was to 1359 products
and $96,000 in revenue so we're talking about

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:32.489
ah you know almost quadruple increase in revenue
over the course or after a full year of real

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.709
world what we call in the business white hat
search engine optimization so we didn't play

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.290
any tricks there is no secret sauces no magic
beans we did a lot of link building we promoted

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.299
a lot of external content there's a lot of
factors and if you follow my blog you will

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.909
see I don't hide anything when it comes to
search engine optimization what we do isn't

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:59.140
a secret it really comes down to just doing
the grunt work but here is an example of um

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:07.409
a full year before a real real result was
seen a real massive increase was seen um so

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.250
if you're into the link building game you're
three months in your six months in and you're

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.989
not seeing a result make this your motivator
don't give up keep your head down keep working

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.870
at it ah your hard work will pay off and don't
take any short cuts don't pay anybody to do

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.819
anything crazy just ah keep doing what you
are doing or make sure you are dealing with

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.379
the right search engine optimization firm
and that they are doing their job correctly

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.239
but ah if you stick with it it might take
up to a year but when that time hits when

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.040
you start to see that increase that increase
will be massive and in this clients case ah

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.219
we have another year to go before we hit what
we sort of think is their cap which I hope

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:56.200
is going to be about $800,000 a month in revenue
as opposed to 96,000 a month in revenue
