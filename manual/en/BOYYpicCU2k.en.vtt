00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.309
Having already found a home on the XBLA and
PC, Supergiant Game's stunning title Bastion

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.420
has leapt (from almost nowhere) on to the
App Store and in particular on to the iPad.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.570
It's a welcome surprise as it doesn't simply
demand players to stick with the control system

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.779
of the first two releases (though it is still
available), opting instead for an intuitive

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.100
semi-auto fire tap and drag system instead.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.460
The only question that remains is, does it
still feel like Bastion?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.969
For those unfamiliar with the title, you play
the role of 'The Kid', a capable warrior adept

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.449
in the use of weapons ranging from hulking
two-handed hammers to mines, grenades, samurai

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:44.449
swords, and akimbo-pistols.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.309
It's an eclectic range, but you'll appreciate
the variety as you encounter the mysterious

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.899
floating-world's vicious inhabitants.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.789
Whether you're fighting a gloop spewing Scumbag,
a fire-spewing Pyth bull, or the always frustratingly

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.429
armored Lunkheads, you'll be able to dodge,
hit, shoot and maybe even fire off a special

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.999
attack or two to keep ahead of the curve.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.270
While you could play the game using a virtualized
version of the original controls (stick-based

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.540
movement with an arrangement of buttons to
dodge, shoot, and so on), the iPad version

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.520
boasts its own smart-control system.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.720
Tap or double tap and you'll respectively
walk or dodge in that direction.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.820
Hold down and drag and The Kid will chase
after your finger.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.880
In either case you'll start attacking hostiles
automatically as soon as they're in range.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.810
This may sound cheap, but as it is you still
need to avoid attacks while positioning yourself

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.630
up for counter-strikes and power-shots, balancing
things out.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.980
Traveling through the world of Bastion is
a unique experience all on its own as it forms

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.830
itself from broken fragments as you move about.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.660
As you do so your actions are narrated by
the friendly elder 'Rucks', giving the game

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.640
an almost story-book like feel as new areas
are constructed before your very eyes.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.470
This actually becomes a core aspect of the
game as you attempt to recreate the world

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.150
by collecting crystals, granting access to
stores that invite experimentation by changing

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.670
The Kid's weapon load-out; modifying passive
boosts; reforging weapons for new effects;

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.039
and even remembering the fallen victims of
the calamity that surrounds you.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.620
Bastion for the iPad is a wonderful adaption
of an outstanding action title and one that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.069
feels at home on the App Store thanks to its
control modifications.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.939
Purists may balk at the reduction of challenge,
but Bastion's beauty is not in the difficulty,

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:31.879
but in unfolding its delicate story, one skway
at a time.
