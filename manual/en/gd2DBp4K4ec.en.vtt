00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:11.066
There's something probably never seen before. You've seen driveway but this is a very special driveway made of a material called permeable 

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:20.266
concrete. Its is just like regular concrete minus the sandâ€¦ Its crushed aggregate that's held together with Portland cement 

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:28.732
Its basically pieces of crushed rock. The sand normally fills in the interstices that when the rocks and causes

00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:39.366
the surface to be impervious to water.This allows water to soak in. Its kind of like a rice cake and all the little pieces have voids in between and

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:44.766
water will go down through. Why would that matter to anyone? Well, here's why...

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:54.899
When water hit's a conventional paved surface it runs off - it's not gonna soak in. When it hits concrete it runs off into the gutter and in the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:01.333
gutter two problems begin to occur. The 1st one is it floods the street. Sometimes that's a problem 

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.666
if your drainage isn't too good or you have heavy torrential rainfall

00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:09.199
then the flooding is a really big problem..Ffor example

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:20.566
the Los Angeles Basin is 78% paved or roofed. 78% is impervious which means that only 22% is soaking up water. The net effect then is 

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:25.799
A) urban flooding ann the second thing - which is really important - is

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:35.600
B) all that water goes and ends up somewhere in the streams, or the lake, or the river or in the ocean

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.433
causing tremendous amounts of pollution because all sorts of junk falls on the land, falls on the street, or falls in your driveway

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:54.099
Aerel particle pollutants and not to be to indelicate but dog poop and garbage and all sorts of junk that builds up over a very long dry 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:01.933
season here in California and eventually reaches a level that when it gets concentrated in those bodies of water

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:12.133
you have tremendous problems - bacteria and all kinds of water pollution. Its really a big deal, so the idea of a pervious pavement is to

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:22.099
allow water to remain on site. It doesn't go any where and actually soaks through this material stays on sight. The 3rd benefit which is watering 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.800
the plants that are nearby. The roots are actually getting under this material and are taking on 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.366
water. Its a much much better way to go- such a good idea that municipalities

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:37.066
over the state and all over the country

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.866
that beginning to require this material

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:42.766
on a lot of the development projects.

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:48.832
this was the first residential pervious driveway in California. Its here at my house and it 

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:52.299
was quite a production. We put in about eight years ago, and its done

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:01.033
really well and I'm really happy with that, and I just wanted to tell you a little bit about it so that you can consider that if you have an 

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:08.699
application where it might work. Its not just for driveways by the way. they do pervious concrete walkways, sidewalks, patios and whatnot, even

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.700
load bearing roads. It will take any kind of the reasonable vehicle traffic

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.066
and its about the same cost as a conventional concrete driveway.

00:03:19.066 --> 00:03:27.399
sometimes as little more, sometimes less. One of the really interesting things about cost is that because it's pervious you don't need to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:35.400
think about drainage. Normally you might have a drain and a drainpipe that takes the water away and costs money to put in which sometimes  

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.266
can be very, very expensive.

00:03:38.266 --> 00:03:43.332
The water's not going anywhere so you've eliminated the need for drain system which 

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:47.633
means that even if the driveway itself costs more it's gonna cost less when you

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:57.733
take out the drainage system. So cost is not a factor, durability is not a factor. These have been down in places in Florida and in the 

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:02.133
southeast for 30 years or more in they still work perfectly well.

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:07.366
this material absorbs water a a rate of 300 to 400 inches

00:04:07.366 --> 00:04:09.132
per hour

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:13.033
per hour!.Nnow that's important because

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:15.533
the surface can plug up

00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:18.266
and you're going to lose absorption.

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:25.066
At 350 inches per hour you can really plug it up before it becomes a significant 

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:31.932
factor.Our rainfall in Santa Barbara where this driveway is located is 18 inches of rain per year.

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:43.599
so we're talking about what? A huge amount -  220 times the annual rainfall per hour. This could almost completely plug up and we still 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:51.233
handle all the rain that can possibly fall, so it's essentially a zero run off paving element

00:04:51.233 --> 00:05:00.899
maintenance is minimal.Rake it once in a while you can power vacuum and out if it gets really clogged up. I had thisdriveway for eight 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:07.633
years. I've cleaned it out with a vacuum twice and I've power washed it twice. 

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:13.666
The rest of the time, I just rke it off. It's a very very low maintenance material.

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:18.232
and if you wanna see out works, watch this. This is so cool...

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:26.766
When you dump water on a driveway, you know what happens - it ponds up and starts to runoff. check this out...

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:29.932
The water

00:05:29.933 --> 00:05:33.866
soaks in disappears. Let me show you this another way.

00:05:33.866 --> 00:05:37.566
Here's a block of colored

00:05:37.566 --> 00:05:39.966
material - the same thing

00:05:39.966 --> 00:05:43.399
If we apply water to this, watch what happens

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.000
It's going through

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.433
the concrete

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:53.033
through the concrete

00:05:53.033 --> 00:05:57.066
that means its staying on the land and is going to work for you

00:05:57.066 --> 00:06:01.499
it's not causing flooding. Its not polluting anything...

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:09.566
this is a really great material. There's a lot of information on and you can Google pervious concrete.. If you're in 

00:06:09.566 --> 00:06:14.866
California or Nevada, there is an organization called the California Nevada Cement Counsel 

00:06:14.866 --> 00:06:18.366
and they have a lot of information on pervious concrete

00:06:18.366 --> 00:06:26.932
it has to be put in, by the way, by a certified installer. Its a different process than pouring regular concrete. Its actually fairly challenging

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:30.133
to do unless you have the training and some special equipment.

00:06:30.133 --> 00:06:37.866
but there are contractors all throughout California and throughout the United States here and there its growing in popularity so you 

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:43.066
shouldn't have too much trouble finding someone to do it, but don't hire just a regular cement 

00:06:43.066 --> 00:06:47.566
contractor that doesn't know what they're doing. Its a little bit tricky to deal with.

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:56.866
I've been really happy with it, clients have been really happy with it. It's gone down in many many public places parking lots, in roadways 

00:06:56.866 --> 00:07:04.899
slow speed road ways when the speed is 25 or 30 miles an hour. It's a fantastic material and really making a difference

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:15.300
in our water quality and our flooding problems. Give it consideration if you have a site like this it's relatively flat and that's causing run-off 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:21.133
problems or if you're needing driveway this definitely something to consider. Thanks a lot.
