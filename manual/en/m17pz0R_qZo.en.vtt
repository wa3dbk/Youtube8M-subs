00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:09.613
Good morning. 

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.128
The news this week 

00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:12.643
has only reinforced the fact 

00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:16.536
that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions.  

00:00:16.536 --> 00:00:19.357
Financial markets faced more turmoil.  

00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:23.353
New home purchases in October were the lowest in half a century.  

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:27.664
540,000 more jobless claims were filed last week, 

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:29.858
the highest in eighteen years.  

00:00:29.858 --> 00:00:33.332
And we now risk falling into a deflationary spiral 

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:36.441
that could increase our massive debt even further. 

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:39.027
While I’m pleased that Congress passed 

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:41.953
a long-overdue extension of unemployment benefits this week, 

00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:45.035
we must do more to put people back to work 

00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:47.177
and get our economy moving again.  

00:00:47.177 --> 00:00:51.043
We have now lost 1.2 million jobs this year,

00:00:51.043 --> 00:00:53.629
and if we don’t act swiftly and boldly, 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.861
most experts now believe that we could lose millions of jobs next year.  

00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:01.436
There are no quick or easy fixes to this crisis, 

00:01:01.436 --> 00:01:03.713
which has been many years in the making, 

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:06.064
and it’s likely to get worse before it gets better

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:09.721
But January 20th is our chance to begin anew 

00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:12.359
with a new direction, new ideas,

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:17.244
and new reforms that will create jobs and fuel long-term economic growth.  

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:20.405
I have already directed my economic team 

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:22.808
to come up with an Economic Recovery Plan 

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:28.581
that will mean 2.5 million more jobs by January of 2011 

00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:31.585
– a plan big enough to meet the challenges we face

00:01:31.585 --> 00:01:34.433
that I intend to sign soon after taking office.  

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:37.045
We’ll be working out the details in the weeks ahead, 

00:01:37.045 --> 00:01:40.206
but it will be a two-year, nationwide effort 

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:42.583
to jumpstart job creation in America 

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:46.214
and lay the foundation for a strong and growing economy.  

00:01:46.214 --> 00:01:50.054
We’ll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, 

00:01:50.054 --> 00:01:52.849
modernizing schools that are failing our children, 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:55.252
and building wind farms and solar panels; 

00:01:55.252 --> 00:01:58.883
fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies 

00:01:58.883 --> 00:02:01.940
that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.231
and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead. 

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:08.993
These aren’t just steps to pull ourselves out of this immediate crisis; 

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:12.676
these are the long-term investments in our economic future 

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:15.027
that have been ignored for far too long.  

00:02:15.027 --> 00:02:17.796
And they represent an early down payment 

00:02:17.796 --> 00:02:21.244
on the type of reform my Administration will bring to Washington 

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:25.554
– a government that spends wisely, focuses on what works, 

00:02:25.554 --> 00:02:29.342
and puts the public interest ahead of the same special interests

00:02:29.342 --> 00:02:31.380
that have come to dominate our politics.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.253
I know that passing this plan won’t be easy.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:38.981
I will need and seek support from Republicans and Democrats, 

00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:43.396
and I’ll be welcome to ideas and suggestions from both sides of the aisle.  

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:45.773
But what is not negotiable 

00:02:45.773 --> 00:02:48.020
is the need for immediate action.  

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.684
Right now, there are millions of mothers and fathers 

00:02:50.684 --> 00:02:52.121
who are lying awake at night 

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:55.673
wondering if next week’s paycheck will cover next month’s bills.  

00:02:55.673 --> 00:02:58.181
There are Americans showing up to work in the morning 

00:02:58.181 --> 00:03:01.525
only to have cleared out their desks by the afternoon.  

00:03:01.525 --> 00:03:05.051
Retirees are watching their life savings disappear 

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.925
and students are seeing their college dreams deferred.  

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:11.556
These Americans need help, and they need it now.

00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:15.631
The survival of the American Dream for over two centuries 

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:18.452
is not only a testament to its enduring power, 

00:03:18.452 --> 00:03:21.012
but to the great effort, sacrifice, 

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:23.468
and courage of the American people.  

00:03:23.468 --> 00:03:26.446
It has thrived because in our darkest hours, 

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:29.528
we have risen above the smallness of our divisions 

00:03:29.528 --> 00:03:33.002
to forge a path towards a new and brighter day.  

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:37.287
We have acted boldly, bravely, and above all, together.  

00:03:37.287 --> 00:03:41.414
That is the chance our new beginning now offers us, 

00:03:41.414 --> 00:03:44.836
and that is the challenge we must rise to in the days to come.  

00:03:44.836 --> 00:03:46.978
 It is time to act.

00:03:46.978 --> 00:03:50.191
As the next President of the United States, I will.

00:03:50.191 --> 00:03:52.385
  Thank you.
