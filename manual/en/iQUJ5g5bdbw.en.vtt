00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:09.240
I love you; I hope these thoughts reach you

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.140
I’m sure one day it’ll come true

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:24.520
Such feelings are too painful

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.460
I don’t understand things such as beginnings

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.280
It seems like you could have an ordinary name and be anywhere

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.980
But no matter how many people there are

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.070
I’m sure to find you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.910
I don’t like the me who locked up these honest feelings

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.370
And confined herself in a shell

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.570
Each time that I halfheartedly hold myself back

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.210
The pain merely grows

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.020
What do you wish for?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.580
I want to be close to you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.600
Forever and ever that’s all I want and yet…

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.030
(Thump thump…)

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.690
Love deterrence

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.900
Look! The game’s beginning

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.620
If I was looking at you would you know?

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.620
The starting bell chimes

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730
Listen To My Heart

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.440
My silent voice,

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.090
Stop this love deterrence

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.990
I want to tell you everything about me

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.950
For no special reason I cut my hair but

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.720
I can’t actually say that it’s your fault

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.300
I’m just lying and running away

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.510
It’s enough, I can’t go on like this

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.270
Looking at others intently

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.800
Not knowing such bravado

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.030
Your back soon passed by

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.450
And I felt the pain far away

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.610
Who are you thinking about?

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.600
Tell me “How long will the two of us

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.330
Continue like this?”

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.450
(Squeeze squeeze…)

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.190
Love deterrence

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.340
Look! The game’s beginning

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.930
These entangled feelings will no longer come apart;

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.030
things began to move

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.150
Listen To My Heart

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.900
If I get used to being more honest

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.620
Stop this love deterrence

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.250
Stay only by my heart

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.870
One day I’ll say

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.210
“I love you”

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.120
In my dreams I say

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.460
“Sorry for everything”

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.840
One day say “We’ll be together forever”

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.400
Firmly, firmly say

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:16.860
“I won’t leave”

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.950
(Throb throb)

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.670
Love deterrence

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.760
Look! The game’s beginning

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.090
Look at these straightforward thoughts

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.090
Now I’m overflowing and I start to run

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.590
I don’t want to be alone any longer!

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.300
Look at me!

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.030
Everything leads to you,

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.570
No matter the past or the future, forever

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.870
And ever…

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.860
This encounter will change the world

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.390
After school in the classroom,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.640
Now it’s just the two of us

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.410
This is a chance given by God

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.280
But the time still passes by

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.850
I’m sure that if this goes on,

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.340
We’ll pass each other by

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.010
With our backs facing each other,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.460
We move apart…

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.650
I love you; I hope these thoughts reach you

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.610
I’m sure one day it’ll come true

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:39.490
Such feelings are too painful

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.010
Please stop…

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:51.630
The love deterrence
