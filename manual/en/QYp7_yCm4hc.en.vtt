00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.460
Now let me show you how to calculate 
the number of bricks, blocks or pavers using

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.129
your Material Estimator.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.619
It'll give you quick estimates for how
many bricks, blocks or pavers for any surface

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:17.060
area that you need.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.579
Now the default block size built in is
an 8 x 8 x 16 common concrete block.

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.050
The face area of that is 8 x 16. That's 128
square inches. You

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.189
can check the block area that's stored
by hitting [Rcl]

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.220
[Blocks]

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.530
Block area - 128 square inches.
So you know you've got a common 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.930
8 x 16 block.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.060
If you have a single course of blocks
and you just want to figure out how many you need,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.460
say for a hundred feet [1][0][0] [Feet]

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.860
[Conv] [Blocks]. There's going to be 75 
blocks in that row, whether it's for a footing for

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.230
a fence or a property line or something
else. If you have a square foot area,

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920
for example, a hundred foot long wall 
[1][0][0] [Feet].

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.430
by six feet tall

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.030
600 square feet

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.660
[Conv][Blocks] There's going to be
675 blocks needed for

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.680
that.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.950
You can also add a percentage for
waste if you like.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.820
Now if you have blocks that are non 
8 x 16, you can

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.360
set the block size to any other
size you like. Say there's a 4 x 8

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.920
inch face brick that you want to use for a
hundred square foot patio. So we go [4]

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.090
[Inch]

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.259
[x] [8][Inch]

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.310
There's our 32 square inch
block size. We hit [Stor] and above

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.640
[Block] it says

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.760
Block Size. So we've now stored it as  
32 square inches. So now when we have a

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.170
hundred square foot patio [1][0][0]

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.540
[Feet][Feet]. Second press makes 
it square feet.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.490
Hit [Conv][Blocks]

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.270
We need 450 of those 4 x 8 inch bricks 
for that.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
If you have pavers for a driveway or
something, 6 by 6 pavers, same thing.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950
[6][Inch] [x] [6][Inch]

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.460
is 36 square inches each. Store that
as my block size

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.970
and maybe the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.479
driveway is 1500 square feet.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.910
Convert to blocks.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.150
We need 6000 of those pavers for
that driveway.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.090
Add maybe five percent for waste 
[+] [5][%]

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.739
6300 blocks and they're

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:12.659
63 cents each.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.849
[Conv] to cost over the [0].

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.389
Tells us we've got about $3900
worth of pavers for that

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:19.509
driveway.

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.239

function. For more details you can download
