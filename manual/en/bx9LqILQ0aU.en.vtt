00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:47.889
When I was speaking at MIT, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
I was speaking on the resurrection and the reliability of the Scriptures.

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:52.908
When I finished I walked down into the audience, 
was interacting with a lot of the MIT students.

00:00:54.216 --> 00:00:58.744
One of the students said, “I just can’t believe in the Bible.” I said, “Why?”

00:00:58.983 --> 00:01:02.781
“Well, so much in it cannot be true.” I said, “Really? Give me an example.”

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:06.433
He said, “Look at Noah’s ark, the tower of Babel.”

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:10.711
He said, “Noah’s ark didn’t originate in the Bible.

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:21.916
There [are] many stories in other religious traditions in history about a man with animals in a boat that survived through a storm.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:29.120
And then with the tower of Babel were it says 
God took this tower they had built

00:01:29.266 --> 00:01:35.959
because they were going to ascend to God and be 
like God themselves and it says God dispersed them

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:40.648
and broke up their language and gave them 
different languages to confuse them.”

00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:50.996
And this young man said to me, “You know there are so many traditions with that same story in it; therefore I cannot just not believe it.”

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.858
I said, “Isn’t that interesting?

00:01:54.666 --> 00:02:01.843
The very reason why you say you can’t believe 
is the very basis of why I say I can believe it.”

00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:03.488
He said, “What do you mean?”

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.016
I said, “Follow with me. If there was Noah and he did build an ark, a huge boat,

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:20.688
and loaded the animals onto [it] to preserve them of 
each species and there was a great flood that covered the Earth

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:31.330
and then the waters receded and the ark landed,
if there weren’t other traditions of that,

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.323
other stories of that coming down through various traditions

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:43.808
then I would question the validity of the story of Noah and the ark.”

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:48.464
Are you with me? You see, if there was something that phenomenal

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.411
then of course you would have traditions come 
down through various parts of history that would relate to that.

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:59.221
With the Tower of Babel, with something that unusual,

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:08.220
if there weren’t other traditions and stories about a 
tower and God confusing the languages very similar,

00:03:08.683 --> 00:03:18.646
then I would question the truth about the Tower of Babel in 
the Word of God.  These traditions verify that they took place.
