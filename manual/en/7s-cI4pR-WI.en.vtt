00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120
LAPELS

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.960
The difference

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.400
between a double-breasted jacket

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.000
and a 3-button single-breasted one

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.080
is the lapels which vary greatly,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.960
this is much more crescent-shaped,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.760
it has a peak,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.400
the double-breasted jacket
is more overlapping...

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.200
A normal double-breasted jacket
overlaps

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.800
about 16 centimetres,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.960
while a single-breasted one

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.600
overlaps 3 centimetres, not more.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.000
In the double-breasted jacket,
the peaked lapels

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.000
have these dimensions,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.000
they're wider,

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.600
also because it's much longer,
since it's buttoned at the waist.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.600
In the three-button jacket,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.600
double-pressed,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.800
the notch is cut slightly slanted

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and it's much narrower,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.400
because it's shorter.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.120
That's the difference.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.560
A finished double-breasted jacket
comes out like this.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.200
If I do this, you can

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.800
see the difference.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.960
This is a tuxedo,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160
it is single-breasted
with a button at the waist

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.760
and the lower part of the lapels

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.600
is lined in silk grosgrain.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.800
The uppercollar is like the jacket,
that is, in wool,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.880
while the entire lower facing

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.360
is in silk grosgrain.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.480
The collar of an overcoat

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.280
is different still,
it has other characteristics.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.880
This,

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.560
quite military-like,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.840
can be

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.440
buttoned here

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and buttoned up here.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.400
Buttoning it like this,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.920
leaves a small collar

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.200
similar to a shirt.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.840
It's all buttoned up.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.200
The difference lies
in the fact that this is a collar...

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.600
This overcoat is particular

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.200
because it's an English-style coat,

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.480
double-breasted, wide lapels,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.880
there's a half belt at the back,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.280
a deep pleat with a vent,

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.360
it's a garment in cashmere

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.960
and a favourite with customers.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.320
This one is a Cover Coat.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.600
This is

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.960
single-breasted

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.640
and this too has a button-up feature.
