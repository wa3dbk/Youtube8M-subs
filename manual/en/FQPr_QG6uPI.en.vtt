00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.760
Today I am counting down the
top 5 most beautiful Japanese actresses. 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.949
Staring the list at number 5 we have Kitagawa Keiko.
Smart and beautiful she has got a degree in

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:22.949
commerce and was an exclusive model for the
Japanese 17 magazine from 2003-2006. 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:28.359
She is so pretty! What doe she star in? You can see
her in Akumu Chan, a toad I recently reviewed,

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:35.130
Paradise Kiss, and Buzzer Beat. At number
4 we have Karina. I think she is a strong

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.090
actress who works really hard and frankly
is someone that is quite beautiful.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.090
The hair,  the eyes, the smile, and of course the inside.
And she always gets the cutest guys in every

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.690
drama. What does she star in? You can see
her in Love Shuffle, another TOAD I reviewed

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.690
not too long ago, Real Clothes and Bambino!
It is not too popular but I really like Bambino!

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.650
Making the cut at number 3 is Ueto Aya. When
you are talking about a girl next door beauty

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.440
in Japan you cannot beat her. She is so cute
and melts your heart and yet can play the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.180
calculating detective or the cold prostitute
with equal flair. What does she star in? You

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.240
can see her in Nagareboshi, Attention Please,
or The Zettai Reido Series. At number 2 we

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.800
have Horikita Maki. She is such a versatile
beauty. She can play the girl next door, the

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.900
cross dresser, the crazy person. Everything
she does you're left in awe, or at least I

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.360
am. What does she star in? You can check her
out in Nobuta Wo Produce, Kikoku, or in the

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.360
Japanese version of Hana Kimi.
\f1 And topping the list at number 1 we have

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.650
Kuroki Meisa. The daughter of a Brazilian
American mom and a Japanese dad, she is the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.650
current Japanese representative for Armani!
and is married to Jin Akanishi - It's like

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.090
Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biehl, Orlando
Bloom and Miranda Kerr. What does she star

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.999
in?
\f0 You can check her out in Akai Yubi, One

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:16.999
Pound Gospel, or in Andalucia Revenge of the
Goddess. Number 1 is

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:23.590
\f1 Aibu Saki. She has the cutest dimpled
smile, OMG! Watch her in Zettai Kareshi (Absolute

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.129
boyfriend). Number 2 is Nakama Yukie. She
is classically beautiful - like straight out

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.129
of a painting. Watch her in Gokusen. Number
3

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:37.519
\f0 is Yuna Ito. I loved her as the gothic
rocker Nana, total girl crush. Watch her in

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.209
Nana of course. Number 4 is Ayase Haruka.
To me she looks like the Japanese Hillary

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.609
Duff. And, she looks great in sweats drinking
a can of beer! Watch her in Hotaru no Hikari

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:53.439
Series. And slipping in at the bottom of the
list at number 5 is Inoue Mao. I can't deny

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.849
the many netizens that love this girl. She
is very pretty though not so much my style.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:04.650
Watch her in Hana Yori Dango. And that does
it for todays Top 5 Friday. I upload Top 5

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.450
videos every Friday. If you have a recommendation
for a Top 5 Friday theme, head on over to

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.540

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.099
Last week I asked you which drama do you like
better. The Japanese version of Han Kimi,

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.230
or the Korean version To the Beautiful You.
And to my very pleasant surprise, the Japanese

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.059
version of Hana kimi was the winner. For this
weeks poll, which recent period drama do you

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:37.029
like better. Reply 1997, or Bridal Mask. Cast
your vote on my Hallyu Back Facebook page,

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:41.730
and proclaim the results in next weeks video.
Remember to like and favorite this video,

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.549
and do not forget to subscribe to my channel
for more Top 5 and TOAD adventures. She is

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:55.549
