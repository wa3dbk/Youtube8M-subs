00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.859
Hello, my name is Amanda Wheatley and I am
the designer of Fusion gig bags. 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:11.910
Today I'd like to show you the F1 Electric
Guitar bag that I've got on my back here.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.760
Here we have the grab handle at the front
of the bag. This allows you to lift the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.119
bag or walk with the bag in front of you.
You also have one at the back here, so

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.660
you can walk down the aisle of a train or
anything like that.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.660
The construction of the bag is 30mm high-density
foam. It has got a re-enforced

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.520
PVC textured base. So if the bag is sitting
on the floor it keeps it clean and tidy.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.910
At the top of the bag is a re-enforced area,
again with textured PVC.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.910
This pocket is to put your guitar leads in.
Sometimes it can be quite a bulky item

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.239
that's why I have created a pocket with quite
a big space.

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.379
What is great about our backpack straps is
that they've got reflective material

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:12.379
running down both sides. This is great if
you're walking down the road or if you want to be seen in the dark.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.280
So now we have the backpack straps tucked
away inside the headstock area and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.759
we have all the straps tucked away in the
lumbar support, I'd like to show you

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.200
the Flow-System.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.200
This is a very comfortable back support system.
It has two high-density foam

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.909
pillars that hold the bag away from your back.
If you are cycling or if you're walking long

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.399
distances you don't get hot.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.299
One of the most important features of the
Flow-System is that it is very

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:21.299
comfortable and that it prevents your back
from sweating because the netting holds the bag away from your back.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.819
And I'd like to show you the inside of the
bag.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:49.139
The zips are all heavy-duty zippers. We have
rubber zip-pulls on the bag.

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.019
The great thing about our bags is that we
use the high-density foam. We don't

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.239
use the soft foam like must other gig bag
manufacturers do.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.469
The high-density foam makes the bag almost
like a hard case, that's why we call

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:10.769
it a hybrid bag.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.790
t's a very, very rigid structure.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.549
Inside: Here we can see it is 30mm thick high-density
foam padding. And the inside has a velvet-mix padded foam finish.

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:31.900
Here we have a re-enforced bridge area and
we also have a re-enforced headstock area.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.519
On the base of the bag we have a re-enforced
end-pin panel.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:42.519
And when you look at how the guitar is placed
inside the bag you can see that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.299
there is a lot of space and room around the
headstock area. When the bag is

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.949
transported you don't get any movement of
the guitar inside the bag.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.409
Being a musician can be quite difficult.
You've got your instrument, you've got your

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:03.619
bags, you've got your accessories,
you've got your laptop and you've got your

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:09.359
drink and you're running to catch a
train or you're trying to catch a plane.

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.419
You're running down there and "oh my Lord"
you've got everything hanging

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:20.419
around your neck and you just can't get through
the door and then your phone

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.080
rings!

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.590
We've come up with a great idea called the
Fuse-on system.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.539
Here you have the Laptop Backpack that can
be used individually but the beauty

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:38.490
of it is, you can "fuse-on" to the front of
the musical instrument bag.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.270
The second bag is the Small Backpack, which
you can use for your wires, cables

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.270
and effect pedals. This attaches to the headstock
area of the Guitar Bag.

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:05.060
So here we have the solution: "Fuse-On"
I've got my hands free, I can pick-up my mobile

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.250
phone, I can have my drink, I can
walk through the door, I can even run for

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.930
the train.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.770
All our F1 Premium Guitar bags have the same
features. They are available in

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.949
four different colour options and they all
have the Fuse-On System.

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.269
Fusion ...more than just a gig bag!
