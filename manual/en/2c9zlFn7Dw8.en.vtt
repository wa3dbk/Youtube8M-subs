Hi, my name is Sarah, I’m here at Pet Land
in Pembroke Pines tonight, and on behalf of

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.599
expertvillage.com, I’m going to speak with
you a little bit purchasing and owning a pet

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.780
turtle. Another consideration, when it comes
to your turtle’s habitat is what substrate

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.710
or what you are going to keep in the bottom
of the aquarium. You do not necessarily need

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:32.390
to have gravel in the aquatic half of your
turtle’s enclosure. It tends to make it

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.640
easier to clean your turtle’s closure, if
you not have gravel because gravel tends to

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.160
keep bacteria and fungus. If you do choose
to have gravel in your turtle’s enclosure,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.940
you should make sure that the gravel that
you use is of a sufficient size that your

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.710
turtle cannot ingest it. We have seen turtles
ingest gravel before and I have had to surgically

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.210
remove it and as it became life-threatening
to the turtle. The gravel can cause intestinal

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.210
obstruction and impaction and will require
surgical removal by a qualified reptile veterinarian.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.009
Cleaning your turtle’s enclosure requires
a full disinfection of the entire enclosure.

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.570
You do not want to just take out the water,
wipe the tank out and put everything back.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.500
You want to completely breakdown your turtle’s
environment, thoroughly clean the turtle’s

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.750
enclosure with a soapy water or a diluted
bleach, you can dilute bleach, one part bleach

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.350
to 30 parts water and you want to rinse very,
very well, no matter what you decide to use

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.200
to clean your turtle’s enclosure. When you
are cleaning your turtle’s enclosure, it’s

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.350
also very important that you thoroughly clean
any gravel or rocks or any cage furniture

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.320
or any other materials that you will be putting
back in the cage. On behalf of expertvillage.com,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.140
I would like to thank you for letting me speak
to you about your pet turtle. If you would
