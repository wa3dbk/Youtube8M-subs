My heart still beats at the speed. (laughing)
We love Sweety High. That's Sweety with a

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:16.100
Y. We love Sweety High. That's Sweety with
a Y! YAAA! (laughing) What's up everyone?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.590
We're At Sunset. I'm Harrison. I'm Tom. And
I'm Andrew. And you're watching SweetBeatTV

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.320
only on SweetyHigh.com. Hey Sweetys. It's
Alex Schiffman with SweetBeatTV and we're

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.989
here for another episode of Sweety Spotlight
with Australian pop rock band, At Sunset.

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.140
Wooo! (clapping). Hey guys! Welcome to America.
We're very happy to have you from down under.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.909
It's good to be up over. Yeah, you have been
doing a lot in LA. I hear you've been paint-balling.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.370
Yeah. I saw you were on a yacht yesterday. Yeah,
heaps of work. (laughing) We've been doing

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.920
a lot of stuff that you can do in Australia,
like bowling and shopping and going to the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.449
movies. Except you guys give free refills.
Free refills! I kid you not. That is what

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.960
you love about America? I'm not joking. We
buy a coke at...at a restaurant for 5 bucks

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.299
and it's like that big. You guys get it, it's
this big for two dollars and its free refills

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.520
so I am just chugging away. So let's talk
about the band. So tell me a little bit about

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.320
how the band was formed. Uh, the band started
basically Andrew and I started the band. We're

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.979
the brothers, so Andrew and I started the
band. We started doing things on YouTube.

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.979
We started getting a few fans here and there
and like, I remember ringing each-other and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.759
going we like we got 100 views. Wow! 100 views was freaking us out. And that would go to

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.640
like 1000 views and then 1000 went to 100,000
views and then to a million views.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.310
We saw some of your videos on Australian Idol.
Oh boy. (laughing) So tell us about that experience.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.179
When I was 16, I auditioned for Australian
Idol. (Singing) Waiting on the world to change.

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.829
Very very good. I was the youngest top 10
finalist in the world. That was insane and

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.210
it set up a lot of things for me after that.
And is that how you found him? Uh, no. We

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.799
found him like two years after. He came to
our studio to come work at our studio one

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.799
day and then it was kind of just like fate.
Yea, we just clicked like vegemite and toast.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.840
(laughing) Tom normally sleeps with 4 teddies,
but for this trip only 2 made it, Puffy and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.670
Peanut. And there is only...the most important
one is Puffy. Tom talks to Puffy. They have

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.140
regular conversations about the day. Now Puffy
would obviously drown if you put it in the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.140
washing machine, so Tom puts a snorkel
and straw for Puffy to breath. Friday is the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.910
premiere of Puffy's Twitter. You've heard
of Instagram, right? Have you heard of that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.530
thing? Oh yes. It's this new. It's this thing
for selfies. Just for selfies. We hear you

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.700
are the ultimate selfie-er. He is a selfie
king. Selfie King! So besides selfies, there

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.010
is another thing that a lot of people do on
Instagram called sunsets. I think you guys

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.060
may be the sunset experts. I need you to give
me your best tip for taking an Instagram sunset.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.960
There is literally like a 15 minute window
for the perfect sunset if you are down at

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.150
the beach. I think a cool sunset shot needs
a silhouette of some sort in there. Are you

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.760
going to put some filters on there, or no
filters? Ooo! X- pro? No. You see the problem

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.650
is if you can get that perfect sunset then
what do you need a filter for? You can hashtag

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.280
no filter. How cool is that? Hash-tagging
no filter! So our friends over at M want to

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.170
know, if each of you could collab with a female
artist, who would it be? I'm going to guess

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.260
the boys answer. One of them are going to
say Demi Lovato. Yeah. I am going to say Katy

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.420
Perry. I am really liking Ariana Grande at
the moment. We love your single, Back in Time,

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.420
so we want to play a little game in honor
of it. Okay, ready? Were you hiding that behind

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.550
you the whole time? Yeah, I was. Surprise!
So if you could go back in time to any decade...we'll

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.940
start easy...what would it be? I would go
back to the 2000s. The 2000s? Because I would

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.080
never want to live without technology. See,
I want to say the 90s because I'm 90s too

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:04.080
so I had a good decent spell in the 90s. When
I think back to the 90s I think of Power Rangers,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.070
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Back Street
Boys, N'Sync. I'd have to go back to the 60s

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:16.910
with Austin Powers. Nice! Yeah, you...that
hair would fit right in. What about a famous

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.380
historic event? Like if you could go back
in history to any event. I'd say when the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:28.120
lightbulb was first created. Nice! You love
technology. He was doing engineering before

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.900
the band. Tom, what about you? The invention
of the wheel. The wheel? So the invention

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.210
a thing rolling on the ground? (laughing)
The wheel. I'd go back to the Rolling Stones,

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.720
maybe when they played somewhere massive.
Okay, so you are going to perform for us today.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.350
Yes. Yeah. We can. What are we going to hear?
We are going to an a cappella of our song

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.980
Back in Time. And now for another Sweet Spotlight
with their single Back in Time, At Sunset.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.980
(Singing) Now we're running back in time.
My heart still beats at the speed of light,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.260
cause I've been searching through my mind
to find a map that'll take me back in time.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.180
Well that was amazing guys. Thank you so much
for stopping by Sweety High. Thank you so

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.860
