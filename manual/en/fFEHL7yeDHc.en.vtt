00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:01.974
Hello!

00:00:01.974 --> 00:00:05.410
Today you join me back in the Cheshire town of Wilmslow

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.454
and we're going to see the Carrs,

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:09.590
a park very close to the town centre.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.723
Let's see what we can see!

00:00:13.723 --> 00:00:16.834
We start off here at the Remembrance Garden.

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.646
These two memorials

00:00:18.646 --> 00:00:21.246
were erected to commemorate those who fell

00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:23.661
during the two World Wars.

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:25.240
The 1st World War at the back,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.491
and the 2nd World War here at the front.

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:32.717
Tragically, the same family name recurs several times

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:38.545
for instance, the Massey family lost six members.

00:00:38.545 --> 00:00:40.565
Overlooking the Remembrance Garden we have

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:43.630
St. Bartholomew's Parish Church.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.349
The church as it stands today

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:47.253
was built in the 16th century

00:00:47.253 --> 00:00:50.968
some time between about 1510 and 1530.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.058
Parts of the church are much older

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:55.658
and in fact the crypt

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:57.841
dates from about 1300.

00:00:57.841 --> 00:01:00.070
There is evidence that there was a church here

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.528
as early as about 1250.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.576
Coming down the road we enter the Carrs park itself.

00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:20.480
This stone archway commemorates

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.106
when Henry Boddington

00:01:22.106 --> 00:01:23.731
of Boddington's Brewery fame

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:26.332
donated land here at the Carrs

00:01:26.332 --> 00:01:31.580
to the town of Wilmslow in 1925.

00:01:42.493 --> 00:01:46.210
The Carrs follows the River Bollin very closely.

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:49.370
This weir here is probably on the site of an old silk mill

00:01:49.366 --> 00:01:54.430
and there were several mills on this stretch of water.

00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:42.170
This bridge here was built in 2011

00:02:42.168 --> 00:02:44.540
and it replaced an earlier one which had started to succumb

00:02:44.537 --> 00:02:47.650
to the bank being eroded on the far side.

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:49.460
It leads to a part of the Carrs which were purchased

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.850
later in about 1935.

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.840
The total area of the part is about 70 acres.

00:03:14.397 --> 00:03:15.790
Well, if you come up on this high path

00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:18.020
I would definitely recommend bringing your boots!

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.710
It's quite muddy!

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.560
Well, after a little bit of a walk

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:28.400
instead of these really tall trees

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.280
which populate most of the woodland

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.480
we come to this little copse of yew trees.

00:03:33.484 --> 00:03:35.570
Now there's something actually inside there

00:03:35.574 --> 00:03:38.180
that very few locals even know exists

00:03:38.175 --> 00:03:43.180
and it's the remains of St. Olaf's Chapel.

00:03:46.395 --> 00:03:49.600
The chapel was built in the latter half of the 19th century

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.040
for the Boddington family

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:54.060
who lived at nearby Pownall Hall.

00:03:54.057 --> 00:03:57.680
It's fallen into neglect, disrepair and vandalism

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.210
and only the bottom two courses of stones remains.

00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:11.940
Hold on, what's this?

00:04:11.937 --> 00:04:15.190
Well it turns out it's a geocache.

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:17.560
If you don't know what one of these is

00:04:17.556 --> 00:04:21.690
see www.geocaching.com.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:44.630
Just a few yards away, we come to this

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.350
memorial stone here

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:49.880
and this magnificent oak tree behind me.

00:04:49.878 --> 00:04:53.590
It's said that the oak tree was planted as an acorn

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:57.730
in the first cut of soil from the Manchester Ship Canal.

00:04:57.726 --> 00:04:59.300
Henry Boddington was a director

00:04:59.305 --> 00:05:00.980
of the Manchester Ship Canal Company

00:05:00.977 --> 00:05:05.250
when the construction first started in the 1880s.

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:39.940
Well, that's it from the Carrs for this week

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.170
but if you carry on further you can get to

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.000
Quarry Bank Mill and Styal Country Park.

00:05:45.002 --> 00:05:46.670
If you want to see a video of

00:05:46.674 --> 00:05:48.480
a walk through Styal Country Park

00:05:48.485 --> 00:05:49.510
just click on the link

00:05:49.507 --> 00:05:54.150
in the top right hand corner of the screen, just there.

00:05:54.151 --> 00:05:56.660
Well, hopefully see you again soon!
