00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.330
- WE WANT TO EVALUATE
THE TWO GIVEN LOGARITHMS

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.270
WITHOUT THE USE OF A CALCULATOR.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:10.480
WE HAVE LOG BASE 3 OF 81
AND LOG BASE 2 OF 32.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.870
TO EVALUATE THESE WE'RE GOING
TO SET THEM EQUAL TO A VARIABLE,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.270
LET'S SAY X,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.090
THEN WE'LL WRITE THIS
AS AN EXPONENTIAL EQUATION

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.060
TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF X.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.780
SO TO WRITE THIS LOG EQUATION
AS AN EXPONENTIAL EQUATION

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.180
WE CAN USE OUR NOTES BELOW
WHERE B IS THE BASE,

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.720
"A" IS THE EXPONENT,
AND N IS THE NUMBER.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.390
ANOTHER NICE WAY TO REMEMBER
THIS IS TO START WITH THE BASE,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.450
WORK AROUND THE EQUAL SIGN TO
FORM THE EXPONENTIAL EQUATION.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.000
SO HERE WE HAVE 3 RAISED TO
THE POWER OF X MUST EQUAL 81.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.630
SO 3 TO THE POWER OF X
MUST EQUAL 81

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.180
AND NOW WE'LL SOLVE FOR X.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.840
WE CAN DO THIS
WITHOUT THE USE OF A CALCULATOR

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.660
BECAUSE WE CAN WRITE 81
AS 3 RAISED TO A POWER.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:08.570
81 = 9 x 9 AND 9 = 3 x 3,
SO 81 = 3 TO THE 4th.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.690
SO NOW WE HAVE 3 TO THE X
= 3 TO THE 4th.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.480
SO THESE TWO ARE EQUAL
AND THE BASES ARE THE SAME,

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.480
AND THEREFORE THE EXPONENTS
MUST BE EQUAL

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.510
MEANING X MUST EQUAL 4.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:36.420
WELL IF X = 4
THEN LOG BASE 3 OF 81 MUST = 4.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.450
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT A SECOND EXAMPLE.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.330
WE'LL SET THIS EQUAL
TO A VARIABLE LET'S SAY Y.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.510
WRITE THIS AS AN EXPONENTIAL
EQUATION.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.090
SO 2 IS THE BASE, Y IS THE
EXPONENT AND THE NUMBER IS 32.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.480
SO 2 TO THE POWER OF Y
MUST EQUAL 32.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.300
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT 32.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.630
32 IS EQUAL TO 2 x 16,
16 IS EQUAL TO 4 x 4,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.630
4 IS EQUAL 2 x 2.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.510
SO WE HAVE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 FACTORS
OF 2 SO 32 IS 2 TO THE 5th.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.090
SO 2 TO THE POWER OF Y
EQUALS 2 TO THE 5th.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.540
AND AGAIN, THESE ARE EQUAL.
THE BASES ARE THE SAME.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.570
SO THE EXPONENTS MUST BE EQUAL
AND THEREFORE Y IS = TO 5.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.030
WHICH MEANS OUR LOGARITHM
IS = TO 5.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:38.120
SO WE HAVE LOG BASE 2 OF 32 = 5.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.180
NEXT, WE'LL TAKE A LOOK
AT TWO EXAMPLES

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.870
WHEN THE NUMBER PART
OF THE LOGARITHM IS A FRACTION.
