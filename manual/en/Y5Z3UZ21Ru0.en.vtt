00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.820
Hi, I'm Tim Coombs, co-pastor of Trinity Presbyterian
Church in Scotia, NY and a member of the network

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.900
of biblical storytellers.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:18.970
To learn more about its mission, go to nbsint.org.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.850
As we begin the story of Adam and Eve, it's
important to remember that stories project

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:33.080
worlds, create roads, expectations, ways of
seeing the worlds that linger with us, and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.239
that's important for understanding what's
going on in Adam and Eve.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:44.950
The Jewish people lived in exile in Babylon
for a long time, and so they heard Babylon

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.059
in creation stories that went on for a week
at their new year's festival.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.140
And in that story Merodach the male warrior
kills Tiamat, the female dragon, splits her

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.530
open and that's how creation occurs.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.910
And imagine a little Jewish boy seeing this
and saying, ""I want to be like Merodach.""

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:15.790
And so a counter story was formed over perhaps
an old story modified in which God creates

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.370
Adam, Adam the Earth.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.900
His name you could say means ""mud guy,""
and he has no partner.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.900
None of the creation is a fit friend for him.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.870
And so God calls his sleep to come upon Adam
and out of his side God creates Eve, the mother

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.680
of all living.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.820
And then God puts them in the perfect garden
of Eden and says, ""You can eat anything you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.670
want, just not from the tree of knowledge
of good and evil.""

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.160
And so life begins for Adam and Eve.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.100
But then the Serpent comes and tempts Eve
saying, ""God said don't eat from any of the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.100
trees.""

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.310
She said ,""No, no, no, God said we can eat
any tree, just not from the tree of knowledge

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.800
because if we do, we will die.""

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.520
Serpent says , ""No, no you won't die, but
you will become like God.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.160
"" And since Eve long for that knowledge,
and the tree looked good.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.500
She took it and ate, so did Adam.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.080
God found out, and they are punished.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.280
They are banished from the garden, never to
return.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.629
And so that is the creation story of Adam
and Eve which is found in Genesis 2.
