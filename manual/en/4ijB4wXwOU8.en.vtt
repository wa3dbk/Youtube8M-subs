00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.080
What's up yo?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.890
This is Kid Glyde.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.890
I'm here to teach you guys some breaking moves.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.100
For this one, I'm going to show you some basics.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.000
Well actually, what a beginner should know.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Straight up.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
All right?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.560
Beginners should know, of course, the four
elements of breaking.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.910
The four basic elements.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.410
There's more elements, but we'll go into that
later.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.690
So anyways, we got top rock; we got the footwork,
freezes and power moves, the eye candy of

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.690
the whole dance.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.800
All right.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.300
With top rock, you should have at least three
steps.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.530
Three steps, Indian step, cross step and at
least a side step.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.320
The three and you can do the back step.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.540
Back step's easy.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.899
Footwork, six step, two step, three step.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.520
It's very important to have the six step.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.750
Kick outs, step outs.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.940
You should have all that in my first series.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.940
Know what I'm saying?

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:04.940
Know what I'm saying?

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.940
Know what I'm saying?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.659
Power moves, first work on freezes to help
you get the pop, you know, the strength to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.770
get the power moves such as table top, the
baby, reverse baby.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.400
Then for swipes, I would say let's work on
elevated chair.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.770
Elevated chair would look like this.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.770
All right.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.100
That will help you with your swipes and you'll
be good.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.060
That's what a beginner should know, as a beginner.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.751
So, top rock, you've got the Indian step and
then, the reverse to that, you got the back

00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:40.230
step.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.990
Then, you've got the side step.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.200
Three basic top rock moves.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:57.280
A little bit more advanced, but still beginner,
is the cross step.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280
Know what I'm saying?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.650
Then you've got the footwork: step outs.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.000
A little faster.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.230
Switch hands.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.880
You got the kick outs.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:11.920
Step.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.040
Kick out, son.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.840
And you've got the six step, which I showed
you all previously.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.480
One, two, three, four, five, six.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.129
One, two, three, four, five, six.
