00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.210
Nordic skiers from Montana State
University and the Bozeman community

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.550
have the opportunity to participate in
advanced performance tests, thanks to a

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:18.810
new oversize treadmill in MSU's
Movement Science/Human Performance Lab.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.529
We're doing our annual fitness testing
of the MSU nordic ski team.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.999
We had a large treadmill in the lab
previously but it just broke down this

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:29.589
last spring

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.730
and with that problem came the
opportunity of replacing it with an even

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.920
bigger treadmill.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.120
So this new treadmill has belt size
eight feet wide by ten feet long.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.520
It has a maximum speed of twenty five miles
an hour will go up to forty percent grade.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.330
And the size of the belt is necessary for

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.330
nordic skiers to actually roller ski
in a skate style during a treadmill test.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.320
My name is Tyler Reinking and I'm
from Silverthorn, Colorado.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.200
It was a new experience for sure. Roller
skating on the treadmill in itself is an

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.110
interesting

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.760
thing to do and experience.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.060
It's similar to roller skiing on the road
but there's a little bit,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.210
just the quality of when you plant your poles
on the rubber surface it responds differently.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.380
I was doing a Bo2 Max Test,
and that measures

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.790
how much the volume of oxygen that
you can consume and it finds the maximum

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.240
amount at you're peak intensity level. Primarily 
what it does is it allows the head ski coach

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.390
objective information,

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.319
that can be used as a comparison

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:40.959
between skiers year-to-year. But more
importantly its used

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:45.479
to look at individual skiers progress and
fitness over the years as they're here

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.640
at MSU. So if I come in
and do this again next year,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.890
it's really helpful to see

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.960
where I am, where I was.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.520
It can also served as a means of
tracking how well someone is recovering,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.090
say from injury

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.750
or sickness.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.290
The testing also benefits students in the
Human Performance Program.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.209
You know that's how this testing
actually started is needing an annual

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.389
venue for testing

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.659
that wasn't  a part of a research study but
was is the same form a testing year

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.379
after year.

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:22.749
And was a type of testing that was commonly
talked about in classes and provides a

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.129
lot of different hands-on types of
testing.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.639
This testing actually

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.510
is a,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.269
I consider it a mandatory part of being 
in our graduate program in exercise

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.099
physiology, to get the students familiar

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.419
with working with athletes,

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.850
different types testing scenarios

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.129
and under stressful conditions.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:50.129
Members of the MSU team and the team's assistant coach were
on hand to cheer on their teammates during the testing.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.110
The one thing that always amazes me with this
testing is just how much the MSU nordic skiers 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.230
enjoy it,

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.449
they almost look forward to it,

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:02.789
and how competitive they are at it

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.709
We've chosen to 
serve the MSU skiers

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:07.530
as

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.169
an educational setting for my students

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:13.019
for them and to benefit
the MSU skiers themselves.
