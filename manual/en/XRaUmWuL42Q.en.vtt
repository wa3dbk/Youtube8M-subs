00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.540
HELLO PEOPLE FROM THE NEW GENERATION!

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.400
This time, we´ll show you how to disassemble the front part of a stereo in a Dodge Caravan

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.040
The procedure will be very simple

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.840
The only thing you´ll do is to open the glass holder

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.440
And this piece you can see in here

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.960
This plastic piece. Pull it out from the left side

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.400
towards you; as you can see I´m doing it

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.280
you can do it either with your hands or with a screwdriver

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.700
I suggest you to do it with your hands so you won´t scratch it

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.920
After we removed this piece, we´ll find two screws

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.800
holding the lower side of the panel

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
let´s remove them both

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.300
After we´ve removed the screws; We´re going to pull the boardl towards us

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.120
holding it from the bottom side of the board

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.900
In this way

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.360
It´s a bit tight

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.180
But when you do it; you need to be very careful

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.040
so you won´t break it

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.160
Once we have popped the board out; We´ll need to unplug all the harnesses it has at the back

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:41.540
First remove the locks which are in red so you can remove the  harnesses

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
Do it carefully

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.700
After you  take out the lock you can remove the harness

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.700
We´ll do the same with this one

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.100
and unplug it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.200
As you can see, I didn´t break any of the pieces and neither scratched anythig on the board

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.320
And now, we´ll find four screws which are holding the stereo

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.840
Remove them all four screws

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.280
To be able to remove the stereo

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.080
Unplug the harnesses it has at the back

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.320
And you´ll have your stereo disassembled

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780
Well, that´s it. We hope we´ve helped you
