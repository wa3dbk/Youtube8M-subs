Hi my name is Karl James owner of Creolesoul
Catering located in Round Rock, Texas and

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:14.070
on behalf of Expert Village I'm here to show
you a creole shrimp crab salad. Now let's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.000
start building our dressing for our creole
shrimp crab salad we're going to start off

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.430
with a little mayo what we're using is some
sandwich bread that'll be the base for this,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:47.780
like I said now we're at the point we're going
to start building layers. So we're starting

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:56.539
with the base for our dressing which is our
sandwich bread and then we're going to add

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:17.250
some sour cream to that we're going to add
a shot of Worcestershire and then we're going

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:28.530
to add the juice from a lemon cut that in
half. I do it over my hand like this to catch

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:35.880
the seeds cause you don't want any seeds to
go in there, so we'll juice both halves of

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:52.320
this lemon seeds, our second half if you want
to save some of that lemon taste take some

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.460
of the zest and you can add some of later
if you like. But I think we got some real

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.549
juicy lemons here and that should be enough.
