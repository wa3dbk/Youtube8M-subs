00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.500 position:95%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the world of 3D printing plastic is a major

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670 position:98%
player. Here at Virginia Tech, they've even built a 3D printing

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.770 position:91%
vending machine. Students can order up a part for a design

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.170 position:89%
project and out pops the finished product. Engineers call

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.800
it additive manufacturing.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 position:91%
CHRIS WILLIAMS: In additive manufacturing, we actually are

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.300 position:77%
adding material to create the shape that we want,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.800 position:97%
layer-by-layer. One layer at a time, starting from the bottom,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.630
and working our way to the top.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.630 position:95%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, what will it take to move technology like

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.470 position:88%
this into the manufacturing big time? Move over plastic.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.370 position:89%
It's time to print something, well, a lot harder - metal.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.530 position:89%
CHRIS WILLIAMS: What we're doing that's different is that

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.370 position:94%
we're printing copper. It's a really tricky metal to create.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.530 position:83%
MILES O'BRIEN: With support from the National Science

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.670 position:95%
Foundation, mechanical engineer Chris Williams and a team are

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.800 position:86%
developing a low cost, energy efficient way to 3D print

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.970 position:97%
complex copper parts. Copper is an excellent conductor of heat

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.030 position:80%
and electricity, and is widely used in electronics.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.370 position:89%
Traditionally, manufacturers start with a block of copper

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.830 position:75%
and machine it down to form to the desired part.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.230 position:95%
Additive manufacturing does the opposite - laying down copper

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.370 position:94%
to build up a precision shape. The process starts with a jar

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.630
of copper powder.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.270 position:69%
YUN BAI: So, we're jetting glue into powder.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.870 position:94%
MILES O'BRIEN: This printer works like a traditional ink jet

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.670 position:98%
printer, but instead of printing ink onto paper, it prints glue

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.770
into the copper powder.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 position:91%
CHRIS WILLIAMS: We're working with a process called binder

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.630 position:89%
jetting. In that process, you're using an ink jet head to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.800 position:95%
actually selectively jet glue into a bed of powder, one layer

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.600 position:94%
at a time. Once the part is created in that fashion, we then

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.200 position:89%
take it to a furnace to then sinter or fuse the particles

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.930 position:97%
together to make the metal part. So as a result, we're sort of

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.900 position:92%
separating the creation of the product from the heat that's

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.200
required to make a dense product.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.670 position:84%
MILES O'BRIEN: But is an additive manufactured part as

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.700 position:91%
good as a machined one? Not yet. The printed part contains

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.330 position:94%
tiny pockets of air that can reduce performance. Williams is

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.130 position:92%
looking to add powdered copper nanoparticles to the glue to

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.330
fill in those tiny spaces and gaps.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.170 position:92%
CHRIS WILLIAMS: Which would, we hope, improve its sintering

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.070 position:66%
performance and its mechanical performance

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.270
and its electric conductivity.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.130 position:92%
MILES O'BRIEN: Williams says this process will be ready for

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.300
widespread use within five years.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.200 position:89%
CHRIS WILLIAMS: We hope that we'll be able to share these

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.700 position:89%
results, and enable engineers and designers to design new

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.870 position:75%
copper products for energy applications, thermal

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.770 position:84%
applications, structural applications with any kind of

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.970
complexity that you can imagine.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.970 position:89%
MILES O'BRIEN: Next-generation manufacturing, printing up

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.430 position:98%
everything from solar panels to jet engine parts. The sky's the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.600 position:80%
limit to what might one day roll off these presses.
