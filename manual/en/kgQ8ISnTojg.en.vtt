00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:41.194
I'm interested in sort of the body

00:00:41.194 --> 00:00:43.093
becoming a little bit more fantastical

00:00:43.093 --> 00:00:48.173
how do I create a scene or I make my body feel like, seem like it's weightless

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.040
So it's a flat surface that still projects depth

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.160
and time and three dimensions, that's just really cool

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.620
I don't even have a question

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.060
(laughter)

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.100
Tell me your relation to pain

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.060
and I will tell you who you are

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.420
I am looking at trees

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.100
They may be one of the things I will miss most from this earth

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.200
If you feel yourself getting into a rut with improvisation, how do you break out of that?

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.300
Do you guys have like a list of things?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.660
(laughter)

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.140
Our relationships with another

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.260
personally I think inform our choices in improvisation

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.020
as much as the music itself

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.200
I learned a lot as a young composer by watching choreographers work

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.780
And your sweater's really fly by the way

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.560
Oh thank you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640
(laughter)

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.260
This is my music

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.620
Good

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.680
As people move through the space they follow the lines, kind of

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.980
and as they move through the lines they're caught on camera

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.120
from an aerial perspective those bodies look like they're notes on the staff

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.600
It was great!

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.020
(laughter)

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.780
Just keep playing it and do your thing

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:23.473
Like this?

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.660
Yeah but a little slow, and very loud

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.040
Yes, exactly!

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.760
(chanting)

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.120
Ahhhhhhh!!!

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.960
That's it, exactly!

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.880
Yeah

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.600
(applause)

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.120
(applause)

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.280
(applause and cheering)

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.360
(applause continues)
