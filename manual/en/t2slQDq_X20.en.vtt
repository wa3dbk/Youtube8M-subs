00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:13.163
Hi there H2O Fans! Today we’re doing a TAG 
 and the topic is, guess what, mermaids!

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:18.875
We thought this might be something cool and different. 
 So let’s get started with the first question!

00:00:18.962 --> 00:00:23.332
1st question: Have you ever dreamed of being a mermaid?

00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:32.398
Yes! When I was younger I thought it was really cool that 
 in H2O you could be human as well as a mermaid.

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:36.118
So I kind of dreamed of it for myself.

00:00:36.118 --> 00:00:40.150
2nd question: Have you ever tried to become a mermaid?

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.944
Actually this would not be possible as I don’t have 
 a moon lake in front of my doorstep ;-)

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:56.101
But I have imagined what it would be like if I 
 went outside, it started raining and I'd become a mermaid.

00:00:56.101 --> 00:01:02.739
I guess it would be difficult if you were out with 
 your friends and suddenly *oops* you’re a mermaid! 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.828
Maybe that’s why they shot H2O in Australia where 
 it’s less rainy than here in Germany.

00:01:07.828 --> 00:01:14.200
3rd question: The little marmaid, H2O, Mako or 
 Ocean Girl - which is you favorite?

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.950
I had not heard of Ocean Girl before, so I don’t know 
 the series and can’t tell whether or not it’s my favorite.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.848
All the other three are definitly very good. 
 But I guess my favorite is Mako.

00:01:28.848 --> 00:01:35.310
4th question: Are you a waternixie? So do you like swimming?

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.810
I don’t like swimming that much. But I am mad about diving!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.501
When I was younger I never went to the pool without my diving goggles!

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:58.260
5th question: Can you swim like a mermaid or 
 have you ever swum with a monofin?

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:11.550
I don’t know if I can swim like a mermaid but in 
 the water my friends and I try to move like one.

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:28.630
I don’t know if it really looks like that. But it’s a 
 lot of fun and I can really recommend it to you!

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:33.300
6th question: Do you like dolphins?

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:40.800
Yes! I like them and I think they’re absolutely adorable. I 
 can’t tell why, they just look so cute. 

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:45.610
And I would really like to swim with dolphins some day!

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:52.490
7th question: What is you favorite beach activity?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.989
I prefer sun bathing or reading a book.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:10.250
And I can sleep very well on the beach with 
 the warm sunshine and the sound of the waves.

00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:20.780
And when I was younger my brother and I 
 used to dig deep holes on the beach.

00:03:20.784 --> 00:03:30.780
So it's really hard to tell what I like the 
 most. But I think sun bathing is my favorite.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.217
8th question:

00:03:35.217 --> 00:03:42.780
Who is more similar to you: Ariel, Cleo, Rikki, 
 Emma, Bella or Mako's Lyla, Nixie or Sirena?

00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:56.970
I think that’s a very difficult question as every 
 individual person has their very own character.

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:03.909
But I in another video I have already said that I 
 like Rikki very much, her character, her responses, etc.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:12.680
I think that if you asked my friends they would 
 probably say that I am most similar to Rikki.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.850
9th question: Do you believe in magic?

00:04:16.853 --> 00:04:22.998
I don’t know whether magic exists but I don’t really believe in it. 

00:04:22.998 --> 00:04:33.099
I like it in H2O and Mako but it's 
 just a TV show, it’s not real life.

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.610
I like the mermaid's powers but I don’t think that magic really exists.

00:04:37.614 --> 00:04:42.560
10th question: Which superpowers would you like to have?

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:48.980
I think Cleo’s force is the coolest one because she 
 can do whatever she wants with the water.

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:54.060
that’s cooler than just freezing or heating the water.

00:04:54.064 --> 00:05:03.500
And with the moon ring the Mako girls can even do more than that.

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:09.150
But when it comes to water I think Cleo’s 
 power is by far the coolest one.

00:05:09.848 --> 00:05:16.390
Of course we’re tagging all the fans and you can 
 tag all of your friends and spread the TAG!

00:05:16.392 --> 00:05:20.907
And I tag some specific people as well.

00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:40.600
