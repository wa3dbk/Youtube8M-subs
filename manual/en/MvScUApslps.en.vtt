00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.849
The farmer's decision on on what crop they are going to use within a 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.230
growing seasons one of the most
important decisions they're going to make 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.739
in that season and then over the long-term as sort of a cornerstone

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.010
of sustainability.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.770
In today's world we often use crop
rotations as a convenient and ordered way

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.920
to manage our cropping systems.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.090
But Mark Liebig stands on the
shoulders of giants

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.530
as he looks at the long-term effects
of dynamic

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.960
cropping systems.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.360
For our region our research has found that a dynamic cropping system

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.229
is probably the most sustainable. Now
dynamic cropping system what is that?

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.440
Well, it's a it's an approach to crop
sequencing where you're making

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.460
decisions on what to plant every year.
You can imagine that

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.820
within a particular region, there's going to be a certain portfolio

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.160
of crops that you can use.  You have to
take that information and you have to

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.690
have a really detailed

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.119
understanding about the short
term sequencing effects.

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.590
You think about it.  Think about a
fixed rotation

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.380
 where you may have two heavy water
using crops followed by one 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.229
light water using crop.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.270
But that doesn't necessarily take into
consideration

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.069
what the conditions are in terms the
precip.[itation] you're receiving

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:35.830
okay?  You might have the year 
you didn't get

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.560
any snowfall over the course of the winter - it was a it was an open winter and you're

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.539
going into the spring completely dry.

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.300
In a fixed sequence, well, you're going to plant that.....

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.520
whereas for the the dynamic cropping systems approach, 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.509
what we can do is that we can look at our portfolio

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.840
of crops and say what here uses the less water?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.239
and will it fit in with the rotation
based on what we have

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.619
planted the previous year?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.390
And the residue that's there?  What's
the market like for that crop?

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.180
We've done a lot of that short-term
research with some fantastic scientists

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.080
who were here and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.370
retired just recently - looking at the
short term effects and they also set

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.870
experiments in place where we could look at the dynamic cropping system

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.670
over the long term. What we found is that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.069
if we use spring wheat as a keystone crop

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.760
 we find that it's yields are twenty
percent higher

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.050
under a dynamic cropping system versus  a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.300
three-year fixed rotation. And
so there's their production component

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.250
you can look at the soil health and what we see is we see higher

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.269
organic matter content, we see faster
infiltration rates

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.880
under that dynamic cropping system
compared to the fixed

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.290
system and so you're you're seeing soil
health benefits starting to accrue from

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.230
that approach as well and so

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.489
we see that the dynamic cropping
system's a 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.769
 a win-win for producers.  You've got
the

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.430
the  production component, production's higher - higher yields

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.810
and you're also improving the soil resource,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.090
that's the long-term sustainability component.
