**Captions by Project readOn**

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:07.667
Last time,
on "Feed Me Bubbe"...

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.400
Today, we're gonna make
basic chicken soup.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.400
I've already cleaned
my four chicken legs.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.567
Later on, we'll add
our vegetable:

00:00:15.567 --> 00:00:19.100
celery, carrots,
parsnip, dill,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.000
or you can use
parsley, too,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.767
and cube.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:25.367
Put my chicken leg
in this water.

00:00:25.367 --> 00:00:26.933
But nobody wants the fat.

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:28.903
And then take a spoon...

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.867
And see how it is,
all this fat on top?

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:33.500
Just take it off
carefully.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.933
It will all come off,

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.433
and then you'll have
clear chicken soup.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.733
(beeping)

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.333
Well, we've got
a basic chicken soup

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:51.067
all ready to add
everything you like:

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:52.933
kneydlach, luchen.

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:55.400
Next time, we'll show you
all the different ingredients

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.967
to add to our
basic chicken soup.

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:58.833
When I need
some good kosher food,

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.400
there's only three words
I need to know:

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.133
feed, me, bubbe.

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:10.133
(theme music)

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.667
Last time, I left you
with a basic chicken soup

00:01:30.667 --> 00:01:34.333
and four soup
chicken legs.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.800
Today we're going to enhance
our chicken soup

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.233
and do something
with the chicken legs.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:41.700
And let's begin.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.833
One last ingredient
I forgot

00:01:43.833 --> 00:01:46.300
that is important
for chicken soup is the onion.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.400
Let me get it
from my refrigerator.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.867
That's the onion.

00:01:57.902 --> 00:02:00.067
Now, we're going to make
our matzo balls.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:03.333
And I followed the instructions
on the back of the box.

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.067
Basically,
your two eggs,

00:02:06.067 --> 00:02:08.700
two tablespoons
of vegetable oil,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.067
and mix it together.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:11.967
When I do it
for my husband and myself,

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:13.633
I just use
three egg whites

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.933
to not to have
the yolks.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.537
But for a crowd,
I use the egg completely.

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.267
First, give it
a little beat

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:22.267
just to break up
the yolks.

00:02:22.267 --> 00:02:24.433
Add the oil.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:27.133
And gently,
just mix it together.

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.233
And this is the package
of the matzo ball mix.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.533
With a fork,
gradually work it in

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.833
so that it becomes thick.

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:41.233
It takes a few minutes.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:43.767
You have to blend it all
together.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:46.833
In fact, sometimes, you know
what I do to make it easier?

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.433
Take a spoon.

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:52.200
It's much easier
to stir it.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.903
Get it well-blended

00:02:53.903 --> 00:02:56.133
because it has to absorb
the egg mixture

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:57.567
and the oil mixture.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:02:59.820
It's important.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:01.136
Now, this has all mixed

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:03.139
and absorbed
the oil and the egg,

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.266
and I'm gonna put it
in the refrigerator.

00:03:05.266 --> 00:03:08.592
This particular recipe box says
to put in the refrigerator

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:10.302
for 15 minutes.

00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:12.807
Others say leave it
for 15 minutes.

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:14.701
I like to put it
in the refrigerator.

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:17.249
Reason being
that it gets cold,

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:18.951
and then when you put it
in the hot soup,

00:03:18.951 --> 00:03:22.367
I think you get a fluffier
and better matzo ball.

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:24.647
And, after all,
I want my matzo balls

00:03:24.647 --> 00:03:26.134
to be soft and fluffy.

00:03:26.134 --> 00:03:28.633
Not like golf balls.

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.059
Okay, Bubbe, it's now time
for the Yiddish Word of the Day.

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.054
What's today's Yiddish word?

00:03:43.054 --> 00:03:45.922
Today's Yiddish word
is "tam," taste.

00:03:45.922 --> 00:03:48.894
Bubbe's chicken soup
has a good taste.

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:50.920
A gutn tam.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.897
We'll be right back.

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:58.900
(music playing)

00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:12.226
Fifteen minutes is up.

00:04:12.226 --> 00:04:14.419
And now, I'm gonna make
my matzo ball.

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.622
Wet your hands first

00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:18.817
and roll all
the size of walnuts.

00:04:18.817 --> 00:04:22.120
It's up to you if you like
big ones or small ones.

00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:26.639
Sometimes you have to wet
your hands again

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.879
because it dries.

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:30.171
Otherwise,
they won't slide off.

00:04:34.786 --> 00:04:37.291
And I like to make them all
on one plate.

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.449
Then that's easier
to go over to the stove

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.001
and drop it
into the soup.

00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:43.512
And how many it makes?

00:04:43.512 --> 00:04:45.478
Well, sometimes,
I make 10, 12.

00:04:45.478 --> 00:04:46.943
It depends.

00:04:46.943 --> 00:04:49.075
And for a big family,
what I do is

00:04:49.075 --> 00:04:52.726
I buy the extra matzo ball mix,
the extra box.

00:04:52.726 --> 00:04:55.463
And I make it
in 10 cups of water

00:04:55.463 --> 00:04:56.899
according
to the directions.

00:04:56.899 --> 00:04:59.062
So, I have
plenty of matzo balls

00:04:59.062 --> 00:05:01.372
and satisfies everybody,

00:05:01.372 --> 00:05:03.225
and the taste
is wonderful.

00:05:03.225 --> 00:05:04.586
It's delicious.

00:05:04.586 --> 00:05:06.490
Everybody's happy
and satisfied,

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.291
and they think
I'm brilliant.

00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:12.203
Well, every bubbe
is brilliant.

00:05:12.203 --> 00:05:15.169
After all, the experience
of all the years,

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:16.901
that is something.

00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:20.585
Okay, now I'm ready to drop them
into the soup.

00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:24.272
And my soup now
is on a slow boil on low.

00:05:24.272 --> 00:05:26.748
And I'm gonna gently place in
the matzo balls.

00:05:26.748 --> 00:05:29.212
Be careful
because the soup is hot.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.556
It has to cook
for a good 20 minutes

00:05:34.556 --> 00:05:36.175
on a slow boil.

00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:40.126
And then you should have
delicious, fluffy matzo balls.

00:05:41.927 --> 00:05:43.893
I'll put my cover
over the pot.

00:05:46.893 --> 00:05:49.972
I'll put my cover on,
wait 20 minutes,

00:05:49.972 --> 00:05:51.806
and you'll have
delicious matzo balls.

00:05:51.806 --> 00:05:53.990
And then I'll show you
the next step

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.511
as soon
as they're ready.

00:05:56.507 --> 00:05:57.485
Gefilte.

00:05:57.485 --> 00:06:00.253
G-E-F-I-L-T-E.

00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:01.263
Gefilte.

00:06:01.263 --> 00:06:03.398
Excuse me, instead of
old-fashioned waste,

00:06:03.398 --> 00:06:05.472
have it with
an old-fashioned taste.

00:06:05.472 --> 00:06:07.328
It's the taste
that counts.

00:06:07.328 --> 00:06:09.500
Well, bubbe means
grandmother.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.072
It means, means,
means, means grandmother.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:14.191
The best thing
is gefilte fish.

00:06:14.191 --> 00:06:16.037
Okay.

00:06:16.037 --> 00:06:17.878
Follow the easy directions,

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:20.474
and the results
will be gefilte fish.

00:06:20.474 --> 00:06:21.981
Ess gezunterhait!

00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:24.381
Old enough
to make it perfect.

00:06:24.381 --> 00:06:26.198
And we're actually
recording

00:06:26.198 --> 00:06:28.535
behind-the-scenes video
right now,

00:06:28.535 --> 00:06:31.616
of this conversation
that's taking place.

00:06:31.616 --> 00:06:33.467
The 20 minutes were up.

00:06:33.467 --> 00:06:35.950
And now, I took out
my matzo balls

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.817
with my slotted spoon,
put it aside.

00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:39.822
And now...

00:06:39.822 --> 00:06:42.583
Remember, I talked to you
about my basic chicken soup?

00:06:42.583 --> 00:06:44.808
Now, I'm gonna add
my basic chicken soup

00:06:44.808 --> 00:06:46.457
to the soup
from the box.

00:06:46.457 --> 00:06:49.185
And this is where
you're gonna have flavor,

00:06:49.185 --> 00:06:51.257
and it's gonna go
a long way.

00:06:51.257 --> 00:06:54.111
Just take your time,
mix it up.

00:06:58.507 --> 00:07:01.513
I put in my basic soup,
give it a good stir,

00:07:01.513 --> 00:07:03.247
set on medium,

00:07:03.247 --> 00:07:05.713
and let it cook
for about 10, 15 minutes

00:07:05.713 --> 00:07:08.879
until it gets good and hot,
and the flavors blend.

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:11.835
And there you have it,
chicken soup for a crowd.

00:07:15.712 --> 00:07:18.573
And here is the soup
for a crowd.

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:21.544
And my matzo balls,

00:07:21.544 --> 00:07:23.655
my luchen and my rice.

00:07:23.655 --> 00:07:25.730
Oy, you know
what I forgot?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.322
I forgot to cook,
to show what I'm gonna do

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:29.564
with the soup chicken.

00:07:29.564 --> 00:07:31.215
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:33.560
Next episode,
we'll do the soup chicken.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.582
Ess gezunterhait!

00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:35.689
Enjoy.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:37.403
And see you next time.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:45.090
(music playing)

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:10.313
