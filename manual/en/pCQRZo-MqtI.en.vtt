Hi, I'm Amelia, and I'm going to talk to you
about how to choose a hairstyle. First of

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.580
all, one thing to think about is face shape.
Now, a lot of people say that the oval face

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.400
shape is perfect, I disagree. I think it's
more about just certain aspects of your face

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.269
shape. So, if you've got a very angular jaw,
you're not going to want to really draw attention

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.300
to it, you're going to want to soften it.
So, in doing that, that means you're going

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.630
to want a hairstyle that's going to sort of
come down and around your jawline, just to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.740
sort of soften that angularness. If you have
a small forehead, you're not going to want

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.140
to have a lot of heavy bangs, because that's
going to make your face appear smaller. So,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.469
if you do want bangs, what I recommend, is
something more swept to the side, like that.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.110
A lot of women are very particular about their
length, and really there's no such thing as

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.760
your hair being too long, or too short. It's
really just what's going to look best on your

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.410
frame and on your face. I don't think that
older women, or that at a certain age you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.890
should cut all of your hair off. It's really
more about again, just how to frame your face.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:10.220
You can have long hair after fifty, as long
as it's stylish and well kept. One really

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.230
good way to choose a hairstyle, is to look
around your town, and see if you find people

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.650
who've got hair that is similar to yours.
Stop them and ask them who does their hair,

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.890
because it's easy to find a hairstyle that
you like, it's not always easy to find a hairstyle

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.850
that looks good on you, or that works well
with your hair. So, when looking through magazines,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.790
and when looking at people, you want to make
sure that you find something, a model, or

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.400
a person whose got a hair texture that's similar
to yours. So, if you've got naturally curly,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.710
thick hair, you're not going to look good
with a short Bob, unless you're willing to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.490
wear it curly, or to go in and style it every
single day. You also want to take into consideration

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.130
your lifestyle, that's a big, big factor,
and how much time you are willing to put in.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.570
Are you willing to use a round brush? Are
you a style person, do you use a lot of products?

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.450
Are you willing to use a blow dryer? How much
time do you spend on styling your hair? These

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.170
are the questions that you need to answer,
and that need to be asked of you, by your

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.340
designer if you're choosing a new style. So,
what I recommend is when in a new town, or

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.280
looking for a new designer, always make sure
that you find someone whose got hair similar

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.860
to yours. Ask them, look through magazines,
and bring in several pictures of what you

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.340
like, or don't like. Take that to your next
designer, and make sure that you sit down

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.890
and have a very thorough consultation before
you let them do anything else to your hair,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.090
and then you can help, that will help you
choose a great hairstyle for yourself.
