00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.750
Just as a reminder  or maybe this is something
new to those who are new to our channel

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.720
here on YouTube

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.150

reviews are informative to anyone looking for

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.330
quality

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.000
cell phone accessories, they're primarily
created for government agencies and larger

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.960
corporations.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.980
With that in mind, with that said, when
purchasing the cell phone support accessories

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.140
for larger organizations you have
two main concerns

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.020
are: number one will be accessories work?
and number two

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.930
how much will this cost the organization?
The Motorola

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.790
Moto x accessories selected for this
review are ideal for government and

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.800
large corporate organizations

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.550

available at the lowest

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.860
possible price. furthermore if you check us

So again that is DiscountCell.com to learn

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.590
The 3 products that we will be reviewing today are

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.859
for the year Motorola Moto X phone.

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.539
We have here a case by Nite Ize,

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.030
a 3 in 1 charger by Naztech, and then a
universal

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.560
windshield holder by also by Naztech.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.939
To start off with the cell phone pouch

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.909
or the cellphone holster by Nite Ize. This is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.399
not the kind of thing you would wear with a
Suit but definitely is the kind of thing

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:49.960
you're looking for if you're

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.460
with law enforcement, the military,
contractor, construction, or really any

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.729
organization where

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.090
you're on a tight budget but you looking for
durability its to protect your

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.639
phone

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.329
This case is made of a durable nylon
canvas,

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.890
it securely fastens here with velcro.
The Motorola Moto X

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.440
fits right in here and in addition to
you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.870
the holding the phone this particular
case

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.860
has a few extra cargo areas there is one here
that fits credit cards or

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.950
business cards or anything small like that.
There's a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.250
pen holder right here. There's

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.070
an additional cargo port back here and this
little guy on top

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.490
is an elastic band where you can stick
your bluetooth headset

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.410
or you anything else you would like in support of your Motorola Moto X phone.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.640
Next we will be talking about

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.020
the 3 in 1 charger by Naztech.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.280
I think this is a pretty cool charger because
if you're like me you've probably got a

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.630
couple diiferent chargers around your house;
you got one that you use to charge

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.810
to your PC with a USB cable,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.510
You've got a charger to use that you plug into the wall and another

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.950
for when you plug into your car.
So

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.210
this one kinda combines all three into one. Here in the side

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:15.210
you've got you know the the two prongs that
fit your wall adapter into your

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.840
iwall outlet excuse me and thet'll charge
the phone there

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.780
but also, when you're on the road, this closes
up and this case comes off and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.840
and stick it right into your car's
adapter

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.970
so that you can charge on the road as well. With the

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:34.070
NazTch three-in-one charger it also comes
with a

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.930
four foot 9 inch USB cable, micro USB
cables you can plug this into your PC or into

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.850
the charger unit

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.290
and this end into your Motorola Moto X and
you can charge

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.960
really anywhere whether it's from the
wall, your car, or with your PC.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.050
The whole system comes with this little black 
case

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.650
so you can throw everything in there and then toss in your backpack, your briefcase, or

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.770
whatever you carry things around in.
The last thing we'll be talking about

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.090
is the universal windshield mount by
Naztech. I think this is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.270
especially applicable to the 
Motorola Moto X

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.810
because the Moto X is one of the few
phones that can be operated completely

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.739
by Voice.  You don't have to touch it at all to
access your directory or to make a call

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.139
or even send a text with the voice
text option.

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.400
So with a phone like that that you
can use without having to touch it

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.889
or anything like that you want to be
able to access it while you're

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:28.499
driving

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.939
what's the point of having a hands-free
phone if you don;t have a way of

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:36.030
displaying it without using your hands in the car.  So this is by Naztech

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.479
clips right onto your windshield right
here with a suction cup.

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.009
Just close that and that will click right in

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:47.219
and then your phone, open it up like that

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.879
and the Motorola X sits right in there
and then you close it

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:54.939
until you get a snug fit and you're good to go. You've got your phone

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.800
properly displayed.  You can access it using
the voice activation feature we talked

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.349
about

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.249
handsfree. So these are the

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.650
3 Motorola moto accessories that we were
reveiwing today.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.360
Again, all these are available at DiscountCell.com
and we have special pricing

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.499
available for government agencies and
large corporations.
