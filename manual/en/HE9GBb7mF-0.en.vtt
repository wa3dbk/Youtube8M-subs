00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.209
Hello from the Deschutes National Forest,
I'm John Williams with another Accessible

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.150
Adventure in The Pacific Northwest. This time
were at Lava Lands in the Newberry National

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.750
Volcanic Monument, just a few miles south
of Bend on HWY 97. We'll begin with a tour

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.530
of the visitor center, then I'm going to take
you to an accessible trail, for a stroll back

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.000
to a time when volcanoes ruled the landscape
of Central Oregon.

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:50.019
Just look for the Lava Lands sign, and take
the easy access off the freeway.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.440
You'll find this facility very accessible.
From the visitor drop off area.......

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.440
Convenient parking.... paved trails....and a large, accessible
restroom.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.360
Come on, let's head inside the Visitor Center.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.439
The Visitor Center will prepare you for an
adventure that spans thousands of years, when

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:18.430
mountains were being created, and lava was
flowing!

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.650
The Monument and Caldera were named in honor
of Dr. John Newberry, a well known scientist

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.940
that surveyed this area in the latter part
of the 19th century.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.490
Several sites in the area are named after
Chief Paulina, a well known leader of a Northern

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.290
Piute group, that lived in the Central Oregon
area.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.290
Learn about the history, the geology, and
much more, with displays and "hands on" exhibits.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.050
US Forest Service Rangers are on hand to familiarize
us to the Monument with this 3D topographic

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.470
map, and answer questions before heading out
for a close up view of the power of mother

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.979
nature.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.049
I'm anxious to get outside and take a hike
on the lava flow.

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:08.140
First though, a little education with a US
Forest Service interpretive talk.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.190
This is the Trail of The Molten Land. A very
accessible, paved trail, through the lava

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.260
flow and 1/3 of the little over a mile long
trail, is completely accessible.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.489
There are plenty of interpretive signs that
include interesting information about your

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.980
trip through time.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.969
The area we are hiking through hasn't changed
for thousands of years. The Forest Service

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.000
works hard to keep it that way for years to
come.

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.939
As the sign says, we've come to the end of
the accessible portion of the pathway. Now

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:49.779
the trail does continue, and it's paved, but
it's steep and bumpy, I wouldn't recommend

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:50.600
it in a wheelchair.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Back at  the Visitor Center, take
a turn through the Trail of the Whispering

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.569
Pines trail back to the parking lot. This
would be a great place for a picnic, when

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.609
you return from Lava Butte.

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.760
Because there is limited parking on Lava Butte,
you must obtain a 30 minute, parking permit,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.849
available at the Welcome Station.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.889
We've arrived at the top of Lava Butte! The
butte erupted several times, beginning about

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:29.919
7000 years ago. Sending gas-charged material
high into the air and causing hot lava to

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:36.049
flow for miles, above and below the ground.
Several accessible interpretive panels near

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.029
the parking area will help explain the surrounding
features.

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:44.969
The entrance to the fire lookout above is
paved all the way to the top, I found it way

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.609
too steep to negotiate in my wheelchair.

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:54.309
From here, it's easy to see how Lava Butte,
and Newberry Volcano shaped this part of the

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.529
high desert.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:01.939
The Lava Lands Visitor Center is open May
through September, then open on weekends through

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:07.309
mid October. For more detailed information,
you can call their information hot line or

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.900
search for Volcanic Vistas on the Deschutes
National Forest website.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.900
The Newberry National Volcanic Monument is
56,000 acres! So we've just barely scratched

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000
the surface of all the things there are to
do and see here. The friendly folks of the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.669
US Forest Service and their non-profit partners,
Discover Your Forest can help you decide what

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.360
to see next. I'm John Williams and I'll see
you soon for another Accessible Adventure

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.060
in the Pacific Northwest. And be sure to watch
all of our videos right here.
