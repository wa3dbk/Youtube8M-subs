00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.930
So, one of the most nerve-wracking and exciting
times for a new and aspiring actor

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.220
is when you land your first audition

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.299
Once the excitement settles down of getting the role, then the panic starts to set in

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.379
of what do I expect when I get to the audition.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.740
So, we have some tips for you today to help you

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.949
learn a little bit more about what you can expect when you walk into that

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.189
casting directors office. Um, typically

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.179
when you go to an audition, there
will be a casting director there might

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.259
be a casting associate

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.320
Um, there could be a director there could
be a producer. It all depends on the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.489
production. Each casting is different

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.690
If you're going for a big studio audition, most
likely you're only gonna deal

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.110
with the casting director at the first audition.Um, you're going to
walk in

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.199
you will see the casting director sitting
to one or the other side

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.989
with their casting associate you'll hand them your
headshot and resume

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.989
and you will introduce yourself. Here's a little secret. Typically,

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:03.579
casting directors, unless they reach for your hand first, don't want you to shake their hand.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.040
Why? Probably because they're meeting

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.560
a couple hundred people a day and they don't want to swap all those germs.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.680
So, it's best to just introduce yourself

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.439
hand them your headshot. They'll tell you where to stand to prepare for your

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:21.280
audition. They may ask you to slate for the camera,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.770
they not, they may just say, ya know, go ahead when

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.939
you're ready. You're always going to want
to take those first

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.869
thirty-seconds, um, after they let know
that to prep to get into

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.060
character before you give your read.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.430
Um, sometimes a casting director will be ok with one take

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.740
sometime they will, you know, give you a little bit of direction, maybe say lets try it this way

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.939
or, you know, lower your voice a little bit

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.490
or some kind of direction to change up your audition

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.850
then they'll let you read again. Um,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.590
they could do this two or three times. They might just go for one read.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.020
When you're finished, they will thank you for your time

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.250
and you will thank them back and exit the room.
