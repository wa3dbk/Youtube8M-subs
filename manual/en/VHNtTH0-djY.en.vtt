LAUREN GOTTLIEB: Mobbed is back
with an all-new episode

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.000
on Wednesday, February 1.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.510
It follows two feuding brothers,
and I got to sit

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.040
down with one one of them
to get a sneak peek.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.510
Hey, guys, we're gearing
up for an

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.170
all-new episode of Mobbed.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.234
And right here with me is Tim
Jarzabeck, the star of the

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:23.550
next episode.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.830
TIM JARZABECK: Hey,
how's it going?

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:25.530
LAUREN GOTTLIEB: Yeah.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.940
OK, so I have to know--

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.920
it's about you and your brother
feuding, right?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.865
TIM JARZABECK: Yeah, my brother
Nick and I. We haven't

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:32.030
talked in a really long time.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.690
We play in a band.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.790
LAUREN GOTTLIEB:
What'd you do?

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.530
TIM JARZABECK: Well, I kind
of stole his guitar.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.030
I stole a lot of his clothes.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.070
I sold all of it and
went to Las Vegas.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.525
LAUREN GOTTLIEB: Can I
give you a round of

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:43.170
applause for that?

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.533
TIM JARZABECK: No.

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:44.628
I feel really bad about it.

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.090
It's really, really upsetting.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.570
But I'm trying to make
everything better.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.580
LAUREN GOTTLIEB: So how did
you think about going on

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.570
national television, like
Mobbed, to ask for

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.700
forgiveness?

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.570
TIM JARZABECK: Well, I thought,
honestly, the only

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.910
way to really fix things would
be to do something

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.075
tremendous like that.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:03.680
And so yeah, I thought instead
of just calling him and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.814
apologizing for stealing all
his things and ruining our

00:01:06.814 --> 00:01:09.960
band and our family, to take him
on national TV in front of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.180
millions of people and
do it that way.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.610
LAUREN GOTTLIEB: On Mobbed, we
always try to throw in some

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.090
little surprises.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.860
And in this episode, there's
a couple cameos.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.340
TIM JARZABECK: Yeah, we got Art
Alexakis, the lead singer

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.620
of Everclear.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.287
LAUREN GOTTLIEB: That moment
was amazing, by the way.

00:01:24.287 --> 00:01:25.780
You're gonna love it.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.390
TIM JARZABECK: And
Ace Hood, rapper.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.080
And then DJ Ravi who's a really,
really famous drummer.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.940
LAUREN GOTTLIEB: Nice.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.140
