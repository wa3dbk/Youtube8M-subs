Matt Guff for the House Snowboard Shop. This
is a T.Rice C2 BTX Snowboard. That's right,

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:20.050
this is Travis Rice's professional model snowboard.
It is a twin shaped board for your freestyle

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:29.369
all-mountain oriented needs. The C2 Power
Banana profile is pretty cool. In between

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.329
your feet there's reverse camber and underneath
your feet there's actual camber. If you were

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.570
to look down the sidewall you'll notice the
Magne Traction. Magne Traction will keep you

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.729
up on the ice, and keep you floating in the
pow. The double sintered ultra-high molecular

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:54.859
weighted sidewall is going to be strong and
predictable in flex all season long. There's

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:04.500
also internal power transfer rods that run
inside the sidewall as well. Now, what makes

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.619
this board so lively is the horse-powered
core and "glass" that it has in it. There's

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.560
Columbian Gold Timber that runs from tip to
tail, but inserted of having traditional fiberglass

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.670
it actually has basalt, which is volcanic
rock fibers that wrap around the wood core.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.820
The base is a sintered ultra-high molecular
weighted base. It's going to absorb a lot

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.700
of wax. It's going to stay fast all season
long. The top sheet is pretty unique as well.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.899
It has a metal flake finish to it, kind of
shines. But it's made out of bio-plastic beans

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:50.009
and basalt. So this is it right here. This
is the T.Rice C2 BTX Banana board. The graphic

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:58.869
was done by Mike Parillo and you can check
everything out at the-house.com. That's right,

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.570
C2 BTX T.Rice reverse camber on camber technology
together.
