00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
I don't know about you guys

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.860
but my favorite engine sound is

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.000
the 6 cylinder Porsche Boxer engine, I can't help it.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.060
There are few cars in which you can experience that sound better than in this.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.060
The Porsche 911 Speedster.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.640
And I can hear you think, Casper you drove the 911 Speedster already.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640
And that's true.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.640
However, that was the 964 Speedster.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.280
And this is the original!

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.820
At the end of the 80's America was in an economical recession.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.720
So Porsche America went to the headquarters in Germany and told them they needed something special, because they weren't selling anything.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.840
It was just too hard back then.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.880
And in Germany they thought, very nice and all, but we just finished developing the 964.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.200
So why do something special again already!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.560
But then they thought of an old 911 Speedster sketch.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.580
Which was relatively easy to produce

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.220
because they could make it on the chassis of the normal 911 convertible.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.600
Which they heavily adjusted.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.220
The windscreen was lowered and was made detachable.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.780
The windows were also lowered.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.120
The roof is really just for emergencies, and is stashed behind this lid in the back.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.400
Which is also the reason that there are no rear seats

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.400
which is too bad if you have kids or friends that you want to bring along.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.400
But if you have a car like this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.460
you dont really need friends or kids, let's be honest.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.580
The 911 Speedster was meant as an hard-core version of the 911

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.020
and as standard it was less luxurious.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.060
The initial idea was to make it cheaper as well but when they finished developing it and it was ready to be sold

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.160
they made a new calculation and concluded that it was going to be more expensive compared to the normal 911 convertible.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.880
So it became a car focused on the enthusiasts.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.120
So Porsche decided to make it a limited edition as well.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.080
In the end 2104 cars were sold

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.180
Of which about 800 were sold in the United States.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.820
The remainder was spread out all over the globe.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.840
There were some funny things about the Speedster

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.460
for example, it was meant as a car with a normal body.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.900
But if you bought the M503 version of the 911 Speedster

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.420
there was the turbo look option.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.640
Which was wider and had a tougher body.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:51.060
In the end, everyone figured it was a limited edition. so why not fit all the options!

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.140
So almost everyone choose the wide-body turbo look.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.560
In the end only 171 cars with the narrow body were produced!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.640
If you are really looking for a collectors car, that's the one to look for.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.000
Off course, all the Speedsters are very rare with only 2104 cars produced, most of which are already in collector's  hands.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.880
They are hard to find.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.980
This is the 3,2 Litre 6-cylinder Boxer engine.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.800
I love it!

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.740
The 3,2 Litre 6-cylinder engine has 245 horsepower

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.740
and 268 Nm torque.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.460
Top speed is 245 Kilometres/hour

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:50.660
and a sprint to 100 km/h, if you can manage the manual gearbox, should take about 6 seconds.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.280
And with those performance figures Porsche figured it would be nice if you could go on track with it

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.280
and be able to trow it around a bit.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.060
So designer Helmuth Bott took that into account as well.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.320
So for example the windscreen can be taken off and it is quite easy as well, just a few screws.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.160
If you know where they are, but if you do you can race without windscreen!

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.020
I personally would put on a helmet in that case though!

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.380
Because I don't like eating flies very much.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:38.380
I've never seen a car this age, it's from 1989 like all Speedsters it was built in the first half of that year

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.060
and I've never seen a car that age that is in such a good condition, it's as new.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:51.120
The first owner hasn't done 14000 kilometres, but took care of it like it was his own child.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.760
Look at this panel here, with the stitches and leather

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.040
if you told me that the panel came from the factory yesterday, I would believe you.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.800
It's unbelievable, great car!

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.440
Gina Classics got this car from the first owner.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.040
There is a real Blaupunkt cassette deck in this car, period correct as they might say.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.740
And let me just show you some of the cassettes.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.620
You may guess from which country this comes.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.100
Hawaii Johnny

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.040
and Italienische Traummelodie von Orchester Tony Ventura.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.040
I hope I'm pronouncing this right.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.040
What a cover, great right?

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.660
All of this is included!

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.660
Very cool.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.600
If I could afford a 911 Speedster, I would know what to do!
