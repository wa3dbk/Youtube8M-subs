00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:04.460
researchers at Northumbria University in
the UK wanted to see whether or not the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.080
dance moves up men

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.630
trigger certain feelings or emotions
among women

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
especially when it comes to them judging
at the fertility

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.980
other men now this is really interesting
because he used 3d imagery in 3d cameras

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.070
to determine what women like when it
comes to these dance moves

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.600
and I want to give you an example what
they came up with when it comes to dance

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.359
moves that do not attract women let's
take a quick look

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.630
I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.250
how I really love this your day by the
way unfortunately

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.440
that looks like most the dance moves
kabc in a club he doesn't look that bad

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.710
I gotta be honest with you

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.710
keep it looks like you dig in it though
like you feel the music

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.680
and a racist he looks like he's walking
around like a little billion and a fall

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.739
and might have the white man over by
here definitely

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.340
be here really interesting right don't
dance moves signal something in a

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.960
woman's brain that says

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.120
no he is not the kinda guy I'd like to
reproduce with his fertility is a little

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.829
questionable

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.150
I questioning the accuracy legitimacy
credibility and this study

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.280
because sometimes dance moves or or
someone's upset the rhythm

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
is not good and it doesn't that doesn't
mean he can't get it up for duty need to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.390
do

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.750
you know what i mean that damn straight
okay I don't think those things are

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.320
connected

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.700
at all at all could give you an example
with the women

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.700
like why men and women like running my
hand and i cant believe me know

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.200
but notice the huge I read a little more
actually a lot more

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.490
so wildly that signals to women that hey
you know what this guy is good in bed

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.380
are you as you have a good time women
are not interested in straight men

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.470
I didn't know that it so we don't lose
that may take this with a grain of salt

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.619
okay and I do want to tell you guys how
the researchers did it so the youth 3d

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.649
cameras at the film nineteen guys
between the ages 18 and 35

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.600
and they're all dancing the dudes moves
were then turned into animated avatars

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.770
as shown to 35 straight women

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.129
to rate on a scale of one to 10 the
female participants found men who made

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.150
big movements with the neck and trunk

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.560
to the wrist and left shoulder and bass
movements with the right me

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.989
to be the best dancers look it's all
about how animated the guy is right so

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.489
big I just like doing a two-step then he
doesn't he doesn't seem

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.290
bond the woman is a response ok great to
that guy but if he's like

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.879
enemy that a good time the left for the
party you know

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.030
yeah I show

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.200
appraisal I love how specific the word
which I discredits the stories covering

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.580
the

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.360
the left me in the right elbow or
whatever was right and then

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.860
highlighted the like if the swing the
trunk right yeah well that part right

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.170
okay so I'll and at my sure this is the
winning

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.150
formula for getting women it okay

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.459
so but I do understand that is somebody
who's more on a lot

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.519
up my PC more confident rydell girls are
track for women are attracted to

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.640
the confident guy the life of the party
the one who seems the most powerful and

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.269
I think that if a guy is making really

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.720
big motions with his body that he's
confident you get turned on by that

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.890
now what a big push now it could be
really difficult to

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.330
but me determine what those dance moves
were based on that 3d imagery

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.659
so as a result we have brought on um

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.940
bro tip to help demonstrate what the
good but dance moves are in with the bad

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:32.840
dance moves are

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.080
so broad that what we start off with
what women do not find attractive

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.370
prime mover with you

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.030
yes our air go this is what women do not
find attractive

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.540
for you

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.269
that doesn't like the animation funny
and I can see why women do not buy the

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.230
track not it will

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.989
actually know everybody guys think what
kinda maybe it is as well as well as

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:02.769
autonomy

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.720
on now this ought to be good bro tear I
can you please do for us very attractive

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.549
desperate this is

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.310
preview is similar to what I do in
nightclubs to sell of course I got it I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.569
got this you know company

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.930
