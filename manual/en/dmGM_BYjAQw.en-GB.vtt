00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.550
Hi, I'm Liz Hogan. I've been carpooling for
three and a half years now. It's really good

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.290
to have people in the car with you, have a
bit of a you know joking around, laughter

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.300
all the way there and it actually speeds the
trip up, so what might take an hour, seems

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.300
like a ten or twenty minute trip as all you're
doing the whole way is laughing. I decided

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.859
to carpool because it's cheaper, I get to
ride into town with friends or people I've

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.269
gotten to know over the years. The main benefits
of carpooling are cost saving and a bit of

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.510
company in the morning, somebody to talk to.
I decided to carpool because I moved into

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.760
the city recently and I decided to get rid
of my car and I figure that it's an easier

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.760
way to get around. It's cheaper, we get to
take the T2 lane and we get to talk. I think

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.479
the main benefits of carpooling are the time
saving, the cost saving and being able to

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.149
meet new people. For me it is, it's saving
money, not just in the petrol, but in the

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.659
wear and tear of your vehicle. The money I
save from carpooling is around $300 to $400

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.280
a year, which easily can be paid for my tennis
membership. When you're carpooling you need

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.500
some flexibility, just to be able to work
around other peoples schedule and your own.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.030
We're quite flexible and there are not always
five of us, so it ranges from two to five

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.979
during the week, so we can have a packed out
car or we can be nice and comfortable with

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.820
three of us; I'm always in the back as I'm
the skinniest. We've got a roster; we have

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.409
actually diarised it as well into our Outlook
calendars, so you know when it's your week.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.329
We all pretty much work the same core hours,
if someone needs to start a bit early or finish

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:58.810
a little later, then they either bring their
own car or get public transport. The great

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.840
benefits of using the T2, T3 lanes is you
just fly past other traffic, even the buses

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.940
are stuck sometime and you're not. I decided
to carpool because it's great for the environment.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.569
We'll it is environmentally friendly I think,
carpooling because you've got five people

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.140
in one car, opposed to five individuals driving
their own cars clogging up the motorways.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.200
I think carpooling is a great way to meet
and network with people. I've made two or

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.950
three really good friends from carpooling
so far. We have lots of fun carpooling, we're

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.220
an eclectic bunch and there's always something
funny going on. One of our carpoolees is a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.580
non-drinker, so every now and again we stay
in the city, have a drink or two and she drives

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.430
home. One person is always late, I think I'm
the only one that's on time, but that's probably

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.519
because I've got to drop my daughter off in
the morning and she has to be somewhere at

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.409
a certain time. I definitely think more people
should carpool, that would definitely cut

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.920
down on the number of cars in the city. A
lot more people should carpool, there are

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.670
so many people driving by themselves these
days, it seems like a waste. If everyone carpooled

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:03.580
there would be a lot less traffic and it would
be way better. I would definitely recommend

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.209
carpooling to everyone; it's a lot easier
than I thought it was going to be. I think

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.680
a good way for people to find carpooling is
mainly not to be shy, so just text your friends,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.909
like hey man do you want a ride or do you
like want to get together, it's really easy.

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.610
I found my carpooling group through a bunch
of ex workmates who still work just past where

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.180
I work, so it's nice and easy to get into
town. Another good way to get someone for

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.920
carpooling is there's actually a website called
letscarpool, so just go on that and find someone

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.620
to carpool with. I think the best ways of
trying to find a carpool match, are to use

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.629
the letscarpool website or just to find someone
through work, just ask around your office

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.239
if there is anyone who travels the same route
or would keen to split costs. There's lots

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.540
of resources, if you look for it you'll find
it.
