00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:01.883
- [Voiceover] Tired of
your boring drink coasters?

00:00:01.883 --> 00:00:06.050
Well lets learn to make our
own for just a few bucks.

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.026
To pull this one off we are
going to need a cutting board

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:11.966
or scissors, some mod podge
glue, and some ceramic tiles

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.086
and a brush and just a little bit of felt.

00:00:14.086 --> 00:00:15.470
Now if you want a custom design,

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.185
print out a couple colored pictures,

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:19.925
but leave enough room for about
four and a half inches each.

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:22.208
A standard piece of paper
can hold a couple of these.

00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:24.454
I went ahead and put them
all together in PhotoShop.

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:27.026
We're going to be using a
standard 4x4 ceramic tile.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.209
These are cheap and you can get them

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.780
at the hardware store
for about .18 cents each.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.575
Now once you've sent your
design to the printer

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.534
and it comes out, it's time to cut it up.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:36.652
You're going to want to make
a square out of your image

00:00:36.652 --> 00:00:39.883
that's 4 and 1/8 inches long on all sides.

00:00:39.883 --> 00:00:42.043
Make sure your deign is
carefully measured out,

00:00:42.043 --> 00:00:44.086
clip it, and then it's time to go ahead

00:00:44.086 --> 00:00:46.740
and place it onto the tile to
make sure it fits correctly.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.208
Now you are going to
want to keep a little bit

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:50.002
of a white border on the sides.

00:00:50.002 --> 00:00:51.513
Now grab your Mod Podge glue

00:00:51.513 --> 00:00:53.803
and apply a thin coat
directly onto the tile.

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.053
In a pinch you could use Elmer's glue

00:00:56.053 --> 00:00:57.319
but the top layer is not

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:59.157
going to be as pronounced and clean.

00:00:59.157 --> 00:01:00.547
Now at this point it is good to mention

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:02.260
that you don't have to print anything.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.669
You can simply cut logos
or pictures out of magazine

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:07.568
or old book and make your awesome
coasters however you want.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:09.446
Just follow the same process as before.

00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:11.564
Once the image is centered
and secured into place,

00:01:11.564 --> 00:01:13.931
apply the first top-coat to the picture.

00:01:13.931 --> 00:01:16.869
Go slowly and steady here to
avoid bubbles in the paper.

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.951
Make a nice thin and straight layer

00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:20.993
and then give it at
least 10 minutes to dry.

00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:23.116
Now you are going to one to
do this about three times.

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.337
You should have a nice waterproof

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:26.256
and flush looking coaster at this point.

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:27.811
It's time to pad the bottom with felt

00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.201
and finish up the project.

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:30.952
Get your felt out which can be purchased

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.465
at any art store for cheap

00:01:32.465 --> 00:01:34.584
and cut it to the same size as the paper.

00:01:34.584 --> 00:01:36.464
Now apply another thin layer of Mod Podge

00:01:36.464 --> 00:01:37.686
or glue to the bottom,

00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:39.891
and carefully place
the felt into position.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.564
And boom that's it.

00:01:41.564 --> 00:01:43.236
Once this process is complete you can

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.705
let everything dry for about an hour

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.213
and then they're going to be ready to go.

00:01:46.213 --> 00:01:48.014
These things make great gifts for anyone.

00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:49.887
And speaking of gifts, we're giving away

00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:52.175

Hell, I even signed one of them

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.460
