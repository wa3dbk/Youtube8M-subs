00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:08.312
On the northern end of
the Bulgarian Black Sea shore

00:00:11.813 --> 00:00:13.925
there is an impressive cape.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.258
Kaliakra Cape.

00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:17.966
It is a natural and
archaeological reserve.

00:00:18.116 --> 00:00:20.634
One of the reasons for the numerous
legends related to it

00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:24.387
are the vertical cliffs, 70 meters high,
which incite imagination.

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:28.100
They form a natural fortress,
surrounded on all sides by the sea.

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:33.182
In the end of the 14th century
the Dobrudzha principality

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:36.800
lived through its brightest period.

00:00:36.893 --> 00:00:39.061
Its ruler - Dobrotitsa
- created a powerful navy

00:00:39.526 --> 00:00:42.687
and acquired the dominion
upon the entire Black Sea.

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:45.960
A persistent war with Genua was initiated.

00:00:45.692 --> 00:00:47.744
He even interfered in the internal affairs
of the Trapezund Empire.

00:00:47.706 --> 00:00:51.362
Kaliakra became
a capital of his kingdom

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:54.503
in the second half of the 14th century

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:56.481
and lived through an upsurge
typical for the Middle Ages.

00:00:56.658 --> 00:00:59.694
Commerce flourished and money were coined
behind the fortified walls.

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:03.694
Citizens were getting rich,
churches were built.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.970
Its great advantage was
the suitable strategic port.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.799
By the 1402 the Ottoman Empire
had already conquered

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.613
all Bulgarian principalities.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.512
The Byzantium Empire itself
was endangered

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:22.573
and even the entire western world.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.390
The last hope for salvation
sparkled near Kaliakra.

00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:28.071
There the army of tsar
Vladislav the Third - Yagelo

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:30.764
started preparing for a battle.

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:33.428
In the crusade campaign
participated Polish,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:37.483
Hungarian and western knights,
as well as Czech,

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:39.594
Bulgarian, Romanian and
Serbian-Croatian armies.

00:01:40.204 --> 00:01:42.802
Presently those turbulent times
are just a memory,

00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:47.581
and Kaliakra is a tourist attraction.

00:01:47.902 --> 00:01:50.339
The mighty walls of the fortress
can still be seen.

00:01:53.284 --> 00:01:55.621
The small church of the Dobrudzha
despots is also there.

00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:59.596
And the dolphins are also here -
hidden in the depths of the Black Sea.

00:02:00.274 --> 00:02:03.513
The Yaylata reserve is located
in close proximity to Kaliakra.

00:02:04.271 --> 00:02:07.491
It is a dream come true for archaeologists,
speleologists, biologists, botanists.

00:02:08.172 --> 00:02:12.867
On an area of three hundred decares,
hanging over the sea,

00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:15.353
there are three Thracian necropolises
and one hundred and twenty tombs,

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:18.347
more than a hundred residential caves,
dug by ancient builders.

00:02:18.728 --> 00:02:21.809
This cave town was settled as early
as the fifth millennium BC.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.875
The large necropolis had also arisen
around a dug in sanctuary,

00:02:28.551 --> 00:02:31.894
turned to the east
towards the rising sun.

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:34.777
Later monks settled in the caves

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.242
and turned them into a monastery
rock complex,

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.821
typical for the early Christian period.

00:02:46.058 --> 00:02:48.443
Yaylata is a word coming from the Turkic
language and means an alpine grassland.

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:55.991
The name does not give a correct
idea of the generosity,

00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:59.082
nature had had for this place.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.807
Amidst a sea of grass here grow
entire islands of wild rye,

00:03:02.424 --> 00:03:05.960
wild oats, poenys, irises...

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:08.203
Scientists had registered
the incredible 270 animal species

00:03:08.623 --> 00:03:12.583
for such a small place.

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:14.213
Endangered species had found shelter
on its territory -

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:18.875
large and small bustard,
medium cormorant.

00:03:18.906 --> 00:03:21.900
This place is also crossed by Via Pontica â€“

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:24.577
one of the largest air highways
of migrating birds.

00:03:24.626 --> 00:03:28.086
180 bird species nest nearby,

00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:30.918
when they get back to spend the winter in Africa.
