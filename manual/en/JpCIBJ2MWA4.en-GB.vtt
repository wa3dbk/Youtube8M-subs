00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.130
Hi, I'm Celeste. I'm from Malaysia and I'm
currently studying my for A-levels on the

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:05.340
Newton Programme at INTO

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.340
So, this is my bedroom in the INTO accommodation

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.099
The INTO accommodation is really nice.
We get all sorts of facilities here, such as

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:20.849
two kitchens in a corridor

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.500
and a study room

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.989
The thing I really like most about staying
here in INTO is how easy it is, after class

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.000
to go out and knock on a friend's door and
have a chat, or even

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.019
play some music in the study room

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.120
Talking to my friends really helps me take
my mind off the work and stress

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.379
and at the same time makes me feel less homesick

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.379
The University of East Anglia campus is really
beautiful, especially if it's sunny

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.120
and there's lots of things to do besides studying
on the weekends

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000
You can run around the lake

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.000
play sports in the
Sportspark if you're into it

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.500
or you can just come out here and chill out
with your friends

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.390
Being a science student, I have classes
9 to 5 every day

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.890
The lessons are really good because the class
size is small

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.400
maybe just 5 to 10 students in each class

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.000
so you get a lot of personal attention and
if you have any problems it's really easy

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.880
to just raise your hand and to have
the teacher help you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.630
The teachers here on the Newton Programme
are fantastic

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.440
I really like how they are so good at making
the lessons interesting

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.620
and sometimes funny as well

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.000
I really like how they come up with a lot
of creative ways of learning such as

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.450
mind-mapping or presentations

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.000
I find this really helps me to remember things
better

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.990
This is the science lab, where we have most
of our science lessons

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.000
On some days of the week we also do
practical lessons

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.880
The practical sessions we have here are
really interesting

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.320
I especially like the Chemistry ones because
I like to learn by doing

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
and it's really interesting to see all these
chemical reactions

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.979
Also, in Biology we have done quite a number
of dissections

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.880
which was really cool because we don't do
much of that in my high school

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.500
As I want to do Medicine, it's quite good
preparation for me

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.090
Coming here, you'll meet students from all
over the world

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.520
From Vietnam, China, Kuwait

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.000
In my time here, I've learned a lot about
different cultures

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.810
and I've made many new friends

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.630
If you have any problems with your studies
it's always good to talk

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.200
to your personal tutor, who will be assigned
to you, or even your friends

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.810
Just knock on the door and they'll be there

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.940
I think the key is to have a really well-balanced
life and, if you do that

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.850
I think you'll really have a blast during
your two years here
