Hi, this is Matt Senatore on behalf of Expert
Village and today we are going to learn how

00:00:07.372 --> 00:00:12.969
to make my Grandma Josephine’s three-layered
lasagna. Let’s check on the sausage and

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:20.669
see how that is coming. Okay the sausage looks
done so now we are ready to add that to our

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:35.200
lasagna.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.980
So our sausage is cooked very nice so what
we are going to do is cut out sausage in little

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:48.590
slices and then we are going to put it on
top of our, our lasagna. So we are just going

00:00:48.590 --> 00:01:00.810
to cut the sausages in little slices so now
it is going to add a nice little flavor to

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:14.070
our lasagna. I am going to take each piece
of sausage and just put it on top of the lasagna

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:29.249
and it will add a nice little flavor, there
we go. Then we are going to add the rest of

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:40.520
our cheese, spread out the cheese covering
the sausage totally covering the top of the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:52.979
lasagna. It is okay if we put a lot of cheese
on here because to me that is the best part,

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:18.010
spread it evenly, you really don’t want
to see the sauce, you just want to see the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:34.519
cheese. There you go, now I am going to add
some garlic powder and oregano on top, there

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:55.670
is the oregano, and a little garlic powder
and now you are ready to bake.
