00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.470
My interest in collegiate ministry
really sprang out of my own experience

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.930
as a college student. When I was a
freshman in college, I was a young

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.420
Christian, someone that needed a lot of
follow-up and I was really blessed to

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.360
run into The Navigators while at college
the staff couple of my school are Peter

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.460
and Debbie Udall, and over the four years
that I was at school they poured their

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.630
lives out for me and helped me a great
deal to become established in the basics

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.620
of the Christian faith, and one of the
things that Peter impressed upon me as

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.460
he discipled me was that I should pass
on to others what he had passed on to me.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.860
And so, later on as a graduate student
thinking about what kind of career I was

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.570
going to pursue, I thought about what
type of job would give me the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.100
opportunity to have that kind of
ministry in the lives of other students.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.939
It occurred to me that being a college
professor would be a great opportunity

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.490
to meet students and to have that kind
of ministry in their lives. Nav Fusion

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.110
provides an opportunity for The
Navigators to reach out to campuses that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:36.080
are not staff lead. My goal l for our
students is really two-fold. One that they

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.299
would develop a lifelong love
relationship with Jesus Christ and that

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.970
they would find their supreme joy in
knowing Him, and the other part is that

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.790
the overflow of that joy would be to
share it with other people. The key, apart

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.260
from the Spirit of God, the key to
reaching students, is other students. The

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.439
student leaders are very very important
aspect of what happens in our campus. We

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.200
are really blessed to have 15 or so
people on our leadership team, the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.819
majority of those are students, some of
them are recent graduates that have

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.890
stayed in the area and continue to help
us on the campus. Every one of them has

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.180
made a commitment to meet with at least
one other student on a regular basis to

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.060
give them personal time and attention in
establishing that person more in their

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.590
walk and in discipling them.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.300
One of the guys that I meet with
regularly, John is one of our key leaders,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.250
and it's been a pleasure for me to help
him in his walk and get to know him

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.420
better. It's been real easy because there
are a lot of things in our backgrounds

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.300
that are similar. John has an avid
interest in sports. We talk football,

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.970
we're both a little bit competitive when
it comes to ping pong or playing pool,

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.080
racquetball or whatever so we we have a
lot of fun that way, but he has a real

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:12.130
heart to know God also and that's been
really the best part of our relationship.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.769
Dr. John is someone that is incredibly
engulfed in the scriptures and like I

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.989
can see that because you know we'll just
be having conversation and I think I

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.680
could I'm pretty sure that I could just
throw out any topic I wanted to and Dr.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.560
John would have something from God's
Word to give on relation to that topic.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:40.060
John in turn is having a good influence
on several of the other guys on campus,

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.819
he meets with two or three of them and
he's passing on to them a few things

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.970
that he and I have talked about and also
a lot of what he has learned as a team

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.959
leader, at the Green Mountain summer
training program. It's been one of the

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.920
great benefits of being a Nav Fusion
campus, is that our students can get

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:10.220
involved with some of the things that
The Navigators as a larger entity beyond

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.900
our campus can make happen you know we
as a single campus cannot put on a

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.370
summer training program, but it's been
great to be able to send our students to,

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.530
to programs or to regional and national
conferences and overseas missions

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:31.780
opportunities, to be involved as
counselors at Eagle Lake in Colorado,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.789
there they get training beyond what we
can give them here and John's a good

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.070
example of how that kind of equipping
can come back to the campus and then

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:49.330
really be used to spark the ministry
here. Nav Fusion provides an opportunity

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:55.940
for students to catch some of the vision
that The Navigators have held and that

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:01.190
is the vision of knowing Christ and
helping others to know Him, and to do

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.590
that through a ministry of personal
investment, my wife and I are simply

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.310
passing on to our students what others
have passed on to us, and although our

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.480
ministry probably doesn't look exactly
like a staff led campus would look, it

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:27.260
still has the Nav DNA and we have the
same passion that many others in The

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.620
Navigators have, to see students walk
with Christ.
