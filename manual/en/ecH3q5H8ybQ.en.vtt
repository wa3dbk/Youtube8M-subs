00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:03.385
- [Curtis Smith] Welcome to Southwest Yard
&amp; Garden, I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:03.385 --> 00:00:07.209
Today we're with Patricia
Aaron, Extension Home Economist

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:09.685
with Bernalillo County. And
she's going to teach us about

00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:12.454
food preservation,
especially food dehydration,

00:00:12.454 --> 00:00:14.714
which is really important
at this time of the year.

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:16.911
Patricia, what do we need to
know to dehydrate our food?

00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:18.229
- [Patricia Aaron] Well, the first thing
that we're going to do is

00:00:18.229 --> 00:00:19.813
we're gonna wash our hands.

00:00:19.813 --> 00:00:21.017
I'm going to show you
how to wash your hands.

00:00:21.017 --> 00:00:24.471
Any time that you handle food,
always wash your hands before.

00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:27.276
And that will help make a food
safe product for everyone.

00:00:27.276 --> 00:00:28.477
- Is there a special
way to wash your hands?

00:00:28.477 --> 00:00:30.027
- There sure is and I'm
going to show it to you.

00:00:30.027 --> 00:00:30.860
- Well let's learn.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.716
- Okay.

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:34.858
To wash your hands to make
them ready to prepare food,

00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:37.351
you want to first remove
any watch or any rings that

00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.434
you may have and then wet your hands,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.672
lather really well, and
rub your hands together

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:46.900
for 20 seconds.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.688
It's that abrasion that's
going to remove any kind of

00:00:49.688 --> 00:00:52.729
bacteria, microorganisms, or contaminates

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.562
- [Curtis] So I took my watch off,

00:00:53.562 --> 00:00:55.395
how do I know when 20 seconds is up?

00:00:55.395 --> 00:00:56.228
- [Patricia] Oh, you could recite

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:57.061
the alphabet if you'd like.

00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.215
- [Curtis] A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:02.177
- [Patricia] Now you want
to rinse them really good,

00:01:02.177 --> 00:01:03.363
rinse them thoroughly

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:07.530
and dry them on a clean towel
so you don't recontaminate.

00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:21.331
- Well Patricia, our hands
are washed, what next?

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.700
- Well I want to tell you a
little about dehydrating food.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.152
Dehydration is the oldest known way that

00:01:27.152 --> 00:01:28.710
man has preserved food.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.572
It's very economical, here
in New Mexico it's perfect

00:01:31.572 --> 00:01:34.062
because we have our New
Mexico sun that's always

00:01:34.062 --> 00:01:36.879
nice and bright and we have low humidity.

00:01:36.879 --> 00:01:39.838
So you don't really need a
big fancy dryer like this

00:01:39.838 --> 00:01:42.197
- And so you do have a
pretty fancy one here, but

00:01:42.197 --> 00:01:43.996
if you don't have it,
there are ways to do it?

00:01:43.996 --> 00:01:44.829
- There sure is.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.406
You could do it in your
oven and prop the door open

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.423
and you would do that at
the lowest setting on about

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:51.340
150 degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:54.490
Or, you could do it outside,
and if you were doing it

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.383
outside, hand me that screen.

00:01:57.383 --> 00:01:58.216
You'd want to use one of,

00:01:58.216 --> 00:02:00.930
- 150, that sounds like New Mexico to me.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.400
- That's your oven temperature.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.295
You want to be sure that
the screen is a food grade,

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:09.414
safe plastic, or stainless steel.

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.316
You don't want to use a window
screen because sometimes

00:02:11.316 --> 00:02:13.761
those are galvanized metal
and you have an interaction

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:14.753
with the acids in food that

00:02:14.753 --> 00:02:16.673
could cause a type of food poisoning.

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:20.005
What you would do is put the
food on the plastic screening,

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:22.059
set it outdoors, you want
it in the hottest sun.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.405
So in New Mexico it would be

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:25.972
out by nine, and then in by six.

00:02:25.972 --> 00:02:29.345
You would cover it with cheese
cloth to prevent insects from

00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:32.358
landing on it and then
after the food is dry,

00:02:32.358 --> 00:02:36.744
then you want to freeze it
for at least 72 hours for

00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:38.862
three days and that will
kill all the insect eggs

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:40.343
so they don't hatch out.

00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:43.308
- Okay, I see you've got
apples, you said you had

00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:44.589
to use something to keep
them from turning brown,

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:48.207
because I know if I slice an
apple, and am slow to eat it

00:02:48.207 --> 00:02:49.920
it begins to turn brown pretty quickly.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.646
- Right, and that
happens when it oxidizes.

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:55.079
Apples, peaches, apricots,
so what we're going to do

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.415
is make a solution to cover the fruit

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.256
so it doesn't turn dark.

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.111
Try that apple.

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:02.944
You're going to get full.

00:03:02.944 --> 00:03:03.828
- I'm going to get fat
today, I'm gonna enjoy this.

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:05.260
- By the time we finish.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.093
- That's good.

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:06.926
- Isn't that good?

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:08.049
I love dried apples.

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.523
- Yeah, dried apples don't
stick around very long

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:11.828
at my house, the children
really like them.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:14.755
- And you've got, aha, my favorite
of all favorites there.

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:15.625
- Are the apricots.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:16.458
- That's it.

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:17.542
- Now isn't that a beautiful apricot?

00:03:17.542 --> 00:03:19.786
We have lots of apricots
in the Albuquerque area.

00:03:19.786 --> 00:03:21.638
I guess maybe around the state too?

00:03:21.638 --> 00:03:23.908
- Uh, this was a good year for apricots.

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.158
- Try that one.

00:03:27.108 --> 00:03:28.818
- It's good, this is worth doing.

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:31.324
- Oh good, well I'm going
to show you how to fix the

00:03:31.324 --> 00:03:34.283
apricots, peaches and apples
so they don't turn dark.

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:36.675
I've taken, I think these
are Alberta peaches?

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:37.962
- Okay, big beautiful peaches.

00:03:37.962 --> 00:03:41.282
- And what I have done is slice
them, or rather peel them.

00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:42.115
- [Curtis] Just peel them first.

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:44.639
- And I put them into a
solution, let me get the

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.132
towel back here, you have
to put them into a solution

00:03:48.132 --> 00:03:49.552
that prevents them turning dark.

00:03:49.552 --> 00:03:53.173
One of the products you could
use is like, Fruit Fresh,

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:56.494
a less, inexpensive product
is just old vitamin C

00:03:56.494 --> 00:04:00.259
which a lot of people have in their homes.

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:01.259
You use six,

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.382
500mg tablets

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:07.038
to one gallon of cold water.

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:09.433
Put them in a plastic bag.

00:04:09.433 --> 00:04:10.844
- I was wondering about that

00:04:10.844 --> 00:04:15.641
- Yeah, and then just take
your rolling pin, smash them

00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.335
up so that you've got a powder.

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:19.302
- Oh that was easy.

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:20.135
- Yeah, see right here?

00:04:20.135 --> 00:04:21.678
- You didn't even need my help there.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:22.511
- I thought about asking you.

00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.189
- I knew you would.

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:25.499
- And then we're going
to, I've already dissolved

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.178
in the water and you can see
these peaches have been in

00:04:27.178 --> 00:04:30.402
here about 30 minutes and they
haven't turned dark at all.

00:04:30.402 --> 00:04:33.572
With the peaches, what we're
going to do, we're going to

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:37.739
cut it in half, twist, so
that we can take out the seed,

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:44.403
I did plums two weekends
ago and this is how I did

00:04:44.403 --> 00:04:45.736
all those plums.

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:51.585
And then we're going to cut
them in very thin slices.

00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:53.085
- [Curtis] About how thick is that?

00:04:53.085 --> 00:04:54.293
- [Patricia] 1/4 inch thick

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:55.639
and that'll give you a nice slice.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.502
When you're dehydrating, a
real trick, is that all of the

00:04:58.502 --> 00:05:02.110
slices of anything need
to be about the same size.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.274
So they all dry at the same
time and you're not having to go

00:05:04.274 --> 00:05:06.835
to take them off the screen

00:05:06.835 --> 00:05:09.752
as the thinner ones dehydrate first.

00:05:10.926 --> 00:05:12.351
- [Curtis] You put them back
in to the ascorbic acid?

00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:14.410
- [Patricia] Mhm because
we want each--what the

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.947
ascorbic acid is doing is
it's just coating it so that,

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:19.707
it's an antioxidant, and
it's not going to turn brown.

00:05:19.707 --> 00:05:22.241
There's no problem with the
browning in food safety but

00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:24.591
it's not very appetizing,
certainly not, doesn't look

00:05:24.591 --> 00:05:25.751
very good.

00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:28.955
Okay Curtis, let's take these
out now, and we'll drain

00:05:28.955 --> 00:05:30.168
these in the bowl and then I'mma have

00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:31.931
you place them on the screen.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:34.514
And then they'll be ready
to go into the dehydrator

00:05:34.514 --> 00:05:35.931
or to go outside.

00:05:37.008 --> 00:05:39.838
And they need to be left two
to three minutes, you don't

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:41.623
need to soak them, you're
just wanting to cover them

00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:43.894
in that antioxidant.

00:05:43.894 --> 00:05:45.856
- [Curtis] Now we go to
the much longer process.

00:05:45.856 --> 00:05:47.503
- [Patricia] Of drying.

00:05:47.503 --> 00:05:48.933
- [Curtis] Now they're easy
when putting it on the screen,

00:05:48.933 --> 00:05:50.680
now you have to leave
space between each one?

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.513
- [Patricia] Yes, because you want

00:05:51.513 --> 00:05:52.346
that air flow so that it's

00:05:52.346 --> 00:05:54.115
going to dry very nicely.

00:05:54.115 --> 00:05:56.198
- [Curtis] I'll leave room in
case we do something else here

00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:58.865
because you've got a big screen.

00:06:01.767 --> 00:06:03.706
- [Patricia] Those are
beautiful peaches, aren't they?

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:04.539
- [Curtis] Yes.

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:05.449
- [Patricia] I'll put this one back in.

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.264
- [Curtis] They'll be tasty
after they're dried too.

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:10.121
- We've talked about
fruit now do you have any,

00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:12.471
can you think of anything else
we need to tell the viewers

00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:13.911
about fruit?

00:06:13.911 --> 00:06:14.814
Or anything that you'd like to know?

00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:16.632
- There are some fruits
that have already been

00:06:16.632 --> 00:06:18.420
harvested, and I'm wondering,
something like cherries,

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:20.528
which we had a pretty good
crop this year, um you've

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:25.526
got the apricots here, the
apples are coming in shortly,

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:28.676
you've got cantaloupe, do
other melons dehydrate as well?

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:31.062
- I tried drying
watermelon, and watermelon

00:06:31.062 --> 00:06:33.062
has so much water and it

00:06:34.203 --> 00:06:38.355
shrinks up to a very small
piece and it's almost sugar.

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:39.188
- I like that.

00:06:39.188 --> 00:06:41.606
- You would like the watermelon then.

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:43.804
I've done honeydew and
honeydew has about the same

00:06:43.804 --> 00:06:46.240
consistency as the cantaloupe.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.171
- So the honeydew and the
cantaloupe are probably

00:06:48.171 --> 00:06:50.661
the better melons for dehydration

00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:52.444
But what do you do with these
things once you've finished

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:54.099
dehydrating them?

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:57.460
- Put them in to freezer baggies

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.045
- Now do you have to
freeze them after this?

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:01.103
- Depending on the length of time that

00:07:01.103 --> 00:07:02.402
you want to store them.

00:07:02.402 --> 00:07:04.584
If you wanted to store
them for a year or so

00:07:04.584 --> 00:07:06.143
then I would put them in
the freezer just to have

00:07:06.143 --> 00:07:07.943
an optimum quality product.

00:07:07.943 --> 00:07:09.551
You don't have to, they
could be stored in a

00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:13.412
cool, dry place, about
50 degrees fahrenheit.

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:17.120
These type of things don't
tend to stick around your home.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.612
People really like dehydrated products.

00:07:19.612 --> 00:07:20.445
- We eat them fast.

00:07:20.445 --> 00:07:21.278
I noticed you didn't zip it closed.

00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:23.923
- Nope you need to press out the air

00:07:23.923 --> 00:07:25.580
because oxygen would destroy the product.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.413
- [Curtis] Okay.

00:07:26.413 --> 00:07:29.448
- Close it, and you've
got a product to store.

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:31.832
- And, I know there's lots
more to this, how could

00:07:31.832 --> 00:07:34.230
someone get more information
if they wanted to learn

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:35.891
more about this?

00:07:35.891 --> 00:07:38.114
- Extension has a
publication on drying foods,

00:07:38.114 --> 00:07:41.202
guide E322, which you can request from any

00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:44.905
cooperative extension
service office in New Mexico.

00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:46.559
And we'd be happy to send it to them.

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.021
- Great, and thank you for this.

00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:49.510
- Thank you, thank you for having me.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.825
- This was interesting
and it was quite tasty.

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:53.067
- Good.

00:07:53.067 --> 00:07:58.160
(upbeat music)
