00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:04.509
Daisy is a flower whose petals on white should always

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.239
we must always paint on a background already painted or dark background

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:14.619
in this case I took the cardboard
dark so you can see better as the

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:15.689
brushstroke

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.719
a round brush is picked depending
brush size

00:00:19.719 --> 00:00:23.130
have larger or margaritas
little

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.839
in this case is a double zero

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.480
we carry white

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.779
we will give

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.790
if we give a little clue what goes
to be subsequently the center

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.700
We give a touch

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.480
from here all the strokes to make the center

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.530
for example we started here

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.190
put the tip to crush and we
raising as we approach

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.550
the center

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.600
with little movement tip

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.300
crushed and rise

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.820
crushed tip

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.690
and raised

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.710
We got crushed tip

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.130
crushed

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.880
we loading

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.600
in this area we are going to paint more
later small to see what is the volume

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.320
we will be giving a little smaller

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.140
now let's paint the center

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.360
Let's use the orange brown and yellow

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.169
with orange

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:16.449
what we will do is that first
brushstroke

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:17.919
we took

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:19.999
let's fill

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.009
vsmos to give volume using a brush hojos

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:37.399
or brush five zeros

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.869
we will make a crescent of points
dark and a few in the center

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:59.969
always coming and going

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.969
that will give the shadow of seeds

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.920
thicker bottom

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.789
and we finished

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:21.789
and now a bit in the center

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:29.269
we have given the shadow now take the light with yellow, so we get better volume

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.069
this year this case is contrary
We give the largest crescent

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:55.669
daisies have a very thin stalk
