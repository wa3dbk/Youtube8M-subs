-Thanks a lot.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.700
I'm getting real sick and tired of
being dragged all over the place.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.950
-Whoa! You're the biggest
orange I've ever seen!

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.640

-Yeah, ya are.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.380
I'm orange, you're orange.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.560
We're both oranges!

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.310
-I'm not an orange, I'm a pumpkin.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.050
-Pumpkin?
Don't you mean "plumpkin"?

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.820

You're huge!

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.360

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.700
-Hey, Plumpkin,
wanna see a trick?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.620
-Not really.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740
-[burps, laughs]

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.750
-Hey, Plumpkin!
-It's Pumpkin!

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.340
-Hey, Plumpkin!
-What?

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.900
-Can you touch your
eyeball with your tongue?

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.120
-No.
-You haven't even tried it yet.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.840
Try it! Errl...

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.510
-I don't want to try it.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.110
-Errl... almost. Errl...

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.850
-Would you stop that?

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.660
-I almost got it.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.430
-Orange, knock it off!

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.690
-You're not trying.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.360
-Oh, my God, stop it!
-What?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.570
-You know,
I'm a pretty relaxed guy most of the time,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.860
and it takes a lot to get me riled,

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.860
but you,
you are driving me crazy,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.780
and I've only been here--
what?--a minute.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.280
You don't shut up!

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.320
And it's Pumpkin! Pumpkin!

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.770
Not Orange, not Plumpkin,
and I'm not your brother.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.310
What? What is it?

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.910
Why are you mumbling
and making that face?

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.160
-Knife.
-Huh?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.130
[screaming]

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.920
-Somebody should take
that guy's knife away.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010
Right in the head.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.470
Oh no, he's tearing your insides out.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.560
-[shrieks in agony]

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.930
-Hey! Hey, Plumpkin!

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.850
Hey, Plumpkin! Hey!

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.350
Hey Plumpkin,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.310
somebody carved a face on your butt.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.120
[laughing]

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:57.490
Oh...

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.350
Hey, who turned out the lights?
