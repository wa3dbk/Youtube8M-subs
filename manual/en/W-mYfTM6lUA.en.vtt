00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.350
Michelle, ma belle.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.340
These are words that go together well,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.110
My Michelle.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.650
Michelle, ma belle.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.630
Sont des mots qui vont trés bien ensemble,

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.710
Trés bien ensemble.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.570
I love you, I love you, I love you.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.980
That's all I want to say.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.740
Until I find a way

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.110
I will say the only words I know that

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.580
You'll understand.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.810
Michelle, ma belle.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.290
Sont des mots qui vont trés bien ensemble,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.870
Trés bien ensemble.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.410
I need to, I need to, I need to.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.890
I need to make you see,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.160
Oh, what you mean to me.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.330
Until I do I'm hoping you will

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.490
Know what I mean.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.330
I love you...

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.260
I want you, I want you, I want you.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.790
I think you know by now

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.630
I'll get to you somehow.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.610
Until I do I'm telling you so

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.900
You'll understand.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.990
Michelle, ma belle.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.480
Sont des mots qui vont trés bien ensemble,

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.650
Trés bien ensemble.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600
I will say the only words I know that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.350
You'll understand, my Michelle.
