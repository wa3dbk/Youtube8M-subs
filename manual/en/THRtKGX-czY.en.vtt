00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.560
They call it creeping,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.800
I say loving,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.060
it's the only way for me

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.840
Filling out papers,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.420
signing waivers but I stay outside his reach

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.860
I name your mother and your father

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.220
and the first pet that you keep

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.360
I know your favourite place to dine at when your cheque comes in each week

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.600
I know you do your wash on Sundays and you separate your whites

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.480
and that your car needs a new tire 'cos last week I laid those spikes

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.400
I've got a million polaroids with all the dates penned in red ink

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.520
I sneak a walkie-talky in your room to listen to you sleep...

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.760
You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.620
One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.480
We'll be together, yes forever, we will never ever part

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.720
Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.180
Some call it stalking,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.680
I say walking just extremely close behind

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.900
I'm sure if I sat down and asked you, well you really wouldn't mind..

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.700
You've got those eyes that drive me crazy,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.880
and I've got eyes to watch you sleep

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.900
I brought a pack lunch and some coffee for my stakeout in your tree...

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.620
outside your house..  (shh!)

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.860
gotta be as quiet as a mouse, or else you'll call the police

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.000
And I'll get done for somethin' stupid like disturbance of the peace

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.860
and piece by piece I am collecting all the things you leave behind

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.020
and when you don't I rummage through your bins to see what I can find...

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.240
You just don't know it yet but you love me and I love you the same

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.220
One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.580
We'll be together,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.940
yes forever,

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.180
we will never ever part

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.440
Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.740
You just don't know it yet but you love me

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.540
and I love you the same

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.420
One day we'll have a pretty wedding and I'll be your everything

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.940
We'll be together,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.700
yes forever

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.440
we will never ever part

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.140
Oh you don't know it yet but baby I've already got your heart

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.880
already got your heart

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.180
already got your heart
