00:00:01.956 --> 00:00:02.200
O: [SINGING]

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:02.934
She's so bossy.

00:00:02.934 --> 00:00:03.225
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:00:03.225 --> 00:00:07.335
I never met a vowel that
didn't like my swing.

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:10.269
Is it 'cause I so sassy?

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.670
The way I do my thing, I like
to shake things up.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.115
I like a sound that's new.

00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:21.505
I ain't satisfied with changing
a, or e, i, o, and u.

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:22.996
That's why I'm Bossy.

00:00:22.996 --> 00:00:23.244
CHORUS: [SINGING]

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:26.143
Oh, yeah, she's Bossy R. You
better do what she says.

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:26.266
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.469
Yes, and I'm a star.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:27.799
CHORUS: [SINGING]

00:00:27.799 --> 00:00:31.445
Little miss Bossy R, her
way is the only way.

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:37.440
Wah-ooh, Bossy R. She's
got a brand new sound.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.860
Little miss Bossy R, she'll
turn your vowels around.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.229
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.026
Let me introduce my background
singers.

00:00:44.026 --> 00:00:47.145
Each one has a gift, but
they all sound so

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:48.590
much better with me.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.898
Ha-ha, you catch my drift?

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:53.670
Without me there to make
them pretty, they

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.685
would just be lost.

00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:58.407
A consonant like me
to show those poor

00:00:58.407 --> 00:00:59.645
vowels who's the boss.

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:00.882
That's right, I'm Bossy.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:01.046
A: [SINGING]

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:05.090
Standing in the back, I'm
on the short a track.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.040
But next to Bossy R, my sound
changes from ah to ar.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.990
So now as I sing my part, I
sure enough sound smart.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.455
My car is an art.

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:18.752
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:01:18.752 --> 00:01:19.940
Come on, all.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.270
O: [SINGING]

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.200
It's simple, yesiree, I
like my sound a lot.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.564
Until the Bossy gets a hold
of me, and I change

00:01:27.564 --> 00:01:28.560
right on the spot.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.857
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:29.224
What a sport.

00:01:29.224 --> 00:01:33.540
O: I got a score with
sounds galore.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.358
I had to run and tell my
neighbor that this O's got a

00:01:37.358 --> 00:01:39.516
brand new flavor.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:39.813
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:43.500
You see how I change the
sound from cat to cart,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.492
or from pat to part?

00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:46.488
Oh, you'll get it.

00:01:46.488 --> 00:01:48.480
This is so much fun.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.876
E AND I: [SINGING]

00:01:48.876 --> 00:01:50.970
Oh, it was said we
weren't a hit.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.460
You can bet we didn't fit.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.701
Our hands were tied, but
still we tried to

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:57.942
make the best of it.

00:01:57.942 --> 00:02:01.428
Then Bossy came around and
changed our sounds and put us

00:02:01.428 --> 00:02:02.424
on the mic.

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:02.922
BOSSY R: That's right.

00:02:02.922 --> 00:02:03.318
E AND I: [SINGING]

00:02:03.318 --> 00:02:07.404
Now, when we're next to her,
E and I sound just alike.

00:02:07.404 --> 00:02:08.400
Yeah.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.600
BOSSY R: E and I make
two different

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.461
sounds 'til I come around.

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.365
I change the I sound from
fist to first, and the

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:16.301
E from gem to germ.

00:02:16.301 --> 00:02:17.269
You see?

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:17.591
U: [SINGING]

00:02:17.591 --> 00:02:22.870
Pardon if I blush, but I can't
help but gush 'cause I'm so

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.400
thrilled with Bossy that I
swear I might just bust.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.000
BOSSY R: Or burst.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.200
U: [SINGING]

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.500
Change is up to her, so
bun can become burn.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.000
Yes, with that r, I'm happy
that I always get my turn.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.225
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:37.200
Oh, I'm Bossy.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.400
CHORUS: [SINGING]

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.500
Oh, yeah, she's Bossy R. You
better do what she says.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.680
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.000
Yes, and I'm a star.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.200
CHORUS: [SINGING]

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.600
Little miss Bossy R, her
way is the only way.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.825
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:02:45.825 --> 00:02:47.400
Oh, I'm Bossy.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.600
CHORUS: [SINGING]

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.400
Bossy R, she's got a
brand new sound.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.580
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.900
Got a brand new sound.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.100
CHORUS: [SINGING]

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.400
Little miss Bossy R.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.625
BOSSY R: [SINGING]

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:55.500
I'll turn your vowels around.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.750
Yeah.
