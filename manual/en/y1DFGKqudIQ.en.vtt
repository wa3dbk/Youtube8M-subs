00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Admiration

00:00:11.729 --> 00:00:16.500
HuskyTHON is a great opportunity to support a fantastic cause

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.259
HuskyTHON is a way for anyone who wants
to make a difference to be able to make a difference

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.089
in a way as simple is
getting out and dancing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.179
I do HuskyTHON for the kids, I don't think there's another night

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.000
you can be part of where it's just all for them, and nothing else

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.180
It's great to see them, and see them having a good time, and all of us having a good time, and all of us having a great time

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.900
What other night could a bunch of college kids get together and just dance for the kids  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Just being able to take what you want you want to budget for yourself, that time,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and in investing in someone else is probably the most gratifying experience that a person can possibly have

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.010
My favorite part of HuskyTHON is actually seeing the kids participate

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.810
We just had made a Harlem Shake video

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.800
And all of the kids got a chance to start the Harlem Shake video

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.430
I think it's really cool that we center the night around

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.430
things like that and make them the spotlight

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120
Just in the last twelve months since I've been here last

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.120
We've seen 300,000 patient visits made possible because you care and you lead

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
We love you, thank you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.000
Last year we did the circle hope for the first time 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Where every participant is given a hospital bracelet just like the bracelets at Connecticut Children's Medical Center when they arrived

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.310
And at the end of the event

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.730
We all stood in a huge circle

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.270
And the miracle children came around and cut off everyone's bracelets

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.420
It was beautiful

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.610
It'd encourage anyone who would be interested in doing this in years to come

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.960
HuskyTHON is a great way

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.000
to make a difference, to get involved

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.020
and to do something meaningful while having fun at the same time
