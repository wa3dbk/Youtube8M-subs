00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.850
Today on our 2005 Chevy Silverado well be
installing the Firestone Work Right Helper

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.130
Spring kit, part number F8605.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.440
First, before we install our kit well need
to remove the old or manufacturers bump stops.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.880
To do this well simply go ahead and raise
the vehicle, take the weight off the rear

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.320
axle and then remove the nut, securing the
stud that goes up through the bump stop and

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.410
holds it to the frame.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.219
Now with the old bump stop out of the way
were ready to go ahead and start installing

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.620
the new Work Right Helper Springs.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.909
The Helper Spring kit can be modified for
the vehicle or ride necessary.

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:47.769
For a stronger, stiffer ride we can take the
helpers spring, along with the long bolt provided

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:55.109
in our install kit, add a split-lock washer,
flat washer, and go up through the spring.

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:02.039
Then we can add two of the blue rubber spacers,
and then our top plate.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.770
Well then take our bolt, take it up through
the frame and secure it with the flat washer

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.850
and nut.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.409
For this application, however, we will not
be using any of the rubber spacers.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.040
This will provide the softest ride while still
giving us the support that we need for our

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.500
application.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.439
When removing the rubber spacers we can go
ahead and use the smaller bolt provided with

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.509
our install kit, again add the split lock
washer, the flat washer, go up through the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.340
spring and then through the mounting plate
and then through the frame, securing with

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:57.420
a flat washer 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:06.289
and nut.
