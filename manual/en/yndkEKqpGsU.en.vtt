00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.229
Today on our 2002 Ford Escape well be installing
the Tow Ready T1 Connector, part number 118343.

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:10.640
To begin our install, well first go ahead
and open up the rear cargo door.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.839
This will allow us to see the fasteners to
remove the rear taillight housing on both

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:15.839
sides.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.810
Starting here on the drivers side well go
ahead and remove the two fasteners and then

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.060
pop the taillight out of position.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.040
Note: To pop the taillight out of position
were going to be using a small plastic pry

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.830
bar, but you can also use a flat bladed screwdriver
just be careful not to chip the paint.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.650
Now, once youve popped the taillight out,
be careful not to break the alignment tabs

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.880
underneath.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.100
Now with the drivers side removed, well go
over to the passenger side and repeat the

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.899
same process.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.649
Next starting here on the passenger side,
well go ahead and take the new four pole connector

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.280
and the yellow wire connection point and feed
them down between the bumper cover and the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.050
body of the vehicle.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.850
Then well take the brown and green wire connector
coming from our converter box and attach it

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.350
to the manufacturers wiring, and then plug
the other end back into the taillight.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.620
Now well go ahead and repeat the same process
for the green wire connector and the gray

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.250
plug in the center of the taillight.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.860
Now with all our connections made, well go
ahead and take the white wire with the pre-attached

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:24.610
ring terminal and secure it to the body of
the vehicle as it will be the ground for our

00:01:24.610 --> 00:02:45.560
converter box.
