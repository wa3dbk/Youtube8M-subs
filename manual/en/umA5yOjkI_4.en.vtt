00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.060
Item #: SCP-1548

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.270
Object Class: Euclid Keter

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.560
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-1548 is
currently uncontainable due to its status

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.560
as a stellar body.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.920
It is to be observed by astronomical personnel
at Research Unit-█, currently located at

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.180
████████, Sark.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.449
Three small-scale radio telescopes are currently
in use to allow for 24-hour message reception.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.590
All received messages are to be transcribed
and transmitted to the SCP-1548 database at

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.590
Site-█.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.780
MTF Gamma-5 is currently assigned the task
of suppressing knowledge of the object's characteristics

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.039
in the mass media.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:51.930
Description: SCP-1548 is the Foundation term
for PSR B0531+21, an optical pulsar in the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.270
Crab Nebula.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.110
Originally discovered in 1942 by various scientific
organizations, the anomalous nature of the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.989
star was not known until 1968, when Agent
M███████, then an astronomer

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.910
at [REDACTED], began observations via radio
telescope.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.730
Radio observations revealed that the star
was, in fact, accelerating towards the Solar

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.900
System, and that it was pulsing in Morse Code.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.660
The first fully transcribed SCP-1548 message,
translated from Russian and broadcast in three

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.730
bursts, reads as follows: "I wake/I see all/And
find it lacking".

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.400
SCP-1548 normally pulses at a rate of approximately
30hz, although higher transmission rates have

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.000
been recorded (see Addendum SCP-1548-A).

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.330
Over the course of the next ten years, the
star was observed to accelerate to approximately

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.110
0.85c (2.55x108m/s).

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.700
During this period, the pulsar began to transmit
increasingly hostile messages, with common

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.470
phrases being "You cannot hide" and "Only
death".

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.160
Having reached its apparent maximum velocity
by unknown means in late 1978, the pulsar's

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.660
messages changed, becoming significantly more
erudite and coherent.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.090
It was at this point that SCP-1548 began to
demonstrate awareness of those observing it.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.200
Messages began to take on a personal tone,
insulting those observing the object.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.590
Messages simultaneously received on multiple
telescopes will threaten personnel using all

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.819
telescopes.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.159
Messages sent while telescopes are recording
automatically, without human involvement,

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.900
are normally general threats against humanity
as a whole, although [DATA EXPUNGED] prompting

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.700
the establishment of observation posts at
these specific sites.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.739
The means by which SCP-1548 apparently predicts
the future in order to time the reception

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:45.480
of its pulses is unknown.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:57.210
Addendum SCP-1548-A: On █/█/198█, O5-█,
on medical leave from Foundation duties, accidentally

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.700
directed a small optical telescope in the
general direction of the Crab Nebula.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.459
The telescopes at Sark recorded the following:
"I just remembered this: the coordinates of

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.889
all SCP secure facilities.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.069
And have the personal information of the O5."

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:17.939
Following this transmission, the star's pulse
rate increased from 30hz to well over 1khz,

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.780
necessitating the use of high-speed cameras
to record the message.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.469
Over the next eight hours, SCP-1548 transmitted
[DATA EXPUNGED], totaling more than a gigabyte

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:30.670
of information.

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.129
This was the longest continual message to
date.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:40.760
Addendum SCP-1548-B: SCP-1548 is reclassified
as Keter by order of O5-█

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.109
I don't care if it gets here in 5,700 years.

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:45.829
It knows too much.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:46.980
-O5-█

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:55.290
Addendum SCP-1548-C: After the major solar
flare on 11/4/2003, the Sark facility received

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.959
a brief message stating "Your little world
will be next.".

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.239
Comparable messages have been received after
every significant solar event since that date.
