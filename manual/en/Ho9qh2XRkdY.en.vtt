00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.080
Windows 7 was released
in 2009.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.630
And it was the successor
to Windows Vista.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.640
There are six editions of
Windows 7 that were

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.320
introduced.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.430
This is very similar to
the editions that

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.990
were in Windows Vista.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.340
There's a Windows 7 Starter,
a Windows 7 Home Basic, a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.700
Windows 7 Home Premium, and
a Windows 7 Ultimate.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.560
For use at work you would
commonly see Windows 7

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.520
Professional, or Windows
7 Enterprise.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.450
And you'll notice that
I've grayed out the

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.020
Windows 7 Home Basic.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.120
That was a version that was
created specifically for

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.200
emerging markets.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.120
You would not be able to even
activate Windows 7 Home Basic

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.020
unless it was in one of those
particular countries or

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.640
geographies.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.060
Windows 7 Starter is a basic
version of the Windows

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.010
operating system that was really
designed for netbooks.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.200
And netbooks, of course, are
very small portable computers

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.210
that don't have a lot of
advanced graphics capabilities

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.880
or high end processors.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.090
So you generally don't see
things like DVD playback.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.080
That was a feature that you
would not find in Windows 7

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.780
Starter, because netbooks
generally don't have DVD

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.510
players inside of them.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.880
There's no Windows Aero,
because the graphics

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.310
capabilities in those devices
are not very advanced.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.940
And things like Internet
Connection Sharing would not

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.140
apply either.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.870
There's no Web Server
functionality in Windows 7

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.130
Starter, and certainly none of
the enterprise technologies

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.710
that you might need at work,
like access to an active

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.000
domain, or things like using
BitLocker or EFS encryption.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.730
You would only find Windows 7
Starter in a 32-bit version.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.180
There are not 64-bit versions
of this operating system.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.470
And this version only supported
a maximum of two

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.120
gigabytes of memory.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.340
If you're at home and you're
using Windows 7, then you're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.900
probably using Windows
7 Home Premium.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.940
This is the version that you
would buy at a big box store.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.980
You would purchase it and run
it on your home computer.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.970
This is probably the version
that was also included with

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.090
many home computers.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.250
It allowed for playing
back DVDs.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.090
There was the graphical Aero
support inside of it.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.540
And you could enable Internet
Connection Sharing, or even

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.590
run your own web server on a
Windows 7 Home Premium device.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.310
Again, you didn't have the
enterprise functionality.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.380
This was really designed
to be run at home.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.280
So no connectivity to Active
Directory, or any of the more

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.340
advanced encryption
capabilities.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.460
Windows 7 Home Premium did
provide a 64-bit version of

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.600
the operating system,
which gave you more

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.890
hardware to work with.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.490
You could use up to 16 gigabytes
of RAM in your

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.310
64-bit processor.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150
And you could have up to two
separate physical processors

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.030
inside of your computer that
allow you to do more than the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.410
32-bit version of the Windows
7 Home Premium.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.560
If you wanted to use Windows 7
with every feature enabled,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.760
then you were probably wanting
to run Windows 7 Ultimate.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.300
This allowed you to connect
to Active Directory.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.060
You would use this as a
remote desktop server.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.600
You could use some of the
encryption technologies for

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.070
encrypting files, or even use
BitLocker for encrypting the

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.770
entire hard drive of
your computer.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.640
The 64-bit version of Windows
7 Ultimate supported a total

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.910
memory of 192 gigabytes
of memory.

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.290
And this was exactly the same
functionality as Windows 7

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.280
Enterprise.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.370
Think about taking the
Enterprise version that would

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.400
only be available through
volume licensing with

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.160
Microsoft, and be able to
use that same type of

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.650
functionality on an operating
system that you

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.780
could run at home.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.010
If you needed to run Windows 7
in a business environment but

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.260
you didn't need every single
capability of Windows 7,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.800
you're probably running Windows
7 Professional.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.850
This has exactly the same
functionality as Windows Home

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.120
Premium, but it enables the
capability to connect to a

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.340
Windows Domain, and be able to
administer that device through

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.580
Active Directory.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.010
You can also turn on the
Remote Desktop Host

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.160
capabilities on a Windows 7
Professional, and use the

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.860
encrypting file system, so that
you're able to encrypt

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.310
individual files.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.390
The Windows 7 Professional,
though, did not allow you to

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.580
enable BitLocker.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.040
So the entire encryption of a
hard drive is not something

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.960
supported inside of Windows
7 Professional.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.940
The 64-bit version of Windows 7
Professional allowed you to

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.100
use a lot more memory.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.660
You could use up to 192
gigabytes of RAM.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.410
As I mentioned earlier, you
would be using the Windows 7

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.860
Enterprise version if you
had a volume license.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.150
If you were managing very,
very large deployments of

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.510
Windows 7, this is probably the
version that you're using.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.100
This allowed and enabled
multiple languages in the user

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.910
interface, which is important
for large international

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.030
organizations.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.870
It also allows you to turn on
that volume level encryption,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.460
called BitLocker in Windows.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.210
So that you could put that on a
laptop, send the laptop out.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.650
And even if that laptop got
stolen or lost, the data on

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.620
that system would still
be protected.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.890
The Windows 7 Enterprise version
also enabled some Unix

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.660
application support, which is
important for some large

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.610
organizations.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.960
Here's a summary of all those
additions on one single slide.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.940
You can see that the starter
version of Windows 7 really

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.110
doesn't provide any of
those functions.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.560
And it only allowed up to two
gigabytes of memory use on a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.680
32-bit system.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.450
The 64-bit functionality,
not even available

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.210
on Windows 7 Starter.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.110
Windows 7 home premium obviously
allowed the DVD

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.250
playback, the Aero graphics,
and some of the Internet

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.900
Connection Sharing an internet

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.040
information system web services.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.540
But it's not designed
for the business.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.130
So it didn't have domain, EFS,
or BitLocker capabilities.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.700
And you can see the memory
allowed for a Windows home

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.920
premium was four gigabytes on
a 32-bit system and up to 16

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.670
gigabytes on a 64-bit system.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.500
If we look at Professional,
we're enabling the Active

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.790
Directory functionality, and
the encrypting file system.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.490
But you do not have that
BitLocker volume level

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.870
encryption on the Professional
version.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.720
You're also increasing the total
amount of memory that

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.080
you can access on the 64-bit
version up to 192 gigabytes.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.820
The Ultimate and Enterprise
versions, of course, enable

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.670
everything, including
BitLockers.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.480
So now we can have that volume
level encryption, and protect

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.620
those devices that happen to go
outside of our environment.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.890
Or we just want to be sure that
all of the data on that

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.640
volume is encrypted, no matter
what happens to that computer.

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.020
And you can see that the maximum
memory, very similar

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.740
to the professional version, at
four gigabytes for a 32-bit

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.040
system and a maximum of 192
gigabytes for a 64-bit system.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.710
The requirements for Windows 7
are a little bit different

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.890
between a 32-bit version
and a 64-bit version.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.950
Some things are identical.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.950
For instance, the processor
required is a 1 gigahertz

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.530
processor for both of
those editions.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.060
You can see the memory
is different, though.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.750
On a 32-bit version,
one gigabyte of

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:50.770
memory is the minimum.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.380
On a 64-bit version, there is a
doubling of two gigabytes of

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.310
memory required for a 64-bit
version of Windows 7.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.460
You also would need a minimum
of 16 gigabytes free to

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.220
install a 32-bit version
of Windows 7.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.250
But you would need an extra
amount, up to 20 gigabytes of

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:11.450
memory, free and available
with the 64-bit version.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.650
The video requirements
for both the 32 and

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.450
the 64-bit are identical.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.880
You need a DirectX 9
graphics device.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.650
And it would need a standardized
Windows driver

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.150
called a WDDM.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.370
That's a Windows Display Driver
Model version 1.0 that

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.840
had a very standardized way of
accessing the graphics driver

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.280
in a Windows environment.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.190
Those are identical, whether
you're using

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.440
Windows 7 32-bit or 64-bit.
