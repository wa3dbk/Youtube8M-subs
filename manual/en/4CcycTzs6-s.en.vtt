Hello again, this is Paul from www.puppetsnstuff.com.
You can reach us on the web at www.puppetsnstuff.com.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.250
Okay, now what we want to do is to create
a nose for this character so you remember

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.020
the pompom earlier, pompoms make great noses.
They really do. All you have to do is add

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.501
a little bit of hot glue and stick in on the
area that you want the nose to be or you can

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:28.990
get a little more creative. You can take one
of those Styrofoam balls or cut it in half

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.600
and then you can go back and take some of
your fleece (let me cut out a little square

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:50.399
piece of fleece here) and you can stick it
over the ball and then stretch it out as much

00:00:50.399 --> 00:01:03.800
as you can so that you get kind of deal. Then
the way to get it to stay is to take some

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:18.680
thread and wrap it around, wrap it around
the part that you are holding and pull, cut

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.880
and then tie it. Sorry I am out of the camera
shot right now but what I am doing is simply

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:38.909
tying this, so that that extra piece is already
in place. Then you take your trusty scissors

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:51.250
and just trim it because you do not need all
of that excess. Then what you do is add your

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:00.240
little nose, take your glue gun and you are
going to go around the edges again (just like

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.399
what you did with your eyes earlier) starting
from the outer ages working your way into

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:11.050
the center and then stick it on your character
where you want it to be. Put it right there

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:21.901
in the middle and again hold your puppet,
press it down for about 3 minutes until it

00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:28.950
is nice and sturdy and bonded to your character.
When we come back we are going to put some

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.860
hair on it
