00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.380
What's up, guys?

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.960
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.510
Today I want to discuss one of the most versatile
exercises out there, and that is the Farmer's

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.510
Carry.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.610
It demands core strength and stability.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.340
It demands hand and grip strength.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.320
It demands forearm strength, proper posture,
endurance, conditioning, all this stuff rolled

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.609
into one.

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.039
What could we do if we took it up a notch?

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.280
And that's exactly why we have two very different
dumbbell weights showing here.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.870
Guys, if you want to challenge yourself, and
challenge all those things that I said, especially,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.260
particularly the core,

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.470
and make this one of the most under-utilized
core exercises that you want to start asymmetrically

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.470
loading.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.470
We got a 100-pound dumbbell.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.330
We've got our 60-pound dumbbell.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.120
When you want to challenge yourself, asymmetrically
load yourself.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.120
I say it, guys, all the time.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.350
If you want to look like an athlete, you got
to train like an athlete.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.080
In any athletic setting, even the sport of
life, we rarely find ourselves challenged

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.470
equally.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530
We found that we are always asymmetrically
loading.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.030
So, basically, I'm going to take this 100
and this 60.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.130
Proper posture, again, shoulders go back,
and I just walk it out.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.179
Shoulders stay squeezed back together.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.899
We turn around, and walk back.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.850
This 100-pound dumbbell wants to pull me all
the way over here because it's heavier than

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.850
the 60.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.850
I can't let that happen.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.929
I got to keep my shoulders level.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.850
The forearms are burning.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.810
And I come back.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.359
Now I'm going to show you another variation
that you can incorporate as well.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.539
We can asymmetrically load right to left,
but we can also asymmetrically load up and

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.700
down, or vertical displacement.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.299
Looks like this.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.179
Just like that.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.290
Low ceilings.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:26.879
I don't want to hit the ceiling on the way
back, but you get the point.

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.849
That was pretty heavy for the dumbbells, but
you can lighten it up and challenge yourself

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:33.849
accordingly.

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.450
So, there you go guys, another weapon in your
training arsenal.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.790
As a matter of fact, you can make it the workout,
too, by just simply stationing these two endpoints,

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.280
performing your exercise.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.260
When you get here, put the dumbbells down,
do your exercise, pick them back.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.660
Farmer's Walk them down to the end.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.989
Do your other exercise.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.630
That could be become a workout in and of itself
as well.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.299
The fact of the matter here, though, is guys,
you are functionally training yourself in

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.349
multi-dimensions, right.

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.390
You've got all those things working and working
together, and that is the essence of ATHLEANX

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:05.390
Training, guys.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.390
We say it all the time.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.570
If you want to look like an athlete, you got
to start training like one.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.310
And you have to, above all, overlook nothing
in your training.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.829
So these things, you guys, I know you're not
doing, start incorporating them into your

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.189
workouts, and you'll see this immense carry-over
to all aspects of how you look, how you perform,

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.310
and how you feel.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.719
If you want to get our program, guys, where
I take you through all these things in a systematic

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:31.720
way, then I say head to ATHLEANX.COM right
now and get our 90-Day Training system.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.439
In the meantime, that third video of the week,
guys, it's coming.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.540
You guys wanted it.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.540
I'm listening.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.540
We're going to start delivering it next week.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.330
In the meantime, we want to see your comments
for this video, and your thumb's up.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.330
Leave them below.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:44.819
I'll see you guys back here in just a couple
of days.
