Hi, I’m Samantha with Sharks and Minnows
Swim School and I want to demonstrate a basic

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.090
stroke. This stroke is called the front crawl.
Any stroke starts off with a good glide and

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.130
to glide you want to place one of your hands
on the wall and both of your feet on the wall.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.840
When you push off you want to make sure that
your body is streamlined, meaning that your

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:32.580
head is down and your whole body is tight,
hand together and feet together just like

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.469
this. Once you feel comfortable with the glide
you can add a kick, the kick with the front

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.699
crawl is called the flutter kick and you want
to make sure that you’re relatively straight

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:55.530
and that your feet are very floppy. The flutter
kick looks like this. It’s important that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.489
you keep your kick right below the surface
of the water and that you make sure that your

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.030
feet are nice and floppy like flippers and
the front crawl uses a flutter kick and it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.850
also uses an alternating arm motion. When
you’re doing your arms you want to bring

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:20.800
one arm out of the water at a time and enter
with a smooth entry, just like this. It’s

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.800
important that you’re not smacking the water
but instead that you’re cutting it. The

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.820
other thing is you want to make sure that
you keep your elbows up high just like this.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.540
So once you’re comfortable with the glide
and you’re comfortable with the glide and

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:44.230
the kick then start adding the arms. That
would look something like this. Once you have

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.800
the arms down you may wonder how you’re
suppose to breath. For breathing there’s

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.920
a couple of different ways you can do it.
You can either pop your head up to breath

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.260
or you can turn it to the side. The best way
is to just rotate your head to the side, this

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.980
is called rotary breathing. So for rotary
breathing you want to pick a rhythm, maybe

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.259
do two arms and breath or three arms and a
breath or maybe even four arms and a breath.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.780
Today we’re going to do two arms and then
take a breath to the side. When you’re breathing

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.110
to the side you’re going to raise your arm
and turn your head so you’re breathing almost

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:32.840
in your armpit. I’ll show you, it’s important
that you exhale underwater blowing bubbles

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.180
so that when you do come up to take a breath
you can take one quickly.
