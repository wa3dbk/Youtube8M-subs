00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.210
How to Green Your Wardrobe.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.549
Wearing vintage clothing is one of the best
ways to reduce the environmental impact of

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.270
your fashion choices—short of walking around
naked.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:17.279
You will need A vintage store A sewing kit
A resale shop Eco-safe laundry detergent A

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.949
clothesline and an environmentally conscious
dry cleaner.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.340
Step 1.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.970
Check labels when you shop.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:36.260
Look for natural fabrics such as wool, cotton,
cashmere, bamboo, hemp, and linen.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.260
Step 2.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.890
Avoid new synthetic fabrics made with petrochemicals,
such as acrylic, polyester, rayon, nylon,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.440
or anything labeled stain-proof or wrinkle
resistant.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.260
Many such fabrics are treated with chemicals
that not only impact the environment, but

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.700
also may be absorbed or inhaled directly.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.140
Step 3.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.590
Look for white or naturally colored fabrics
made with no chemical dyes.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.220
Botanically dyed or color-grown cotton provides
natural variety.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.270
Conventional cotton is among the world's most
chemically treated crops—buy organic cotton

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.579
instead.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.040
Step 4.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.500
Try not to load up on trendy items that you
will throw away after one season.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.810
Be willing to pay a bit more for a high-quality
classic that will last for years.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.030
Step 5.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.740
When shopping for clothes, accessories, and
jewelry, check your local consignment or thrift

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.240
store for vintage items.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.750
Step 6.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.409
Don't but new clothes unless you have to.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.380
Extend the life of what you already own with
a stylish makeover—such as new buttons or

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.380
trim.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.780
Step 7.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.539
When finished with an item of clothing, instead
of discarding it, hand it down to a friend

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.329
or charity, or donate it to a resale shop.

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.340
Step 8.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.420
Many natural fabrics wash beautifully in cold
water by hand, but if you must dry-clean something,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.729
look for an environmentally conscious dry
cleaner.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.619
Avoid dry cleaners that use the chemical Perc,
a known cancer-causing agent.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.619
Step 9.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.000
Launder your clothes with a nontoxic detergent
that is free of dyes and artificial fragrances.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.190
Powdered detergent is easiest on the environment.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.349
Step 10.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.879
Consider air-drying at least some of your
clothes on a clothesline, to save on electricity

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.790
and the carbon emissions that go with it.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.849
Did you know Forty million plastic bottles
are tossed daily in the US, but—luckily—plastic

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.110
bottles can be recycled into durable polyester
and fleece.
