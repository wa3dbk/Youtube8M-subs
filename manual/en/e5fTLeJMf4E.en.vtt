00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.240
Some new research shows that the secret to
being a creative genius might be being a bad

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:10.840
person.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.929
Anthony Carboni here for DNews and it turns
out that creative people tend to be more dishonest

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.929
than others.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.330
A 2011 study of employees at an ad agency
anonymously surveyed people in different departments

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.590
to see how likely they were to engage in questionable
behaviors at work like "take home office supplies"

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.340
and "inflate your expense report-" and people
in creative departments like copywriting and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.490
design were way more likely to do dishonest
things than other employees.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:34.490
Why?

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.260
Well, the idea is that creative behavior requires
you to break rules- to create something you

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.429
have to think outside of the normal boundaries
of every day life.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.210
So people who are more likely to break those
every day rules are more likely to create

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.170
something that lies outside of them.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.789
But wait- does that mean creative people are
more likely to lie, or that lying makes people

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:55.789
more creative?

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:56.789
Which comes first?

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.940
A new Harvard study says first comes lying,
then comes art.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.949
And the less time between a lie and a creative
act, the more creative you'll be.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.340
Five groups were tested for their baseline
level of creative problem solving skills.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.510
Then they were asked to solve some math problems
and told the more they solved, the more they'd

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.572
be paid for being part of the study.

00:01:14.572 --> 00:01:19.360
The researchers allowed them to report their
scores on the honor system, so they could

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.470
say they got whatever score they wanted- but
the researchers were secretly tracking their

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.680
actual progress.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.240
Finally, the participants were given some
creative word-association problems.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.050
The people who lied about their math scores
all did better than those who didn't.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.440
The researchers go on to say that it's possible
that dishonesty is so widespread in society

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.740
because by acting dishonest we become more
creative, which lets us creatively rationalize

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.230
our dishonest
behavior, which makes us more creative- and

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:46.290
we just get into a big, messy loop.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.050
Their study doesn't actually prove that, but
maybe they're just thinking creatively.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.670
I was a nasty, horrible, dishonest kid- and
art and creative writing were my best subjects.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:56.670
Hmmm.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.670
What do you guys think?

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.750
Are creative people naturally dishonest?

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.030
Are you going to lie and cheat your way to
the great american novel?
