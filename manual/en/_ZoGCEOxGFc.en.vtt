00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.550
--In front of the secret base

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.017
Around a hundred rioters had surged here from all directions, each wanting the bounty for burning the agave.

00:00:06.017 --> 00:00:10.850
Maroudo’s Soldier T: 500 grand! Five hundred grand, just to burn the place!!

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.917
Maroudo’s Soldier U: I’m gonna light it up!!

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.283
The agave meant the world to Yamato and his friends.

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.250
--As such, Naoe Yamato’s response was to…

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
Maroudo’s Soldier V: …Hm? What’s this line drawn in the earth?

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.017
Momoyo: That? That’s the borderline between this world and the next.

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:28.950
…To place here the strongest god of war, creating an impregnable fortress.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.883
Momoyo: A painful punishment awaits anyone who steps over that line.

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:37.250
Maroudo’s Soldier V: K—K-K-K-Kawakami Momoyo?!

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.083
Maroudo’s Soldier U: Hey, weren’t you too hurt to even move?

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:45.950
Momoyo: I get it. I won’t be bored if the enemy keeps coming here in waves.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.117
Momoyo: My mission’s to protect our base… Let’s give it a shot.

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:56.283
Maroudo’s Soldier T: S—Stay strong, guys! There’s a hundred of us!

00:00:56.283 --> 00:01:00.250
Maroudo’s Soldier V: Yeah! I ain’t scared of just one girl!

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.583
Maroudo’s Soldier U: …Let’s do this! ROAAARRRR!!!

00:01:03.583 --> 00:01:06.383
A hundred rioters crossed the line in the ground and attacked.

00:01:06.383 --> 00:01:10.650
Momoyo: Hah hah hah!! Nice, I’m so glad.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.917
Momoyo: …Aoi Touma, I figure you’re watching from on high.

00:01:14.917 --> 00:01:19.883
Momoyo: So you better be looking this way! ‘Cause I’m sending up some fireworks!

00:01:19.883 --> 00:01:23.383
Momoyo: Ka-wa-ka-mi

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:27.917
Momoyo: HA!!!!!!!

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.383
Maroudo’s Soldier T: Huh… Look at the wave of light.

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:35.817
Maroudo’s Soldier V: Wow. It’s so… pretty…

00:01:36.317 --> 00:01:39.183
None of the hundred understood what was happening...

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.017
as Momoyo’s flash of light burnt them to ash.

00:01:43.017 --> 00:01:45.217
Maroudo’s Soldier U: ….*Groan*…

00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:47.617
And thus all of them fell.

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:53.750
Takuya: Wow… That was like a colony laser.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:04.183
Momoyo: Mmm… That felt great. Well, they’ll have nightmares about it for the rest of their life, but I think they’ll live. I held back.

00:02:04.183 --> 00:02:08.683
Momoyo: But this time, I’m strictly on defense.

00:02:08.683 --> 00:02:13.850
Momoyo: I’m not going anywhere. After all, I have to protect the base and the agave.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.917
Momoyo: And protect Mororo, who’s inside there.

00:02:16.917 --> 00:02:21.083
Momoyo: In other words, if the offense can’t get through, we can’t win.

00:02:21.083 --> 00:02:24.117
Momoyo: Wanko, everyone, go get ‘em!

00:02:25.317 --> 00:02:28.083
----Inside the Child Palace

00:02:28.083 --> 00:02:32.917
Koyuki: Wow, it’s so pretty. Something just shined so bright.

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:36.717
Jun: Hey, Young Master? Have you spoken with your father recently?

00:02:36.717 --> 00:02:39.917
Touma: Of course not. I hate him.

00:02:39.917 --> 00:02:44.483
Touma: But the more I hate him, the more I loathe myself.

00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:48.550
Jun: With all you’ve accomplished, Young Master, I think he’ll be proud of you.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.783
Touma: …I’m sure you are right.

00:02:50.783 --> 00:02:54.850
Touma: Though I would not enjoy being praised over this.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.850
Touma: ….

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.550
Koyuki: Oh, it’s the old man!

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.783
Shakadou: Hey. You havin’ fun, General?

00:03:02.783 --> 00:03:05.017
Touma: Shakadou-san…

00:03:05.017 --> 00:03:06.950
Jun: ……

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.983
Shakadou: Everyone outside’s having a grand old time.

00:03:09.983 --> 00:03:13.950
Touma: It appears that the brunt of the enemy’s strength isn’t coming this way.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.150
Shakadou: I’m heading out.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.917
Touma: Yes, please join the attack.

00:03:19.917 --> 00:03:22.317
Touma: You are one of my Jokers.

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:26.483
Touma: Thus, you must put a halt to the enemy Joker.

00:03:26.483 --> 00:03:31.150
Touma: I ask that you take care of Mayuzumi Yukie, who is wandering through town and eliminating the Dark Cookies.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.083
Shakadou: Roger that. I was plannin’ on goin’ after her.

00:03:35.083 --> 00:03:38.083
Shakadou: So, I’ll be off. General, you have fun back here.

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.717
Touma: I already am having plenty of fun.

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:44.250
Shakadou: …You’re giving me that look again.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.817
Shakadou: The wild spark in your eyes is the same one I had in mine when I was a kid.

00:03:49.817 --> 00:03:53.950
Touma: Each of us grew up in truly worthless environments.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.717
Shakadou: Damn well we did.

00:03:55.717 --> 00:04:00.150
Shakadou: Neither of us has an outlet for our anger. So let’s vent it out, together… Hee hee.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.850
Shakadou: After all, our interests align…

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.183
Koyuki: Want a marshmallow?

00:04:05.183 --> 00:04:07.917
Shakadou: Oh, maybe I’ll take one.

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:10.850
Shakadou: Damn, this is good! Thanks. (Pats her head)

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.117
Koyuki: Yay, yay!

00:04:13.117 --> 00:04:16.883
Shakadou: OK. Time to go rough her up!!

00:04:16.883 --> 00:04:19.950
Koyuki: Have a good trip!!

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.550
Shakadou jumped off the roof of the Child Palace.

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.217
Shakadou: Hah ha ha ha ha ha! Things have gotten fun!

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:32.283
He trembled with joy because he could fight, and his beastly howls echoed across the night sky.

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:38.417
Touma: That lump of chaos has been set free… Now, the city will descend further into mayhem.

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:44.817
Touma: …However, Shakadou is one of my friends… I wish him well.

00:04:44.817 --> 00:04:47.450
Kanayanagi Town, Kazuko vs. Angel

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.017
Angel: Weak!! Kawakami Kazuko, you’re weak! ♪

00:04:52.017 --> 00:04:54.750
The full force of Angel’s kick pounded into Kazuko’s midsection.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.350
Kazuko: Gah--*Cough*!

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.483
Angel: Time to finish you!!!!

00:04:59.483 --> 00:05:01.250
Kazuko: Not yet!

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.517
Somehow, she managed to get her naginata in front of the golf club’s downward swing.

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:09.750
Angel: Argh! Stop resisting! Give it here...

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.783
She hooked the end of her golf club around the naginata.
Angel: Argh! Stop resisting! Give it here...

00:05:09.783 --> 00:05:12.550
She hooked the end of her golf club around the naginata.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.583
Angel: It's mine now!!

00:05:14.583 --> 00:05:16.617
Kazuko: Ah! My weapon!

00:05:16.617 --> 00:05:19.383
Angel snatched Kazuko’s naginata.

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:23.250
Angel: It’s all over! You’re dead, girl!!

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.883
She swung with her club.

00:05:25.883 --> 00:05:28.250
Kazuko: I’m not giving up yet!

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.083
With a smack, Kazuko grabbed at the golf club with both her hands.

00:05:31.083 --> 00:05:34.183
Angel: Ah, you bitch!!! Let go…!!!

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:36.283
Kazuko: HIYA!!!

00:05:36.283 --> 00:05:39.483
Still holding onto the club, she kicked her legs upward, snapping the weapon in two.

00:05:39.483 --> 00:05:42.650
Angel: Ah, my weapon!!

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.383
Angel: I’m gonna fucking execute you! OM NOM NOM!

00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:49.883
She began taking more medicine to further heighten her abilities.

00:05:49.883 --> 00:05:53.917
Angel: I can still fight bare-handed… Take this!

00:05:53.917 --> 00:05:56.083
Kazuko: Ugh!

00:05:56.083 --> 00:06:01.083
Angel: You’re too badly hurt to stand a chance, girl… See?!

00:06:01.083 --> 00:06:02.783
Kazuko: Hagh!

00:06:02.783 --> 00:06:08.050
Angel: I’ve got the advantage! Here’s a roundhouse kick!

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.217
Kazuko: Wah!!

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:14.850
Angel: Now, resign yourself to your fate.

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.417
Kazuko: *Huff*, *huff*, *huff*. Not yet…

00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:24.383
Angel: You stupid? There’s nothing you can do to win now.

00:06:24.383 --> 00:06:28.817
Angel: Huh? Huh? Wh—What? Huh?!

00:06:28.817 --> 00:06:33.650
Angel: My—My body’s trembling…?!

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.617
Angel: I can’t see straight… What’s going on?!

00:06:40.617 --> 00:06:45.283
Angel: *Huff*… *Huff*… Well, you see….

00:06:45.283 --> 00:06:50.183
Kazuko: You’ve taken so much medicine that, you know.

00:06:50.183 --> 00:06:57.817
Angel: ?! R—Ridiculous… Ooh, I feel sick…

00:06:57.817 --> 00:07:02.817
Kazuko: You thought your phony strength would give you a decisive win.

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:08.317
Kazuko: But I persevered and won! Ha!!

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.317
Angel: Guhaw!!

00:07:10.317 --> 00:07:13.117
Kazuko’s punch sent Angel flying.

00:07:13.117 --> 00:07:18.550
Kazuko: I basically don’t care about drugs or any of that.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.983
Kazuko: But using medicine to make yourself stronger is just too selfish.

00:07:22.983 --> 00:07:25.083
Angel: …Kh!

00:07:25.083 --> 00:07:30.183
Kazuko: Now reflect on your actions! Kawakami-style Ougi!!

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:32.450
Angel: WAIT--

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.183
Kazuko: Scorpion Strike!!!!!

00:07:36.183 --> 00:07:39.217
Angel: Ugghhaaaaa!!!

00:07:39.217 --> 00:07:41.817
Her punch scored a critical hit against Angel.

00:07:41.817 --> 00:07:43.783
Angel: Kah… ugh!

00:07:43.783 --> 00:07:47.117
With a snap, Angel fell unconscious.

00:07:47.117 --> 00:07:52.917
Kazuko: …*Huff*, *Huff*, *huff*… *Sigh*~~

00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:54.817
Kazuko: Yeah!!

00:07:54.817 --> 00:07:57.683
With that, Kawakami Kazuko finished brilliantly passing judgment on Itagaki Angel.
