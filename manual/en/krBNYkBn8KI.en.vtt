Hi guys, squirtdude here and welcome to another
episode of minecraft unmodded. This is where

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.850
we take popular mods in the mine craft community
and recreate certain elements of it using

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.199
mechanics within the game. In this episode
we are going to take a look at the mod terrefirmacraft.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.509
This mod basically reinvents survival mine
craft by adding more realistic gameplay. The

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.730
thing we are going to recreate from this mod
is it's randomly appearing cave ins

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.300
In the mod cave ins are rare and can trigger
randomly whenever a player mines in a cave.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.680
Using commands, redstone, and some few workarounds
the same effect can be duplicated in vanilla

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.370
mine craft. and it looks pretty good if you
ask me.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:49.370
Now, the way this works is pretty straight
forward. The whole system has two main sections.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:54.719
First part detects when a cave in should happen
by keeping track of a certain event. In this

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.579
case it is using a set block clock to constantly
check for whenever a player mines a stone

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.879
block. The output of that then goes into a
randomizer which controls the frequency of

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.189
the cave ins. If the randomizer outputs a
signal it then goes to the second part of

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.570
the system which triggers the actual cave
in and resets the whole thing. This part uses

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.420
a modified version of Danda Game's clever
method of "Using fill destroy on certain blocks"

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.329
If you want more information on this particular
concept then I suggest you check out his tutorial

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.430
but as always, all of the commands I use will
be in the description. The simple explanation

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.579
of how it works is that it replaces a certain
block with a flower. When it does this is

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.939
cause the flower to immediately break into
item form, which essentially allows you to

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:48.729
turn a block into an entity that can then
be tracked. This entity is then checked for

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.670
stone above and if it is successful it then
spawns falling sand to replace it. All of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.840
this happens in 1 tick

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.109
What is neat about this concept is that the
trigger can be modified to anything you want.

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:07.030
It could be mining a particular block or even
exploding TNT. Just crush yourself in anyway

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.450
you find fulfilling.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.280
I know cave in's are a just a mere fraction
of what mod contains so If you have suggestions

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.540
on other elements from terrefirmacraft I should
recreate, or have suggestions on concepts

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.470
from other mods please let me know! Well Thats
about it for now, appreciate you guys for

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.980
watching and I will catch you next time.
