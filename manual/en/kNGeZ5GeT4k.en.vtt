00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:01.251
- Hi everybody!

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.928
My name is Tyler Oakley and I am here

00:00:02.928 --> 00:00:04.204
with the one and only...

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.064
- Korey Kuhl.

00:00:05.064 --> 00:00:06.004
- Korey Kuhl!

00:00:06.004 --> 00:00:07.709
So Korey, this is our third year

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:09.009
doing this, what are we doing?

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.086
- We're doing the
chicken nugget challenge.

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:13.584
- For the third year in a row.

00:00:13.584 --> 00:00:14.931
I think this should be the final year.

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.068
- I'm literally never doing this again.

00:00:17.068 --> 00:00:18.541
- Even picking these chicken nuggets up,

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:19.676
I was like...

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.542
- I'm trying as hard as I can

00:00:22.542 --> 00:00:24.370
to be happy about this situation.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.507
- 20 minutes on the timer,

00:00:25.507 --> 00:00:26.808
we're supposed to eat as many as we can.

00:00:26.808 --> 00:00:28.501
The first year you you did...

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.246
- 50.

00:00:29.246 --> 00:00:30.349
- The second year you did...

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.508
- 51.

00:00:31.508 --> 00:00:32.764
- This year, how many are you doing?

00:00:32.764 --> 00:00:34.307
- I, well...

00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:35.202
- You're competitive,

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:36.628
so as much as you hate this, I feel like

00:00:36.628 --> 00:00:37.846
you're gonna try to do 52.
- [Korey] It's funny because

00:00:37.846 --> 00:00:39.230
I am competitive, but I'm also

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.110
not into this at all, so I'm just looking

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.261
to get like 50 at least.

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:45.649
- The first year I did 44, I think.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:46.729
- [Korey] Yeah.
- [Tyler] 43, and then the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:48.865
second year I did like 33.

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:49.691
- You were awful.

00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:52.150
- I was so bad last year,
but this year I feel like I'm

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.847
Starvation Station for the Nation,

00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:55.901
I'm Hungersville, U.S.A.,

00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:59.530
I'm ready to eat, and I have
been stretching my stomach.

00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.530
I haven't been doing that.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.443
Three, two, one.
- [Korey] I'm not happy.

00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:07.488
- [Tyler] (screams) It's happening.

00:01:07.488 --> 00:01:09.146
Oh my God, no.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.667
- Get your ranch out.

00:01:10.667 --> 00:01:12.363
- Amateur mistake is dipping.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:13.281
- Oh.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.744
- But I really want ranch.

00:01:14.744 --> 00:01:16.264
- They only gave us two ranches,

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:17.703
so you have to share.

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.247
- Well, I'm already beating you.

00:01:19.247 --> 00:01:22.258
Mm, I gotta say this is really good.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:25.359
- The first three are always really good.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.440
- Mhmm.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.285
Have you had a chicken
nugget since last year?

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:28.924
- Yeah.

00:01:28.924 --> 00:01:30.850
Sometimes you just want a nugget.

00:01:32.145 --> 00:01:34.031
Are you already breathing heavy?

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:37.687
- Remember when I sneezed
a chicken nugget last year?

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:39.730
- That alone is gonna make me puke.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.426
- 10 nuggets down.

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:44.374
- I have already beaten you to it.

00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:45.745
- Let me have my small victory,

00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:47.010
you're gonna win overall.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.692
So you guys may know this, or you may not,

00:01:48.692 --> 00:01:50.631
Korey and I have a podcast together.

00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:52.745
We shoulda done the chicken
nugget challenge as a podcast.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.370
I guess it would just be a lot of chewing.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.423
- You're wasting time.

00:01:56.423 --> 00:01:57.725
- I am on my second box.

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.867
- I hear you chewing so loudly.

00:02:01.286 --> 00:02:02.552
Do you have the meat sweats?

00:02:03.828 --> 00:02:06.014
Daddy chose black for a reason.

00:02:06.014 --> 00:02:07.673
- You can't see my sweat sweat.

00:02:07.673 --> 00:02:09.089
I feel like I'm in a good rhythm,

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:10.367
the rhythm is gonna getcha.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:11.807
- The nuggets are gonna get ya.

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:13.314
- You know how there's like gay animals?

00:02:13.314 --> 00:02:14.708
- Are there gay animals?

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:18.295
- Like, a seahorse can fuck some,

00:02:18.295 --> 00:02:19.131
seahorses fuck.

00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:20.513
- K, are you trying to
say a seahorse fucked

00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:23.276
a different animal, or a
seahorse fucked a seahorse?

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:26.005
- My question is, do you
think there's a gay chickens?

00:02:27.072 --> 00:02:28.628
Do you think we're eating our people?

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:30.192
- Gay chickens.

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:34.735
- I'm, like, killing it, I'm
doing actually really good.

00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:37.334
- What's your favorite shape
nugget, have we discussed this?

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:38.634
- I don't know, but the last nugget

00:02:38.634 --> 00:02:41.277
was an instant mood changer.

00:02:42.524 --> 00:02:43.987
- What's your favorite shape?

00:02:43.987 --> 00:02:45.056
- Boot.

00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:46.947
What's yours?

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:48.154
- I thought about my favorite shape

00:02:48.154 --> 00:02:50.194
being the circle, 'cause my two nuggets

00:02:50.194 --> 00:02:52.586
were circles, the last in these boxes.

00:02:52.586 --> 00:02:54.978
- You know, that was a riveting story.

00:02:54.978 --> 00:02:56.940
- You're a riveting story.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.056
I want that.

00:02:59.087 --> 00:03:00.643
Daddy splashed.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:01.979
- Oh me, oh my.

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.360
I made a drip.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.078
- You refrigerate your ketchup?

00:03:05.078 --> 00:03:06.843
- Who doesn't refrigerate their ketchup?

00:03:06.843 --> 00:03:09.060
- Yuck, I hate cold ketchup.

00:03:09.906 --> 00:03:11.229
- Ketchup is good.

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:12.807
You know when you just feel sick?

00:03:12.807 --> 00:03:15.718
- The one time a year
when you eat 50 nuggets?

00:03:15.718 --> 00:03:17.311
I need another.

00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:18.154
- Hold on.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.155
Okay.

00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:23.825
It's heavy.
- [Korey] It was like way

00:03:23.825 --> 00:03:25.906
and the box is sweaty wetty.

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:26.987
- No that's just me.

00:03:26.987 --> 00:03:28.727
You want me to touch you with it?

00:03:28.727 --> 00:03:29.470
- Stop.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.689
- Done.

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:33.034
- If you had to be a gay chicken...

00:03:33.034 --> 00:03:34.812
- Okay, would you be a top or a bottom?

00:03:34.812 --> 00:03:36.448
Do chickens even fuck?

00:03:36.448 --> 00:03:37.884
Are you okay?

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:40.147
- They got stuck in my throat,

00:03:40.147 --> 00:03:42.017
but then it was like Slip 'n' Slide it.

00:03:42.017 --> 00:03:43.143
- It might've been a beak.

00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:44.003
- It's claw.

00:03:44.003 --> 00:03:45.360
It's toe claw.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.277
- It's called a talon.

00:03:46.277 --> 00:03:47.903
I got shit on by a bird the other day.

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:49.156
- Nuh-uh.

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:50.284
- At Starbucks.

00:03:50.284 --> 00:03:51.978
Do you watch my videos?

00:03:51.978 --> 00:03:53.279
How dare you.

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:54.161
- I don't know if that's crust

00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:55.425
in the corner of your eye

00:03:55.425 --> 00:03:57.875
from like sleep or a chicken nugget.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.224
- I can literally see my
reflection in my fingers.

00:04:02.224 --> 00:04:04.154
It's so greasy.

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:06.227
I need to like push up my glasses,

00:04:06.227 --> 00:04:08.365
but I'm gonna start seeing Smudge-ville.

00:04:08.365 --> 00:04:09.944
- Oh, so suddenly you care about

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:11.987
the smudges on your glasses?

00:04:11.987 --> 00:04:13.020
Do you feel like if you farted

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.142
you'd make more room?

00:04:16.548 --> 00:04:18.663
- Did you shit in preparation
for this to make room?

00:04:18.663 --> 00:04:19.661
- No.

00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.625
I should have maked

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.660
to make room.
- [Tyler] Amateur mistake.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.408
- [Korey] Please, I've yet
to lose to you at this game.

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:27.285
- Well I do feel like I am about to die.

00:04:27.285 --> 00:04:28.737
(belches)

00:04:28.737 --> 00:04:30.419
(coughs)

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.218
- You literally lose count.

00:04:35.053 --> 00:04:36.152
Wait.

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:37.630
- I'm beating last year.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.277
I feel like I'm dead, but
I'm beating last year.

00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:41.520
- That nugget puts you over the top.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.981
- If I finish this, I beat last year.

00:04:43.981 --> 00:04:44.957
I can do it.

00:04:44.957 --> 00:04:46.001
- My favorite part of last year

00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:47.441
was winkin' at the nugget.

00:04:47.441 --> 00:04:49.159
Do you remember when I
winked at the nugget?

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:50.854
- You know I was very busy dying.

00:04:50.854 --> 00:04:54.638
I just feel, I'm at 35, and
I feel like this might be it.

00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:56.437
- I'm stickin' to the chicken.

00:04:56.437 --> 00:04:58.399
- I'm stickin' to the sweet and sour.

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:01.198
Honestly, I'm like if I
even look at another...

00:05:02.213 --> 00:05:04.170
- No.
- [Tyler] No.

00:05:06.971 --> 00:05:07.772
Got it.

00:05:07.772 --> 00:05:09.734
- Wait, there's like 90 seconds left.

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:13.319
- There's literally no way I
can eat the rest of this boot.

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:15.933
Have you ever peed in a boot?

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:17.511
I know you have.

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:19.254
Spring Break, 2008.

00:05:19.254 --> 00:05:20.518
Is that your last one?

00:05:20.518 --> 00:05:23.430
There's like, I have so many left.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.846
- I'm quitting at 50.

00:05:24.846 --> 00:05:27.585
- I don't like that I can
squish it and see the juices.

00:05:30.407 --> 00:05:31.545
- There's 10 seconds left.

00:05:31.545 --> 00:05:32.370
- Are you kidding?

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.693
Wait, I have a little
bit left of this one.

00:05:33.693 --> 00:05:35.724
- I (indiscernible) after this.

00:05:35.724 --> 00:05:37.373
That was my last one.

00:05:39.864 --> 00:05:41.956
(alarm beeping)

00:05:44.048 --> 00:05:45.116
- I did my 50.

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:45.789
- Did you?

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.218
Well I have good news
- [Korey] I don't believe

00:05:47.218 --> 00:05:48.849
your counting, first of all.
- [Tyler] Count them.

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:49.381
Count them.

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:50.379
I did 40.

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.598
You know, I'm in between
year one and year two.

00:05:52.598 --> 00:05:54.001
I feel happy about it,

00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:56.080
I don't feel happy
about my body right now.

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.043
Would you ever do it again?

00:05:57.043 --> 00:05:58.018
- No.
- [Tyler] Okay, good.

00:05:58.018 --> 00:05:59.431
I think we're done.

00:06:00.754 --> 00:06:02.668
That had ketchup on it, my carpet!

00:06:02.668 --> 00:06:03.829
- It did not.

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:06.291
- If you like this video, be
sure to give it a thumbs up.

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.486
If you wanna see the latest video,

00:06:07.486 --> 00:06:09.204
where can they click, Kor?

00:06:09.204 --> 00:06:10.029
Over there.
- [Korey] You point

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.084
on the screen for me.

00:06:11.084 --> 00:06:13.053
You point to the right of the nuggets.

00:06:13.053 --> 00:06:15.512
- If you want to, oh my,

00:06:15.512 --> 00:06:17.544
if you wanna hear the latest podcast...

00:06:17.544 --> 00:06:18.868
- Have we gone back-to-back yet?
