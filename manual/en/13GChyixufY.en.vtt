00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
To all of you beautiful people who will never stop chasing the dream.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.000
We're living in time when there are so many options

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.800
But sometimes, you see, we can't really choose

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.000
And if not game of mind, it's a play of emotions

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.080
But those silly things just can't make me lose

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.600
We're living in time when the powers are fighting

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.320
But what if we're small, and just want a little bit of life?

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.160
I still believe and I'm hoping that someday

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.800
There'll be peace on this Earth for us all

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.540
Sun shines... or so what if it's raining?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.040
I'm gonna get out on the street

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.400
People smiling when I say "Hey!"

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.780
So what if that is all I need?

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.160
Turn it on! I will be dancing!

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.880
Music breaks out of my head

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.340
Yes, inside I'm always sixteen!

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.660
So what if that was all I had?

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.860
So what if I am just a dreamer?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.040
I'm gonna dream of better day, of better time...

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.900
Spring will come, things will come clearer!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.260
I feel love is in the air...

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.920
Love is in the air!

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.400
What I want from this life...

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.980
Wanna live, wanna fly

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.820
Is it worth being suspended in time?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.440
And no matter how long can I be chasing the dream

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.400
Wouldn't stop for no reason

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.800
'Till the end will be real

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.040
Waking up every morning I will happily scream:

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.440
"Hello world! This is me!"

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.340
And so I begin

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:46.080
So I begin...
