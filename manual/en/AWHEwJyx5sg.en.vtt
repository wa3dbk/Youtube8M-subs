Hi everyone and welcome back to lancengi in
todays video I am going to be showing three

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.780
easy nail designs that are sure to be the
ultimate nail art guide for Christmas nails.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.769
In this video I am actually only going to
be using Formula X the holiday gift set from

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.769
Sephora.

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.030
I bought this set for thirty-nine dollars
and it comes with twenty-two mini polishes.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:45.160
It really is the ultimate gift for anyone,
a secret Santa, or if you’re a beginner,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.270
I mean I have a ton of nail polishes and I
would love this gift.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.039
Let me know in the comments down below if
you would like me to do a review on this holiday

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.710
polish gift set by commenting down below or
thumbing up this video.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.600
Mani #1 To start off manicure number 1 paint
your nails any color you would like.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.650
To create the present on your nail your going
to take a nail stripper and some polish and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.580
apply the polish to the right third of your
nail vertically.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.390
Now take the nail stripper and apply the polish
horizontally across your nail.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.360
Taking a tooth pick and some polish place
a dot in the center of the cross section.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.880
Now create an oval shape that meets in the
origin.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.950
Repeat for the other side of the bow.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.520
To create the end of the ribbon your going
to take your dotting tool and create a curved

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.160
line that is going to create a “C”

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.539
Here is what the finished manicure looks like.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.790
I really love this blue color I think it really
reminds me of beautiful Christmas presents

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.600
under my Christmas tree.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.460
I think this nail design is simple and elegant
and really gets you into the holiday sprit.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.929
i hope you want to recreate manicure number
one.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.530
Lets move onto manicure number two

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.100
manicure number two. to recreate manicure
number two, take two coats of any polish you

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.750
would like and apply it to your nail

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.350
Next taking a nail stripper your going to
create a horizontal line at the center of

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.300
your nail and two vertical lines that start
at the center and work its way down.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.050
Then taking your nail brush
Fill in the rectangle portion on your nail

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.170
now taking a nail stripper create a cross
in the center of your nail by placing a vertical

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.060
line down the center of your present and I
find its easiest if you do the horizontal

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.730
line in two sections.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.440
I like the bow to be centered so I place three
guiding dots.so the top dots are going to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.540
be were my bow is going to end and the center
dot is going to be where the center dot is

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.540
going start.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.280
And I just create an oval by shaping the curve
line now to create the bottom of my bow I'm

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.790
going to take my nail striper and a dot to
the center and work the ribbon out words to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.210
create a C shape here's what the finish manicure
it looks like when you're all done and you

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:27.010
apply a topcoat I love the way this manicure
looks and you can add different color presents

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.350
to this look or you can add it as an accent
it's really up to you

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.840
if you re-create it make sure you send me
a picture let's move onto manicure number

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.830
three
manicure number three to re-create manicure

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.270
number three you're going to use a red polish
and apply it to the tip of your nail you don't

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.100
have to be perfect here because we are going
to go in and cover up the edge of the Red

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.100
tip.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.380
To create the present you can even use a male
stripper or a dotting tool if you're a beginner

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.773
Ivory recommend using a dotting tool and that's
how I'm going to show you how to do it now

00:04:02.773 --> 00:04:08.043
create a triangle or in a 90° angle that
connects with the red tip now fill in the

00:04:08.043 --> 00:04:14.569
rest that portion in and allow it to dry now
at the ribbon to your present by TNL striper

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.959
and making across in the center of your present
now to top off your present with a bow use

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.540
a bobby pin or a dining tool and create a
heart shape ribbon now to create the top of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.630

dining tool and create white dots along the
