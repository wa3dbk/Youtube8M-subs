As we talk about beginning piano basics, again,
we are going to cover some things that will

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.030
help you better understand this music. As
you look at music, there are what we call

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:23.660
sharps and flats, which are notes that have
been modified slightly from the original note

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:32.910
in order to produce the correct pitch within
the music itself. If we're talking about a

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.089
sharp, we are talking about taking a note,
the note that is written and raising it a

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.249
half step, meaning that you're going to want
to go up a half step from the note that you

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:51.850
start on. When we talk about a flat, that
a flat will actually lower a note a half step.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.729
Now, here let me take a second and show you
what I'm going to talk, what I'm talking about.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:03.280
If we're looking at a keyboard, again, find
middle C. Take yourself to the two notes that

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.920
don't have them between it, right next to
these two. Okay? And as you find the black

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.939
keys here, you're going to go to the one that's
just to the corner of it, to the left corner.

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:19.670
This here is middle C. Okay? Now if we want
to take middle C and we want to do something

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:28.360
to it, okay, we are going to add a sharp to
that, let's say. Now, a half step, each one

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.320
of these is a half step. Now, if I go another
half step, I have now moved up a whole step.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.630
So this is C-sharp, right here. Okay? Now,
if we want to take a note and we want to flat

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.190
it, we'll start at the next note up, which
this note here is D. Okay? And we are going

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:53.990
to go down a half step. So this would also
be D-flat. They are the same note. C-sharp

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.350
and D-flat will end up being the same note
on the keyboard. Now, as you look at the music

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.369
here, you're going to look at the, you're
going to see some different symbols that you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.421
hadn't seen before. These symbols here represent
what we just talked about. This symbol here

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:19.390
that looks sort of like a numbers sign is
a sharp. That is a sharp to tell you that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.040
that note has been sharped and raised a half
step. If we slide over here, we look at this,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.150
we have another sharp here. And the note next
to it has this other looking symbol here.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:36.280
This is a natural symbol. This shows that
the note has now been moved back to its original

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.480
position and gone back. So we've now lowered
it a half step once again. Okay? Now, of what

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.290
a flat symbol looks like, we've got one down
here. This is a flat symbol. It kind of looks

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.190
like the letter B, with just a little bit
of a clip off of it. Okay? And normally these

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.480
are placed in front of the notes, the same
way that the sharps were. And again, these

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.290
will also, these will lower the note that
you have written another half step.
