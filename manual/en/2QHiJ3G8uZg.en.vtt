00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:04.939
You think you're the victim of medical negligence
and you suffered a significant injury as a

00:00:04.939 --> 00:00:09.060
result of that and you want to learn what
the legal process is in order to evaluate

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.170
a possible case to understand to give you
better understanding of exactly what's next

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.460
in the process.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.460
Wanna learn more?

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.260
Come join me, I'm Gerry Oginski, I'm a New
York medical malpractice and personal injury

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.250
trial attorney practicing law here in the
state of New York.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.830
The first step is a quick screening call that
you're going to have with the attorney that

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.040
should last no more than two or three minutes.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.310
That call is designed to get some basic information
to determine whether or not to even invite

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.670
you into the office for a full consultation.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.050
Assuming you're invited into the office then
you'll sit down with the attorney for about

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.050
an hour.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.630
He or she will then go through and ask you
lots of questions about what you think was

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.989
done wrong and what injuries you suffered
as a result of that and take you through step

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.440
by step exactly what occurred.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.079
Now, assuming the attorney has invited you
in and now undertakes to do a full investigation

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.789
the next step that occurs is that the attorney
is going to request all of your medical records.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.290
And once those records come in, the attorney
is then going to read and review all of those

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.200
records as well as sending them out to medical
experts for confirmation that not only is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.119
there wrongdoing but that the wrongdoing caused
injury and that the injury is significant

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.119
and permanent.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.830
And once the medical expert confirms all three
of those elements, then you have a legal basis

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490
to proceed forward with a case in New York.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.260
Now, here are the steps and I'm going to go
through them really quickly in a marathon

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.210
fashion to give you a quick sense of what’s
involved in bringing this type of case.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.740
Assuming you have a valid basis for a case,
the first thing the attorney does is prepare

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.340
a document called the summons and complaint.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.330
We take that document, bring it into court
and we buy an index number.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.460
That’s an identifying number.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.200
Once that occurs, we file it with the clerk,
then we take that document and deliver it

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.619
to the people that you are suing.

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.340
Once that’s been done, we then have to wait
for an answer - an answer to the allegations

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.170
of the complaint.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.530
Once we receive an answer, we then let the
court know that issue has been joined meaning

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.780
that all the sides that you are suing all
the different people that you are suing have

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.749
now answered the allegations and in all likelihood
they're going to deny the allegations and

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.480
that’s typical and routine.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.180
So what happens next?

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.590
The court will give us a date and time to
come in to set up a scheduling conference

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.599
and a scheduling conference is just that.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.700
It’s a guideline of when things are supposed
to happen during the course of your litigation.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.169
Scheduling involves dates of your question
and answer session known as a deposition.

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:34.239
Dates that attorneys are supposed to exchange
certain documents to each other.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.809
Dates for the next conference.

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.999
The next thing that will happen that you're
involved in is something called the deposition.

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:43.519
And that’s a question and answer session,
your attorney will prepare you for that.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.540
And after you've completed your question and
answer session then the next step is that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.890
your attorney will have an opportunity to
question all the people that you have sued.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.319
And after all of those depositions, also known
as an examination before a trial, are done

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.499
and after all those documents that are supposed
to be exchanged are exchanged among the parties,

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:06.779
the next step that will occur is we notify
the court that the case is technically ready

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:07.779
for trial.

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:08.840
What does that mean?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.859
It means we file a document called a note
of issue which says to the court, hello court,

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.939
hello judge, our case is now ready for trial,
please put us on the calendar, on the trial

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:20.019
calendar.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.839
And what happens literally is we get put on
the bottom of the calendar and over time our

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:26.189
case rises to the top.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.510
It will be months before we get notified to
come in for a pretrial conference.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.089
Those are basically conferences designed to
let the court know what’s going on, whether

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:39.299
or not there is a possibility of settlement
or negotiation that we can try and enter into

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.939
and if not we get a trial date.

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.559
And the next step after that is we appear
for trial.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:49.769
Now, your case can be settled at any time
during the litigation process.

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.049
So your attorney is going to notify you and
let you know if and when an offer to settle

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.139
your case is made.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.419
The trial process is an interesting one because
it begins with jury selection.

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:05.949
Jury selection is a fascinating process whereby
we select people from the community to come

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.419
and listen to try and make a decision about
the dispute in your case.

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.329
Once jury selection has been finished and
we have a judge who's been assigned to your

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.269
particular case to try it, then we begin the
trial process.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.959
And depending upon the type of case, and how
many witnesses and experts we have to bring

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.810
in, the case could last for a few days or
a few weeks or even more.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.340
And that’s just an overview of what goes
on when evaluating a possible medical malpractice

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.220
case here in the state of New York.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.200
And some of the basic steps that occur in
the litigation process.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.639
So why do I tell you this?

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.550
I tell you this to educate you and teach you
about how the process works here in the state

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.550
