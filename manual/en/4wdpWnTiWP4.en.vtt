Hi this is Alia and welcome back to my kitchen!

00:00:09.654 --> 00:00:13.137
Today, I'm going to show you how to make the cheesecake, the easy way.

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:16.970
First, this is a no bake cheesecake, so 
 you don't even have to bake it

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.338
Second, the ingredients are so easy to find and I'm 
 not even using the gluten in the cheesecake.

00:00:23.338 --> 00:00:26.289
Third, it's amazing lead delicious 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.596
So, all have to do is to watch the video, get the 
 ingredients below the video in the about section and make it.

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:34.314
Let's start!!! 

00:00:34.314 --> 00:00:36.078
Let’s prepare the crust.

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:38.586
First, melt the butter in the microwave.

00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:41.652
In a food processor, finely ground the cookies!

00:00:41.652 --> 00:00:45.506
 Add the sugar and continue mixing until they become like sand.

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:47.920
Count two cups of the cookie mixture.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.261
Add the melted butter, little by little while mixing, until well incorporated.

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, let’s get our baking pan ready. 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.670
 I am using a cheesecake pan with a removable bottom part.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.500
If you don’t have it, use any pan you 
 have – it will still taste the same!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.815
Pour the crumbs into the pan –notice I 
 lined up the bottom with parchment paper

00:01:09.815 --> 00:01:13.881
it is so much easier when cutting and serving the cheesecake!

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:20.104
Using the bottom of a cup, press the crumbs down 
 into the base and up the sides. 

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:23.262
Place in the fridge while preparing the filling. 

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:29.113
Here comes the cream cheese… our master ingredient in this recipe!

00:01:29.113 --> 00:01:32.782
 It has to be at room temperature, soft and creamy! 

00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:38.819
Place it in a large bowl, and beat it for 
 1 minute on low speed using an electric beater.

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.810
Add the vanilla extract and continue beating for another minute. 

00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:47.758
Now add the sweetened condensed milk and continue beating, on medium speed, 

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:53.796
for around 5 minutes until you get this smooth amazing creamy mixture!

00:01:53.796 --> 00:02:02.248
We’re almost done! Melt the chocolate in the microwave, in 30 second shots 
 and mixing in between so you do not burn it. 

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:09.040
Pour the cream cheese mixture on top of the crust and smooth 
 it out with a spatula… oh look at this! 

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:16.550
Now if you want to be all fancy, pour the 
 melted chocolate in a spiral on the cheesecake mixture

00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:23.889
and using a knife or skewer, make swirly movements 
 to get these beautiful artistic chocolate swirls! 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:29.550
Now cover all this goodness and place the cheesecake 
 in the fridge for at least 4 hours

00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:31.969
and I mean it. You have to wait! 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:37.820
And here we are!!!! Look at this! The perfect cheesecake bite

00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:43.997
 I placed my cheesecake for 4 hours in the fridge and it 
 is a bit soft, but I like it this way. 

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:47.759
If you want it firmer, keep it overnight in the fridge. 

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:54.999
Check this out soft, crumbly, and creamy… exactly how it should be… YUMMMY

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:57.840
Bon Appetit
