00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Guten tag!

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.200
Today this video will be more geeky than usual.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Today I'm here in Frankfurt, Commerzbank Arena, and is not for a football game.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.200
It's for a championship of computer games. Called DotA 2.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
"Defense Of The Ancients 2"

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.000
It is an extremely popular game and has a very intense professional scene.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.000
I like it very much! Elissa not so much, but she is going to to join me anyways.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.300
Let's see how it goes.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.500
The staff managed to organize a spectacular event here at ESL One.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.700
They invited the best players of DotA 2 in the world to participate.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.300
And the games are pretty interesting so far.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.000
And only here in Germany you can enjoy a computer game on a giant screen, sipping a pilsen of the highest quality.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Or, if you are one of ten girls who came for the event, rosé wine.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.700
We left Berlin to Frankfurt early on Saturday. It was around 7am ...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In about 4 hours we reached the city, using the ICE train - Inter City Express.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:16.800
It travels at 300 km/h, and we get a good discount on the ticket. In one of the german supermarket chains was a promotion of 79 euros to get to and from any city. And this is a very good price for a city so far away.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The scene of DotA 2 is very interesting. It is this little world where these people become celebrities, distribute autographs and take pictures with everyone.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
It's really cool to see other major nerds, like me, become so popular.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
The total value of tickets for the event was 54.90 euros.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Luckily for us, was a gift from our dear friend Mr. Lupa.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.200

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.000
Just like in any sport, there are the favorites.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.900
And just like in the World Cup this year, the favorites are falling one by one.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.800
It's been an amazing year for sports and for e-sports.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.300
So that's it, if you enjoyed the video and the event, like it :)
