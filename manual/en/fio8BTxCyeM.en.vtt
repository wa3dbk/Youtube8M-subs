00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:24.000
A single shining pearl I string upon a golden thread

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.720
And turn my ear to listen to a singing voice on the night wind

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:41.440
My heart, hidden away in sleep

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:52.340
Plays in a far away world

00:00:52.340 --> 00:01:01.030
This tone playing in my soul

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:09.840
Fades away so quickly, and is thus, beautiful

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:25.660
For tomorrow I’ll return the tears I’ve let fall to the sky

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:53.380
A single piece of broken coral I wrap in a golden cloth

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:02.090
And turn my ear to listen to the sounds of rice plants waving

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:10.890
My heart, hidden away in waking

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:21.760
Dreams of the eastern country where I was born

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.530
Tying this ribbon that has come undone

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:41.420
All smiles here and there begin to fade

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:50.150
This galaxy wavering in my soul

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.910
Lingers so distant, and is thus, beautiful

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:16.320
For even this pain I’ve lost at day break will surely be able to smile

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:36.010
For tomorrow I’ll return the tears I’ve let fall to the sky
