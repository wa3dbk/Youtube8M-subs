&gt;&gt; MONICA: Hey, my name's Monica Ward,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.050
and I'm here today to give you a little tip about the 21 Day Fix Meal Plan.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.500
Now, it may appear that I'm crying and that these are tears of super joy for having discovered this awesome tip,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.200
but the truth is, this onion...these onion fumes are just like taking over in the kitchen.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.900
So, it's a good thing that you're on the other side of this video.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.200
One of the things that I've discovered is that I just don't feel like I get enough

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.750
of the vegetable variety that I like to eat normally in my day,

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.030
so what I did was I created a vegetable medley.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.080
In the vegetable medley...

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.900
in this Tupperware, I put in some organic cucumbers.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.900
I put in some onions and I put in some heirloom tomatoes.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.500
Those things are super delicious and I love them topped on top of my...my salad.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.800
I've already put in some of my mixed greens for one serving of my green,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:24.100
and I can quick go to the fridge and just get out another section or another portion of green for the 21 Day Fix meal planning.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.509
And, BOOM! I now have two servings of green, ready to go,

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.300
and if I already precooked some of my hardboiled eggs,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.659
I can put stuff in for my red container.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.000
I already have my dressing prepped.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:47.700
I will have that ready to go and it just makes planning a lot easier when you're doing the 21 Day Fix Meal Plan.

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:53.879
See? Tune in for some more tips that I'm discovering in my 21 Day journey.
