00:00:06.323 --> 00:00:09.668
This is one of those nights, the kind you remember where you were

00:00:09.668 --> 00:00:12.422
When you have great pride in your school

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.068
the chance of a national championship in basketball means something

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:17.745
So where were you?

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:20.343
At J. Gumbo’s on the west side of campus? 

00:00:21.796 --> 00:00:22.877
It’s awesome to be a Cardinal

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:24.615
We got our team winning the Sugar Bowl

00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.992
we got our women in the national championship, we 
 got our men playing in a couple hours

00:00:28.992 --> 00:00:31.261
and let’s just talk about some other sports

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:35.822
our track team’s awesome, our soccer team’s awesome, our 
 women’s softball team is just amazing 

00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:37.526
Inside the Red Barn? 

00:00:38.795 --> 00:00:39.794
Campus experience is amazing

00:00:40.436 --> 00:00:41.992
The students here at the University of Louisville

00:00:42.127 --> 00:00:44.582
we’re all together, we rise as one

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:50.917
The last game we played here, the Final Four, it 
 was amazing, the students rally together as we won

00:00:50.973 --> 00:00:52.591
it’s just an incredible experience here. 

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:56.504
Along Cardinal Boulevard, the new hot spot on the north end of campus?

00:00:59.919 --> 00:01:02.380
Chelsea Hall is a junior from Northern Kentucky. 

00:01:02.452 --> 00:01:07.289
She has to work during the game at Cluckers 
 restaurant, but still has a great view. 

00:01:07.658 --> 00:01:11.928
We get real busy, but when something big’s happening  
 on the TV, the whole restaurant stops 

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.935
and everybody stops what they’re doing and we 
 stop and do the Cards cheers 

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:19.924
and we clap and everybody just really comes together. It’s like a 
 big family in here when the Cards start winning. 

00:01:20.559 --> 00:01:25.041
It was a truly epic battle between the Cards 
 and Michigan for the men’s basketball title.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:27.886
It kept fans on the edges of their seats 

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:33.351
Freshman tennis player and finance major Valentina Schneider is from Germany

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:38.984
She understands the lengths which student athletes work to 
 get to the pinnacle of their sport. 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.490
People only see the games on TV, so the actual competition

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.760
They don’t actually see what the student athletes actually put into it

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.390
It’s practice every day, traveling, on the flight

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:58.660
workouts, sports medicine, you have to organize everything and 
 still keep up the good grades. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.220
Quite a student experience at UofL

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:09.860
an experience you’ll remember on the night the 
 Cardinals won their 3rd men’s national championship
