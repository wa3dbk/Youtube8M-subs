00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.310
Hey everyone, welcome to another edition of
The Daily.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.620
It's Friday, August 19th here with Greg Lalas.
I'm Nick Firchau.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.370
Greg, a lot to get to, but first lets get
back to Thursday night, CONCACAF Champions

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.830
League.
Toronto FC, they go down to Panama, they get

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.890
a 2-1 win over Taro FC.
A big win for Toronto, a big win for MLS.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.860
MLS makes it 5 for 5 on match day one in the
CCL group stage.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.610
It was Julian de Guzman with a rare goal that
got Toronto going.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.300
Ryan Johnson with the other goal for them.
They gave up a penalty late when de Guzman

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.580
took one of the forwards down.
Probably a decent call

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.590
The Toronto coaches were not happy about it.
That's Toronto FC.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.240
2 for 2 in Central America so far in CCL.
Don't forget that they went down to Nicaragua

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.990
and beat Real Estle on the road as well.
They're looking good in CONCACAF Champions

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.410
League.
As they went into this game, they talked about

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.220
how these trips are beginning to help them
come together.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.880
We'll see what it does toward the third part
of the final season of MLS.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.680
This is a Toronto team that has been totally
remade.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.540
Are they going to get a lot of confidence
that they can bring into the league as well.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.460
FC Dallas and Toronto FC, both in group c
now, and they're both going to meet in the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.299
next game and get some bragging rights there.
Lets move on to regular MLS action from Thursday

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.100
night.
DC United goes to Chicago.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.909
They get a 1-1 draw.
Greg, Josh Wolf, the old Chicago Fire hero

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.759
gets one for DC United.
You know what?

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.530
DC, they're finding ways to get results and
it's pretty impressive what they're doing

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.780
on the road especially.
They're the only team in the Eastern Conference

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.740
with a winning record on the road.
Now, if they can start to get those wins at

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.130
home, picking up 3 points like that, this
is a team that could really do some damage

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.959
in the Eastern Conference.
Really upset what everyone expected.

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.850
The Dero experiment, the Dero move to pick
up Dwayne de Rosario is working beautifully.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.091
He continues to be a working presence as that
2nd forward for them.

00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:54.299
For Chicago, it was the 15th draw in the season
so far, which is an MLS record now.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.009
They need to figure out a way to make those
draws into wins, especially at home right

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.389
now.
Chicago, I think they're really struggling

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:05.799
to figure out how to win a game.
This game against DC was a great example of

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.149
that.
From the east to the west, some big news out

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.069
at LAX.
We don't usually talk airport news, but Robbie

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.950
Keane on the ground as the new LA Galaxy designated
player.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.989
He's set to meet the live press conference.
You can find that on mlssoccer.com at 3:30pm

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.819
eastern time.
It created a lot of buzz, Robbie Keane in

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.190
LA.
Yeah, he lands in LAX and the Galaxy fans

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.239
are there to meet him.
The flashbulbs are going and the singing is

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.189
happening.
Lots of autographs and things like that.

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.099
It's very exciting.
We'll see what he does on the field though.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.230
He has already come out and said throw me
in the deep end, see if I can swim, see what

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.400
I can bring, and let me show you what I can
bring to this team.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.480
From one player to another out, Jimmy Conrad,
long time MLS veteran, 13 years announces

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.680
his retirement on Thursday.
A concussion he suffered early in the season

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.500
with Chivas USA.
He hangs it up, but a great career for Jimmy

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.400
Conrad.
A lot of credit to him.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.819
You know he has been in this league for a
long time when you think about all the games

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:03.129
he's played.
Don't forget about the World Cup and the national

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.299
team and all that.
From the bottom of our heart, I think I want

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.900
to congratulate Jimmy Conrad on a wonderful
career, and wish him all the best going forward.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.959
He is going to be involved in the Chivas USA
Youth Academy.

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.291
I think it's going to be terrific to have
him around there.

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:20.070
He is a guy who all the young players can
really look up to and learn something some.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.189
Good luck with all of that Jimmy.
Lets take a look at a couple of big games

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.561
this week.
The first one has conference bragging rights,

00:03:25.561 --> 00:03:29.030
the Columbus Crew and Philadelphia Union out
at Crew Stadium.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.090
7:30pm eastern, you can follow along on MatchDay
Live.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.810
The two best teams in the east going at it
in Columbus.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.799
What is Columbus going to do?
I think they continually surprise people,

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.260
and you know what?
At this point, Zeha is in one of the top 6

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.761
or 7 coaches after his record.
It's amazing, and he continues to put out

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:51.670
a team that gets the wins.
Eddie Gavin's injury will be an issue for

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.140
them, but this is a team I think they can
fill them in.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.900
Renteria is healthy again, and he has just
5 goals in 10 games that he's been able to

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.950
play because of injury problems.
I think that this is a Columbus team that

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.959
knows how to get wins, especially at home.
From a Philadelphia standpoint, how do they

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.881
incorporate Freddy Adu.
Will he play that 2nd forward?

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:12.340
Will he play out wide?
That's what Peter Novak has to decide because

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.109
he I think is going to be this focal point.
They're going to play the game around Freddy

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.810
Adu.
A couple of big games out west.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.470
Lets start with Dallas back at home after
that big win over Pumas in the Champions League.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.490
They play host to Seattle at 9pm eastern on
MatchDay Live.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.150
Another great game.
Two great teams in this one.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.430
Fellow of course, lots of confidence coming
off that midweek game in Champions League.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.170
4-1 victors at home in their first group league
game.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.230
I think this is going to be a great game.
Two teams that like to attack and I'm expecting

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.030
lots of fireworks.
One last game I want to take a look at, and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.810
it's another round of the Cascadia Cup.
The Portland Timbers playing host to the Vancouver

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.220
White Caps, 10pm eastern at JELD WEN Frield
on Fox Soccer.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:56.060
A good game, and these are two teams that
are struggling right now, but Vancouver is

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.230
building for 2012 still.
They already announced a new coach for 2012,

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.190
so all they're doing is looking forward to
next year.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.000
Portland on the other hand, they still have
a shot to make the playoffs.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.230
It would have to start now though.
They have to get 3 points against Vancouver,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.570
a team that they should beat.
If they're going to make any run to the playoffs,

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.600
they're going to need 3 points in this one.
Don't forget, you can find a complete list

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.810
of all the games on mlssoccer.com
Don't forget the latest edition of ExtraTime

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.780
Radio came out on Thursday.
We had Daniel Hernandez talking about all

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.500
the critics of FC Dallas' win over FC Pumas.
Tommy Smith from ESPN breaking down Robbie

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.220
Keane's arrival here in MLS.
You can find that on iTunes and BuzzSprout.
