00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.359
Hi, I'm KC from G free foodie, and
today we are making gluten-free pie

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.779
crust.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:24.140
I'm gonna make enough pie crust for two
single crust or one double crust pie, you

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.510
can use a food processor like I'm going
to, or if you have way more patience than

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.730
me you can use a pastry cutter or forks
to incorporate all the ingredients. So

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.989
first I'm going to put in gluten free
flour blends, you can find one that you

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.250
love for baking or you can follow the
guide for blending your own gluten-free

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.180
flour at Gfreefoodie.com,
this is Baker sugar, so you could use

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.080
regular white sugar, or Baker's sugar is
a little bit fine finer grind, xanthan

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:08.870
gum and some salt, I'm going to give that
all a whirl in the food processor to

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.870
get it fully incorporated before we go
on to the next step.

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:30.039
Okay, so now we're gonna add our wet
ingredients, and here I have some butter

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.070
that's been partially melted, I know that
in traditional pie crust baking we don't

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.899
use partially melted butter, but we're
gluten free baking, and this time we do.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:50.649
Whoo! And so I'm gonna put this right in
here, right on top of our flour, you could

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.929
use a butter replacement if you'd like
to, I would use a butter-flavored

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.959
shortening because margarine is gonna
make your crust crispy instead of flaky,

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:07.569
and then this is some spectrum
shortening, you could use a similar

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:15.549
shortening if you don't have it, I'm gonna
put in one egg white, this recipe on our

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.170
website has an egg free conversion using
honey, so you're welcome to use that if

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.850
you'd like to, and I'm going to add four
tablespoons of ice-cold water, this is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.010
cold water, and you'll see that I have
some ice cubes floating in it because I

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:37.510
want it cold, if you're making a pie that,
you know, vanilla will go well with, I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.220
might even add some vanilla now, you
could add cinnamon if you want to flavor

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.230
your dough, this would be the time to do
that.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.220
Okay, we've got it all in there,
with four tablespoons of water I'm gonna

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.790
give it a spin.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.510
Smooth dough, and I've got a few more
little crumbles here, so I'm going to add

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.629
another tablespoon of water, and you've
just got to kind of judge this by eye,

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:14.120
maybe even tablespoon and a half roughly,
and I'm gonna give this another spin and

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:26.930
then we're ready to take it out. Okay,
our pie dough is ready to go, here you'll

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.870
see that it's smoother than conventional
pie dough, and that's okay, that's what we

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:44.239
want. I'm going to take some plastic food
wrap and put half the dough in here,

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.620
shape it into a disc, and I'm gonna get
it ready for rolling so again. This

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:59.030
recipe is a double pie crust recipe, so
you've either got some dough left over

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.650
to make another single crust pie, or you
can split it in to do and make a double

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:13.130
crust pie, so we're just gonna wrap this
up and shape it into a disc, and this can

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.280
go right into the fridge,
or you could roll it right now if you

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.160
wanted to. Alright, we're ready to roll
out our gluten-free pie dough, and before

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.570
we start this, you need to know two
things, gluten free pie dough is stickier

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.720
than traditional pie dough, and it's
actually a little more forgiving, so if

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.419
you get a crack, don't worry about it,
don't sweat it,

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.630
you can fix it. So, I'm gonna take I've
got a piece of wax paper here, and I'm

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:47.060
gonna take a little bit more gluten-free
flour and sprinkle it around on my wax

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.130
paper, if you've got a fancy marble board,
this would be a great opportunity to get

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.470
it out, if you don't, don't, don't worry,
about it.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:04.110
Just put it out on your counter, I'm
gonna unwrap my dough here, I'm gonna put

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:12.620
it right in the center of this box paper,
and I'm gonna put some more flour on top,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.330
and I know lots of people have their own

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.970
pie dough rolling ideas, so I'm going to
show you the way that I think it's

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.480
easiest to do it, and if you have a
different way that's cool, you can just

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.850
fast forward the rest of the video, so
I'm going to take my pin and I'm going

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:43.310
to go back and forth gently, and I'm
going to turn back and forth, gently turn

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.300
if the dough starts to look like it's
really sticking to the wax paper, you're

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.470
just going to pull the paper back up and
add a little more flour and continue

00:05:52.470 --> 00:06:03.530
this way until your dough is nice and
thin and a good size for your pie plate,

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:27.409
hey I've got my pie dough nice and thin,
I'm simply just gonna peel back this wax

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:35.599
paper and I'm ready to go into my pie
plate or your tart pan or whatever.

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.569
You're ready to bake. Okay, so we've got
our pie crust right here into our pan,

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:46.729
and I've fixed any little cracks we have,
I'm just rough filling the edges with my

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.819
fingers, now you're just going to follow
the directions for your pie recipe, you

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.689
can bake this shell as it is, and fill it
with a cream filling, or make a fruit,

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:02.930
pumpkin pie, whatever you want, so you're
just gonna make your pie the way you

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:08.569
always have and now with your fancy new
gluten-free delicious crust.
