00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.630
 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.960
 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.330
I’m Pravitt Gourh,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.330
and we are in the Kastner Lab at NIH.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.790
I’m working on a disease called systemic sclerosis.  It’s an autoimmune disease

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.250
where the immune system starts attacking our own body instead of protecting us

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.190
from infections.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.379
In some people, it can be a very devastating disease and eventually

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.220
leading to death

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.390
Unfortunately, we don’t have any treatment so far.  It’s a big need

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.980
right now to figure out this disease.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.920
I was born in northern part of India.  I grew up in India and came to United States

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.050
about 14 years ago.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.000
My parents always tell me that right from birth I was a very curious child

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.059
and would try to open up all my toys to figure out how they used to work.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.280
I did not grow up knowing to be a scientist,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.229
or a physician-scientist for that matter. I think it was a journey

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.259
that just certain pieces fell in place.  I went to medical school, then I came to United States.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.619
to pursue a graduate degree, and then I joined a lab in Houston, Texas.

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.250
My mentor was Dr. Frank Arnett.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.300
I started working with him.  I got intrigued.  I wanted to understand

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.470
this disease better so that we can help the patients better, and here I am.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.580
And we are doing a very big study in the African-American

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.090
systemic sclerosis patients -- it’s the biggest study of its kind

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.470
-- to better understand the disease, because the African-American systemic sclerosis patients

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.910
tend to have a much more severe disease

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.840
than any other population that we know of.  If you can understand the genetics --

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.850
because we feel that that has a role to play --

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.920
maybe it can lead to a treatment or a cure for this disease.  We all know about the DNA

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.640
makes usthat makes us.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.130
And if some people carry certain misspellings in the DNA,

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.020
these misspellings can lead to higher risk of a disease. 
I love this job because I’m a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.750
physician-scientist and I get to see patients,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.720
as well as I am able to do research on these individuals.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.959
So the way we do things right now is we get a blood sample.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.330
It’s a regular blood tube that would get drawn in a doctor’s office.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.330
And then from that blood tube, we can extract DNA.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.350
Because of the cutting-edge technology that we have, we have these arrays that are there,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.920
where you can look up millions of misspellings on a DNA on, like,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.660
up to eight or 10 individuals on this small piece of glass.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.730
But since these are such tiny objects,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.820
what we have to do is, we have to use robotics to

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.530
load stuff on that.  Also, we are using multiple samples.  My study is about

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.959
involving 2,000 individuals.  So to help

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.130
speed things faster, we have these tools that are available

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.340
which are robotic plate loaders and stuff like that.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.930
Also then we use a scanner which has

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.350
a banner [spelled phonetically] robotic arm.  So even when you’re at home at night,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.709
if you’ve done the experiments during daytime, it can automatically keep

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:05.820
loading and scanning the arrays

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.430
for you over night, and in the morning when you come, you have the data.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.110
I have millions of misspellings of the DNA,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.590
and we have about 12 on each glass slide,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.030
and there are four glass slides.  And the robotic arm is picking up this tray.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.160
And we put it on the scanner so that it can scan, and then we’ll have the data

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.590
to look at and analyze these misspellings.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.180
Since we have thousands of samples, and if you had to put all of them individually on a plate

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.280
it would be very difficult,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.680
so this is a robotic arm which has these pipe head [spelled phonetically] tips.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.730
And so when Julie [spelled phonetically] hits start right now, it’ll start picking up these tips, go to these plates,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.120
which have 384 samples at a time,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.910
pick DNA out of them, and put them in this other plate,

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.350
and then we can use this plate to do our PCR reaction to basically amplify the data

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.190
to test for the misspellings on the DNA.  So right now it’s doing the second plate

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:10.190
and putting them in this small 384 well plate [spelled phonetically].

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.580
So since you don’t want any contamination,

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.579
it has to use different tips every time.  Now, if you can understand

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.370
these misspellings of the -- on the DNA for systemic sclerosis, then we might be able to better understand

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.130
what genes are involved,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.310
and in that way we can perhaps target that protein.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.680
Now, in the long term the goal would be to develop a test

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.810
that we could use to predict the disease and be able to tell who is going

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.720
to get the disease

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.479
and perhaps prevent it from happening in those individuals, or have a treatment

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:41.970
for that

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.430
so that we can stop it at a very early stage.  The way it’s progressing nowadays,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.790
it is something that has to be done in a more collaborative fashion,

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.760
with people of different parts of the country.  And I’ve worked

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.860
with people from different parts of the world in the past,

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.290
had to come together.  And it’s not so much where one person alone is sitting

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.660
in the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.660
dark lab by himself trying to figure things out.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.160
You know [inaudible] that we are seeing on chromosome 6.
Male Speaker:
Yeah, so this is an [inaudible].

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.889
Pravitt Gourh:
So it seems like the chromosome 6

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.410
and these are the misspellings of the DNA, and it goes up so high, so that means

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.560
these are definitely associated with the disease.  Would you think so?

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.070
Male Speaker: Yeah, exactly.     Dr. Pravitt: Okay.  That’s fantastic.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.720
I did not know that I wanted to be a physician-scientist,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.729
or a scientist for that matter.

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:30.260
And I think working with the right people and having the opportunities

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.770
and working with the right mentors

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.120
can lead you to that path.  The only important thing is not to give up easily,

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.370
because you will always have setbacks in life, and I think we should use those as

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.310
a way to push

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.470
ourselves further, rather than holdings ourselves back.
