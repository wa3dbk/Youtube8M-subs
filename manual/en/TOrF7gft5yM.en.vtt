00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:12.959
We really have a high level during this qualifier
So i do expect a lot of tight moves of the players.

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:20.159
There are some who are fast and agile and some really big players with awesome post-moves.

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:40.269
The venue is just awesome and kind of reminds me of the Colosseum in Rome.
Thats phenomenal for the players here and a unique experience.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:40.199
At the qualifier in Salzburg i didn't have the best plan for winning this game. But now at the finals in Vienna I changed my strategy and tried to move my rivals under the basket to make a score.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:49.899
I really enjoy playing games and playing with other players in the cage. It feels so good winning the Austria finals of the King of the Rock.
