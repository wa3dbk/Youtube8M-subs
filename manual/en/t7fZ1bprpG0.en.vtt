00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:26.910
I 
like some really out there games.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.140
I mean, gaming is such a unique media that
some truly original and creative works can

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.250
be created and enjoyed by such a wide array
of people.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.390
Every genre seems to have an audience which
means games can be quite strange and still

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.910
have a place.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.980
And there are some games like this, Frobisher
Says!, that are so completely insane that

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.690
you have to question what is going through
your mind playing it let alone what was in

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.620
the heads of the creators.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.309
But as off the wall crazy as it is, you need
to experience it to understand.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:13.850
Frobisher Says! is a collection of mini games
that make use of the Vita and all its special

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:14.990
features.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.580
You will have to use the touch screen, back
touchpad, shoulder and face buttons, camera

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.600
and gyroscope, all to beat the clock and earn
a high score.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.560
The mini games are yelled out to you by what
I am assuming is Frobisher, as each one says,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.170
Frobisher says, and then gives you a task
a varied as pulling the drain from a bathtub

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.280
to smiling for the camera.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.689
There are fifty different games and are nicely
varied, but all do share one quality and that

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.030
is they are all absolutely insane.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:57.409
They are fun though, which is most important
for a game focused on mini-games.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.140
But the game does have some major setbacks
but they do not come in the way of the mini

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.100
games but instead in game options.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.689
There is just not that many things to do here.

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.480
You can go through the sets of mini games,
either seeing how many you can do in a given

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.310
time or playing until you fail one.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.730
But really, that is about it.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.810
There is a basic tutorial and social media
connectivity.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.969
Social media is a big thing for this game,
with score posting and even in game activities

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.709
that involves your PSN friends.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.749
It is an interesting way to bring the real
world into the game.

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:38.700
But the time spent on social media features
should have gone to more game modes.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.599
And one very disturbing thing is the voice
and face of Frobisher which is, to me at least,

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.449
quite unsettling, making me think there are
darker, more sinister reasons as to why he

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.739
wants me to do these things.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.350
It seems every new system needs a mini game
collection making use of its features, and

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.150
now the Vita has one.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:10.419
The ideas are great, there is just not enough
of them.
