00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.640
Okay for this demo we're going to use
the stencil Home Is Where The Heart Is.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.510
We are using folk art acrylics again
they work great for this. We're going to

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.970
do this project with a stencil brush. So
we're going to be using first wrought

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.070
iron folk art wrought iron and again
we're going to concentrate a little bit

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.230
on the load of the brush. So I'm going to
come down I'm going to lightly dip my

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:44.040
brush into just the edge of the paint.
Just get it on the tip of the brush and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:56.520
then I'm going to this with a circular
motion offload the paint. This way I have the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.039
tip of the brush evenly loaded it's not
too much paint and you're ready to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.280
stencil.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.490
Okay when we stencil with a brush
the idea is to stew a sweeping motion

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.899
towards the opening of the stencil. You
don't want to sweep the brush to the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.350
edge of the stencil you're going to
force paint under the edge and get bleed.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.990
So you come in and then you just sweep
in towards the center.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.570
Okay time to do the heart. We're going to
use folk art Christmas red for the heart

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.440
and we're going to be using a slightly
larger brush this time we sell these

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.970
brushes it's a slightly larger stencil
brush and it's going to work great for

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.270
this heart here so we're going to load
the brush again just dip this the tip in

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.690
the surface of the pain here then do a
circular motion that evenly distributes

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.390
the paint on the end of the bristles.
Then we're going to take that and we're

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.370
just going to slightly offload that on
our paper towel so we're ready to go

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.690
here. When you stencil this you want to
make sure that you bring your your brush

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.470
into the opening of the stencil and
don't work this way and push the paint

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.209
underneath. So you know you can start in
the middle of the stencil no problem but

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.989
when I do this I'm aiming it towards the
opening of the stencil. You can see how

00:02:48.989 --> 00:03:00.330
this works works great. It's quick, it's
easy I'm getting great coverage. It's  known

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.590
as the pouncing technique.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.950
You can see how the larger brush makes
very quick work of this larger area. Okay

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:20.310
home is where the heart is let's see how
it turned out. That looks fantastic!

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.690
Nice tight edges, turned out great. We're
really happy with this. took about five

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.319
minutes to do.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.860
