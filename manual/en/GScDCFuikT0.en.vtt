Hi, Melody again on behalf of Expert Village.
I’m folding clothes today to make them go

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.980
into a suitcase and try and keep them somewhat
wrinkle free. We have some clothes here that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.020
are actually sort of wrinkled to begin with,
so possibly when they get to where they’re

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.539
going they won’t be wrinkled anymore if
we fold them properly. Um, this is a man’s

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.719
shirt with short sleeves and the first thing
I do is go for the corners of the shoulders,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.579
and then I fold it towards its back and I
put my finger in the collar, pull the collar

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:49.469
up, grab for the top parts of the sleeves,
and try and shake it out a little bit and

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.640
then I lay it down on a flat surface, and
I try and find where there’s some problem

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.080
areas with wrinkles, and I stretch it out
so that the under arm pit seams are together,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:12.290
and the sides are together and that the tail
is straight, just to try and prevent creating

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:19.000
new wrinkles. I take the arms and I’ll fold
them inward and I’ve got my hand in there

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.200
because I don’t want to create a big crease
in there where I’m folding, I want it to

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:33.180
fold straight and flat and as you can see
I’m making a little bit of margin using,

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.890
here’s the armpit and this would be your
side or flank of the shirt and I’m pulling

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:48.090
it towards the middle there and now what I
would do in this case would be take the tail,

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.700
bring it up, against, making sure I’m not
creating new creases, I’d pull it all the

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.719
way up to the collar, so that the collar has
something to protect it, its not just hanging

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.841
out there in the breeze by itself. And there
are different ways to do this, in this case,

00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:13.930
this is a very thin material and its making
a nice flat little package and it could be

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.349
done just like this, another way to do this
might be to fold it again, but that would

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.910
be up to you and the size of the space you
have in your suitcase. In the next segment

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.569
I’ll be showing you how to fold another
piece of clothing to go into a suitcase.
