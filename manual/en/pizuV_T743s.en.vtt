ANDRE BOULAY: The next type of yo-yos and
it's the type of yo-yos that you're going

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.490
to see everyone using if you go to a contest,
if you look online and anywhere else with

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.110
these videos and what not. Ball bearing yoyos
is where its at. All the new tricks we're

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.650
doing, all the fancy new stuff it's because
of ball bearings. If you look in a yo-yo,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.949
you've got a ball bearing. This is a ball
bearing roller, it goes in the center of the

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:29.860
yo-yo itself and this is actually what the
string goes around onto it. I'll show really

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.940
quick what a ball bearing looks like inside.
You'll notice this one has the circle and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.180
inside here you've got all these little balls
and actually this is all some of the factory

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.960
lubricant that comes in there to help keep
the rust out, but you'll notice all these

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.949
little balls go in there and what happens
is these spin around, that's what the yo-yo

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.440
is on to. And as the yo-yo is spinning around
this, because of all those little balls, you've

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.619
reduced the friction so much that you can
land the yo-yo multiple times in the string,

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.350
you can keep it spinning for you know minutes
on end without any problems and it really

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.140
helps improve the performance. So, let me
show you real quick. We got a string here,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.960
the string itself, as we mentioned two strands
of string that comes around the bearing like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.600
so. So as the yo-yo's spinning, you'll notice
that bearing isn't moving at all. It's just

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.520
the yo-yo spinning around it. We put it together,
the string is just around that one bearing,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.990
so you tighten the gap up and so because of
that bearing you can land it on the string,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:45.960
let it sit there and do tricks that were just
never before possible. You'll notice with

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.120
the bearing in there you can land it one,
two, three times even in the gap. And because

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.180
that bearing is spinning freely, there's nothing
there to stop it from coming back to your

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.390
hand or stopping it from spinning. Because
of ball bearings, you'll see all the tricks

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.780
we're doing today are possible.
