00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Well, first we thought how we could help the local charity.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so we came up with the charity Chips.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we were trying to raise money for it, but we wanted to do it in an inventive way...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
...rather than just a normal sponsored run, or walk or something like that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We just want to fundraise for this little local charity called Chips...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
...which stands for Children's Integrated Playscheme.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So they help mentally and physicall disabled children, and their families...

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
...by providing Summer playschemes for them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We needed to communicate well with each other to make sure we were all doing our jobs right...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
...and also to communicate with sponsors and local businesses to try and communicate our message across... 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
...and get sponsorship money to actually raise money for the charity we'd chosen.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We've rowed nearly fourteen miles today and it took us between five and six hours.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
From Richmond-upon-Thames here to Kingston-upon-Thames.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It started because we wanted to make a change and help people less fortunate than us.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So, we decided to help kids who are disabled, to have the same opportunities that we have.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It was quite hard, but when you're near the end you got used to it...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
...but at the start it was a bit of a push, we were like "yes, come on."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The community is always gonna be a big part to us, especially in our future.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I think this like, is a way of showing we appreciate what we have...

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
...and like sharing it with others, being able to give that extra.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
They have got something to give back to the community, they have got something to say for themselves.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
This team of fourteen young people is a perfect example of that...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
...somebody that wants to give back to the community...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
...that wants to help children in their local area.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Children, especially, they're vulnerable, and they're the foundation of our society...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
...and if we can help them with their everyday life it's good for our community...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
...and everyone in our community feels really well bonded together. It's really good.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I think what NCS does, is it does show that we are capable of doing...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
...a lot more than people expect, and actually I'm quite surprised.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You know, thinking about just 15, 16, 17 year-olds raising Â£1,000 for a charity.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I think it's invaluable. You don't have that many opportunities any more to go off and do something by yourself.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You know, I think especially when you're at school you're very looked after...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
...and it's a lovely transition between school and perhaps going on to college or University.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The biggest thing that I learned is to give back to the community...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
...because already the community helps us in many ways.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I've conquered some fears, and opened up some things that I want to do in my life.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I think that's what NCS is helpful for, to see the world a little bit differently... 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
...and to learn something about themselves that they never knew.
