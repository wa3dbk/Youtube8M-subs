00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
All these people they don't know where to
go

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.600
All these people think they're dead cause
someone told em so

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.000
But if you quickly take a glimpse at the sky,
Suddenly everything around you will deteriorate and die

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
All these people they don't know what they're doing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
All these people don't know what it is they're pursuing

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I just hope that they will realize it soon enough

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.000
Or we will all be sent to hell or the heaven above!

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.500
Can sadness be defined?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
It's a pretty common condition that's
fucking with your mind

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.000
We gotta move forward yet we always stay behind

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.340
Not knowing what to do, I'm speaking to you because I'm blind!

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.500
Now.. 
I live in Nakskov city

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.000
I wanna stay here but things aren't looking
pretty

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.000
The town's getting reckless and it's really
quite a pity

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It has the potential to becoming more than
something shitty!

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Sometimes, I just don't know what to do
anymore

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.800
Sometimes I just wanna lay down and start
to cry on the floor

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.000
Sometimes I'm lost and my whole life just
turns into a war

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But every time that happens, someone opens
another door

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Have someone ever told you that love is a
lie?

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.000
I'm sure that whoever said it to you was
a good guy

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.170
We feel that way when we don't get the chance to say goodbye

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.000
But how can someone decide whether another person should live or die?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
All these people they don't know where to
go

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.210
All these people think they're dead cause
someone told em so

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.680
But if you quickly take a glimpse at the sky,
Suddenly everything around you will deteriorate and die

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.400
All these people they don't know what they're doing

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.500
All these people don't know what it is they're pursuing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.640
I just hope that they will realize it soon enough

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.000
Or we will all be sent to hell or the heaven above!

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.049
Can sadness be defined?

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.300
It's a pretty common condition that's
fucking with your mind

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.000
But no matter what we do we keep running out of time

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.500
The space is endless and so is the nature
of mankind

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.000
So, where do we go from this place that we
ended up in

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.610
Cause there is nothing here that's worth
discussing

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.290
And even if we do stumble across and upon
something

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.500
You can bet that I'll start running, 
just look what you're becoming!

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.000
Sometimes, life just seem so hopeless and
bland

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Sometimes I wish I could travel to another
planet and land

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.500
Sometimes I got nuts, why won't anyone understand?

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.000
Guess no one will notice if I buried myself deep in the sand..

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.869
But when it all comes down, do I even got a chance?

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.500
All the odds are against me, I'll be dead if I don't advance

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.800
But as things look now we may need to do a change of plans

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Because I don't want someone to stand upon my grave and start to dance

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.480
All these people they don't know where to go

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.000
All these people think they're dead cause someone told em so

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.000
But if you quickly take a glimpse at the sky

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.500
Suddenly everything around you will deteriorate and die

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.500
All these people they don't know what they're
doing

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.000
All these people don't know what it is they're
pursuing

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I just hope that they will realize it soon
enough

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.520
Or we will all be sent to hell or the heaven
above

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.000
All these people they don't know where to
go

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.920
All these people think they're dead cause
someone told em so

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.500
But if you quickly take a glimpse at the sky,
Suddenly everything around you will deteriorate and die

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:10.500
All these people they don't know what they're doing

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.000
All these people don't know what it is they're pursuing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I just hope that they will realize it soon enough

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.500
Or we will all be sent to hell or the heaven above
