00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.120
Hello everyone! I'm Fefe or Tron544 and this is a new

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.180
video belonging to the section in which I show you

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.040
some tips or guitar data.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.780
Now it's the turn to show you how

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.720
the Korg Miku Stomp, or Miku's Pedal, as you might

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.760
know it, sounds!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.620
It's a pedal which most of you may want!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.380
Um... And, er...

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.640
It's used for playing melodies. It has a little bit of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.760
latency, but this doesn't stop it from being awesome!

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.260
So, now I'll be showing you how it sounds!

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.200
Well, here we have Miku's Pedal...

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.520
We proceed to select its first two positions,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.220
which are Random, so Miku sings random syllables.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.740
This is a Pedal used for melodies only!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.800
It's seems like she says random phrases!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
Um... The "Random 1" position is completely the same.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.120
The "Scat" position features random sounds.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.860
Um... It has a little bit of... latency,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.840
but... you can do fine with it.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.260
We go on to the "Looh" position.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.600
The "Looh" syllable.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.360
As you might noticed, this has a really

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.700
good detection of Vibratos.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.860
As well as for bends!

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.800
This is really interesting for playing melodies!

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.220
We go on the the "Lahh" syllable.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.380
We go on to the "Ahh" position.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.960
The "Pahh" syllable...

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.200
"Nyan".

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180
This position cuts the sounds.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.440
I'm holding a note, for example, right now.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.700
But this just cuts it.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.080
Now, this is the most interesting part of the Pedal:

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:54.740
being able to upload... any lyrics to it, really easily!

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.080
Just for testing, I uploaded with my iPhone

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.460
the lyrics of one of Miku's songs, which you might know

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.760
to the "Phrase 2" position.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.201
Let's see... Just listen!

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.180
"World is Mine" by Miku Hatsune!

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.260
You can play every one of Miku's songs

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.860
and it sounds really, really interesting.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.320
Um... I really recommend this pedal and

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.360
if you can get it in your country, you have to buy it!

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.300
