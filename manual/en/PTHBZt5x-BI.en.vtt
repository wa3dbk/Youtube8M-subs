00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:03.830
VO: The grass isn’t always greener on the
other side!

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.470
With a little regular maintenance, your lawn
can be the envy of the neighborhood.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.280
VO: A healthy lawn has six basic components:

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.630
VO: First thing you need to address…weeds.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.380
VO: Look at the overall health of your lawn.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.420
If you have large areas of weeds with very
little grass, it may be time to start over.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.869
VO: Spray the weeds with non-selective weed
killer and wait for them to die.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.240
Non-selective means it kills all plants, so
be careful what and where you spray.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.159
VO: If your lawn is in better shape and you
only have the occasional weed, use a selective

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:38.190
herbicide and spot treat only the areas with
weeds

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.370
VO: Once the weeds are eliminated, it’s
time to improve your soil.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.289
VO: Over time, the soil under your lawn begins
to degrade in quality.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.739
VO: Dethatch using a garden rake.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.559
VO: Start by raking your lawn vigorously to
remove thatch - the dead grass and other debris

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.649
that prevents water, nutrients and air from
reaching the root system.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.479
VO: Next, aerate your lawn.

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.579
VO: Aerating reduces soil compaction by poking
holes in the ground.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.430
The best option is to use a core aerator,
which removes small plugs of dirt to loosen

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.430
the soil.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.180
On small yards, you can use a spike aerator.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
VO: Now that your weeds and soil are in check,
you’re ready to seed!

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.100
VO: There are two categories of seed: warm-season
grass, like Bermuda and Centipede, and cool-season

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740
varieties, like fescue and bluegrass.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.820
Choose the grass that’s best for your region.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.520
Lowe’s can help you decide.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.409
VO: If your lawn is in good shape, you’ll
want to over-seed, which means to evenly spread

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.759
seed over the entire lawn.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.649
Check the label to determine which spreader
setting to use.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.820
VO: If you have bare patches, you’ll need
to spot seed.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.630
Loosen the soil with a rake and evenly spread
seed directly on the soil.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.409
VO: Rake the seed in and tamp it down with
the end of the rake.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.530
This seed-to-soil contact is essential for
germination.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.719
Spread a small amount of mulch or straw on
top for insulation.

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.299
VO: Finally, keep the seeded area consistently
moist for a couple of weeks until you see

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.960
the new growth.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.420
Make sure not to over-water the area, just
enough to keep it slightly wet.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.540
VO: For more on lawn care, including the best
time to seed and fertilize, visit Lowes.com/LawnCare.

VO: Next up, we’ll take a look at feeding,
watering, and mowing.
