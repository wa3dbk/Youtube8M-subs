00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.930
Hi, I’m Dr. Donald Yoo.

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:07.060
I’m a Facial Plastic Surgeon, here in Beverly
Hills, California and I’d like to talk about

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.520
Asian rhinoplasty.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.459
One of the reasons I enjoy Asian rhinoplasty
so much is because it can create such a dramatic

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.260
change in someone’s appearance.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.380
Beause the nose is in the center of the face
it is important that the appearance and proportions

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.990
of the nose, are in balance with the rest
of the facial features.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.289
I’ve had the privilege of operating on Asians
of just about every ethnicity, and I have

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.500
found one of the keys to a successful result
is approaching each nose as a personalized,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.650
individual nose.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:42.500
On the computer I can sit down with them,
and morph their images and see what they find

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.340
aesthetically pleasing, and I can be on the
same page with tem and figure out if we see

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.170
eye to eye as to what we find to be a beautiful,
attractive nose.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.820
And also at this time I am able to assess
their expectations and also if it is surgically

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.440
possible to create the nose they envision
for themselves.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:09.039
Another way I avoid a cookie cutter approach
or avoid creating a cookie cutter nose, is

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.070
by using tissue from the patient’s own body.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.200
This way each surgery is tailored to that
patient, and all the grafts and techniques

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.560
that I use are unique to that patient.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.149
Synthetic grafts are very popular and widespread
in Asian rhinoplasty, and there are a number

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.719
of reasons for this.

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:33.909
One of the main reasons is that synthetic
grafts are readily available, and are ready

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.490
to use right off the shelf.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.659
One of the problems with this is that those
grafts are not individualized – the same

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.049
graft that is used in your nose is also used
in thousands of other patients’ noses.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:51.280
The other main disadvantage of using synthetic
implants is that there is a risk of infection,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.060
migration, and extrusion (or ulcerating through
the skin), that is much, much higher than

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.829
using your own tissue.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.240
Using grafts made from your own tissue, also
known as autologous grafts, is safe, and provides

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.869
predictable and permanent results.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.640
It also provides a nose that looks more natural
because instead of the sharp, visible edges

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.810
of a Silicone or Gore-tex graft, your own
tissue is used to build your nose, and as

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.880
it is incorporated into your body, it becomes
a part of your nose.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.140
For this reason I use exclusively autologous
grafts (or grafts made from tissue in your

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.510
own body) for Asian rhinoplasty.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.470
By using autologous grafts I can address each
of the aesthetic and functional concerns of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.450
my patients.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.050
A number of changes can be made to the way
the nose looks during Asian rhinoplasty.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.320
Some of these changes include: increasing
the height, or building up the bridge of the

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.481
nose to create more definition when looking
straight-on, and to improve the profile; another

00:02:56.481 --> 00:03:02.070
possibility in Asian rhinoplasty is to increase
the refinement and projection of the tip of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.790
the nose.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.290
Some Asians are unhappy with the bulbosity
or the width of the tip of their nose, or

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.270
the fact it does not project far enough from
the face.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:18.220
For patients who wish to augment or build
up the bridge of their nose, I can augment

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.670
using a variety of graft options.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.650
One of the commonly used grafts is cartilage
harvested from inside the nose, or portion

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.460
of the nose dividing the right and left nostril,
right in the middle, called the septum.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.510
By harvesting a portion of the cartilage from
the septum I am able to build up other areas

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.400
of the nose that may be deficient.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.150
Another possible option is taking cartilage
from the ear, or the concha.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.000
By taking cartilage through a small incision
behind the ear, I am able to use a hidden

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.750
incision that does not alter the appearance,
shape or look of the ear in any way, and that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.120
cartilage can also be used to build up the
nose.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.459
For patients who desire the maximum amount
of change, cartilage harvested from a small

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:14.870
2.5 cm incision right underneath the right
breast or chest, I can harvest rib cartilage,

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.109
and use that cartilage to then construct the
nose.

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.310
Another common complaint from patients seeking
Asian rhinoplasty is the flare or the width

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.310
of the nostrils.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:33.249
And again the flare and the width of the nostrils
can be modified during surgery.

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:37.990
Asian rhinoplasty is a surgery that I really,
really enjoy performing because it can create

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.919
such a dramatic and significant change.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.229
