00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:09.409
 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.610
 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.869
 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.759
Patented Installation-Ready Technology
from Victaulic is revolutionizing the

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.599
planning and implementation of fire
protection systems

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.320
where safety installation speed
efficiency and reliability

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.739
is paramount. Argus fire protection
limited selected victaulic installation

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:36.629
ready technology

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.540
in a time-critical warehouse extension
project in Auckland, New Zealand they've

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.400
got a site here behind me that's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.239
27,000 square meter warehouse extension.  The overall objective of the

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.840
system we're installing as

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.629
an easy fire demand at nine thousand liters
per minute

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:55.780
at about 10 bar of pressure. So we got a

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.079
full stored capacity for a primary supply and
we've got a secondary supply which is a

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.550
tank with 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.300
to achieve a sixty-minute duration of
water supplies. So the feedback

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.350
from the guys on site is that they

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.979
really like the technology, the Installation-Ready Technology

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.960
it's making their job a lot easier not having
the pre-grease couplings

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.810
putting the pipe together especially the
heaviest stuff makes life a lot easier

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.450
for them.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.549
 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.399
The main challenge we had in the pump room was the weight of the equipment that

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.299
we're installing

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.450
the safety aspects was being able to use the Installation-Ready couplings to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.670
stack the heavy equipment on top
rather than using the traditional

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.189
two-piece coupling with a gasket having to manipulate

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:52.189
the gasket over the two bits of piping joined together.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.900
 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.120
 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.180
Normally you build it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.810
once the roof and structures are in place in the end but on this one we were given the

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.220
opportunity to build a

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.920
sprinkler pipe work into roof sections on the ground with the structural steel

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.490
guys

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.680
and then craned up into place in
about 25 different segments

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.350
we had a limited window of two days to
get the pipe work installed on the ground

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.130
there was only one shot at getting it right and if we missed that pipe

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.920
then we were having to install in the
air with additional excess and labor  

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:27.500
to achieve

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.150
the same result. So the expectations on
a job like this is that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.800
we will have to work longer hours if we
don't meet the deadlines

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.350
which puts pressure on the guys on-site
and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.110
being able to install pipe quicker means that guys can got home at the end of a 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.620
 8-hour day instead of having to work a 12-
hour day.  So we have six installers

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.800
working on site to do the roof
sections a in the valve room itself

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.380
we're down to four for the heavier
equipment.  

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.080
I'd estimate that we save

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.470
around 5 to 8% on the total build cost
 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.770
by using the Installation-Ready Technology 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.770
 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.950
 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.590
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.390
Well we've done

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.470
two successful projects with Victaulic as a supplier now 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.970
The first being a freezer installed where we
had to work in live freezer at -20

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.989
the Installation-Ready couplings provided
us with a flushy on the Gasket as well as  a quick install in the freezer itself.

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:41.349
 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.859
 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.040
So we're doing a warehouse now that is similar type but
much larger scale

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.390
and we've used the same methodology on
this new warehouse

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.109
as well so it's definitely beneficial. Now the
support from the Victaulic

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.129
is outstanding. We get help with
commissioning

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.980
or the QA of the installer of the products ensures we're doing what we need to be doing.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.970
So the reliability of the Victaulic product is

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.030
superior. We've had failures in the past so
I've

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.560
moved to the safer option which is Victaulic.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.989
Patented Installation-Ready Technology from Victaulic is engineered to reduce

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.989
installation time optimize labor risk
management and provide superior

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:22.990
performance.
