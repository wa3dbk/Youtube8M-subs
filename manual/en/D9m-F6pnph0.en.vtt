00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.180
It's 3:50 am.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.940
Two of my friends are coming to pick me up.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.680
We're gonna go explore California.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:20.500
So the plan is to hit up as many cool places as we can in Northern California...

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.440
...but we only have a week.

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:27.604
First one's Yosemite,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.400
Tahoe

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.120
Shasta

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.135
Avenue of the Giants

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.780
Uh, San Francisco

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:33.277
and then Big Sur.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.320
Thank you.

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.220
This is how Charles enjoys nature.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.600
That was awesome!

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.840
We just saw a baby bear.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.800
Problem is we don't have cell phone service.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.900
This guy's a little creepy.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.660
He's probably getting ready to kill us.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.800
We don't really know where we are in the Yosemite Valley.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.200
You broke something!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.320
I didn't mean to!

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.260
Jinelle's leaving us a day early, so we're trying to find a hotel.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.560
Hi, do you have any rooms available?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.060
Do you have any rooms for tonight?

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.820
Hi, do you have any rooms available?

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.440
Do you have any rooms available?

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.640
Nope. No vacancy.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.720
We might be sleeping in our car tonight.
