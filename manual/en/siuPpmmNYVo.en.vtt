00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.240
A point and shoot camera 
with a 7x optical zoom,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.640
you don't see that everyday.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.140
I'm going to tell you all about this 
Olympus Stylus 7010 in just a second.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.560
Right now you are looking at the 
shiny Olympus Stylus 7010,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.320
and this is a point and shoot digital camera,
12 mega pixels,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.900
but you have a 7x optical zoom,
5x digital.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.290
The 7x you can get 
really close with that.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.240
It's pretty good for a
point and shoot camera

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.370
that's still affordable,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.700
it's actually, you get a 
lot of value for this.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.370
Now let me tell you 
more about it first of all,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.850
it has a 28 mm,
wide angle lens,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.080
2.7 inch LCD screen,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.450
and that does have the
HyperCrystal technology.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.860
ISO 1600 dual image 
stabilization to make sure 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.640
your photos don't come
out blurry if you have shaky hands.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.390
Also, the dual image stabilization
helps in low lighting situations as well.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.720
Also you have 36 MG 
of internal storage, 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.680
so you're going to want to 
get an XD or a micro SD card

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.070
to go along with 
this Olympus.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.810
Twenty-three shooting
modes including

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620
a feature called
Magic Filter,

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.050
which is a new feature.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.520
And you can apply this, it's kind
of like a Scene mode, actually,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.350
but Pop Art, 
Fish Eye and Pinhole, 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.720
are the three effects 
of the Magic Filter.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.830
And I took some pictures 
earlier using this feature,

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.320
and I'll show you
it in a second.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.010
Also you have shadow
adjustment technology 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.960
so you can really make sure 
to bring out the details

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.770
and correct your shadows 
and your images.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.770
Panorama mode, Movie mode,
you can shoot VGA movies

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.640
640 x 480, this is the resolution, at
30 frames or 15 frames per second.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.290
And then in your 
Playback function,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.890
I saw that there's a lot 
of cool editing features.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.790
Not just crop and resize,

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.630
you can do sepia photos,
black and white,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.390
and you can even fix your
shadows and put on Beauty mode,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.010
which you know
is one of my favs.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.430
All in your Playback
editing features.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.100
Last but not least,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.800
this Olympus does take 
a rechargeable battery

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.050
so when you're fully charged

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.200
you don't have 
to worry about 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.040
running out and grabbing
a pair of those double A's.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.640
Now, onto our tour and I'm going to
tell you more about this Olympus Stylus.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.680
So on the back of the camera you'll 
see you have a mini USB port

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.090
and that is to hook up to a computer
and load all your photos and videos

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.850
onto Facebook or YouTube,
whatever site you prefer.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.130
You have your tripod 
mount right here, 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.420
and let's open up this door,
door number one,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.650
and you will see your
rechargeable battery. 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.600
And underneath your battery this
is where your memory card goes.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.670
Either your XD or your microSD card.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.240
Right under the battery.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.280
Okay let's start our tour of this Olympus
Stylus by powering on you'll see your power

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.750
button is up top next 
to your shutter release.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.980
And before we really 
get into this tour, 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.420
I've got to show you this zoom.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.020
Again, it's a 7x optical, 4x digital, 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.150
you can really get 
those telephoto shots.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.660
And you don't have to 
be in your friends' face,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.220
which is nice, 
scare them with the camera. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.700
But this is a nice size,
for a point and shoot camera.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.340
Let's turn on over back again
you'll see your 2.7 inch LCD screen,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.180
and that does have the
HyperCrystal technology.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.080
So as you can see,
the screen is bright,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.610
the resolution
is clear,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.120
and overall it's quite a view when 
you're trying to examine your photos.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.830
Right here you have your 
Wide and your Tight, 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.460
and below your 
Wide and your Tight, 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.600
your zoom controls you'll see
your mode dial.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.190
And this is how you change 
your different shooting modes.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.910
Right now, we are in Easy mode.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.470
Well, let's go on over to Scene mode.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.480
And here, 
this Olympus as you will see, 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.410
comes equipped with all of 
the typical Scene modes.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.590
And we'll scroll 
through them right now. 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.520
Self Portrait, Sunset, 
Fireworks, 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.110
you know fireworks are actually 
really hard to photograph,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.900
so it's nice that you have 
that Fireworks setting.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:58.810
Documents, Beach
and Snow,

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.130
and Pre-Capture 
Movie which is great 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.450
because you can set this
camera on Pre-Capture,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.540
and it will capture up to
two seconds of a movie before

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.810
you actually start recording.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.620
Once you press the shutter release,

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.040
And this is great so you can
actually jump in the movie.

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.040
And set the camera on a tripod.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.380
And look at this, Pet.
Pet function.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.280
For when you're shooting, you know, 
pictures of those fuzzy little animals.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.840
Alright, so that's all 
your Scene modes. 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.020
Let's go into the 
next mode selection. 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.290
Which happens to be,
oh, our memory's full.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.890
Okay, that's okay,
right now we're in Beauty shot.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.470
And basically what
Beauty shot does,

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.650
it's going to smooth 
out the wrinkles, 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.930
hide those blemishes and make 
sure everyone in your photo

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.980
comes out looking
glamorous.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.590
Thank you Beauty mode.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.970
Okay this is Movie mode right here,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.480
and by hitting the 
function button you'll see

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.630
all your settings come up.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.470
You can shoot in either 
15 frames per second or 30.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.110
You have options between
QVGA which is 320 x 240 resolution

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.550
or your VGA for your
higher resolution.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.520
Also you can change your
metering right here.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.860
And your white balance up top.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.950
So that is Movie mode.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.320
And let's check out another mode,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.640
as we move 
along on our dial.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.460
Oh, we're in Playback, we're
not ready to go there,

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.480
we'll come back
to Playback.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.730
Let's keep on going.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.970
To iAuto, now what iAuto mode does, 
is it has a set of predefined Scene modes.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.340
And the camera's automatically going
to detect which Scene mode is best

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.370
for your photo.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.730
I actually really like being in iAuto,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.980
when I'm out and about just
taking pictures of random things.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.770
Because the camera is 
going to do all the work for me,

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.790
and I just really don't have
to worry about anything at all.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.950
Okay? So there's your 
mode dial right there.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.490
Now to go into your settings,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.120
now actually, iAuto doesn't,
you can't really change any of the settings

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.280
so if you really want to change
your settings you have to be

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.180
in Auto mode
and you just hit Menu.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.230
And all your functions will appear.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.710
Now let's go on up,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.590
to Magic Filter.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.020
Now Magic Filter,
is a new feature,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.990
comes on this Olympus and it actually 
is going to put a filter on your lens

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.640
and you have three different
options here. Okay?

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:20.360
You have Pop Art,
Fish Eye, and Pinhole.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.540
So this is Pop Art right now.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.650
This is Pinhole,
and this, is Fish Eye.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.590
And you'll see, you can view
all the different, you know,

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.640
filters right here, all at once.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.170
And decide which one 
you want to choose.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.050
I took some pictures
with a couple of these filters,

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:41.860
I'll show you in second.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.600
Alright, so let's get out of here,
and go back to our Menu.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.950
There we go.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.130
And let's go over the
rest of these controls.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.080
Alright, so you have
Playback right here,

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.220
and along this square you'll see
your flash, your exposure,

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.140
your Macro mode,
and your self timer.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.810
Also you have 
your display,

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:00.620
so you can see your
composition gridlines, 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.340
or your histogram,

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.080
or you know just all 
of the settings. 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:07.500
And you also have 
your trash down here. 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.720
Let's go into Playback 
I'm going to show you 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.810
some of the photos
I shot earlier,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.870
this is with the Pop Art filter,
as you can see the colors,
