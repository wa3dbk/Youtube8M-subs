AMY DALLEN: My name is Amy
Dallen, and I sell comic books

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.330
and then do various things
on the side.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.870
I act, and I write silly
nerdy songs.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.110
And I play games
when possible.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.100
I think I got into comics,
probably I would have to blame

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.060
the X-Men cartoon from
the early '90s.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.740
Because that was my appointment
television.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.970
The internet was kind of
invented right when I was

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.640
getting into comics, so there
were not a lot of other girls

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.250
to talk about comics
with, really.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.830
But luckily on the internet
the new writer of Marvel's

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.290
Generation X cannot tell that
you are a girl asking him your

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.690
nerdy questions on the
message board on AOL.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.865
So that allowed me to further
the obsession, which is how

00:00:47.865 --> 00:00:49.830
most of us end up with a
lifelong comics habit.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.290
You can't be like, I'm a comics
expert, because I get

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.785
tested enough all the
time at the store.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.390
I've actually had to start
wearing nerdy t-shirts to the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.480
store so that people will stop
being like, do you actually

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.670
read the comics?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.110
And I'm like, no, I'm lost.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.530
How did I get behind
this counter?

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.250
Because seriously, working in
a comic book store would be

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.930
the most boring imaginable
job if you did not

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.950
actually like comics.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.510
Gaming is literally more fun
than a lot of other activities

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.690
you could be doing.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.370
Because I'm learning the merits
of actually exercising

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.520
or crafting or many other
things, which turn out to be

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.730
very, very fun, but are less
obviously fun than playing a

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.780
board game where you're
confronted with a series of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.910
different challenges which test
either your knowledge or

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.150
your creativity or your logical
ability or your

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.370
ability to work with teams.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.490
They're literally just
fine activities.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.900
What makes nerd society, in mind
head, better than a lot

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.600
of other alternatives is in most
of the world if you're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.960
excluding people that's what
you're supposed to do, like

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.390
the cream rises to the top.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.460
Everybody else go be
socially awkward.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.670
In nerd society, obviously
you get mean

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.650
people, and you get exclusion.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.010
But if you do that you're
violating the entire

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.970
spirit of the thing.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.130
Gaming is inclusive,
and it's cerebral.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.630
It's something that literally
there is a game that you can

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.080
play with any other group of
people on Earth and have a

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080
great time.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.080
Even if you don't speak the same
language, even if you've

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.440
never met before, even if
they're two-year-olds, there's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.540
a game out there that you guys
are going to have an awesome

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.320
time playing.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.770
Or you can have these incredibly
sophisticated games

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.180
or games of collaborative
storytelling or games of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.630
strategy that you leave feeling
as if now, should you

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.190
suddenly need to mastermind
a Mongol

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.230
invasion, you are prepared.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.880
And the idea of taking a totally
unfamiliar challenge,

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.280
navigating it to the best of
your ability in company with a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.990
bunch of other people, and then
leaving that, there's no

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.070
negative consequences.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.370
It's just fun.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.770
And you just end up better
friends with people.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.610
Gaming is nothing
but positives.
