Hi! I’m Ross. Thanks for visiting expertvillage.com.
What can we do with computer files? Let’s

00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:14.832
find out. How do you burn your files to a
CD. If your computer is equipped with a CD

00:00:14.832 --> 00:00:25.410
burner, windows XP can send the files to the
burner. Simply just highlight the files that

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.710
you want to send, right click on one of the
highlighted files and you have an option send

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:43.230
to, find your burner. This one here is a DVD,
yours could be a CD, but it is an RW so it

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:51.960
can write to the disc. I will left click to
select. You can see down here, you files waiting

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.600
to be written to the CD. Click the files now.
I’m going to click on that. It opens up

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.409
this new window, and these are the files ready
to be written to the CD. I can just leave

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.659
the files in this area and keep sending more
files. I could find another file, let’s

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:25.189
say in letters. I could send this one over
to the writer also, come back here, and the

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.021
file is now there. Once I’m ready to burn
these files to CD, let us come over to the

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:40.729
left side and say write these files to CD.
It will ask for a name. The name that you

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:50.920
give it here will show up when you put the
CD into a drive. These go through the process

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.380
and now it wants the disc, put the disc in,
click, and burn your files.
