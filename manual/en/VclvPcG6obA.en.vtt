00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.320
 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.559
Now i have been inundated with people asked me to do

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.100
back to school type recipes or simple snack recipes that take

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.950
absolutely no time whatsoever

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.020
And i have also had people ask me what is my favorite
snack to make that

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.760
requires almost no effort. So today im going to show you one of my

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.520
all-time personal favourites that i like to do
especially during hot weather

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.150
Now while this isn't a recipe it is a fantastic idea that i know you will love

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.650
that i just had to share with you.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.410
and this is just how simple it is on how
to make your own paddle pop

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.750
frozen yogurts at home and incredibly healthy to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
Of course it comes down to the type of yogurts you want to choose. Im choosing

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.170
this one its a ninety eight  percent 
fat-free yogurt

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.280
So all we have to do is with a knife just make a little cut

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.149
just on the top, not to much. Then we are going to grab some paddle pop sticks and i got these

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:56.719
from the bargain shop and

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.129
they are very cheap, it works out to about

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.830
one cent each. So just put that through
the top

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.780
Just place them in the freezer for say four to five hours

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.330
until they are completely frozen.  Okay so i have taken them out of the freezer and had them in there over night.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.330
Just going to take the top off. So what i have done is run the outside under a hot water tap

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.869
So you should find it will just pop right out. And there we have it and they literally took

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.970
ten seconds to make so if you're looking for that
super simple easy

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.579
summer treat to make that every one will love kids and adults alike

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.880
and with absolutely no work involved what so ever

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.880
this is a perfect treat to have a hot day
and honestly even on a cold day.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.090
and depending on which one you choose
its also incredibly healthy

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.820
But the best part is you can choose your favourite yogurt so you know its going to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.860
taste simply delicious.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.420
So as i said its not a recipe but it is a fantastic idea

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.979
for those people who are looking for
super easy snack to make

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.640
that just takes second's. Thank you for watching this episode of Todd's kitchen.
