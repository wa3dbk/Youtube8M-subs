Hi! My name is Scott Reil and on behalf of
expertvillage.com I will like to talk to you

00:00:04.481 --> 00:00:10.610
about vegetable gardening. Hi! Lets talk for
a couple of minutes about designing your garden.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.969
I think it is one of the things that people
over look when they are building there vegetable

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.600
gardens but it is one of those things that
are going to lead to a long term success or

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.020
a failure if you don't get it right. So what
are the things that plants really needs? Well

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.279
one of the things that they need is light
and water. When I laid out my vegetable garden

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.340
I found the sun is placed in my yard and that
is where my vegetable garden went. Now I did

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.950
it here for a couple of other reasons to we
have talked about water this is one of the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.370
places in my yard where the surface water
tends to feed off. I have even directed some

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.160
of the down spout from my house to this area
because I have a raised bed garden that was

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.260
a consideration of my design I can take the
water move it right in this garden area and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.850
it helps keep the garden deep watered. That
is always moistened over here even on hot

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.800
dried summer days. Now the other things that
I need to consider is where does the sun rise,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.050
where does the sunset, how does the sun move
through my garden through the day. Because

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.330
of that in my garden I started with lower
plants over to one side and I work over the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.580
higher plants on the other side and that allows
the plants to get light continually throughout

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.680
the day without shading one another out. Another
consideration for me cause I have such a small

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.311
garden was other garden surfaces that I can
use and you could see back behind here I have

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:35.820
gone vertical in my garden and I grow my beans
up that to maximize the little garden space

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.330
that I do have. With just a little for thought
and with just a little bit of concentration

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.060
you can look and find the right place in your
yard for your garden and figure out the plants

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.479
that you want to grow. Sure I wanted to add
12 tomatoes but looking over my garden I had

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.830
room for 6. Be realistic when your obsessive
your garden and the space that you have in

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.430
it, play it accordingly and your garden would
reward you with great vegetables all summer

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.720
long.
