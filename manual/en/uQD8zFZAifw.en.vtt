00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.180
Hi!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.400
I've got a bit of a weird question, 
would you mind looking after my stuff?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm busting to use the bathroom.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.840
Okay.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You're not a terrorist though are you?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.800
What? Do I look like one?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.700
I don't know, they're getting more and more 
inconspicuous looking these days.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.500
I'm not, pinky promise!

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.200
Pinky promise?! What are you five?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.000
*mumbling*

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.460
"What are you, shy? I've been standing here.."

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.260
"..you shy? I've been SITTING here for the last five min..."

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
Thanks, you're a life saver
(Sure..)

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.820
Standing or sitting?

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.240
...Hmm

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The film is better.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
No way! Books are always better than films.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.620
Granted, but this is a rare exception. 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.500
Have you seen the film?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.400
No, I like to read the book first.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.400
Ahhh.. There's your first problem.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000
You become too biased.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.860
Biased?!

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.000
No way, it's just that I'm right!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.500
Ms. Right...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.210
It's Anna.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
...Banana

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.000
What are you reading?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.280
Why should I tell you?

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.500
I'm still thinking you could be a terrorist...

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.500
Stop it.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It's a book on how to seduce girls.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Awww.. are you not any good at it?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.900
No, I'm not actually.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm pretty shy when it comes to girls.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.700
Yeah right...

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.000
You are a player

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.400
Me a player? Wait 'till I tell Cade.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.140
Ohh God! 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.280
I wish!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000
You're a shocker.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Pffft... Stop it!

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.079
Look, we should catch Shawshank Redemption the movie,

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.659
But you're not allowed to make 
me laugh.. 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.000
We'll make it a laugh free zone?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.000
Okay..

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.500
I own a copy of it already,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.100
at home...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Okay. Great! Then...

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
Your place it is.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.000
Nice try

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.500
So what? Next thing you're going to do is come over to my place try to borrow my TV then never give it back!

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.300
You know what? 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.720
The DVD store is that way.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.000
I'm sorry

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.600
I'm really not myself today!

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.000
The DVD store is actually THAT way!
