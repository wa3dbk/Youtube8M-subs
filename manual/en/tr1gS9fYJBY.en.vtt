Hi this is Elise McMahon with expertvillage.com

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.210
about flea and tick prevention. If you like
to find more about my services you can visit

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.131
my website canineheadstart.com. So in this
short series in this short clip here we are

00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:19.820
going to be talking about what to do when
you find a tick. How do you get a tick off

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.460
of your dog? How there is probably a hundred
and one different ways that people can come

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.950
up with from burning the abdomen of the tick
with a blown out match to pouring oil over

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:40.410
it. I find the simples to remove the tick
is simply grasp it there I actually gone over

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.870
this dog but unfortunately he has no ticks
but I'm just going to demonstrate for you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.400
what I would do if he had a tick. Lets just
say there was a tick right here. There was

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.510
a tick right here it would be a brown body
protruding here and you would be actually

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.500
be able to move that tick back and forth and
his head would be attach into the dog. What

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.579
I do and I find that this is the easies method
because what you want to do is you don't want

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.299
to leave the head attached. If you just take
the body of the tick and you pull it straight

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:23.649
out so if you just pull it straight out you
topically going to separate the abdomen of

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.850
the tick from the head of the tick and you
are going to leave the head embedded in the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:34.729
dog. What I do is I take the body of the tick
and I slowly and twist at the same time that

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:42.200
I'm gently pulling and removing the tick.
This is a great method of removing the ticks.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.549
The only problem is that a lot of people are
squeamish and they don't want to touch the

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.560
ticks. If that is the case they make devices
that will help you take the ticks out this

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.119
way. So this is a tick removal system here
this little plastic thing that looks like

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.789
a ice cream scoop and you can just see that
there is a little slip cut here and what you

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:13.250
do is you come up and you slide this the body
of the tick under here so you have the head,

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.740
the body, in here and you just come in and
you just very slowly remove the tick and pull

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.120
it away from the dog. This is a good way again
to insure that the head doesn't come detached

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.010
from the dog and that means the head would
stay embedded in the skin of the dog and you

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.540
wind up with the body of the tick. Whatever
method that you chose you want to make sure

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.100
that you if it is a sometime you get a big
sort of infected area the tick was clean the

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.480
spot and wash your hands very throughly after
disposing of the tick.
