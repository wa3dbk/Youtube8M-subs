Hello friends I'm Jeesaa Gupta, a beauty practitioner.
You can see almond, just take one almond,

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:24.210
soak in water and make a smooth paste of it,
add it to your pack. Here I have the extract

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:34.760
taken on from raisin and grapes. Just add
boiled one grape and few raisin, and boil

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.159
this in half cup of water and allow it to
reduce to half, that is one fourth cup and

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.670
then add taken grape water. So I can call
it the extract of grapes and raisin, it's

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.199
very much helpful for normal skin. Just a
little of it, even half teaspoon will do.

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:15.100
Just clean your face with a moist cotton.
This is a moist cotton, just clean face with

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:25.210
this moist cotton or in the astringent an
after that you can apply this pack onto your

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:35.600
face. Allow your skin to absorb the benefit
of this natural pack for ten to fifteen minutes

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:44.720
and then you wet your hands and just dab it
on your face and scrub it gently. Wash it

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.930
off with fresh water. You will feel that your
skin has become soft and supple. And you can

00:01:52.930 --> 00:02:00.000
avoid wrinkle with this pack if you had oily
skin earlier and right now its dry. Thank

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.140
you for being with me.
