Hey everyone. Welcome to Expert Village. I'm
Pam Bowman, but you all know me as Chef Blondie.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:12.799
Today's a real treat for me. We are doing
a food that I grew up on. Sour cream coffee

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:19.630
cake. My mom, God rest her soul, was the queen
of coffee cakes. There wasn't a day that went

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:27.590
by in my house that a coffee cake of some
sort wasn't made. From plum coffee cakes to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.120
blueberry to raspberry to apple coffee cakes.
But my favorite was sour cream coffee cake.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.760
And it's basically the base of all of the
coffee cakes. So we're going to learn how

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.429
to make May's Sour cream Coffee Cake. It's
going to be a lot of fun. It's an easy thing

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:50.420
to do and once you do it, you're going to
love it. And it's a great way to start the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.120
morning. A little piece of coffee with a great
cup of coffee. It's a nice way to end the

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.460
day. So come along with me and have some of
my mom's sour cream coffee cake. You'll love

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:11.050
it. We're going to start out by talking about
all the ingredients that you'll need. First

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.860
we need all purpose flour. Regular old all
purpose flour you can buy in the store. Don't

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:30.780
buy unbleached. Just buy plain all purpose
flour. Next baking soda, baking powder, regular

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:43.860
sugar, butter, unsalted, eggs. We'll be using
three. Be sure you use large eggs. Sour cream

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.160
of course. A little bit of salt because we're
going to be able to control the salt in it.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:00.900
Some vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar, walnuts.
This is for our streusel. And then a little

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.600
bit of powdered sugar that we're going to
mix with water to be our glaze. So let's get

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.930
started.
