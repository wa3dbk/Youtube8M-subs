00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.000
To me, I think the spirit of our 
 wildlife biology program

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.780
is training students who can tackle 
 some of these really challenging

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.000
conservation and management 
issues that are going to come up,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but with a keen eye toward the quality of the science.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.900
We bring our strong academics together 
 with our amazing outdoor classroom around Missoula,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.030
to get students out in the field, 
to get out among the wildlife,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.000
and learn research techniques.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.230
I've worked on Canada lynx here in Montana, 
up by Seeley Lake. I've gone to Asia to study fruit bats.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.000
The course work, and then also 
the field skills I've gained as part of my research,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
will all help me 
be more competitive in the job market.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The Wildlife Biology Program was recently named one of the 
Programs of National Distinction at the University of Montana.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.100
The Program of National Distinction was designed 
to identify the best programs at the University

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
and make them even better
through additional financial support.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.250
Part of this distinction will allow us to expand the aquatics program

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.270
within the larger Wildlife Biology Program, including adding new

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.340
faculty lines and expanding the undergraduate curriculum,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.400
allowing us to students out into the 
rivers and streams around Missoula

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.000
even more than we already do in our classes.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.460
This distinction also provides a dedicated student advisor,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.470
an individual who is completely dedicated 
to helping you, and guiding you in a direction

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.500
that will be of your own interest.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.590
Undergraduate students in the Wildlife Biology Program 
are already very active in conducting

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.000
their own research, and then going on to present that research 
at state and national meetings.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.700
With this distinction, we have more resources

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.000
to allow students to attend those meetings.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.780
And going to a national conference is just a great 
opportunity for presenting my own research,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.000
seeing what everyone else in the field is doing, 
getting to network, and talk to experts in the field.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I love the Wildlife Biology Program here.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.900
The faculty are all amazing scientists,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.000
they're rigorous researchers, they're great contacts 
and collaborators to have into the future.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.710
So, yeah, I would definitely recommend the 
University of Montana to anyone who is considering it.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.000
If I look at myself when I first started, 
I feel like a completely different person, but in a good way.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I feel like I have gained so much more than I originally thought I would.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.980
This would be a wonderful time 
to come in as a wildlife biology undergrad -

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.700
just the combination of these new resources, 
combined with the existing strengths in the program.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
We are training the next generation of wildlife biologists right now.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.050
We've already been recognized

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.140
as one of the best places 
in the nation to get that training,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.000
and with this distinction, we just got better.
