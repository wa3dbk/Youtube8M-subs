We are at a coal mine in Colombia, South
America--actually the Florida Museum of

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.389
Natural History--and with us is Darcy. I'm
so grateful the Florida Museum of Natural

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.240
History is here. My family and I have
enjoyed it for years and years and years.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.900
Before we go into exactly what's going
on here, tell us more about the Museum.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.130
We've got a lot of exhibitions at the
museum that are permanent or long-term.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.619
That includes our Butterfly Rainforest
which a lot of people have enjoyed over

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.869
the years. Fossil Hall. Exhibits about
Native American people and other

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.460
environments in Florida. In our main
changing gallery space where we're

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.469
standing right now, we have a new critter visiting us. 
--The Florida Museum

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.520
of Natural History played a part in the discovery.
--The actual first discovery was

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.160
by a student from Colombia who was
walking around this big coal mine and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.980
ran across a rock that he opened with a
hammer and voila there was a beautifully

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.719
preserved leaf of a rainforest plant.
There had never been a rainforest

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.280
discovered in the Americas from that
time period.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.869
He and his mentor from the Smithsonian's
Tropical Research Institution started to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.820
work on all of these plants, and called
our scientists to see if they could come

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.580
and look at animals. So our team went
down to join the Smithsonian and began

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.340
to ship back fossils from the coal mine.
Two students were in the laboratory

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.470
unwrapping all of these fossils, came
upon this huge vertebra from a back bone

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.049
of an animal, and the guy who was opening it thought 'well, it looks sort of like a

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.909
crocodile but I don't think it's a
crocodile.' And the other guy said 'wow, I

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.560
think it's a snake--VERY big snake.' And in
fact it was so big, they really didn't

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.250
believe it at first, and so they went to
get the comparative materials from a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.409
modern anaconda. We have a 17 foot
Anaconda vertebra that's about that big

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.240
and this thing is about that big.
--I love the way you laid out at the exhibit here.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.780
You're like leading us back to the model
of the Titanoboa

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.780
but before we get there there's other
things happening here... there's a lab?

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.560
It's called a paleo prep lab and it's where
they prepare the fossils from the field.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.880
--So you can see them doing work on fossils.
--Yes, real stuff from the coal mines.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.540
There's a giant turtle! I've never seen one quite like that. 
--Again, a new find to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.100
science and it's kind of the size of a
pool table. This thing is huge.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.540
That was also a find by you!

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.660
And several crocodilians from that period as well.
--The Titanoboa... how big?

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.940
This critter, as far as we can
tell so far, about 48 feet long. That's

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.200
like the size of a school bus. It lived
in the Paleocene, which was right after

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.700
the dinosaurs went extinct. So about 60
million years ago.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.980
You must see this to believe it. I mean, I know you can see it here on our show, which is great, but

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.890
you've got to come here in person.
This is a marvelous exhibit.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.080
It'll be open through August 11th. We're open all week,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.960
Monday through Saturday 10 to 5, and Sunday 1 to 5.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.940
I'm gonna go take another look, but like, from far away.
