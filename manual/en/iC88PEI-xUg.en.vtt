00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.760
Markku and I decided to
go somewhere far away.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.280
Dubai seemed the most
appealing.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.960
It has everything
- especially sand.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.860
After riding a dune buggy
our mouth was dry as the Sahara.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.080
Markku had a solution.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.420
The Dubai yacht marina.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.260
Alén couldn't contain his excitement
about riding in a Porsche boat.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.000
Markku's friend Jyrki Jäämaa
was waiting for us.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.520
Here he is!
The infamous boatman himself.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.980
Welcome!
Hello! Hi Markku.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.920
I've heard all about it
but seeing it is something else.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.340
How is Porsche involved?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.480
This guy wanted to build
a spectacular boat with no compromises.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.980
So he contacted Porsche design
with his plans.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.580
Then Donzi in Florida
made a batch of 14.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.780
- Only 14?
Yes and no more to come.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.400
- That's it.
Yeah.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.840
Where can you see them?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.260
- We've sold 4 of them
to the local bigwigs.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.120
The frame is fibre glass.
How about carbon fibre?

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.360
- There's some carbon fibre.
It's quite conventional.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.080
It has Porsche webs
over the motor.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.580
The first one we sold -

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:03.800
her husband had a GT.
And we sent a photo.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.820
She thought it would be
a great birthday present.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200
Jyrki has been around boats
his whole life.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.300
His business has taken him
from France to Singapore.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.920
And to Dubai in 2006.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.240
He mainly sells large yachts.
From 50ft to 100ft and over...

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.060
Markku was once a customer.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.320
How about it Markku?

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.480
I'm itching to try it out.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.260
- Once a speed junkie...

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.420
Reminisce the old days.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.840
- Yeah we've driven all sorts.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.780
And some long trips.
- Exactly.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.060
- You guys are making me nervous.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.320
I'll just have to trust
the speed junkie.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.980
- 62 knots.
Lets go.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.160
On towards the Persian Gulf!

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.940
Let the sea breeze caress
the boys from the thousand lakes!

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.720
It's on like Donkey Kong.
- Yep.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.820
Go for it.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.340
This is it!

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.500
We'll be in Iran soon...
- Yeah!

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.440
What do you think?
- It's quite fantastic.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.420
It's surprisingly gentle.
- Yeah it is.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.680
The steering is really precise.
Boats today are really sharp.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:10.400
The thing with these is
it takes a minute to find the groove.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.760
How fast were we going?

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.100
- 57 knots.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.240
1 knot equals
1 nautical mile per hour

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.740
and 1.9 km/h.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.120
The Mercury 525-HP
8.2 litre engine,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:36.060
weighing 2.7 tons,
produces a top speed of over 60 knots.

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.500
Captain Alén pushed it
near the limit.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.780
You don't feel the speed.
- No, but if there were waves it'd be wild.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.580
You'd have to have some nautical miles
under your belt to do that.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.240
When did you last drive a boat?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.680
- Pretty much every summer.
So you've kept a feel for it.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.360
- Yeah but...

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.860
not this fast.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.320
Thank you Jyrki!
- Yes!

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.480
Quite a unique experience.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.420
- Thanks for coming boys.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.020
Thanks!
- Come again sometime.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.940
Thanks we will!

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.280
Can you recommend
a restaurant or hotel?

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.260
- Absolutely. Lets head in.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.240
Avanti to the restaurant!
