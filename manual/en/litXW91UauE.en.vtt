00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I always thought people were so cute when they have the little cheeks and they're like rosier, but mine are pretty plain

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.000
If I was going to change one feature about my face I would say that I would want fuller lips. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I am definately a person that looks tired and when I'm tired and when people say that I'm immediately like:" Oh, man ". 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I'm starting to already get a little of crows feet and stuff which is like my mom has, so.. yeah.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.200
I'm a forensic artist, I was trained at the FBI academy in 1993 in composite art. 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.500
I worked for the San JosÃ© police department as the police artist from 1995 to 2011.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.000
We didn't really know what we were doing so that was nerve racking for everyone.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.000
I 've showed up to a place I've never been and walked into this big warehouse 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.500
and at the very end was a guy with his back to me with drafting board.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.500
I had a curtain separating me so that I don't see them.  

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.000
We'll begin.
 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
First of all, tell me about your hair. 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Hum... brown , long. I guess a little bit passed my shoulders.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Your jaw? 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.800
My mom always told me I had a big jaw. Yeah, they are brown eyebrows, dark brown eyebrows. 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.500
I didn't know what he was doing but I could tell after several questions that he was drawing me. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.800
Tell me about your chin.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.300
I guess I never really compared to anyone else's chin but, especially like when I smile I feel like it protrudes a little bit.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.900
What would be your most prominent feature.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.400
I kind of have a fat rounder face
 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.000
The older I've gotten the more freckles I've gotten. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We sort of realized: Oh, man, now I have to talk about myself and, and, and think about my looks.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm forty so I'm starting to get a little bit of the crows feet going on.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Once I get their sketch, I say "thank you very much "and then they leave, I don't see them.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.200
I still didn't know. All I have been told before the sketch was to get friendly with this other woman, Chloe.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.900
Today I'm gonna ask you some questions about a person you met earlier, 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.700
and I'm gonna ask you some general questions about her face.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
She was thin so you could see her cheek bones. And her chin was a nice thin chin. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.300
The women were really critical about moles, scars and things like that. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.500
And yet they were describing just a normal beautiful person. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
She had nice eyes. They light up when she spoke and were very expressive. 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.000
The length of the nose, what is that like?

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.100
Short

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.100
Short?

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.000
Yeah, cute nose.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.400
Her face was fairly thin.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.800
She had blue eyes, very nice blue eyes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.500
Ok.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:29.800
So, this is your self described image, and then somebody else described you like in this sketch.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.800
I have this whole thing about having dark circles and crows feet around my eyes 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.000
and that was not part of the sketch at all, that the stranger did. The stranger was a little more like, gentle.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It's pretty different.. 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Just looks strange....

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
She looks closed off and fatter. 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
She just looks kind of shut down, sadder too.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
The second one it's more beautiful.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.600
Do you think they are catching more from you?

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.300
Yeah... yeah.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.300
She looks more open and friendly and... 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
happy.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.800
I've come a long way in how I see myself, but I think I still have some way to go.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I have some work to do in myself.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Do you think you're more beautiful than you say?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Yeah. Yeah... yeah.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.400
Chloe's perception was so, so clearly different.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:33.800
Her picture looked like somebody I thought I would want to talk and be friends with, like a happy, light, much younger, much brighter person. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.300
It's troubling. I should be more grateful of my natural beauty. 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:50.500
It impacts the choices and the friends that we make, the jobs we apply for, how we treat our children... It impacts everything. It couldn't be more critical to your happiness. 
 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.000
Our self perceptions are generally kind of harsh 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.000
and unbecoming when really that's not how the world sees us.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.000
We spend a lot of time as women, analyzing and trying to fix the things that aren't quite right 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.000
and we should spend more time appreciating the things that we do like.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
YOU'RE MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU THINK.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
