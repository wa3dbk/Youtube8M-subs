00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:09.635
Hi, have you ever had trouble 
trying to see the LCD screen 

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:12.095
of your camera when working 
outdoors?

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.015
The viewfinder from Carry Speed 
will help you in these 
situations.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.850
Let's check it out!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.395
The LCD VFinder from Carry Speed
has a glass that magnifies

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:24.316
the camera's screen, multiplying
it by 2.5

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.985
For example, a 3 inch screen...

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:31.782
turns into the equivalent of a 
7.5 inch screen.

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:34.284
It has a simple but effective 
design...

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.954
with a plastic construction and 
a rubber eyepiece

00:00:36.954 --> 00:00:41.750
that can be folded for easier 
storage.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.042
This model is mounted on our 
camera with magnets that

00:00:45.042 --> 00:00:51.000
connect to a metal frame on top 
of our LCD Screen.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.347
The frame has special moldings 
on the corners

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:56.890
that lock the viewfinder in 
place

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.000
preventing movement or  
slippage.

00:01:03.564 --> 00:01:07.918
It comes with a strap to hang it
on our neck...

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:14.000
and can be quickly unlatched for
more freedom of movement.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:18.829
It's available in various sizes,
so make sure to get

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.000
the correct one depending on the
model of your camera.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.754
It's very lightweight and works 
perfectly fine on cameras

00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:33.000
with flip-out screens like the 
Canon T3i, 60D or similar.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.933
These type of accessories have 
two main functions...

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:40.934
First...

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:43.979
It allows us to correctly see 
our screen when outdoors

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.188
or in very bright situations.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:54.156
It blocks reflections and lets 
us isolate our screen from 
distractions.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:01:57.159
It's second use, which is very 
important...

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.495
is that it allows us to adjust 
our focus correctly

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:03.624
which has become more difficult 
with modern cameras

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:06.460
and the bigger control over 
depth of field

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.131
needing manual focusing most of 
the time.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:15.552
Another useful advantage of the 
viewfinder is that it becomes

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:19.556
and extra point of contact 
between us and the camera.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.977
This gives us improved stability
and also feels very comfortable

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:27.731
when shooting handheld.

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:32.235
The only negative is that in 
very hot or humid situations...

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.404
the glass tends to fog easily.

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:36.198
But this usually goes away by 
removing our eye

00:02:36.198 --> 00:02:39.000
for a couple of seconds from the
eyepiece.

00:02:42.834 --> 00:02:46.083
A viewfinder will make for a 
more comfortable shoot and will 

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.752
let you know that your videos 
are looking like you want them 
to.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.796
There are similar models from 
other brands...

00:02:50.796 --> 00:02:54.466
but Carry Speed offers great 
quality for a low price.

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:58.000
It's an accessory that we 
consider essential for your 
camera.
