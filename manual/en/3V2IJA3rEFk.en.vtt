00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.269
[Opening jingle]

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.719
Hi and welcome to The Bread Kitchen.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.499
When I was growing up, no trip to a cafÃ¨ with my mother was complete without a toasted teacake.

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:24.029
So today I'm gonna show you how to make the classic English Teacake

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.619
which despite it's name, isn't a cake at all!

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:34.030
I'm gonna make 6 reasonably large teacakes and for that I've got 450 g of bread flour,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.420
285 ml of slightly warm milk,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.870
a 125 g of sultanas or you could use raisins or currants or a mixture,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.210
2 tablespoons of caster sugar. I happened to be using golden caster sugar but any fine sugar will do,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.240
2 teaspoons of yeast - dried yeast

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.039
and here there's a teaspoon of salt, a quarter of a teaspoon of cinnamon

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.670
and a couple of big pinches of cloves and ground ginger.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.140
Put the yeast

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.330
and the sugar to the milk.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.950
Give it a good whisk

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.350
and then leave it 10 minutes for the yeast to activate.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.100
Meanwhile, sift the spices and the salt into a bowl

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:22.210
and then sift in the flour, just to get rid of any lumps.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.840
Make a well in the middle of the flour,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.860
pour in the milk and yeast

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.350
and mix to a nice, soft dough.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.450
What you should end up with is a nice, soft dough which is slightly tacky, not sticky 'cos it's not sticking to my hands

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.610
but you can fee, it's...

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.350
It's like the glue on a posting note.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.350
I'll now knead the dough, on a floured surface,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.049
for 5 minutes and give it a good kneading.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.720
After 5 minutes of punishing your dough,

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600
spread it out a bit,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.280
add on the sultanas

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.000
and then, fold the dough over

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.930
and then begin kneading to disperse the

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.450
sultanas throughout the dough. Now some of them will pop out

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.339
but that's OK 'cos you can pop them in again.

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.079
Knead this for a couple of more minutes.

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.099
When you've got the sultanas throughout the dough

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.199
and it's quite springy. Pop it in a lightly-oiled bowl,

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:30.290
cover it, then put it in a warm place and allow the dough to double in size.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.809
Ooh! I'm loving this puffed-up puffiness!

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:38.119
So I'll just flour the surface again,

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.299
turn the dough out,

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.479
knock it back a bit

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:48.209
and I'll just knead it for about 2 minutes.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.309
Alright. Now I'm gonna cut this dough in six pieces.

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:53.879
You can cut it into

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.379
eight if you want smaller teacakes.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.759
I'll take each piece and make it into a nice ball

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:08.069
by kinda folding it in under itself.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.259
Just press the balls down slightly to flatten them a bit

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:15.999
then pop them onto a lightly-greased baking tray.

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.529
Cover with some clingfilm which you've lightly-oiled

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:27.079
and then we'll put them in a warm place for about 45 minutes to an hour to allow them to rise.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.719
These have risen rather nicely.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.289
Now you can, if you wish, brush these with milk.

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:37.369
I'll just brush two of them to show you what the difference of the milk makes.

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:45.009
Now, I'll bake these in the oven at 175 degrees Celsius fan oven or 200 degrees Celsius normal oven for about 15 minutes.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:49.449
And here they are. These two were milk-glazed and they've got like a satin-y finish to them?

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:54.219
Whereas these four which didn't have the milk glaze have got more of a matte finish.

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:57.749
So I just pop them on a wire rack to cool.

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.059
Ooh, they're a bit hot!

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:04.299
When they're cooled, your teacakes should be nice and soft.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.299
Let's cut one open!

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.919
Oooh! Lovely! I can't wait to get this toasted!

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:19.919
I do love toasted Teacakes. They're a real connection with my childhood.

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.020
The best way to eat these is to slice them in half,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.860
toast them, slather them with butter

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.460
and you can eat them like that or maybe put some slices of cheese on top or jam.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.449
Whatever you want, really.

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:38.409
I hope you enjoy making your Teacakes. Thanks for watching and join me again in The Bread Kitchen.
