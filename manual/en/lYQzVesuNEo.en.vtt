00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.370
Now, we're going to serve our appetizer trio.
It looks delicious. I'm hungry just looking

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:13.870
at it. We have our barbeque chicken quesadillas,
which have a little bit extra special aspect

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:25.090
to them. They have pickle relish in them and
blue cheese, as well as cheddar cheese. Give

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:42.460
those a slice and we'll slice another one.
Take our plate. We have come nice leaf lettuce

00:00:42.460 --> 00:01:02.789
and we add our quesadillas like that. Isn't
that pretty? That looks delicious. Next, we

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.970
have our stuffed mushrooms. Very easy presentation.
Because, these look great just on their own.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:21.570
They don't need anything else. Their stuffed
with sausage, onion, sour cream and a little

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:31.990
parmesan Romano cheese. And, then finally
we have our wonderful crab and artichoke dip.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:47.210
It has dill, fresh dill, fresh crab meat and
fresh scallions.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:02:03.180
And, I saved some of the bigger pieces of
crab meant to put on top. Put a little lime.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:15.959
And for dipping, I have some baby carrots.
And, a little bit of grissini which is breadsticks.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:26.230
And, there you are. A crab dip, stuffed mushrooms
and barbeque chicken quesadillas.
