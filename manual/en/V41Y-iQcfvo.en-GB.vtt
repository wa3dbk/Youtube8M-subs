00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.260
Can we get one thing straight right now? Can
Luis Suarez please stop biting people? Not

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.800
because of any danger or harm or risk that
he poses to any other player but for goodness

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.019
sake can we just stop having to suffer the
surge of shit puns and ridiculous memes. It's

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.029
boring. Even more boring in fact than Costa
Rica Vs England.

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.119
Welcome to the Guardian World Cup Show News!

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.920
We feel a bit like the parent of a teenager
caught doing meth this morning. Ignoring the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.649
fact isn't going to make it better, so at
the very least let's just try and get through

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.960
this without either of us needing years of
counselling. Where to start? The incident

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.790
itself, the histrionics or some of the reaction
flying around on social media?

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.579
While we may be disappointed, any fading celebrity
or brand needing a bandwagon to hop onto had

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:57.480
a field day with McDonalds and Listerine amongst
the most effectively cynical exploiters and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.120
it even brought former bite victim and the
social-media -savvy Evander Holyfield out

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.539
of retirement, getting his tweet in quick.

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.159
And just to add insult to injury Suarez's
post-attack play-acting completed proceedings

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.399
and turned the whole incident into the equivalent
of a angry man punching a wall and then wondering

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.630
why the wall isn't the one with the broken
hand.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.869
Which leaves us asking the question WHY? Maybe
the BBCs Danny Murphy summed it up most succinctly

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.659
"There's something wrong in the head with
him and I mean that in the nicest possible

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.819
way" - just to be clear, he was talking about
Suarez (not Alan Shearer)

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.929
So maybe the biggest question we should be
asking is WHAT? What fate lies in store for

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.569
Suarez? With that in mind we sent Marek Larwood
to find out

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.160
I'm going on the street again to find our what sort of punishment FIFA should give Suareeeeeeeeeez

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.160
For me it's an automatic ban, he shouldn't even play in the world cup, he should be banned from the world cup

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.700
Whilst he should get a punishment he should also be looked in to for his mental stability

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.740
Banned from international football for a couple of years

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.540
Personally, I think he's disgraceful the guy should be banned for a considerable period of time

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.660
These people are role models and he shouldn't play any further part in international football. I think he should be banned for life.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.640
Lot's of people said stuff, what was it that they said? I don't know. Back to you.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.110
Thanks Marek. That's what they think, what about you? What punishment do you think Suarez should get?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.780
Let us know in the comments below.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.829
I wish I'd put on a fiver on it happening,
but as you can see we've spent all the World

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.849
Cup Show budget on this expensive set. Besides
this Norwegian guy got there first -

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.629
If Suarez being the first player in the tournament
to bite someone wasn't much of a surprise,

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.599
card-happy referee Marco Rodriguez - nickname
little Dracula - not punishing him, was. 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.849
Not that Rodriguez was that bothered having already
upped his red card count to 52 in 80 games that is.

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.249
Mario Balotelli did his best to make it 53
with this "Knee dive off the turnbuckle"

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:03.099
But perhaps most disappointingly of all, shorlty
after the game, the serene &amp; studied Cesare

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.230
Prandelli resigned. Nice job, Luis.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.010
And, just when you thought England couldn't
be more underwhelming........the Costa Rica

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.799
game, supposedly heralding the dawn of a new
era ended with Gerrard and Lampard in the

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.930
middle and Rooney on the right.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.200
At least the game won "most ambiguous sign
spotted in the crowd" award: "Thanks Gerrard"

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.040
Elswhere, the Golden generation of Ivory Coast
managed to beat themselves, conceding an injury

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.280
time penalty to Greece to go out of the tournament.
That's the Greek team who haven't scored in

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.010
over 18 thousand earth hours. So 2 goals in
90 minutes presumably makes them a golden

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.200
generation too, by their standards.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.079
And FIFA has announced that it is unable to
bring charges over German fans wearing black

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.709
face make-up during the match against Ghana
meaning the 2 fans spotted are off the hook.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.310
That well may be, but we still think they're
massive bell ends.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.980
Nigeria are the only team left in the tournament
yet to concede a goal. In fact, The Super

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.620
Eagles have kept a clean sheet for 221 consecutive
World Cup minutes.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.790
The African side have never beaten South American
opposition at a World Cup, but they have every

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.700
chance here with Argentina converting just
8% of their shots, with Lionel Messi their

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.220
only goalscorer thus far.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.200
That's just about it for today's news let us know what you think about Luis Suarez 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.400
and Prandelli and England for that matter, in the comments below
