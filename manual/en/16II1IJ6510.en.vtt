00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas, and what I'm going to do next is

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.309
U-shaped knitting, that is, it is a big piece of stockinette,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.939
like the circular knitting I was doing, but it's open on one end so when it comes off the machine it can be

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.589
opened out like a book.  That means that I can make a very, very wide piece of knitting by using

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.639
both beds of the machine.  I would be knitting like this:

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.980
across and back and then knit the main bed again,

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.140
knit the ribber again, then the ribber again, then the main bed again.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.900
And I think the easiest way to show this is to get busy and do it.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.160
Here's a needle arrangement.  It's set up for full needle rib.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.410
For my sample, I'm going from 15 to 15.  The end needles are on the main bed, and I'm set at half pitch

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.119
so that the two beds are offset.  The gate pegs do not match up.  And then here's my set up

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.759
for the zigzag row.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.380
What I want for the zigzag row is the tightest tension and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230
the main carriage set on plain,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.089
the ribber carriage set on plain, and I want the tightest possible

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.620
tension.  So I'm set for my zigzag row. And let me get threaded.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.940
I'm just passing

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.080
this waste yarn, which is purple, between the beds.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.229
I'm putting a clothes pin on it.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.800
I'm threading it and I'm going across,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.956
and here's my zigzag row.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.680
Let's zoom in on that zigzag row.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.360
I'm putting the ribber comb in now.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.750
I'm just centering the comb

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.290
putting it between the beds, removing the wire partially,

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260
pushing the wire back in,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270
and then I hang weights.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.949
For this many stitches, I just want one weight on each end.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.949
This is repetitious, but I have some idea of how much video time I have,

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.330
so when I can, I go ahead and give all the instructions.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.069
Now I'm going to put a few rows on in

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.789
circular knitting with this purple yarn

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.419
because I just need to make a start with this before I go ahead and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.730
thread the main garment yarn.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.619
Here are the circular settings -- tension one;  left part button, which means this will slip to the left and knit to the right;

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.459
tension one; right part lever, which means this will knit to the left and slip to the right.

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.729
Let me just do three rows circular. This is going to be removed.  This is not

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.799
going to be part of the actual sheet of knitting that I'm making.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.229
Okay.  I'm going to thread the main garment yarn.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:17.759
I just cut this purple yarn, which is the throwaway yarn, and I tie the main yarn to it,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.669
and then I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.069
use a hook --

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.809
it's a latch tool -- to bring the yarn down in between the two beds, and

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.840
then I'll switch my clothes pin

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.219
from the end that it was hanging on to this.

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.279
Now here's an important thing -- let me get this tension loosened up.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.769
I've loosened the tension on both carriages and I'm going to be changing the settings every two rows,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.269
so the one important thing that's a take away from this is how to keep track of it if you should happen to be

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:08.399
interrupted while you're knitting.  Now for these first two rows, I am going to -- on the main carriage --

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.739
slip to the right,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.410
slip to the left on the ribber.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.549
And what that's going to do is knit across the main bed,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.420
knit back on the ribber.  So let me get those first two rows knitted.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.360
I have the first two rows knitted.  Every two rows I

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.820
change the settings.  On the ribber,  I put this one up and this one down.  On

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:44.649
the main bed, I just pop the other button.  On my machine, if you push in one button, then it cancels the other.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.640
You can push two buttons at once, but you have to hold them both at the same time.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.780
So I have knitted

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.220
from the top

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.260
over and then on the bottom over, so I'm on the bottom.  So now I need to knit on the bottom and on over.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.219
Here is something to think about if you should happen to be interrupted because you have to switch every two rows.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.119
When you come back from your interruption, look at where the yarn tail is coming from.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.639
Let's say I've been interrupted.  The yarn tail is coming from the main bed.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.710
So I want to knit back across the main bed.  So if it's coming from the main bed,

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.750
then I want the main carriage to knit to the left, and then I'm going to want the ribber carriage to slip to the left.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.970
So I can use that -- which bed it's coming from -- to keep track of where I am.

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:51.130
So I'm going to continue doing this -- knitting two rows and then switching the settings -- a number of times so we'll have a good sample.

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:38.469
I think I've done enough rows to have a good sample,  so I'm going to go ahead and cut the yarn.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:45.609
and take the sample off the machine with just open stitches at the top by knitting across and back

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:47.809
and catching it.

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.024
And then I'm going to put it up on the machine and show it.

00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:53.289
Here's my finished sample.

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:59.588
It's joined at the bottom with the purple.  This was the zigzag row at the very bottom, and

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.700
suppose I were to cut and remove that zigzag row.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.140
I got hold of an end

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.809
and I'm just removing that.

00:07:08.779 --> 00:07:12.369
Okay.  With that removed, I can open this out.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.079
It's a big sheet of stockinette.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:24.549
It grew in the machine in a folded condition, and now this is what I have.

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:30.969
I mentioned on the circular knitting that if you use this for a garment, you should check

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:36.398
the gauge between the main bed and the ribber bed and make sure that they match, and

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:43.260
I also mentioned that if you want 20 rows of this, you need 40 rows on the row counter.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:51.260
So that's how to do U-shaped knitting for a very wide piece of stockinette.
