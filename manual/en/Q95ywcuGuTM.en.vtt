00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.880
&gt;&gt; CUTTS: Hey, everybody. We wanted to show
you kind of a fun trick that you can do with

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.010
Google Book Search and a barcode scanner.
Now, in theory, you could use the camera that's

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.880
built in to your Android G1 if you wanted
to because there is a really nice barcode

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.400
functionality built in, there's a library
you can use. So, someone could write a 20%

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.330
project to do this, but, today, what we're
going to use is an actual barcode scanner.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.680
Now, these are not that expensive. I got this
for a little under seventy bucks from Amazon.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.210
This from a company called Adesso, and it's
called the NuScan 1000U. So, it's actually

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.600
really easy to use. It's just USB device,
and you plug it in, and you can hear it's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.879
ready to go, and it just pretends like it's
a keyboard. So, all you have to do is put

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.210
it on a book, click the button and it will
scan it. So, I brought some books in, "Google

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.659
Apps Deciphered," "Google Apps: The Missing
Manual," and "Google Apps: The Administrator

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.729
Guide," and, of course, "Google Apps Hacks"
from Philip Lenssen, a Google Blogoscope.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.770
So, we've got a lot of Google Apps related
book that we want to add to our library. So,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.610
there's a little feature that you might not
know in books.google.com. You go and you sign

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.400
in and you--see at the top right, there's
a link that says "my library," and when you

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.150
click on it, it starts out as empty you don't
have any books in your library at all. So,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.380
let's add a few books using the barcode scanner.
There will be a link for imported books, just

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.530
click that. And you'll see a text area where
you can type in ISBN numbers. It's a real

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.100
pain to see an ISBN number--this number under
the barcode--and actually type it in, so what

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.740
we're going to do is take our barcode scanner,
put it right up to it and scan. And you can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.390
hear the click and we got an ISBN number.
So, now if you click the import button, we'll

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.810
see whether it found it correctly. And it
did. It turns out that Google Apps Hacks might

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.930
have been called "Google Office Hacks" in
an earlier life. So, now, if you want to import

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.090
more than one book at once, it's even easier.
You just click import book. You still have

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.810
the text area. This barcode scanner looks
just like you're typing on the keyboard. So,

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.200
I just scan something and I hit return. Now,
I'm going to scan another book. There you

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.840
go. And let's do this final book. There you
go. So, I've entered three books. I click

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.590
import and, sure enough, it found all of those
three books. So now we have four books in

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.520
our library. And if you click "view my library,"
you can star them, you can look at them, and,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.230
in fact, if you click on cover view--if we
have covers for them--will show those covers.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.319
There's a little known fact that you can search
within books.google.com and only search over

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.290
your library, so, that's why you might use
this. Imagine, for example, that you remembered,

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.440
"Oh, one of my code books, one of my programming
books had something about quicksort, but I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.740
don't remember which book it was." Well, you
can go here and you could say "search over

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.060
my library" and then you'll be able to find
whatever snippet was that was just in your

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.040
books that were on your bookshelf. So, it's
a lot of fun and, more importantly, it's a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.560
good reason to play with a gadget. So, you
might want to try it. It's very cheap, very

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.770
easy to do and it's kind of fun to digitize
your library, your bookshelf of books. And

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.930
it's not really scanning all these books in
real time--you don't want to do that yourself--but

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.290
just by entering that ISBN number, you're
able to search over your own books and search

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.140
over your library. Give it a try.
