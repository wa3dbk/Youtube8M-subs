00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.080
So the first step is we need to cut our fabric
down to the right size.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.629
So to do that, we need to do a little bit
of math.

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:20.240
We're working with a 20 inch by 20 inch pillow,
and we want to leave some room for seam allowance

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.780
on either side.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.930
So with your fabric, fold it in half, just
like it comes off the bolt from the fabric

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.930
store.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.840
You want to take a ruler and you want to measure
12 inches from the fold of your fabric.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.330
And you might wonder why 12 inches.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.039
Well, we want to keep two inches of seam allowance
on either side of the pillow, and since our

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:48.020
fabric is folded in half, once we open the
fold we're going to be at 24 inches.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.300
So you can take a water-soluble marker, these
things are great.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.620
They can draw on fabric and they disappear
with a little bit of water.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.629
And you want to take your ruler and just measure
the 12 inches and make some lines to guide

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.629
yourself.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.100
Always measure from the folded edge.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.370
You can fold your fabric up, move it down.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.210
Okay.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.320
Now once you have your line marked, you're
just going to go ahead and cut right down

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.990
that line.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.310
It's helpful to not have your fabric hanging
off the edge of the table because it'll weigh

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.880
your fabric down and as you're cutting things
might shift a little.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.160
So lay your fabric out nice and flat and then
go ahead and start cutting on the line that

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.190
you made.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:51.130
As you go, you can just roll your pieces out
if you're working on a smaller table.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.810
Also important, as you're cutting, if you're
cutting the way I am, with the fabric bunched

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.420
up on one end as you move it, be very careful
that you're not accidentally cutting the bottom

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.649
layer here as you're going, or you'll ruin
your project.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.910
Perfect.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:19.189
So you take your excess fabric and set it
aside for another fun project later.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:28.959
We're going to simply take our fabric and
open it up, and lay our pillow on top.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.700
And here you can see where we have a little
extra on either side for our seam allowance.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.349
Now what you want to do is take the fabric
and fold it over the top of your pillow so

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.549
that it hits about two-thirds to three-quarters
the way from one side of the pillow.

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:50.829
You're going to take your other side and wrap
it going the other way to cover the entire

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:51.829
pillow.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.950
Now we want this raw edge to be about the
same spot, about two-thirds to three-quarters

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.860
of the way past the opposite side of the pillow.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.920
But, because these edges are raw, we want
to finish them so our pillow looks very professional.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.359
So we want to give an extra two inches, about,
on either side, which would be four inches

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.519
total for turning under our raw edges.

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:23.189
So we'll just estimate about four edges, and
as you can see with our yard and a half of

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.140
fabric, we really don't have that much extra
left.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.260
So if you want you can cut this off, or it's
really not that big of a deal.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.079
You could leave it if you don't want to cut
it.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.079
So that's it.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.759
We've measured and cut our fabric, and now
it's time to finish off our raw edges.
