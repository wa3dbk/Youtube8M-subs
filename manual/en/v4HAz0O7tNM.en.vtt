00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.449
Today we're learning more about

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:10.879
BioSand water filters

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.360
What do we do we have this filter we put
water into it, right?

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.219
water...

00:00:18.219 --> 00:00:22.210
Can somebody guess how to say water in
Portuguese? It's not water.. 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.210
Aqua (says the class)

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.210
Aqua is right

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.029
We’re here representing the Pantanal
Project team.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.289
We’re here to teach students how to build
BioSand water filters.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.490
Our team goes to Brazil to build BioSand
Water filters in different schools

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:39.890
and we’re going this summer to build
four or five different schools, so

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.170
we’re coming here to teach students how
to build these filters because it's going to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.970
be good practice for us.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.550
On Monday we helped pour concrete into the
molds to make them.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.550
And then today we’re filling it with the sand
and the gravel that goes into it.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.610
We decided to do this project at Slauson
because we’re doing a similar outreach

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.290
project in Brazil.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.360
So, we're doing this largely in preparation
for working with the same age group

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.220
but with Portuguese speaking Brazilian kids
in a rural area in Brazil.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.890
“...pour water on sand, it’s going to spread
all the sand out...”

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.920
Brazil is a Portuguese speaking country
and the part that we are going to in Brazil,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.340
there is no English influence at all. All
they understand is Portuguese and so,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.290
through the semester, all of us have 
gone through

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.000
rigorous training in Portuguese, and
we have a couple that know

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.460
really good Portuguese.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.720
“Boa tarde aula de português..

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.130
is..good afternoon Portuguese class.”

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.760
It’s, you know, a whole
different learning process

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.970
of teaching young kids as opposed to
teaching adults who have already been 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.400
through all this and there’s definitely

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.750
a learning curve for all of us teachers,
how to not control but involve

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.200
everybody and make sure everybody is
getting something out of this.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.179
I think it’s a really good idea
to help out other people.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:10.840
I think it’s cool, because they’re
helping people.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.899
It’s been amazing. I’ve actually seen
how easily kids catch on to

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:21.839
something that's as complicated as
a water filter.

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:25.680
“Well on the bottom there’s gravel and
then separating gravel, but it’s

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.069
like smaller than the gravel on the
very bottom, and then there’s

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.909
sand, then there’s a metal plate
with a bunch of holes in it

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.019
and it reminds me of like a...”
“SWISS CHEESE!”

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.449
“Not a colander..yes..it’s a 
colander! And then there’s

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:42.449
a tube in there, and it’s concrete.”

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:44.619
The different aspects that go into it,

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.749
there’s physics as mechanical engineering
there’s biology and they seem to

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:52.579
understand everything so that gives 
me a lot more confidence to do this

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.739
successfully in Brazil. So it's been
a great experience

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.739
I’m very excited. The Pantanal is the
world’s largest wetland, and

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.729
we’re going to have lots
of fun
