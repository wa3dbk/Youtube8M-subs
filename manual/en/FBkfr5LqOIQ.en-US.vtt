00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.000
I usually like to play as I normally do

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
but I thought that if I use a strategic build from the start

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.500
then it will be easier for me to play a normal macro game in the later sets

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.900
If you lose to a player who you always did well against

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.300
you get more upset and frustrated. He should be feeling that way right now

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.500
My feeling was like, 'Finally, I did it. I overcame him'

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.800
It was like I achieved something

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.000
My fans were frustrated and sad to see me perform poorly

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.700
and that made me really want to win and I practiced even harder

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700
I feel good that the results were good

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.700
I will do my best to show my fans more winning games in the future
