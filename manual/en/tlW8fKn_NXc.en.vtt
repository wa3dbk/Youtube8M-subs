00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.159
I got two kids and a wife at home

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:10.279
and my daughter's 8 and 

00:00:10.279 --> 00:00:12.079
wanted to go to dance school

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:14.259
and on the salary I was making at the time

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.650
it wasn't really a good salary to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.279
do all the things that she wanted to do

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.869
I've been behind a desk my entire
life and i got laid off

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.219
I thought you know I've never seen the country.
I've been the person working job to job to job. I worked at fast food.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:27.919
Manager for a while.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.919
I wanted to drive a truck ever since I was little. Ever since the first time I saw a big rig pull up next to our car.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.530
I was working at a convenience store making minimum wage, worked there for over a year and a half.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.870
I was in a remodel business with my dad

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.020
For 30 years I was an accountant for a CPA firm doing taxes

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.850
I was ready for new line of work

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.670
Saw the big wheels, heard the sound of the airbrakes and I just fell in love.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.540
Wasn't offered a raise

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.870
Was turned down for a promotion

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.890
And the way the economy was going it was 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.279
downhill quite a bit

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:07.279
I got laid off and told I wasn't gonna get called back. And I thought if I can get paid

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.260
to see the country,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.470
that might be the way to go.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.890
and I need a career I need something that's stable

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.860
Something that I can do that will provide me benefits and opportunities to grow and learn

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.890
something better, something new. And better myself

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.909
and have some fun too. My whole life I always wondered what the

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.290
open road experience would be like and 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.610
here I am, I've finally made the decision to go for it. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.010
If you're thinking about a career as a professional truck driver

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.450
you've come to the right place

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.100
truck driving is one of the best careers
in america and driver solutions

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.020
company-sponsored training

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.979
can put you on the road to success with
a great trucking company

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.909
driver solutions is more than just truck
driver training

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.930
we're focused on finding the right
opportunity for you with the right

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.460
trucking company

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.060
we do all the hard work

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.070
so all you need to do is complete the
training

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.000
it's easy to get started

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.520
there's no credit check

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.090
no down payment no co signers

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.780
just a commitment from you to drive to
the trucking company that is sponsoring 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.140
your cdl training. I needed a new
career and it was good training, 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.559
good company and i looked it up, I researched it

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:18.840
and I decided this is the place, the way I wanted to go.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.480
They gave me a day to call up my 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.170
driver agent

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.139
And he connected me right away with a carrier

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:31.159
and what to be expecting. The driver agents were great I mean they helped us 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:36.549
through what we were going through and if we had any questions they were real good at answering them

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.629
and putting stuff on our website for us, our driver account. You commit to the carrier for a year

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.879
which is really not a big commitment in my opinion. 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.499
and the benefits are 

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:48.409
at par with all the other big companies out there 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.139
You got your 401ks, your retirements, 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:58.139
health benefits, insurance, all the things you could look for in a career. 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.169
It's a three week course

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:06.939
As long as you apply yourself and study hard, 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.049
Anybody could do it. 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.450
They're gonna be with the classroom instructor for the
first week

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.819
The first few days we cover the basics to get your permit

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.290
Air brakes, combination vehicles, 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.679
General knowledge, 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:20.769
the state operator test

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.859
And from there from the classroom 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.809
tests after they get the permit we get into

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:31.269
DOT test, teach you about map tripping, how to log, 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.999
We cover hazmat a little bit. It's not what I expected. 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:38.389
I thought when I was going to school, it would be school. 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:39.829
you would have that 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.839
teacher so to say, standing there and just lecturing you

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:50.679
But things have gone great. It's really smooth, it's informative. The instructors are really really great. 

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:56.549
They really work with you, encourage you to ask questions. And be clear on all the information given. 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.119
In the second week they can expect to get their hands on opportunities 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:06.759
with the equipment. To learn how to back up on the range

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.659
backing exercises

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.549
learn how to apply that theory they read about in week one in driving 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:14.169
the truck and shifting

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.650
uh... making turns safe operation on the
street with the equipment

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.699
It gets to be really hands on during the
second week

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:26.319
I'm getting more confidence in being
prepared to be out there, it takes 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.210
practice i've never been even, never sat in a vehicle, in a semi before I came to 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.550
school here.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.650
You look at the truckers leaning out their windows and think it's gonna be easy

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.190
But you get here and find out it's not easy

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.289
And the instruction you get from the instructors is awesome.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.820
You're shifting gears, and going backwards

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.430
and not hitting' stuff and looking for cones. 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.449
It's a real time learning experience. I've never driven one of these before and

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.729
just came back and survived my first road trip

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.370
In that third week of training a student can expect

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.999
to finish

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.650
their training

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.809
we

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:03.060
ensure

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.919
to the best of our ability

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.319
that a student has a sound

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.759
foundation

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.389
to build from. 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.240
The operation of the equipment

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.720
We're gonna work really hard to make sure that student understands

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.770
The proper techniques to use to do that. 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.450
To be safe. Number one above is to 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.719
be safe. 

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:24.230
Many new friends, hopefully I'm gonna 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.050
cross paths with them on the road and we're gonna take 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.710
our ten hour break together

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.919
I've made some good friends, they helped me out a lot. 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.449
Like to think I helped them out a lot

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.300
too.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.500
Never thought I'd be able to do the things I'm doing now. The training has been outstanding.

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.210
Definitely given me all the basics I need to get out on the road. 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.350
Just completed my driver training

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.610
and I now become a truck driver

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:48.610
What

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.259
gives us the greatest feeling and what
i'm most proud of as

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.990
in this in this job

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.089
is that we have a chance

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:57.610
to help some one change their life

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.099
so when I see that grad, I know that grad has a chance now

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.909
To provide for themselves and their families

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:06.889
There's no greater feeling than that. 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:11.789
It's a joy for myself and for the staff and for that student now that

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.570
in three weeks

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.570
they've started from not knowing how to get in a truck, 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.869
to now being able to operate it

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:23.870
safely out on the roadway.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.999
there's nothing better than that

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.779
We really do, we change lives here. 
That's my motivation

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.069
my family, my home. 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:37.899
Making sure I can provide for them. 

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:42.110
I get to come out here and live a dream.
It was amazing to get out here and start driving one and have a dream come true. 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.409
The trucking industry is growing. 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.389
Everything in your household came from a truck at some point. 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:54.389
That product got there on a truck so there's always opportunity for truck drivers. 
I'm helping keep America running. 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.219
Changing careers is a big decision. 

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:03.360
it's important to understand not only
what to expect from the job but what is

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.619
expected of you as a driver.

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:09.929
Our website is a complete resource for
