Hey guys, it's Clarissa, and today I'm going
to be doing another very very exciting DIY

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.530
summery beach themed video.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.800
So I'm going to be showing you guys how to
make your very own diy seashell bracelet,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.929
your own bathing suit coverup, your own bohemian
wrap sandals, and also your own super fast,

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.649
super easy, completely no-sew beach bag.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.440
Also another very exciting announcement! not
really an announcement yet, it's more of a

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
question, but it's exciting!

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.190
A couple videos back in my 16th birthday haul,
I asked you guys for your family names for

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.530
our fam here on youtube, and you guys had
some super awesome ideas, but I still can't

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.500
decide because the thing is that I love May
Baes, and I also love Clar Bears, but then

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.270
I also love May Flowers so I don't know, I'm
really trying to decide between these three

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.270
ideas.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.770
So you guys need to choose one of your favorites
from these three ideas and comment down below

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.490
and let me know which one is your favorite
because I am at a loss, it is such a hard

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.490
decision!

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.690
And also let me know which of these DIYs was
your favorite, because I'm always curious

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.690
to know!

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.740
So without further ado, let's get into the
video!

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.210
summer music, summer DIYs, Do-it-yourself
projects, makeup, bikini, sandals, coverup,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.600
no-sew bag, + more!

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.590
First I'm going to be showing you 6 easy and
unique ways to customize your bikini!

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.981
These are super quick, and they don't require
any cutting or sewing... all you need is a

00:01:39.981 --> 00:01:41.289
basic triangle bikini!

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.270
This first way is to tie your bikini into
this super cute strappy design.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.880
This is definitely my favorite, and it's really
unique!

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.640
Separate the two triangles of the bikini,
and loop the long strap you created between

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.040
them over your neck Now, each of the triangles
will have their own set of strings, which

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.149
can be tied around your body as low or as
high as you want!

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.700
Next up is this scoop neck design.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.299
Just flip the bikini upside down, bring the
bottom tie up around your neck, and wear the

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.240
gathered part of the triangles on the inside
for a rounded shape.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.610
This criss-cross halter design is another
really unique style.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.909
It's the same as the scoop neck, except with
the top straps criss-crossed around your neck.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.599
Next up is a simple tie front bandeau.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.560
Wear your bikini with the gathers on the inside
like the scoop neck design, then tie together

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.860
the two top straps in a bow in the front.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.940
Next is a criss-cross halter variation on
the bandeau design.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.760
Instead of tying the straps together in a
bow in the front, tie them in a single knot,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.790
then loop them up around your neck and tie
them in the back.

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.290
If you want to quickly add a little more sparkle
and blink to any of these designs, you can

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.120
add some beads to the ties, or inbetween the
triangles in the front, and if your bikini

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:59.360
bottom ties at the sides, it's super fun to
add them there too!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.900
This next DIY is a super cute coverup, which
is awesome to wear over a bathing suit, and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.459
also over a normal shirt when you're not at
the beach!

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.480
All you need to make it is a plain t-shirt
and a pair of scissors.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.989
Start by laying out the t-shirt on a flat
surface, and fold over the bottom 3 inches

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:14.989
of the t-shirt.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.090
Now start cutting triangles in the fold of
fabric you just made, until you have 6 evenly

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.209
spaced triangles cut all the way across.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.110
Move the fold of the t-shirt up, and you'll
see that the triangles made super cool cut

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.170
out diamonds!

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.650
Cut another row of triangles, then move the
fold up again, and keep repeating this until

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.650
you reach the sleeves!

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.860
Now unfold the t-shirt, and cut off the sleeves
and the neck seam, then fold under the top

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.500
section of the shirt, and cut one more row
of triangles, but be very careful that you

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.450
don't cut beyond the edges of the shirt!

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.040
To finish it off, unfold the top of the shirt
a little bit, and cut two triangles in each

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.459
shoulder, then you're done!

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.340
This shirt is super boho and cute, and a perfect
way to stand out at the beach!

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.420
Next I'm going to be showing you how to make
these gorgeous bohemian wrap sandals.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.780
They're really comfortable, and an easy way
to spruce up a boring pair of flip flops.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.450
All you need is a pair of scissors, a pair
of flip flops, and a long scarf.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.750
Start by cutting the scarf in half lengthwise,
then fold each section in half.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.340
take one of the sections, and loop it under
the strap of one of the flip flops, the bring

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.239
both ends of the scarf through the loop.

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.220
Now separate both of the ends of the scarf,
and start tightly twisting each end around

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.590
the straps of the flip flop.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.550
Once you've completely covered the straps
with fabric, you're done!

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.580
You can tie the long loose ends of the fabric
however you like!

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.640
I wrapped mine in a crisscross around my ankles,
then tied them in the front, and they're super

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.640
cute, comfortable, and secure!

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.910
These are definitely my new go-to beach sandals!

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.500
Now that you've got your beachy coverup, shoes,
and customized bikini, I'm going to be showing

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.120
you how to make a super simple no-sew beach
bag out of a scarf in just 3 minutes!

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.750
Lay out your square scarf on a flat surface,
then fold the scarf in half.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.460
Now tie together a knot at each end of the
triangle you just made, , and make sure to

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.130
leave plenty of extra fabric at the small
end of the knot.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.780
Now open up the triangle, and pick it up by
grabbing the center of the scarf, and gently

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.460
shaking it as you lift it upwards.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.139
Now take the two untied corners of the scarf,
and tie them together, and you're done!

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:07.130
If you want it to be a little more secure,
you can tie the two inner knots of the scarf

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.130
together.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.060
This bag is super easy and cute, and it's
an awesome way to keep your phone and everything

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.930
else safe from the sand!

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:21.770
Last, but definitely not least is this gorgeous
Hawaiian-inspired bracelet!

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.710
All you need to make it is embroidery thread
or twine, seashells, some beads or seaglass

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.580
if you want, and a pair of scissors.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.900
Start by cutting a length of twine long enough
to wrap around your wrist 4 times, then measure

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.210
and cut 2 more pieces of twine the same length.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.280
Now tie all the pieces together, and tape
the knot down to a secure surface to keep

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.280
it in place.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.810
Now hold two of the pieces of thread straight
and tight, and wrap the third piece of thread

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.120
in a single knot around the two other pieces
of thread.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.949
Make sure that you keep the two pieces of
thread REALLY tight and straight while you

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:51.470
tie the other piece of thread around them.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.630
Repeat this 7 times, and you should see a
spiraling pattern of knots start to appear!

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.979
Now thread a seashell or piece of glass onto
the working piece of thread, and secure it

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.070
by tying two single knots after it.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.800
Now transfer to another piece of thread, and
repeat the same pattern using the new piece

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.150
of thread to tie the knots.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.970
Keep tying 7 knots, adding a seashell, tying
2 knots, then repeating until your bracelet

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.470
is as long as you want!

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.700
Once you're done, tie all the pieces of twine
together in one big knot at the end, and tie

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.700
the bracelet on to your hand!

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.509
If you want to make the bracelet easier to
take on and off, you can add a clasp, but

00:06:21.509 --> 00:06:25.509
I prefer to secure it with a tight knot when
I'm going to the beach.

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:29.360
This bracelet is gorgeous, and super fast
and easy to make, and it's an awesome DIY

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.620
to try out with your friends!
