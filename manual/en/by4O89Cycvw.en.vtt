00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
My name is Sam Taunton, I'm 25. I currently live in Brunswick in Melbourne.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.680
I'm very nervous. I'm very worried.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.380
Normally I perform to like 8 or 9 people.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.720
So 1500 people, I'm like f*cking sh*tting myself.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.600
And I'm hoping I can make at least one of them laugh or

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.989
10 of them laugh maybe, and if ten laugh maybe that'll trickle on to 20 and 30 and then

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.690
maybe I can get at least like a 500 out of 1,500 seats that would be a pretty good laughter ratio, so that's what I'm aiming for.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:37.030
Adam Hills: He's a Christmas tree farmer turned digital video dude. From Victoria, it's Sam Taunton.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.550
*crowd cheers and applauds*

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.070
Melbourne, how we doing? We good? Yeah.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.820
Thanks for coming out on a Sunday. Who had a drink last night?

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.940
Yeah. Few loose units in, good to see, good to see.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.080
I grew up in a pretty heavy drinking culture right? My friends and family all drank a lot, so last month,

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.289
I actually made the pretty big life decision to quit drinking...

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:06.569
...at some stage in my life.

00:01:06.569 --> 00:01:09.659
Coz you know, I'm not going to quit now, like that's ridiculous, right?

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.859
Because I'm in my 20's, right? Like I'm at the top, I'm at the peak of my drinking game.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.509
Do you know what I mean? If I quite drinking now,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.009
it's like the musical equivalent of Wolfmother just releasing one platinum record then breaking up, right?

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.200
Like, I'm going out like John Farnham right?

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:31.760
I'll just have 25 cracks at quitting and then relapsing every few years to tour the local RSL circuit.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.299
Like that's how I'm going out, right, and because here's the thing. I don't think I have a drinking problem.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.059
Right? Like I don't think, I just think like I'm not good at drinking do you know what I mean?

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.240
It's like a skill I don't have. Like to me it's just like playing footy or getting those password verification codes right,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.040
when you get locked out of your internet account.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.680
Like I just, can't do it.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:56.099
Coz I can't go out and plan a night, like you know how people go out, and like set themselves up, like they have a big meal to line their stomach.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.180
They have strategic, you know water breaks. They can have their ex-girlfriends phone number on speed-dial.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.780
Like I can't do any of that, right? Like I have one drink and then cut to the next morning,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.320
where I have to have a conversation with someone about why we can't be friends anymore.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.140
And just have a 'nam style flashback trying to order a kebab.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.220
Like, that's my drinking history.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.580
And I was reading an article, I was reading an interview the other day with Tom Hafey, the late AFL player,

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.120
and he was a famous non-drinker.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.480
Right his big thing, was like why would I have a drink when I can just have a cup of tea?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.620
And surely a beer couldn't be better than a cup of tea,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.180
and you know I kind of agree with him, right,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.380
because I love tea, I'm a mad tea fan. I drop fat stacks at t2 all the time right?

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.960
I love tea but like, like I think he's a little bit misguided right, because sure like one cup of tea is definitely better than like one beer,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.950
but like 10 beers, right, like 10 beers are

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.210
so much better than 10 cups of tea.

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.290
It's very hard to have 10 cups of tea and then tell you boss to f*ck off at the work Christmas party.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.200
*crowd laughs*

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.420
Or like, no one's getting laid over a big pot of earl grey, like that's not going on.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.200
*crowd laughs*

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.440
I'm heaps poor right? I'm really poor and it's not good.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.800
I think it's because, like I did an arts degree at University.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.780
Did anyone do an arts degree? Alright, I thought most of you would be too embarrassed to say something but that's, that's pretty cool.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.320
I did an arts degree, and I always liken doing an arts degree to having a serious heroin addiction.

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:31.000
It's just like 4 years of constant bad decisions followed by like 30 grand worth of debt,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.280
and you just end up in the same place, right?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.000
And people don't even know what Arts degrees are.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.060
Like they're that bad. Like I was talking to a girl the other night at the pub I was trying to impress her.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.100
And she said, oh Sam what did you do at uni?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.760
And I went ohhh I did an arts degree, just expecting her to run to the door but instead she said

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.620
"oh my god? really? You're an artist, right?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.100
*crowd laughs*

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.740
"That is so... what do you do? Is it graphic or is it paint?"

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.950
and I had to stop and I said no, no, no, I'm an artist in the same way a subway sandwich artist is an artist.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.960
Like we have the same skill set.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.600
It's tough being poor right, it's not good, I have to steal stuff.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.900
It's not, no don't laugh at that, I'm a criminal right.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.880
I can't pay for public transport, I live in Melbourne which means I ride the tram for free a lot.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.400
And the other day I got a fine, and I was sitting there and the inspector came up to me and he said...

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.460
"Hey man, can I see your myki?" and I said no problem and I handed it to him.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:34.860
And he said "Okay. Here's what's going to happen. It's gonna be a 217 dollar fine but if you pay right now by a card it'll only cost you 75."

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.840
And I was like, yeah alright, 75 great deal, let's do that, right.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.000
So I handed him my card and he said "put a pin number in there"

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.960
I put a pin number in and he said "would you like a receipt?"

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.260
I said yeah that'd be great then as the receipt was printing he kind of paused and looked at me and he said...

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.520
"What are you up to on the weekend?"

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.020
I was like oh I'm just just hanging out with some friends, we're gonna have a few drinks.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.090
He said "oh, that sounds great."

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.060
Then the receipt printed and he handed it to me, he winked at me and said "that's all for today."

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.340
"Have a great time tonight and have a lovely time with your friends on the weekend."

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.520
*crowd laughs*

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.060
And then I got off that tram and I was like f*ck customer service isn't dead, is it?.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.460
*crowd laughs*

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.720
And then was in like a really good mood for the rest of the day.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:23.160
Like what kind of f*cked-up interactions are you having that getting a fine on public transport makes you feel good about yourself?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.440
I think it's just coz I hang out in bad places. Like the other day I was in this clothing store called General Pants.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.560
I don't know if you know the store but it's like that place where like everyone that works there is on MDMA,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.040
while you're trying to buy jeans right. I went up to this guy that I assumed worked there.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:42.360
He was wearing like half a ripped floral shirt and like a sailor's hat, and I was like, hey man are these the only plain tshirts you have?

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.580
And he kind of stopped and looked at me and he goes "f*cking ay"

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.140
What kind of an answer is f*cking ay?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.800
And I got really upset, right, I got really offended I was like an affluent grandma who writes letters of complaint to the SBS, right.

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.690
I said to him, I was like man you can't just talk to people like that.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.990
You can't treat people like that. Like how did you even get this job?

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.310
And he turned around and looked at me and said mate I did an arts degree.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.160
Thanks guys, you've been great.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.320
*crowd applauds*

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:21.080
Adam Hills: Let's hear it for Sam Taunton!
