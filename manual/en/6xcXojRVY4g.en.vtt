and healthy flight.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:18.429

Reading materials Snacks Good seat Early check-in

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.739
neck pillow (optional).

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.050
Step 1.

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.460
Pack essentials, such as medications and passports,
a few days before your flight, and completely

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.060
finish packing the night before.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.530
Youâ€™ll minimize stress because you won't
be rushing around the morning of the flight.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.560
Step 2.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.190
Make sure all essentials are in your carry-on
luggage.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.400
Fully charge your music player, game player,
or laptop and pack books and magazines.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.150
Bring your favorite snacks and finger food.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.730
Check out the entertainment and food options
offered by the airline before you fly.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:03.730
Step 3.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.369
Consider upgrading to a better seating class
for a particularly long flight.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.400
If you check in online up to 24 hours in advance,
you often get to choose your seat or change

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.820
to a better one.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.690
Or get to the airport extra early and check
for a better seat at the counter and again

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.690
at the gate.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.930
Seats in exits rows and the bulkhead provide
the most legroom.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.110
Step 4.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.140
Bring along earplugs or noise-reduction headphones
to block unwanted noise.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.350
An eye mask will shield your eyes from sunlight
if you want to sleep during the day.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.549
Step 5.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.780
Bring a soft travel blanket and neck pillow.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.350
Besides being warm and cozy, you won't have
to worry about the airline's blanket-cleaning

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.400
policy.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.850
Dress comfortably and bring thick socks to
swap for your shoes after take-off.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.290
Neck pillows with lavender are said to be
calming and reduce headaches.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.870
Step 6.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.810
Take motion sickness pills or ginger capsules
2 hours before your flight if you're prone

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.270
to air sickness.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.440
Wash your hands, especially before and after
eating, and bring hand sanitizer wipes.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.659
Wipe down airflow vent and tray tables with
sanitized wipes and use a tissue when touching

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:06.630
the bathroom door handle.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.670
Step 7.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.300
Drink plenty of water before and during your
flight to avoid muscle aches and fatigue.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.950
Get up, stretch, and move around often to
prevent stiffness and deep vein thrombosis.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.230
Did you know A survey by 3M and the Global
Strategy Group found that most Americans would

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.340
rather get stuck in traffic, go on a blind
date, or go to the dentist than sit in the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.510
middle seat on a flight.
