00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
cars.com auto review

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.180
i'm kelsey mays for cars.com here with
the 2012 chevrolet suburban an SUV that

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.469
still gives you the capability to haul
close to 10,000 pounds and up to nine

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.500
people all the way to Grandma's house as
long as you have to bring a few hundred

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.870
bucks for gas 2012 marks your number six
for the current generation suburban and

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.430
it still packs a pretty refined ride and
plenty of room but some drivability

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.079
issues are starting to show its age and
if you don't need all that capability

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.420
better options exist

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.620
the Suburbans 5.3 liter v8 gets the job
done even when you're loaded up with

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.089
passengers but it takes its time a
lumbering up to highway speeds the ford

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.559
expedition feels similarly modest but
Leadfoot will really like cars like the

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.050
toyota sequoia whose 5.7 liter v8 feels
much more potent none of them have the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.920
accelerator lag that plagues the
suburban our test car took a half second

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.639
or more sometimes to respond to the
accelerator it's really annoying

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:05.030
make sure you pay attention to it around
town on your test drive

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.500
like you'd expect in a big SUV ride
quality is very good but the steering

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.240
has some gremlins to iron out

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.120
there's a lot of play in the wheel
especially pointed at twelve o'clock on

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.300
the highway and you end up having to
make a lot of Corrections not really a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.240
good thing for an SUV that's going to be
on a lot of road trips

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.070
at least you'll have plenty of room on
to those trips to throw all your stuff

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.610
behind the third row in the suburban is
about 45 cubic feet of cargo room that's

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.720
a lot of room

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.990
the related chevy tahoe has less than 20
cubic feet

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.680
if you fold all the seats down you're
looking at about a hundred and forty

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.810
cubic feet of maximum cargo volume a ton
of space there to the vast majority of

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.330
suburban shoppers will get the 1500
version which has the 5.3 liter v8 for

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.950
maximum towing capacity and payload
there's a suburban 2500 with a 6-litre

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.280
v8 it gets 12 miles per gallon and
combined EPA city/highway ratings which

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.240
means that you really need its
capability or you just really love the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.960
coffee at your

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.910
local gas station the 1500 get some more
sensible 17 miles per gallon which beats

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.470
the sequoia as well as the nissan armada
and the ford expedition but if you don't

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.480
need this sort of towing capacity
car-based crossover SUVs cost less can

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.340
hold nearly as many people and get
better gas mileage most car-based

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.260
crossover SUVs get combined epa mileage
in the twenties so the most minivans

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.319
which have even more maximum cargo
capacity

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.610
you get the idea and if you need maximum
towing capacity like this then the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.690
suburban is a viable choice but if you
don't get something that isn't quite so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.690
overkill

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.110
