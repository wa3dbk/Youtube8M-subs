00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.639
We're here on a sailing ship going through the Galapagos Islands

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.779
it's a wonderful trip and worked tracing
Darwin steps going

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.120
from island to island looking at all the
animals both on and off land.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.610
But you know when you're on a trip like
this where you're on the water you want

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.910
to make sure that you protect your
equipment.  It would be heartbreaking to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.500
have your

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.340
mobile device or your camera get ruined
because it dropped in the water or got

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.340
splashed upon

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.930
One of the things that we brought with us
is a special little dry bag.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.680
This dry bag which is made by Sea to
Summit

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.590
is there thirteen liter lightweight
version and one other things we really

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.590
like about it is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.670
truly lightweight.  It's very small, it
takes up very little room

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.280
it's very lightweight - it's almost like a
skin for your equipment

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.180
but it will keep it protected.  Sea to Summit does make different sizes of bags

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.720
and different weights of bags, but we particularly
like this lightweight one, especially for

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.290
the kinds of trips that we do

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.180
for sailing, kayaking, or just a day on
the beach.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.070
The way a dry bag works is it has the
opening just like a regular bag

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.420
but it also has this special rubber lip

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.600
on it around one side. You put your
equipment in, in this case I'm going to put

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.660
in a full size

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.539
DSLR camera with a regular
lens on it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:39.539
you squeeze out a little bit of the air

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.150
and then where this rubber lip is you
start turning it over

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.250
keeping it nice and smooth. So I put a
camera in here but you could also put in

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.369
other things like

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.420
a hat or sunglasses are your shirt

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.829
or anything that you want to keep dry.
And just roll it until it's nice and snug

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:07.060
and then clip across. So a dry bag is a
great tool to use when you're in any

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.869
kind of watery environment.  But there are a couple of things to remember

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.459
with your dry bag.  You always want to make
sure that you clip it to something

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.450
because it's easy for this weight to get
thrown overboard or something like that.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.900
So always use the D-ring or always
use

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.920
the clip to clip it around something to
keep it secure. Also you want to make

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.459
sure that whatever you put inside is not
sharp

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.910
because this skin is so thin it can get
punctured if you

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.250
include something that might poke
through the material

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.769
and allow water to get in.  It's also
recommended that you keep it away from

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.019
abrasive things.  You don't want it rubbing

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.090
against something that's going to wear way
the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.239
waterproof power of the fabric

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.349
But other than that, it's pretty rugged
pretty secure

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.480
and your equipment is protected.
