00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.590
Welcome to barackobama.com.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.259
My name is Betsy Hoover, and I'm the director
of online organizing for Obama for America.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.760
Today we're going to talk about how to use
our online call tool.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.080
So, let's get started.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.540
Head on over to our homepage, at www.barackobama.com
or, if you received a link in an email or

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.890
from a social network, click that.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.490
You can also go directly to the call tool
at call.barackobama.com.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.280
Under the Get Involved tab, select Make Calls.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.560
You'll be taken to a log in page, giving you
the option to log in with your barackobama.com,

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.630
dashboard or Facebook username and password.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.131
If you want to log in using a barackobama.com
ID, but you don't have an account yet, click

00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:43.760
on the create an account link.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.820
From there, just fill out some basic information
to create your very own account.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.950
Now you're ready to start making some calls.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.649
Once logged in, you will see a pop-up box,
with information on and directions for this

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.399
particular call campaign.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.630
Once you've read this note, click Start Calling
to get going.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.780
On the left, you'll see the contact information
for the supporter you'll be calling.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.720
On the right, you'll see a script.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.560
Practice pronouncing the supporter's name,
and read through the script so you familiarize

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.679
yourself with the questions you'll be asking.

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.590
Then when you're ready, grab your phone, dial
the person's number on the left and start

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.700
making some calls.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.270
If no one answers, or you're unable to speak
to a voter for some other reason, click the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.119
didn't connect button under the person's phone
number.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.850
A box will appear.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.140
Select the reason you weren't able to talk
to the voter from the drop down menu.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.719
If you do reach a voter, follow along with
the script, and answer the questions asked.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.859
Simply click on the circle next to the appropriate
answer and move on with the script.

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.789
If the call you're making is recruiting for
an event, make sure to mark whether or not

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.039
the person you're talking to can attend.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.069
If they are able to attend, mark down their
email so you can send them a confirmation.

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.709
Please only input the email address of the
person listed.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.819
If the user would like to know about more
events in their area, you can click on Search

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:56.950
for Other Events.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.270
Put in the information for the event you'd
like to look for, the zip code for example,

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.350
and click Search.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.899
If you find an event that the supporter would
like to attend, click the circle next to it.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.770
Then click Choose Event.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.560
This will now be the event you can RSVP the
voter.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.720
When you are done speaking with the voter
and have recorded all the information you

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720
were given, click Save and Continue.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.140
A new person's information will appear on
the left-hand side, so at this point you just

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.390
repeat the process.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.400
Another exciting feature of the call tool
is calling rooms.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.310
By joining a room, you can work with a group
of callers from your neighborhood team, or

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.150
from a specific group you are part of.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.990
Each room has its own leader board.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.460
You can see how your call totals compare to
other callers in the room by clicking Today's

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.000
Activity tab.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.700
There you can also view the total number of
calls made in that room today.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.820
If you'd like to make calls with a specific
group of people, click See More Rooms.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.890
A box will pop up with a list of available
rooms.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.830
To enter a room, simply click start calling.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.930
Congratulations, now you're ready to start
connecting with other people in your community.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.640
Remember when you're making these calls that
you're representing Obama for America.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.100
So take pride in that.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.100
And have fun.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.090
You just may find someone who shares your
enthusiasm.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.670
Good luck.
