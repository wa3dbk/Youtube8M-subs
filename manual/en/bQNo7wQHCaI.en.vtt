00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:07.973
Sorry Amber, 
but you’re not allowed to come in.

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.409
It’s my house.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.512
Strictly speaking, your father’s house.

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:16.448
He told me not to have a boy inside.

00:00:16.448 --> 00:00:17.783
He’s my classmate.

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.217
Still.

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:24.657
You can ask your father.

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:35.500
He doesn’t answer.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.335
I’m leaving.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:41.039
You leave. They say “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.”

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.141
Who said I couldn’t stand the heat?

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.344
I’m ok.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:47.045
I’ll take care of it.

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:48.709
Let’s go.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.453
Will you get your hand off him? 
He’s my friend.

00:00:54.453 --> 00:00:56.221
Just leave while I’m still nice.

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:01.894
Hey, please take care of her.

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.919
What are you doing? Let go!

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:11.803
Who on earth are you? Hey! Let go of me!

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:14.849
Far, far away.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:17.009
Let go of me!

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.511
You wanna die? Let of me! Hey!

00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:21.913
Miss, don’t try to fight against us.

00:01:21.913 --> 00:01:27.285
How heavy are you? 
You can’t match with four of us.

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:28.505
Hey, let go.

00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:31.267
Where are we going? Let go!

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:38.230
Eggplant! Your daddy is here.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.859
Hey…

00:01:42.067 --> 00:01:44.027
You got prettier!

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:47.272
Hungry, huh?

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:49.141
I am.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.109
It’s nice!

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:53.478
Can I see your room?

00:01:53.478 --> 00:01:55.468
Sure. That’s the room.

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:57.482
You are ready to go.

00:01:57.482 --> 00:01:58.492
Thanks.

00:01:59.518 --> 00:02:01.820
Will you go in that look?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.121
Of course.

00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:04.856
Get a blow dry.

00:02:04.856 --> 00:02:08.293
It’ll loosen the perm. Give me my jacket.

00:02:08.293 --> 00:02:09.027
Yes.

00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:11.630
Wait. He told us to call him.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.769
How far are we going?

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:25.477
Around 30 minutes.

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.781
I’ll sit next to you out of courtesy.

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:30.749
Will you?

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:31.829
Yes.

00:02:41.993 --> 00:02:44.033
Have you driven long?

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:45.330
Yes.

00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:51.169
You look neat with the perm.

00:02:51.169 --> 00:02:54.139
As I get older, easy and neat hair works.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.329
You look good.

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.789
&lt;How about me?&gt;

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.832
I have corvina 
but I didn’t broil it since it’s troublesome.

00:03:20.832 --> 00:03:23.696
We don’t need it 
since the table is already full of dishes.

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.004
Do you always eat like this?

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:27.839
No. Menu changes daily.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.209
I mean, 
do you put plenty of food like this?

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:32.277
Yes.

00:03:32.277 --> 00:03:37.315
I rarely have a feast like this 
unless it’s someone’s birthday.

00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:38.216
I have plenty of rice.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:39.618
Ok.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:46.892
I don’t know what to eat first.

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:50.706
Start with this. That’s my favorite.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:56.535
Umm…

00:03:57.302 --> 00:03:59.271
Delicious!

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:01.406
More delicious 
because you put it on my spoon.

00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:06.588
&lt;She is lovely!&gt;

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:11.083
You know what? 
You have infinite charms.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.452
I know.

00:04:13.452 --> 00:04:15.554
That’s not the proper answer.

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:20.524
You should say like “The same goes for you” or “You are awesome, too.”

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.029
Are you smiling 
because you agree with me?

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.197
Yes.

00:04:27.065 --> 00:04:30.569
I think we have chemistry.

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:31.689
So?

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.006
Just saying so.

00:04:42.014 --> 00:04:44.049
Three vege wrap combos, please.

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:45.851
Yes, sir.

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:48.749
How did you know I like veges?

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:51.790
I’m glad you like veges.

00:04:52.457 --> 00:04:54.507
How about you?

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.496
I like it too.

00:04:57.496 --> 00:05:00.232
Didn’t you get a perm, madam?

00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:05.370
My hair dresser told me to do it later. 
She did my hair though.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.972
Oh, I see.

00:05:08.974 --> 00:05:12.244
&lt;I’m afraid I might look ugly 
with the mouth open wide.&gt;

00:05:12.244 --> 00:05:15.280
Look, we’re all of the same age, right?

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.415
Yes.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:19.184
How about talking in a casual way?

00:05:19.184 --> 00:05:20.152
Fine with me.

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:25.991
Actually I feel uncomfortable 
to be called “madam.”

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:27.592
Don’t you think so?

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:28.794
I do.

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:34.466
Let’s introduce in turns. I am April Park.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:38.070
Not Apron? People must have made fun with your name, huh?

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.738
Yes.

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:41.573
I am Myongja.

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:45.444
It’s Akiko in Japanese.

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:46.845
Do you speak Japanese?

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:50.082
Not very well, but I do.

00:05:50.082 --> 00:05:55.153
I ran a business in Japan 
when I was young.

00:05:55.153 --> 00:05:57.255
Oh.

00:05:57.255 --> 00:06:01.860
I think Japanese is a bit difficult to learn.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:09.701
For example, the name Myongja can be translated like Akiko, Joko, Akuru, etc.

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.919
Why is that?

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:14.840
I think Korean Hangul 
is the best language in every way.

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.476
Exactly.

00:06:17.476 --> 00:06:19.478
Ask her family name.

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:20.812
What is your family name?

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.348
Do you like cassis (Gyol Myongja) tea?

00:06:23.348 --> 00:06:24.816
I do.

00:06:24.816 --> 00:06:26.885
That’s my name.

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.820
So your last name is Gyol, right?

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.122
Yes.

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:33.058
I think people will never forget 
your name.

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:35.160
I think so.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.030
Her name is very unique too.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.498
What is hers?

00:06:39.498 --> 00:06:43.502
What do you think is 
the most graceful bird?

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:46.729
Swan (Baek Joe)?

00:06:46.738 --> 00:06:47.806
Yes.

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.409
Is that your real name?

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:51.743
Yes.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.422
Hello?

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:05.357
&lt;This is Byonghoon Yoo.&gt;

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:08.093
Hi.

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.162
&lt;You are Ruby’s sister, right?&gt;

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:11.229
Yes.

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:14.466
&lt;Can I see you now? 
I’m around your house.&gt;

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:16.034
What for?

00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:20.605
&lt;If it’s hard for you to come out, 
I can come to you.&gt;

00:07:20.605 --> 00:07:24.109
I can’t come out at this moment. 
Can you wait for a while?

00:07:24.109 --> 00:07:27.289
&lt;Sure. I can wait as long as it takes.&gt;

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:46.465
You look you really enjoy the food.

00:07:46.465 --> 00:07:48.445
Huh?

00:07:49.668 --> 00:07:50.586
Yes…
