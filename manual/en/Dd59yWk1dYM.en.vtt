00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:28.799
The venue has three types of seats: the common seats, which are retractable; 

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:35.482
cushioned seats with backrest with good back support;

00:00:35.482 --> 00:00:40.807
and the boxes, cushioned seats with the backrest 
 going up as far as the head.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:45.154
José Luiz Góes – Operations and engineering director 

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:51.081
There are 2000 Premium seats in the boxes.

00:00:51.081 --> 00:01:07.364
We have 70 boxes with air conditioning and their own toilet. 
 We also have kitchen areas to support these boxes.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:19.275
The roof is different from a technical and sustainable point of view. 

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:25.161
As the structure is a mixture of cables and metals,

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:34.396
this translates into 25% savings in the consumption of 
 steel in the relation to conventional roofs. 

00:01:34.396 --> 00:01:41.920
The canvas used on the roof is self-cleaning 
 and allows for sunlight to get through.

00:01:49.512 --> 00:01:52.740
The venue is completely different, with several areas.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:02:00.960
The South Square is able to fit 6 to 8 thousand 
 people and indoor events may be held there. 

00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:06.260
On days when there is no football, we can put up 
 a roof module on the pitch and thus, 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.060
be able to cater for up to 15 thousand people on the pitch. 

00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:17.540
The VIP lounge fits 2 thousand people. We have a multi-purpose arena.

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:38.530
The press booths are similar to the ones operated 
 in the world's most modern arenas. 

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:43.200
There are a lot of security cameras. 

00:02:43.196 --> 00:02:49.500
It is a modern venue, totally interconnected with advanced internal television circuit.  

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:55.010
There is a control room, not just for security, but for the 
 whole of the arena’s command and control operation.  

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.980
There are people doing security, lots of stewards will help with information and

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:03.990
ensuring that the public behaves adequately in a venue like this.

00:03:05.121 --> 00:03:13.560
Sprinklers are used to irrigate the pitch, set to a 
 schedule based on a study of how many times

00:03:13.561 --> 00:03:21.880
and how long they should turn on every 
 day.  This is all done. 

00:03:23.747 --> 00:03:30.450
There are seats for obese people, places for physically 
 disabled people and people with reduced mobility.

00:03:30.452 --> 00:03:34.680
There is also a directional tactile floor in areas 
 where there is a great flow of people.

00:03:34.683 --> 00:03:38.430
The venue has been prepared to cater for different types of people, 

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:45.330
who want to enjoy themselves, be it at the 
 football or any other type of event.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:18.760
The stadium’s lighting stands out as it allows for the colours of 
 the home team to be displayed on match days. 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:27.470
The lights may also be used to make the venue 
 stand out even more for concerts and shows. 

00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:39.080
The arena has taken care to be sustainable 
 since the beginning of the process. 

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:44.550
It is one of the Brazilian venues where 
 the original building was demolished and rebuilt.

00:04:44.548 --> 00:04:47.720
All care was taken in the reconstruction phase. 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:55.000
100 % of the concrete from the demolition as recycled 
 in the paving of the access ways. 

00:04:55.702 --> 00:05:01.000
The building was awarded the LEED certificate, which means 
 that it meets the highest sustainability standards.

00:05:00.997 --> 00:05:07.010
Social responsibility, programmes for street dwellers, programmes for inmates. 

00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:15.030
Since the beginning, the venue has taken sustainability related 
 measures aimed at the labour and processes.

00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:24.470
Operating a venue such as this, new and different 
 in relation to what Bahia has seen,

00:05:24.467 --> 00:05:32.530
is something that has to be done with great care, ensuring comfort and serenity.

00:05:32.533 --> 00:05:35.900
We are worried with the flow of our users, coming in and going out.

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.910
We want them to be well cared for, to be fed adequately,

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:45.740
 have access to the toilets, so that families 
 are able to use the venue comfortably.

00:05:46.414 --> 00:05:48.980
We do not want people coming just for the match; 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.610
we want them to arrive early, enjoy the place 
 and be able to watch good concerts.
