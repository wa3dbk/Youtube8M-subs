Alright folks. In this clip I'm going to teach
you how to draw a nurse. So we'll start with

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.289
her upper body, just kind of work our way
down to the neck and up to the shoulders.

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.590
And what we're going to do is we're going
to give our nurse a nice little collar. So

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:27.099
like that and it kind of comes down like that.
And we'll draw her upper body and down to

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:49.710
her waist.
Now we'll draw her arm coming out. So there

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.210
we've got that going and we'll go for sleeves
that kind of come up to there. Obviously you

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.710
can custom design your nurse outfit. It's
pretty easy to do I would say. We'll give

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.370
her her little medical red cross badge right
there. Just to make sure everyone knows she's

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.060
a nurse. Maybe give her a pocket with some
pens for taking notes. You know, make sure

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:39.850
she's equipped. And then we'll move right
on down the leg. And we're going to give her

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:52.570
a nice skirt right here like that, buttons
come down all the way. I'm going to give it

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.881
a little slit so there's some breathing room
in there. And comfy shoes. Nurses have to

00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:04.450
have comfy shoes. They're on their feet quite
a bit. I might as well throw a little heel

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:15.680
in there. Why not. But yes, there we go. So
there'll be one solid dress outfit with a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.650
hat. That's what really ties the look together.
So there you have it. The nurse outfit.
