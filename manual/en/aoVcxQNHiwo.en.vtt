Okay now I know you remember I said mango
chicken salad. Here is our mango and this

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.111
is what we are going to do with it. First
of all we are going to give it a peel and

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:22.260
this is a really nice like mango. Just peeling
off the skin.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.160
Now you probably notice none of this is taking
a lot of time I mean this thirty minute meal,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:39.760
eat your heart out cause we are doing a thirty
minute gourmet meal probably this. Oh we use

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:47.010
about half of this and I'm just going to cut
it just slightly, trim the bottom off so I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.749
got a good base for this to stand on. You
can cut right down the pit, there we are and

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:09.320
we got some beautiful mango and again my claw
is here and I'm going to slice this very thinly

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:19.641
all the way through. How about this neat thing
just a biscuit cutter, your mom might have

00:01:19.641 --> 00:01:25.610
used them to make great biscuits. We are going
to use it to make art so I'm going to take

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:35.180
a little piece of this mango that is thinly
cut and I'm going to set it along the inside

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:44.549
and I'm going to overlap a second piece. I'm
going to overlap a third piece and we are

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:54.899
going to overlap a forth piece tightly into
the corner and let's overlap another corner

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:09.100
here. Let's overlap another piece here and
lets come all the way around. Let me put a

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:18.230
pretty piece right in there. Actually I'm
going to do a little more of a thinner piece

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:29.120
here cause this is so delicate there we go
okay I'm going to kind of let that hang out

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.650
for a while and I'm going to eat this. Mmmm.
Okay we are going on to our next part this

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.040
is going to be the dressing that we make for
our micro greens.
