I'm Nancy Frensley. I'm the training manager
at Berkeley East Bay Humane Society, in Berkeley,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:12.390
California. A lot of people who live in cities,
and in apartments, and in high rises have

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.870
small dogs, and because there's such a distance
between where they live and the outdoors the

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.850
dogs actually need to learn to use a doggy
litter pan. Today, there are a number of commercial

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:36.070
litter pans and litters on the market, but
in general you'll want to have a plastic tub

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.260
that is big enough for your dog to stand in
and turn around in, and instead of a cat litter

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.269
you might want to use turf. The reason for
using turf, or the grass that you buy at the

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.929
garden stores, the reason that you might want
to use that is that dogs develop a substrate

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:05.180
preference, or a surface preference for eliminating,
and that's how how house training works. Dogs

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.890
that have a preference for outdoor surfaces
tend to want to go to out outdoor surfaces,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:19.560
and not to soil on surfaces that are not outdoors.
So, when you set up your litter pan if your

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:27.119
dog has a preference for grassy surfaces you
can line your litter pan with a little bit

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.250
of plastic sheeting, and then put in a couple
of squares of turf, and your dog will probably

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:42.740
gravitate or orient toward that surface. And
you just have to show them where it is and

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.939
take them to it each and every time you take
them to potty. So, you'll want to experiment

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.229
a little bit I think with your size of your
litter pan, and with the different surfaces

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.549
that you can put in. But small dogs can be
successfully taught to use a litter pan instead

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.649
of going outdoors, and that may be helpful
if you live in a high-rise.
