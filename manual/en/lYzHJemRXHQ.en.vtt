00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.410
Today on our 2003 Dodge Ram 2500 we'll be
installing Timbren Suspension Enhancement

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.170
System, part number TDR2500CA.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.849
Now this will be for the rear.

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.050
Now before installing the Timbrens you may
need to raise the vehicle to allow the axle

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.050
to hang freely.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.340
We'll need to remove the existing bump stops.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.060
We'll take out the two bolts holding it in
place.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.550
Now we'll need to keep the bolts as we will
reuse them when installing our Timbren Suspension.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.590
The bump stops however, you can set off to
the side as they will not be reinstalled.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.769
With our bump stops removed we can now move
to the table to assemble our AN rubber spring

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.010
and bracket as shown in the diagram supplied
with the Timbren Kit.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.909
Now you'll notice that one of the brackets
will indicate which side it is for.

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.730
In this case it's the left side.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:01:00.059
We'll place the rubber washer on top of the
bracket 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:11.060
and 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:02:22.140
line up 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.030
the hole.
