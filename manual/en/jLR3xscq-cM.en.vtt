00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Hi everyone! Welcome to PIS' first-person perspective video.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:47.001
Today, I'm going to show 2 rounds of POTM-play.

00:00:47.002 --> 00:00:51.002
Umm... But firstly, I would like to apologise to everyone.

00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:57.003
This is because I haven't updated in a long time. This is because I've been experimenting with the sound-recording software recently.

00:00:57.004 --> 00:00:59.004
Finally, I've found out how to use it.

00:01:02.005 --> 00:01:04.005
Err... A little introduction.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:08.006
Here at Sentinel, I'm with two of my friends, forming a three-man pubstomp team.

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:15.007
One of them is "Cai Bi". [He is a well-known video-maker in China who makes Top 10 DotA video, similar to WoDotA Top 10.]

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:22.008
The other is a pub player in tier-one room. He is called "Jing Ling Dan Dan". [A well-known pub player amongst the Chinese, with almost the fame of competitive players.]

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.009
I believe a lot of other players know him.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:38.010
Because he is such a good player, he know how to and he has excellent micro

00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.011
Frequently, his replays get posted online.

00:01:51.012 --> 00:01:58.012
He has picked Lycanthrope. It is a hero he's quite fluent with.

00:02:04.013 --> 00:02:09.013
There are 4 heroes that he is quite familiar with.

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:16.014
One is Lycanthrope, one is Storm Spirit, one is Shadow Fiend and one is Templar Assassin.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:19.015
These 4 heroes are ones that... he plays quite well.

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:26.016
Recently, he has also picked up on another hero. Which hero is it?

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:27.017
Axe.

00:02:28.018 --> 00:02:31.018
His playstyle is non-mainstream type,

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.019
Soloing the hard lane.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.020
He also plays roaming-style, pumping Battle Hunger.

00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:46.021
He seems to like playing non-mainstream style.

00:02:46.022 --> 00:02:54.022
Personally, I like playing in such manner [non-mainstream] as well. When I play pub games, I'm slack. As long as I'm happy and feel good, I will play it as such.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:56.023
I won't get too serious.

00:03:02.024 --> 00:03:09.024
These few rounds were played at a cyber-cafe, and I forgot to bring my own mouse there.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:19.025
I brought my mousepad, but not my mouse. Now I'm using the mouse belonging to the cybercafe together with my mousepad.

00:03:19.026 --> 00:03:20.026
Someone has pinged.

00:03:21.027 --> 00:03:23.027
Double-damage Lion.

00:03:24.028 --> 00:03:26.028
Hexed [It was a stun though], arrow.

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:30.029
I got the last-hit, and thus the first blood.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.030
As I was saying, I'm using my own mousepad together with the mouse from this cybercafe. So I'm a little not used to it.

00:03:56.031 --> 00:03:58.031
I'm soloing against a Storm Spirit.

00:03:59.932 --> 00:04:02.032
His attack damage is higher than mine and his attack animation is better than mine.

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:07.033
He is advantageous over me in terms of last-hitting. However, my attack range is further than his.

00:04:08.034 --> 00:04:11.034
Hence, I can take advantage of my range and sneak a few attacks while he's last-hitting.

00:04:13.035 --> 00:04:15.035
This arrow...

00:04:17.036 --> 00:04:19.036
Was a little off...

00:04:23.037 --> 00:04:26.037
I got attacked thrice by the Storm while I was trying to last-hit that creep...

00:04:30.038 --> 00:04:34.038
The Storm seems a little angry.

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.039
Storm has no more regen items.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.040
Hardship for him.

00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:00.041
Let's see the rune for the 2nd minute.

00:05:02.042 --> 00:05:03.042
Regen!

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:16.043
Since I have regen rune, I dare to go 1-on-1 with the Storm. This is to keep his HP down. Afterall, he has no regen items and I have the regen rune.

00:05:30.044 --> 00:05:33.044
Let's find a chance to take some of his HP away.

00:05:59.045 --> 00:06:00.045
He pulled me.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:03.046
His Remnant did not hit me.

00:06:04.047 --> 00:06:06.047
Okay, I'm going to use my regen rune now.

00:06:18.049 --> 00:06:19.049
I leaped here.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:29.050
He has no mana, and has used up all his spells. He knew he was going to die, hence he stayed there to attack me.

00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:36.051
What happened just now was...

00:06:39.052 --> 00:06:46.052
I killed a creep and hit Level 5. Pumped Level 2 Starfall, Leaped over and killed the Storm.

00:06:53.053 --> 00:06:55.053
The 4th minute rune is at bottom.
