Today on Drinks With Diablo, 

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.800
we're doing one of our favorite drinks:

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.000
the Pumpkin Pie Martini.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.600
TheFNDC.com presents Drinks With Diablo:

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.800
The Pumpkin Pie Martini.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.600
Welcome back to Drinks With Diablo.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.900
This is your host, Jöhnny Dîablø.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.900
And today we're making the Pumpkin PIe Martini.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.800
What you're going to need for this one is vanilla vodka, 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.000
Kahlúa, half and half, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.700
creme de cacao, pumpkin pie spice, 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.850
and just some plain pumpkin filling.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.650
I've already rimmed my martini glass with cinnamon sugar.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.500
You just dip it in some water,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.100
like on a plate, 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
dip it in your cinnamon sugar, and you're good to go.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
So let's begin.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.400
You're going to need 1 ounce of vanilla vodka.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.400
Add to that a half ounce of Kahlúa.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.400
We're getting busy with one ounce of creme de cacao.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.400
Follow that up with 3 teaspoons of your pumpkin pie filling, 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.400
just your plain canned pumpkin, there you go.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.600
You're also going to need one teaspoon 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.000
of your pumpkin pie spice.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.000
And lastly, two ounces of half and half.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.125
You'll want to give this a nice vigorous shake

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:43.500
so that you combine all the ingredients, all nice.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
So let's do that, and see what we've got.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.500
Ooh.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.350
That is already looking pumpkin-licious.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.300
Oh my goodness.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.500
That looks so good.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.500
Let's try it and find out:

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
the Pumpkin PIe Martini, does it live up to it's name?

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Mmm.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.350
My God.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.300
It's heaven in a glass.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.750
It tastes exactly like pumpkin pie.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.750
This is one of our favorite drinks during the holidays.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.350
If you  drink about three of them, 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.000
it's going to get really filling. You're going to feel really full,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.550
like you ate three pieces of pumpkin pie.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.000
It's going to give a nice, happy type of drunkeness.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.760
It's not going to make you a belligerent drunk.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.900
It's going to give you a nice, happy, warm vibe: just like the holidays.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.125
The Pumpkin PIe Martini:

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:45.525
I give this my highest recommendation.

00:02:45.525 --> 00:02:49.500
