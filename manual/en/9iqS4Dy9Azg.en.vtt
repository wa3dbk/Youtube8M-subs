00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.080
I have a very, very active lifestyle.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.470
I'm a retired fire fighter, I'm on call 24
hours a day, 7 days a week.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.560
I always have to be armed and ready to go
at all times, as well as my training.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.640
And I can honestly say that I never feel inadequately
catered for on a vegan diet.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.240
I started running predominantly to raise funds
for animal charities and I started to win

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:42.660
races and I decided that the ultimate goal
would be to run a marathon.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.079
I entered my first marathon in 2000 and I
won it, and from there I just decided that

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:56.260
this was the way forward to help more animals
and to promote a vegan diet.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.629
Training for a marathon is not just about
going out and running endless miles.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
It's about doing speed work, it's about doing
a lot of endurance work and coupling the two

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.489
together.

00:01:06.489 --> 00:01:09.670
So you've got to be fast but you've got to
be fast over a long distance.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.200
So I personally, and everybody's different,
train between about 80 and 100 miles a week.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.330
I have complete, 100 percent faith that my
diet will give me everything that my body

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.800
needs to perform well.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.710
I certainly don't look at meat-eaters and
think I could perform any better if I ate meat.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.570
I've run 22 marathons and I always produce
a good run, no matter what.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.399
When I at a race people are quite surprised
that I can do what I do on a vegan diet and

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.390
they say "why are you vegan?" and I would say
to them "well, why aren't you?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.310
Because after all I've just beaten you, so
perhaps if you try my diet, you might be up

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.550
there winning races too".

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.509
On one particular occasion, the person who
presented me the award was the lady mayoress,

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.210
and she actually said that her daughter had
been wanting to go vegetarian for quite a

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.210
few months.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.539
When my mom was able to tell her that I had
been vegetarian since tiny and vegan since

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.900
a teenager, she was really overjoyed there was
a role-model that she could use.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.250
That's a bigger achievement for me, because
that's somebody growing up and she's the future.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:38.400
And veganism is the future.
