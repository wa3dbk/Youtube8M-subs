00:00:20.892 --> 00:00:23.577
What's going on, YouTube,
this is El Tiro and today

00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:26.780
is tutorial Thursday where
we give you a new concept

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.090
to add to your freestyle
or choreography,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.710
mainly in the style of popping.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.550
Today, we're going to be working
on some advanced robotics.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.110
We are going to be
breaking down how

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.670
to do the robot in
three different kind

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.580
of content for you guys.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.820
So we'll break it down into
three different videos.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.480
All of them will help
add a different element

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.140
to your robot.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.140
Thanks for wanting to
learn how to do the robot.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.520
This is section two.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.130
This section's going to be
breaking down the chair,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.820
or bending at the medium
level when you do the robot.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.520
A lot of times,
we find ourselves

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.680
being very stationary and tall.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.570
And we are going to add
the element of adding

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.820
the chair, which is
bending the legs.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.875
I'm not really in a chair.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.782
This would be like a chair
sitting, but almost there.

00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:14.490
Basically, I have a
whole different level

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.060
to do my robotics at.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.760
So here are a couple different
ways you can get down there.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.840
Let's say I'm stationary.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.390
I'm going to take
my left arm and I'm

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.720
going to pretend like I'm
pushing a stick or pole that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.825
goes in my knee to push down.

00:01:30.825 --> 00:01:33.731
Like our first tutorial,
we can add the wobble

00:01:33.731 --> 00:01:34.480
to get down there.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:42.574
So I go here, [? put, ?]
robot in, lean, and I'm

00:01:42.574 --> 00:01:46.282
going to do the pull, stick.

00:01:46.282 --> 00:01:48.240
Now, if you want to take
this up another notch,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.720
you can try
balancing on one leg.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.684
I'm going puppet this knee,
and I'm going to pop that up.

00:01:54.684 --> 00:01:56.350
So it's important
when you do the robot,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.800
you got to stay super still.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.340
Balance is the key
element to this.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.300
Now I'm on one leg
doing my robotics.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.479
Really slow, isolated
movements-- puppet my foot.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.140
Lots of different things you can
do here get on this bent level.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.770
You are well on your way to
becoming an awesome robot

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.565
dancer.

00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:22.560
Make sure you click right here
for the last or third part

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.158
into this series of learning
how to do the robot.

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:32.600
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.160
You are almost done
with this series

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.820
of learning how to do the robot.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.930
This is the third
part, and we're

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.529
going to be working on ticking.
