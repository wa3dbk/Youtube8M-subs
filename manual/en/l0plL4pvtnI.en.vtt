How Do I Get Rid of Dark Under Eye Circles?

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.470
I am 35 year old white male with dark under
eye circles.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.930
I tried 2 treatments unsuccessfully: 1) laser
by dermatologist, 2) 8 weeks of teamine.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.283
The laser treatment left me with white dots
in tear trough area.

00:00:45.283 --> 00:00:46.283
I saw a small improvement with Teamine but
not much.

00:00:46.283 --> 00:00:48.840
The doctor also recommended arnica Montana
and I may try that next.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.101
What is the best way to obtain even tone and
texture (no more dots or discoloration) in

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:55.430
the under eye region?

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:06.680
Also, while I research treatments, what is
the best method of concealment?

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.320
Doctor:

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.170
Thank you for your question!

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.140
Dealing with dark circles under the eyes is
a huge industry.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.900
If you go into any drugstore or one of these
skin care retail outlets, just ask where the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.530
under eye circle treatments are and you will
be overwhelmed.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.600
And there are a variety of reasons for dark
circles under the eyes and in my practice,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.890
people come to me a lot for this problem.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.900
So let's learn a little bit about what is
responsible for dark circles under the eyes.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.670
Let's start first with genetics and heredity.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.060
That's the most common issue because a certain
amount of pigmentation is going to be a part

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.840
of this area if that runs in your family.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.100
Next, we have the skin quality itself and
that's where the opportunity is.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:25.520
Skin quality, becoming crÃªpey, thin related
to exposures I should say, like sun exposure,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.020
smoking and stress.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.070
All of these things can affect the skin quality
and can age the skin.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.510
And so, when we think about eyelid skin, realize
that the eyelid skin is the thinnest skin

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.660
in the body.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.280
It's half a millimeter in thickness and anything
that breaks down the collagen in the skin

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.940
will cause the dark circles, the fine lines
to occur.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.060
The other thing to be aware of has to with
allergies.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.880
When you have chronic allergies, in medicine,
we refer to that as allergic shiners or almost

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.730
a bluish quality under the eyes.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.620
Another thing that we should mention is when
a person's skin is very light, they have light

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.170
eyes or light hair.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.330
Then practically their eyelid skin is almost
transparent and your able to see through the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:29.620
bluish quality or the reddish color of the
muscle underneath.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.459
So in my practice, one of the things we've
had very good results with and again, when

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.889
we talk about very good results, we don't
mean complete 100% amazing improvement but

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.230
significant improvement is something called
platelet-rich plasma.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:56.049
Now, platelet-rich plasma is a very interesting
method that we employ that's basically transferring

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.220
technology that's used in orthopedics.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.650
Now more and more athletes are going for injections
of platelet-rich plasma for knees.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.639
People know about basketball players, football
players who are getting these injections.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:15.090
Well, in cosmetics, we've been using platelet-rich
plasma for a variety of things and what I've

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:21.959
been using it is for under eye circles and
I've been consistently getting improvement.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.290
In the concept of platelet-rich plasma, there's
a couple of things.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:35.460
One is, it stimulates collagen as in the healing
process and two, it stimulates blood flow

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.400
and blood supply to the skin.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.080
So that results in the skin quality having
a little bit more luster.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.900
So these are the things that injectable cannot
do.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.860
And using platelet-rich plasma is a very straight
forward and in our practice, the patient comes

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.560
in the office, we draw blood like we're drawing
a routine blood supply and then we spin it

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.250
and we isolate the platelets and we do the
injections.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.449
So that's one option.

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.129
Other options that we employ in our practice
include fractional C02 laser.

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.310
Essentially, any laser that takes off the
top laser skin can allow tightening and new

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.990
collagen to occur can improve the appearance
of dark circles.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.490
Otherwise, when you talk about concealment,
you're looking for some type of camouflage

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:36.550
which is more in the make-up category or tinted,
moisturizer to look less dark.

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:44.030
Some of these work very well but again when
you apply this type of method, then you'll

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.530
have to consider where it goes from looking
like it blends well or where it is obviously

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.530
make-up.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.750
So you have a lot of choices there.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:59.620
In our practice, I developed a particular
cream that I called eye rescue that at the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.780
superficial level of the skin, it does improve
the plumpness.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:12.069
One of the things about skin under the eyes
that is very dry, it can look very wrinkled

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:13.919
and it can look very dark.

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:20.680
So what I came up with is a moisturizer that
has a slight tint to it and I had my patients

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.840
apply it to the skin daily.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.599
It basically improves the superficial aspect
of the skin.

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:33.340
It's almost like waxing a car just smoothing
out a lot of the irregularities.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.199
It also has some active ingredients.

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:41.249
But when you really want to build the quality
of the skin, you want to work a more systemic

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:45.669
way or at a more aggressive way.

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:53.460
So, platelet-rich plasma is our first go-to
treatment for dark circles under the eyes.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:28.800
So, I hope that was helpful and thank you
for your question.
