00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
hello namaste

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.809
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.099
Vahrehvah.com. Today i'm going to
show you how to make Saag chicken

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.830
that is Palak chicken curry

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.769
so for this we're going to take some oil
and now to make this

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.750
add some chopped onion and we're going
to cook this onion till it is slightly

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.830
golden color for certain kind of preparations you want just onion to be

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.320
sauteed but for this we're going to make
it slightly golden color because in this saag

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.940
chicken we're going to add tomatoes

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.550
so we're going to make a nice tomato
gravy first add some salt and just cook

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.180
this

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.690
still this onions are slightly golden in color,  can see this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
onions are getting almost lightly
golden and when you cook the onions to

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.960
this consistency

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.140
the onions will slowly disappear into
the gravy. In this add slices of garlic

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.080
and you know you're going to cook these
two along with these onions and we're

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.000
going to add some ginger paste

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900
ok once these are slightly little more
cooked in this

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.850
add some ginger paste and we're going to
cook this also add some chopped green

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.439
chilli, some turmeric, chilli powder, in
this some cumin powder, coriander powder,

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.430
add tomatoes and mix all of this

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.000
Wow now none of the masalas will burn because as soon as you added them you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.180
also add tomatoes and we're going to cook this till these tomatoes mash up and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.159
disappear along with this onions

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.259
now after around five minutes of slow cooking now you see the tomatoes are

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.820
almost getting disappeared and you can
only see the pieces of garlic

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.210
wow this is a consistency you want now

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.290
still we are not ready to add the
spinach i'm going to show you when in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.420
this add chicken pieces

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.590
ok ok

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.149
you know even if there is some water in
the bowl just add the pieces of chicken

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.330
okay do not add any of the water from
this chicken is good and do not put the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.239
lid on and take a bigger pan like this

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.819
and now slowly saute this chicken along with this onion and tomato masala

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.370
okay you want the chicken to be slightly
sauted with this masala so do not put

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.810
the lid on and the chicken also will ooze out some moisture but you want that

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.819
moisture to be disappearing

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.370
while you're cooking now have a look at
this the chicken is almost seventy

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.030
percent cooked just in this mixture

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.090
ok and also look they are nicely cooked

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.230
and now we're going to add the paste of
spinach

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.519
I just blanched the spinach put in a
blender and made into a paste

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.799
you know add it when the chicken is
almost seventy percent cooked and the

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.019
tomatoes and onions have disappeared in
the gravy and now this will become a

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.450
fantastic saag chicken and the most
tastiest saag chicken you'll ever have

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.760
tasted adding at this point of time will
also ensure that it will maintain and

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.910
nice good green color wow

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.620
look at this;  this is good now

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.389
do not put the lid on or else the color of this spinach curry will slightly

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.769
change so and reduce the flame and slowly cook till the nice flavors come in this

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.030
we're going to add little bit of kasuri methi this is fenugreek leaves

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:52.030
just crush it little bit and just add on
top and do not forget where spinach goes

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.200
garlic goes

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.700
add pinch of nutmeg powder even if I
show you recipe where i added spinach and garlic

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.419
if I don't add nutmeg you know feel
free

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.669
add little bit that will add very nice flavor
to this and also a little bit of garam

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:07.780
masala powder

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.760
look at this just after adding spinach
in a fraction of 2 - 3 minutes

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.540
the masala will be getting cooked very
fast wow this is

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.220
what is called saag chicken you know
people they do what not to their

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.950
saag chickens just it is so simple and
easy to get the best of the best flavors

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.940
from the spinach and the chicken; gravy

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.730
after five minutes of cooking the
spinach also is shining wow in this

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.350
this is option okay

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.510
you know this chicken is in the liptahua gravy that means nicely coated gravy

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.960
but you know if some people want to add
a little bit of cream

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.600
you can add it is an optional but this
chicken itself has awesome very intense and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.940
a beautiful taste in this

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:07.370
add some cream and mix this along with
this chicken and fantastic

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.900
this is all done and that look at this
this is perfectly good

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.620
now this is all ready switch off the flame
and enjoy it with naan, phulka, rice

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.490
anything; this kind of preparation is
best

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.130
wow wow wow you know this is super
you know you can tell when this gravy is

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.260
perfectly good when the gravy should be
nice and green

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.600
but the oil that will be coming from
this has to be a reddish-brown that's

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.070
when this is a perfect saag chicken fuming fuming hot
