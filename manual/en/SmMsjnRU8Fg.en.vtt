00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.699
Well this is what a shelter looks like

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:18.480
This one's special because it actually has
a front to it

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.480
Amazing

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:26.739
Usually it's just completely open

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:27.869
These are sleeping platforms

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.849
You might be able to fit as many three people
along the bottom

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.290
Two on the top

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.670
It's actually got a picnic table inside

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.079
Usually they have that outside

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.370
And tonight I'm having dinner of spicy tuna
and bread

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.370
Peanut butter

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.390
Umm, some flavoured water, and Pop Tarts

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.190
Very nutritious, I know

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.320
Most of the shelters are built out of wood,
this one's a stone one

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.640
Hikers tend to congregrate in these things,
but there's only me here

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.450
I don't know where, where everyone else will
be

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.020
I guess because the shelter's only a few miles
from a town

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.510
People either stop before it or push - push
on

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.150
That's a - something to hang you backpack
up

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.670
Or you foodbag from

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.369
To stop mice getting at it

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:36.101
I think I can see a mouse nest up in the corner
there

00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:40.409
But they'll come crawl all over at night

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.649
Usually they don't have a floor in a shelter

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.799
In fact usually this thing just goes straight
across

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.990
And then there's a drop off the end and that's
the shelter floor

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.030
You sleep where you stand

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.990
So this is a shelter

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.149
I'll get back to my dinner
