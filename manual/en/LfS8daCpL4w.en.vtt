Sock Bun Tutorial - Easy How to do

00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:02.210
Hey Everyone,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.370
We are back after doing the Dita Von Teese
makeup look and I've wanted to do a sock bun

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.570
tutorial for a long time and as it turns out
we have a professional here who is going to

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.540
take over and show you guys a really easy
sock bun. It is a great look for an evening

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.520
out, with all the holidays coming up it's
a perfect look and I think it's great for

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.700
this makeup look.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.700
So we will take a sock and cut the tip of
it off. You take the sock that doesn't have

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.180
an end and you roll it up into a donut like
this. Earlier Katie put some frizz control

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.560
product in my hair to control the fly aways
and to make sure everything would be good.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.560
So to start off the sock bun you just put
your hair in a normal regular ponytail.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.740
Now you put the sock just right here and you
put your ponytail through it and just move

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.960
up the bun and then take the end of your hair
and pull it underneath the bun like this.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.440
Then I put my fingers in here and then just
roll it down like this. It looks like it's

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.340
not going to come together but by the end
it will slowly work it's way down.

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:26.549
And if you have any leftover pieces that are
there you can just take bobby pins and pin

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:31.169
them up to make it look better.

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:36.879
Thank you Stacy that is an awesome look. That
looks really super easy.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.040
Thank you Katie, and I hope you guys enjoy
your sock bun.
