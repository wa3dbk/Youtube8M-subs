Hello, I'm Matt Cail and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you today how to

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.440
do advanced painting techniques. I hope that
everyone is ready to get their hands a little

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.930
more dirty. Well, dirtier than they already
are. Basically, what we're going to be focusing

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.350
on next was what I call spraying. Did you
ever have a situation where you maybe wanted

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.130
to show water across the canvas? Or something
more in a liquid state or maybe even like

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
some type of cosmic interstellar motion, something
like that, this tip is basically, this technique

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.640
is going to show you how to do that. First
off, let's take a fan brush and get some pigment.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.430
Now, this pigment is going to stay near the
tips of the fan brush. You can actually see

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.930
where I've stained the fan brush with past
paintings. You shouldn't be getting much deep

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.080
than that for the fan brush. Next, we're going
to use our media. I have liquid media, which

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.579
I like. It's a little more viscous than turpentine.
Turpentine is pretty close to watery and it's

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:02.151
a lot less intense, chemical wise. Take your
fan brush and douse it. Douse it, douse it,

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:07.760
douse it. I want tons of liquid on the edge
of this. I want it to almost be dripping.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.369
Here's where we get our fingers dirty. I hope
you don't have to run down to dinner any time

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.770
soon. Now, with the fan brush doused with
paint and with our media, you're going to

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.360
take it, you're going to grip it in your fingers
like this, pull it back and let it go. Whoa!

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.900
Look at that! My goodness! Now, hold it a
little bit closer if you wanted to get more

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.329
controlled bursts like that, like follows.
But, if you want to get like a wide splay,

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.060
then you kind of hold it back then let it
go and there you go. And now, you can already

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.630
see like your fingers are already getting
wonderfully grimy. Now, you can basically

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.979
repeat this effect as many times as you want,
depending on how much basically speckling

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.700
or liquid affects you want on your canvas.
The more angles you put into this, the more

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.659
motion you'll get. You'll get it where the
speckles will hit on impact then go a certain

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.869
direction. So definitely, you can think about
this. You can let this dry, come back to it

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.110
and do another speckling in black or another
color. I mean I've seen almost entire canvases

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200
built up over multiple layers of speckling.
