00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:23.530
This operator safety video provides an overview
of the safety features and operating characteristics

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.550
of the Exmark Lazer-Z zero-turn mower.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:38.360
It is not a substitute for reading and understanding
the complete operator's manual provided with

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.360
the mower.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.540
The handling characteristics of zero-turn
mowers are unique.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.880
Using a Z-mower requires training and experience.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.000
Always operate the mower safely and be aware
of specific terrain and mowing conditions

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
that may affect the handling of the mower.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.540
Always wear proper clothing when operating
mowing equipment.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:13.570
This includes appropriate work boots or shoes,
safety glasses, and hearing protection.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.850
Long hair, loose fitting clothing, and jewelry
can easily catch or became tangled in moving

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.360
parts.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:31.820
Make certain that safety shields and all equipment
is in place on the mower and functioning properly.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.370
Ensure that tires are inflated to the recommended
pressure.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:44.210
Became familiar with and pay careful attention
to safety alert symbols, which appear in the

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.450
operator's manual and are positioned on various
parts of the machine.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.170
They identify important safety messages, which
must be followed to avoid accidents, serious

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.350
injury, or death.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.410
Exmark zero-turn mowers are equipped with
heavy-duty rollover protection systems, or

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:18.600
ROPS, designed to protect operators in case
of an unexpected rollover.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.680
Operate the mower with the ROPS in the upright,
locked position and fasten the seat belt.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.960
Lower the ROPS only when absolutely necessary
and do not wear the seat belt when the roll

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.940
bar is down.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.330
Drive with caution and keep the mower's speed
under control.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.470
Always operate the Exmark Lazer-Z zero-turn
mower within the safety zone.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.650
Knowing the safety zone helps you stay clear
of water and other hazards.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.650
Maintain a distance of at least 2 mower widths.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.990
Use a walk mower or hand trimmer near water.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:15.390
Use extra caution when fueling and never remove
the fuel cap or add fuel when the mower is

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.380
running or the engine is hot.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.790
Only add fuel to the mower when outdoors and
only in a level, open area.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.560
Do not overfill the fuel tank.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.680
Fuel and vapors are explosive and extremely
flammable.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:42.700
The fuel's shut-off valve is located near
the fuel tank and should always be closed

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.650
when transporting or storing the mower.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.470
Different types of equipment may be needed
based on the landscape.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:01.120
For example, use a stand-on, walk-behind,
or trimmer on steep slopes or near dropoffs

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.180
or ponds.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.620
Carefully inspect the area to be mowed and
remove any objects that may damage the mower

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.120
or be thrown by the motion of the blades.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.000
Before mowing, make sure the area is clear
of other people.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.150
Stop mowing and immediately shut off the blades
if people or pets enter the area.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.550
Be continually aware of the mower's direction
of discharge and direct the discharge away

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.300
from vehicles and buildings.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:49.330
Again, never allow the discharge to be directed
toward people or pets with the blades engaged.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:56.800
Before leaving the operator's seat for any
reason, stop the engine, set the parking brake,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.400
and remove the key.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.860
Wait for all moving parts to stop.

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:08.729
Never assume that the blades have stopped
when the engine is running.

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.090
Using certain attachments may affect the mower's
stability.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:20.750
Be sure to read and follow Exmark's recommendations
for attachment weights and safe operation.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.939
When using a bagging system with a blower,
remember that a rotating impeller is located

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.419
within the lower housing.

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:36.560
Contact with the moving impeller can cause
serious injury.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.729
Never reach into the blower when the engine
is running.

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.569
Disengage the PTO.

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:53.169
Stop the engine and wait for all moving parts
to come to a stop before removing clogs in

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.870
the blower's shoot.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.770
Do not use your hands to clear clogs and debris.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:10.240
When using the hopper on a bagging system,
disengage the PTO to stop the motion of the

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.199
blades before emptying the hopper.

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:22.460
Close and latch the hopper door before continuing
to mow.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.810
Do not engage the blades with the hopper door
open.

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:34.490
To prevent fires, keep the engine and mower
components clear of accumulated debris such

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.389
as dried grass, leaves, and other clippings.

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:46.210
A buildup of debris near a hot exhaust or
dirty engine can ignite a fire.

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:53.310
Clean the unit once it has cooled, especially
when using a bagging system or when transporting

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.449
in an enclosed trailer.

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.379
Never touch hot surfaces and keep all exhaust
guards in their proper place.

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:10.639
Serious burns can result from contact with
the engine or muffler during operation and

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:15.990
during the cool-down period after use.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:23.639
Operators must be thoroughly familiar with
all safety features and safety alert symbols

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:30.229
and must be completely trained in the functions
of the controls before operating the Lazer-Z

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:31.610
zero-turn mower.
