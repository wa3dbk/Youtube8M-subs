Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:02.633 --> 00:00:05.333
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.066
This week, the President
addressed the national tragedy

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:11.266
in Newtown, Connecticut, and
promised meaningful action to

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:12.900
address gun violence.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.133
While the White House invited
some of its newest Pinterest

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:18.934
followers and the President
spread some holiday cheer.

00:00:18.934 --> 00:00:21.166
That's December 14th
to December 20th,

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:22.967
or "We Are There For Them."

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.000
On Friday after the tragic
events in Newtown, Connecticut,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.200
the President delivered an
emotional statement in the

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.166
White House briefing room.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.667
President Obama:
In the hard days to come, that
community needs us to be at our

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:41.900
best as Americans, and I will
do everything in my power as

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.433
President to help.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:48.367
All of us can extend a hand to
those in need to remind them

00:00:48.367 --> 00:00:54.567
that we are there for them, that
we are praying for them, that

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:58.600
the love they felt for those
they lost endures not just in

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.500
their memories,
but also in ours.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.700
Narrator:
On Sunday, the President
traveled to Newtown, Connecticut

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.066
and spoke at an interfaith vigil
for the victims of the shooting

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:08.667
and their families.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.667
President Obama:
We can't tolerate this anymore.

00:01:11.667 --> 00:01:14.433
These tragedies must end.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.433
And to end them, we must change.

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:20.300
Charlotte.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.767
Daniel.

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:25.066
Olivia.

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.567
Josephine.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.567

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:32.133

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.300

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.867

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:38.934

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.200
Narrator:
On Monday, to help kick off
the White House presence on

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.600
Pinterest, the Office of Digital
Strategies hosted a White House

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.600
holiday social with some of our
newest Pinterest followers where

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.800
the Pinterers had a chance to
talk with and hear from a series

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.433
of White House officials,
including Director of the

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:24.166
Visitors Office, Ellie Schafer,
the Chief of Staff to the First

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:27.633
Lady, Tina Tchen, and the
digital strategists, who wanted

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:30.533
to strategize digitally.

00:02:30.533 --> 00:02:34.166
Macon Phillips:
Where are the conversations
about these sorts of standard

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.100
issues that the country is
grappling with happening,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.600
and how are they
happening on Pinterest.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.734
Narrator:
On Tuesday, the President
dropped by the offices of some

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:43.367
of his staff who play a critical
role in running the day-to-day

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.667
functions of the White House for
some holiday greetings, a whole

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:50.834
lot of hugs, group photos, and
some time to thank the staff for

00:02:50.834 --> 00:02:52.867
all their hard work over
the course of the year.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:56.900
President Obama:
I'm using your work product
and it's helping me out.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.166
I'm very proud of you.

00:02:58.166 --> 00:03:00.633
Narrator:
He even snuck in a few good
old-fashioned presidential

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:02.166
Q&amp;A sessions.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.633
President Obama:
Who wants to describe to me
the process of dealing with

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.166
40,000 emails?

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:07.200
That's only just four of you.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.567
That's a lot of letters to read.

00:03:08.567 --> 00:03:10.200
Speaker:
It's a lot, yeah,
it's like 400 a day.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.667
President Obama:
What have you guys
got cooked up now?

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:15.000
What's the next big thing?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.900
Speaker:
APIs for WhiteHouse.gov.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.834
President Obama:
APIs for WhiteHouse.gov.

00:03:18.834 --> 00:03:20.600
What in the heck does that mean?

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.467
I'm a big believer in us using
new media to reach people who

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:27.233
otherwise can't be reached.

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:30.967
And the more we engage them, the
better our democracy works, the

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:35.767
better our public policy is, the
better our people do, right.

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:38.800
Narrator:
I've been waiting for this
privilege for four years.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.033
I've been here 20.

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.834
President Obama:
I am so grateful that you have
been, and I'm so glad we had a

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:43.633
chance to see each other.

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.166
Let's take a good
picture with everybody.

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.367
(cheers)

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:47.667
President Obama:
We'll do all the
volunteers first,

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:48.533
then I'll do all the staff.

00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:50.734
Let go of your bag,
nobody's going to steal it.

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:52.867
I'm right here.

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:55.066
Got the Secret Service
looking after it.

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:57.367
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President
delivered a statement about

00:03:57.367 --> 00:03:59.934
the policy process the
administration will pursue

00:03:59.934 --> 00:04:01.900
in the wake of
the Newtown tragedy.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.500
Then he took questions
from reporters about it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.066
and his efforts to find
a bipartisan compromise

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:08.266
to reduce our deficit.

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:14.433
President Obama:
If there's one thing we should
have after this week, it should

00:04:14.433 --> 00:04:17.500
be a sense of perspective
about what's important.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.567
The country deserves folks to be
willing to compromise on behalf

00:04:21.567 --> 00:04:27.033
of the greater good and not
tangle themselves up in a whole

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:30.467
bunch of ideological positions
that don't make much sense.

00:04:30.467 --> 00:04:37.567
So I remain not only open to
conversations, but I remain

00:04:37.567 --> 00:04:39.300
eager to get something done.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.500
Narrator:
That evening, the President
addressed an international

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.333
holiday gathering at the State
Department of the world's

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:47.667
diplomatic corps and spoke on
the importance of their work in

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:49.867
light of the recent
events here at home.

00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:53.700
President Obama:
And we're reminded that whatever
differences on the surface, deep

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.767
down we're bound by a certain
set of basic aspirations.

00:04:56.767 --> 00:05:00.533
We want our children to be
safe and free from fear.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.667
And that, I think, is one
of the ways we can honor

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:10.367
all these beautiful children
and incredible teachers who

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:15.700
were lost this past Friday, by
building a future that is equal

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:20.734
to their dreams and delivers
on the dreams of children all

00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:23.000
around the world just like them.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.500
Narrator:
To find out more information
on any of these topics or to see

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.967
complete videos of these events,
go to WhiteHouse.gov, and thanks

00:05:28.967 --> 00:05:31.166
again for checking out
your West Wing Week.

00:05:31.166 --> 00:05:34.233
Children:
♪ You better watch out, you
better not cry, you better ♪

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:40.333
♪ not pout, I'm telling you why,
Santa Claus is coming to town. ♪

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:43.266
(laughter)

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:45.000
First Lady Michelle Obama:
This is exactly what
he does at home.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He tries to beat Malia
and Sasha into my lap.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.967
(laughter)

00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:52.400
Then he has the nerve
not to be comfortable.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.767
(laughter)

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:55.400
Speaker:
All right, get you a girl.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:03.000
(laughter)
