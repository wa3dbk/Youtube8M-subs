Hey Chef Kendra here and today we learn
how to make cheesecake. Preheat your oven

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:17.010
to 325 degrees. I m putting some graham crackers
into our trusty Ninja, and I m going to whiz

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.460
them up, adding more as more room becomes
available. For our crust we need our graham

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.509
crackers crumbs and melted butter. So, we
are going to put out graham cracker crumbs

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.660
in this bowl, then we will add the melted
butter, and grab a folk and mix it well. Did

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.539
you guys know that July 30 is National Cheesecake
day, I might have to do something special

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.530
this year when that holiday rolls around,
and best believe that s a holiday. Everyone

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.109
should have the day off, and free cheese cake
for everyone at factory or something. Anyway,

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:55.010
in a x baking dish lined with parchment paper,
or using a spring form pan, pour in the crumbs

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.710
and pat them down firmly, using our fingers.
Making sure to get the crumbs in all the corners,

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.820
but not up the sides, once it s done set it
aside as we move on to the wonderful filling.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.780
But, before we do that we are going to take
some boiling water and pour in into a roasting

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.720
pan or baking dish. And slide in on the middle
rack of the oven. The steam will help our

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.720
cheese cake not to crack. Eggs, sour cream,
cream cheese, sugar and vanilla will make

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.100
up our filling. We need a electric mixer and
a big bowl. In goes the cream cheese, we want

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.560
to mix this until it smooth. We also want
to make sure our cream cheese is room temperature.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.000
Same for our eggs. Cheesecake comes from Greece,
when the romans slide in and conquered the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.520
Greeks the pinched the recipe. OK, add the
sugar, Now we are going to add eggs, mixing

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.010
in on completely before adding another one.
Now we are going to pour in the vanilla extract

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.910
and mix again, finally we are going to add
the sour cream to our filling. I find that

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.050
not all sour creams are equal so make sure
your use a good brand that you like. We are

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.969
going to give our filling a final mix, we
are going to stop the blender and really scrap

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:16.620
down the bowl before we pour the filling into
our baking pan. The link to this recipe is

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.299
in the description box below. Alright, we
are going to pour the filling into the baking

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.209
dish and we are going to put it on the top
rack and bake it for 45-55 minutes. It should

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.209
still be a little jiggly, in the middle cool
in the pan for 30 minutes, then chill in the

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:44.599
refrigerator for 6 hours. OK guys, please
share this video, and subscribe. Chef Kendra

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.870
is out. Peace.
