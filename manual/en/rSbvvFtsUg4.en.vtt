00:00:13.108 --> 00:00:13.608
-Hi, guys!

00:00:13.608 --> 00:00:15.640
It's Brooklyn and
Bailey, and today we're

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.000
going to be doing a new
type of video series called

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.997
"Fab or Fail."

00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:21.080
And we're going to be
reviewing products and stuff

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.220
that you guys suggest--

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.490
-Exactly.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.660
- -- or that we decide to do.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.243
And we're going to
be giving it a rate

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:27.176
on our "Fab or Fail" scale.

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:30.500
And our scale is 1 to 10,
1 being an absolute fail,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.639
and a 10 being an absolute fab.

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:34.930
And today we're going to be
reviewing the Graphic Skinz

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.960
Design Studio by
Rose Art, and we're

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.736
super-excited to show
you, so let's get started.

00:00:39.736 --> 00:00:42.110
-When you open the box, here's
what you're going to find.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.710
There's a vacuum
chamber and a sponge

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250
to go along with it,
along with a few toys

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.480
that you can skin if
you decide to you.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.780
They also supplied you
with a few skin designs,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.290
but there are some other kinds
if you want to get those.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.876
And then they also supplied
you with a smoothing brush.

00:00:56.876 --> 00:00:59.600
-To start off, I decided to
skin this heart-shaped necklace,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.670
because Bailey and I use
jewelery all the time.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.090
Next up, you're supposed
to trace out your design

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.615
onto your skins and cut it out.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.750
Since the skins
have three layers,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.150
I'm just going to peel off
the first plastic layer,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.315
so that my skins can stick
onto my heart necklace.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.234
Now, in order to
get our skins layer

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:32.650
to stick to our
heart necklace, we

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.830
have to wet down
our yellow sponge,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.580
squeeze out a
little bit of water,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.560
and place the heart in
the middle of the sponge,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.920
then place the sponge
inside the vacuum chamber.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.730
Press the button down until
all the air is squeezed out

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.670
of the vacuum chamber.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.070
After pulling my heart
out of the chamber

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.890
and peeling off the white,
thin layer of paper,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.535
I was really impressed
and surprised

00:01:57.535 --> 00:02:01.790
with how well the
skins layer worked out.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.577
And last, but not
least, take your brush

00:02:03.577 --> 00:02:05.785
and smooth out your design,
so it's nice and perfect.

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:12.770
-I thought it would be fun
to try out a phone case,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.790
so I'm just going to trace and
cut out my phone case design.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.610
Now I'm going to do the
exact same thing Brooklyn

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.170
did earlier, and I'm going
to peel the clear layer

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.855
off my skin, and then I'm
going to go ahead and lay it

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:30.298
on top of my phone case.

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:35.030
And then after I
finished that, I'm just

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.196
going to repeat the same
steps Brooklyn did earlier.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.260
I feel like the phone case
turned out really cute.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.220
And I think that if I used a
more masculine-looking skin,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.095
even my guy friends
would like this.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.340
-Using the same
steps as before, I'm

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.550
going to decorate my
Christmas hot chocolate

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:15.450
mug with this cute blue
B. Since our mugs too big

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.510
to fit into our
vacuum, we decided

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.430
to wet it down and just
peel off the layer,

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.427
and ta-da, we have this cute
Christmas hot chocolate mug.

00:03:24.427 --> 00:03:26.010
-And just for the
fun of it, I thought

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.968
I'd show you guys how I
skinned one of the toys

00:03:27.968 --> 00:03:29.330
from the actual kit.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.340
And just using the
same steps as before,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.030
I'm just going to
add my own pop to it.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.020
This project would make a great
Christmas gift or birthday

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.440
gift for kids anywhere
from six and up.

00:04:09.636 --> 00:04:12.090
-Thank you guys so much
for watching this video.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.210
Some of the other things
we were able to add skins

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:18.025
to-- mugs, sunglasses sides,
water glasses, necklace,

00:04:18.025 --> 00:04:18.740
phone cases,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.480
-A key chain, hair accessories,
another mug, and a ring jar.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.480
-I think we rated the Graphic
Skinz Design Studio as a nine

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.340
on our Fab and Fail scale.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.380
It worked really well.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.000
It really kept the
kids preoccupied--

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.050
Kamri and Rylan were
playing with this for hours.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.840
-Oh, for forever.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.340
-I swear.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.280
Just designing anything they
could get their hands on,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.350
it was a ton of fun.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.560
If any of you all want
to try this project out,

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.885
you can get it at
Walmart or Target.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:44.260
And if you want us to
see your recreation,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.582
be sure to hashtag
#GraphicSkinz with a Z.

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:48.228
And we'll see you
guys next week.

00:04:48.228 --> 00:04:48.936
-(IN UNISON) Bye!

00:04:55.345 --> 00:04:58.510
-For my first cheer outfit, it
revolves around warmer weather.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.830
So to start off, I have
my cheer tennis shoes on,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.430
which are just some Nike
tennis shoes that I have,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.010
and then I am also wearing--

00:05:08.682 --> 00:05:10.640
-How come you're all
wrapped up in the blanket?

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.460
-(IN UNISON) Because I'm cold.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.930
-Oh.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.210
What's it doing outside?

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:18.160
-(IN UNISON) Snowing.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.750
-It is?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.568
What's your favorite
Christmas song?

00:05:21.568 --> 00:05:22.068
-Um.

00:05:22.068 --> 00:05:24.690
-Hungry hippos.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.606
-"All You Want for
Christmas Is a Hippo"?

00:05:26.606 --> 00:05:27.592
-Yeah.

00:05:27.592 --> 00:05:31.043
-And mine's, uh,
(SINGING) All I want

00:05:31.043 --> 00:05:34.510
for Christmas is
my two front teeth.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.660
-Those are good ones.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.260
Hey, I love you guys.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.194
-I love you.

00:05:40.194 --> 00:05:41.140
-I love you too.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.640
-Bye.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.140
-Bye.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.490
-Bye.
