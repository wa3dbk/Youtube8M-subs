00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.000
This is Kerrigan. There is a wave of Zerg advancing on this position. ...

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.200
... We need immediate evacuation.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.600
What happened to Kerrigan wasn't your fault.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.300
Belay that order. We're moving out.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.000
What? You're not gonna just leave her!

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.300
Vengeance doesn't factor into this. Our Revolution is about freedom.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
When you figure it out, let us know. We are waiting on you.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.300
Sir, Dominion ships warping in.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.900
Sweet Mother mercy.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
Bout time, we kicked this revolution into overdrive.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.800
Feels like old times already.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.200
The answers you seek lie within.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
Jim Raynor represents a clear and present threat to this dominion.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.500
Prince Valerian, we have Zerg attack waves incoming.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.500
Kerrigan, what's she after?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.500
She's come to finish the job.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.300
Raynor, you're in way over your head.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.700
We will see about that.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.100
Tell me, why I shouldn't kill you right now?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.300
Because I can offer you, what you have always wanted.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.700
PREPARE FOR THE BATTLE

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.600
If the Zerg wipe everyone out, it's all been for nothing.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.500
Stand your ground.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
THAT WILL CHANGE

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.400
So I am going back to Char...

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.800
EVERYTHING

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.600
... to get the job done.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.800
Now that's the commander, I have been waiting for.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.500
Because the one thing I know, ...

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.900
... some things are just worth fighting for.
