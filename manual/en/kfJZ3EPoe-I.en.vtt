England\
\

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.169

I came to the United States about 14 years

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.169

\

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.249

Done martial arts my whole life\

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:22.249
\
\

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.650
I started out doing YouTube content with Thousand
Pounds\

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.650
\
\

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.089
And from there I just kept on going\
\

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.789
\
Just hearing his accent in person\

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.789
\
\

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.789
It's enchanting\
\

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.280
\
I have a crush, i'm sorry (laughs)\

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.280

You already know what it is\

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.350
\
\

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.510
Captain America The Winter Soldier\
\

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.510
\
This Guy here\'85\

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.510
\
\

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.240
Tell us what you did for the movie\
\

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.620

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:51.620
mouth\
\

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.879
\
I was the Fight Choreographer\

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:53.879
\
\

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:54.879
And the Stunt Double for The Winter Soldier
\

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.879
\
\

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:56.879
The Winter Soldier Double! Do you remember
this?\

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.879
\
\

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.059
Were you the guy that did this?\
\

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.759
\
This move right here? (makes sound)\

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:12.759
\
\

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.399
That's Aaron Toney, He's another all star.\
\

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:17.680
\
What I wanted to do is\'85\

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.680
\
\

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.460
Who the hell?!!!\
\

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.590
\
So many people messing with me!\

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.590
\
\

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.479
So I wanted to get you something special\
\

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.940
\
Um, It's A rare opportunity that you get to

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.940
have\
\

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.360
\
Someone who's actually worked on such a big

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.510
movie\
\

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.390
\
Was that your first big thing that you were

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.529
in charge of,\
\

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:41.900
\
And choreographed and everything?\

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.900
\
\

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.020
Yes, I did a movie beforehand called Raze
with Zoe Bell\

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.020
\
\

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.079
I was the Stunt Coordinator and the Fight
Choreographer for that\

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.079
\
\

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.320
But this absolutely was the biggest project
I've ever done\

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
\
\

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.320
Ever\
\

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.939
\
And I gotta say it's my favorite Marvel movie

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:57.939
to date\
\

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:58.950
\
And I'm not just blowing smoke up your ass\

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.950
\
\

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.950
I really mean it.\
\

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.930

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.930
the fight\
\

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.770
\
It's Con Season, We just had WonderCon\

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.770
\
\

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.410
\
Yea I'm hoping to go to Comic Con\

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.410

\

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.520
I missed WonderCon, I'm really upset\
\

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.290
\
You gotta stay on that!\

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.290
\
\

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.810
So anyone who's getting ready to Cosplay \
\

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.760
\
The Winter Soldier and Captain America\

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760
\
\

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.320
We're going to give you some simple moves
you can do\

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320
\
\

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.320
And follow along and they're going be authentic\
\

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320
\
And Impress everyone at the Con\

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320
\
\

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.320
Let's do it!\
\

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.320
\
Ok, so right now I took off the mics\

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.320

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320
We're about to get down!\
\

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320
\
This sequence happens right when Winter Soldier

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320
takes out the knife\
\

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.320
\
Ok\

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.320
\
\

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.320
And this is where Captain America runs at
the Winter Soldier\

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.320
\
\

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.320

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.320

Did you get that?\
\

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.510
\
Were going to walk it really slow\

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.510

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.510
