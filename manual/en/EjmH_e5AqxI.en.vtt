00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.850
The best way to do a bench press to build
a better looking chest is to

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.950
lower the bar down to your chest, like you
normally would.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.790
But instead of
pushing it right back up you're going to stop

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.030
for three to five seconds
before pushing the bar back up.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.380
So really, you're doing a bench press the
way you normally would, but this time after

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.500
you lower the bar down to your
chest, you're going to stop for three to five

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.970
seconds before pressing the
bar back up.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.270
The reason why it's better to do bench presses
like this is because when

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.910
you do a regular bench press where you just
press the bar up and down

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.980
without stopping, you're mainly using momentum
to bounce the bar up and

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.140
down off your chest.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.830
This takes away from your chest workout.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.320
But when you
do your bench presses like I'm doing in the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
video, where you stop at the
bottom for three to five seconds before pushing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.680
the bar back up, your chest
muscles do all the work, so you can't use

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.460
any momentum to bounce the bar
off our chest.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.530
This makes you have to contract and squeeze
your chest

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.620
muscles even harder to push the bar back up.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.970
This gives you a much better chest workout,
helping you build a better

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.190
looking chest faster.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.420
Now, I'm not saying you can't build a better
looking

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.439
chest doing bench presses the regular way
of pushing the bar up and down

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.439
without stopping.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.889
But you will build a bigger chest faster doing
the way

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:16.090
I'm doing in the video here, by stopping at
the bottom for three to five

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.479
seconds.

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.819
This same bench press method can also be used
when doing decline and

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:25.119
incline bench presses where you also stop
at the bottom for three to five

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.579
seconds before pushing the bar back up.

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.600
You can also use this same
technique to build bigger arms or triceps

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.539
faster when doing a close grip
bench press.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.469
Plus you can also do a dumbbell bench press
the same way by

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.060
pausing at the bottom for three to five seconds.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.719
Using dumbbells gives you
a greater stretch and range of motion which

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.770
helps you work more chest
muscle fibers which will probably give you

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.599
better and faster results than
doing a regular bench press.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.729
Here's a little trick you can do to make your
chest muscles grow even

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.200
faster.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.439
You just lower the bar down and stop for three
to five seconds like

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:06.979
you always do.

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.170
But this time, instead of pushing the bar
all the way up,

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.099
you push it up halfway and come back down
and you only stop for no more

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.790
than two seconds.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.500
Then you finally push the bar all the way
up and that

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.690
counts as one rep.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.520
This is just another workout option you have
for making your chest look

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.840
bigger and better.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.220
So if you have a hard time getting a good
chest workout

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.480
or you can't get your stubborn chest muscles
to grow, simply try this

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.720
technique I'm showing you right now in the
video where you bring the bar

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.290
all the way down and stop for three to five
seconds.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.069
Then you push the bar
back up halfway, then bring it back down and

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.450
pause for less than two
seconds.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.680
Then you finally push the bar all the way
up.
