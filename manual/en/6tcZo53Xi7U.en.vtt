What's special about the Helix soundtrack is

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.160
that it consists of orchestral and electronic parts. 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.660
The attraction itself is divided in three different audio zones

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.299
and the music becomes more and more intense from zone to zone

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.200
to raise the adrenaline level of the riders.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.790
We've composed and produced 100 minutes of exclusive music for Helix.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.310
Every one of our team had the chance to participate on this project 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.190
in collaboration with the others to create this unique sound.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.360
Because of Liseberg giving us free rein,

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.540
we were able experiment a lot with sounds to show another musical side of us.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.620
The planning begun months before the actual production period. 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.440
We've visited Liseberg,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.680
representatives of Liseberg visited us,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.800
and we talked about this gigantic and impressive project in detail. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.600
This way the foundation stone was laid a long time before the first note was ever written.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.180
What was exciting about this project was that we were able to combine

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.940
musical elements, which usually do not go together,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.520
for example Dubstep-like elements with orchestral parts.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.439
We're very happy about the positive feedback by all the enthusiasts

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.079
for the soundtrack of Helix. Thus there were many enquires about 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.439
where the soundtrack is available. 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.300
After a brief consultation with the park, we both agreed to

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.200
release big parts of the soundtrack as a free download.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.820
That's something that does not happen very often so it is a great gift for all the fans.
