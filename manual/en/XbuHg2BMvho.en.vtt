Hi! My name is Mathie from Pintura Facil Para Ti.com (easy painting for you)

00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:15.067
Today we are going to paint these beautiful sneakers for the summer, using the fabric painting technique and I hope you like them

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:27.067
I took the idea from a question I received from our YouTube channel about how to paint the sneakers

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:32.067
If it was necessary to apply the textile medium or if we could use the hairdryer

00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:40.067
I thought about making this step by step tutorial explaining the most important things to paint these sneakers

00:00:40.068 --> 00:00:43.067
so you can also paint them this summer

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:53.067
The designs we apply are the tulips that we painted on a T-shirt some time ago

00:00:53.068 --> 00:01:02.067
We only varied the size of the design: some larger and some smaller to follow the sneakers shape

00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:12.067
If you want to see the step by step to paint this tulip, just click on the right side of the video right now

If you click right now, it’ll open a new tab so you don’t loose this video you're watching

00:01:27.068 --> 00:01:33.067
So let’s go through the steps to paint these beautiful sneakers

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:38.067
The first thing you have to be sure is that the sneakers are made from a natural material

00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:45.067
That it can be from cotton, sailcloth,... any kind of natural fiber but not synthetic

00:01:45.068 --> 00:01:54.067
Synthetic fiber does not allow paintings to stay on fabric and this can make the painting pull out

00:01:54.068 --> 00:02:02.067
Next step will be wash and dry the sneakers. I recommend you to wash them in the washing machine

00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:14.067
and then let them dry in the sun, but don’t in the dryer machine

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:20.067
They have to be well dry to paint on them

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:27.067
Next step will be to paint the sneakers for which you must use textile paint 

00:02:27.068 --> 00:02:36.067
So the paint can well fix on the fabric

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:42.067
When the painting is really dry and all the designs are finished, apply the textile medium 

00:02:43.068 --> 00:02:47.067
So here I can answer to one of the questions I received... Is it really necessary to apply the textile medium?

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:56.067
The textile medium is not absolutely necessary, but if you are going to use these sneakers and will want to wash them

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:59.067
because... as you know... white sneakers get dirty very fast

00:02:59.068 --> 00:03:08.067
I recommend to put some textile medium for the paint to last in time and don’t get away with washes

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:12.067
So your work will last far longer

00:03:12.068 --> 00:03:18.067
The fifth step is to fix the painting with the hot iron or with the hairdryer

00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:35.067
It is a little bit difficult to iron the sneakers, so use the hairdryer until the fabric becomes really hot.

00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:47.067
It is important to notice that it’ll be a chemical smell, that happens when painting and medium are fixing

00:03:47.068 --> 00:03:54.067
So you’ll know the hot is working on fix painting

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:59.067
I hope you enjoy this painting project of painting sneakers
