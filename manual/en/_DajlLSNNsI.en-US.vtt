00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.640
In May 2007, 100 years after the opening of the world renowned zoo,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:18.880
 Hagenbeck gave the all-clear for its new recreational attraction: the Tropical World Adventure Aquarium.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:32.240
That finally gives the citizens of Hamburg and the steadily growing number of tourists to the Hanseatic city an aquarium of the highest international standard.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:54.680
This new attraction has given Hamburg, the waterside city and “gateway to the world“, an access to the flora and fauna of the equatorial regions.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:19.360
For the visitor, a truly unique world of adventure opens itself up which is designed as though Carl Hagenbeck himself had done it: with barless open enclosures, right up close to the animals.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:45.680
For the visitor, a truly unique world of adventure opens itself up which is designed as though Carl Hagenbeck himself had done it: with barless open enclosures, right up close to the animals.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:57.680
Visitors can see 14,300 exotic animals in their habitat – on land, in the water and in caves. 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.840
In all a total of 14,300 exotic animals have found a home here in Hamburg.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.480
The round tour leads the visitor through several theme areas: 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.360
the tropical and sub-tropical seas, forests and the world of caves.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.720
This combination is unique in the world.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:00.480
The species-specific and close-to-nature design of the enclosures together with the fascinating presentation of the animals 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.400
results in the illusion for the visitor of finding themselves transported into the middle of their habitat.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:24.400
In the biotopes, animals whose territory would also overlap in the wild share a habitat with each other.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.640
Visitors are struck by the unbelievable multiplicity of colours and forms of the living coral reef.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:04:00.560
The multitude of fresh and salt water pools are home to red lion fish, moray eels, unusual schooling fish and rarities of the aquatic habitat.
