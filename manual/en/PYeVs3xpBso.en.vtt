Now I've shown everything as far as two point,
three point. I'm going to show how to draw

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.990
an asymmetrical box. This is really simple.
Asymmetrical is more of how to show a sense

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.800
of real skill because everything I'm drawing
is kind of small. If you were to actually

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.680
see something that you would draw in real
life you would have, the vanishing points

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.200
would be way, way, way far off the paper.
So most of this stuff you can almost draw

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.769
asymmetrically if you're trying to draw an
accurate box. I'm going to show you how to

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:43.940
draw it. Not going to pick any vanish points
or horizon lint for this one. Just going to

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:55.030
start with a point and a line going straight
up. Asymmetric means that the lines that are

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.870
going away from the paper, like where your
vanishing points would be, are not existent.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.250
They're basically perpendicular. We're going
to take two perpendicular lines going this

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:19.610
way and that way. We'll start with this way
first.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.290
Since we're trying to keep it asymmetrical
so that means this line is basically have

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.090
to go up here so it's a good thing you just
kind of keep it straight and just eye ball

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.659
it and look at it. There's an official way
to do it but it takes a lot of time. This

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.840
way, trust your eyes, your eyes are usually
right. You can measure it if you want up here,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:54.609
but it's easier just to do it this way. Let's
do it on this side. Just like we would with

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:09.369
the parallel line pick the corner of the box.
So now not only like in two point perspective

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.430
are these lines run parallel, these lines
also run parallel. That's how you call an

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.590
asymmetrical.
