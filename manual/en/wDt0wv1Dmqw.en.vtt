00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:10.360

but you can't really call it baking.

bowls A mixing spoon 2.0 c flour 1/4-1/2 c.

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.780
Step 1.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.440
Preheat the oven to 400 F and butter the muffin
tin.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.789
If you have muffin liners lying around, they
make clean up much easier.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.020
Place liners in buttered muffin tins.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.320
Step 2.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.490
With a whisk mix together the flour, sugar,
salt, and baking soda in a large bowl.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.490
Step 3.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.700
In another bowl, whisk the egg, milk, and
melted butter together and add the lemon zest

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.149
to this mixture.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.409
Step 4.

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.529
Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredients
and pour in the wet mixture.

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:27.549
Mix until just combined by folding the ingredients
together with a mixing spoon.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.520
The batter will be lumpy and thick.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.340
Step 5.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.640
Add the blueberries to the batter and gently
fold them in.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.610
If you're using frozen berries, don't let
them defrost or you'll have purple muffins.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.610
Step 6.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.749
Spoon the batter into the muffin tin filling
each compartment about 1/2 to 2/3 full.

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:49.749
Step 7.

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:55.200
Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes, or
until golden brown and a toothpick inserted

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.079
in the middle comes out clean.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.579
Step 8.

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.349
Cool for 10 minutes.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.749
For best results, serve warm.

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:08.220

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.590
