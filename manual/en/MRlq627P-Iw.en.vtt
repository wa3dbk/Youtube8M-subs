00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.320
Are you ready for our pink overload?

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.400
Welcome to Pins and Things. Today we're going to be making this princess pull apart cake.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.940
So I'm going to be making my own frosting today just so that it's stiff enough to hold its shape

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.860
And what you're going to need is rose colored food coloring,

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.909
Powdered sugar, milk, vanilla and butter. You're going to need four and a half cups of powdered sugar

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.960
And now put in your 1/2 cup of butter and mix it. And then add 2 teaspoons of vanilla and 3 tablespoons of milk

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.660
The frosting is starting to firm

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.760
I have Joe, Pink or Rose food coloring. I'm just gonna stick in there

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.849
Perfect! And you're going to need to double the frosting recipe. This you can get in any cake decorating section

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.399
I got it at Walmart. You can get it at a craft store

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.479
You can get it basically at any store that might have cake decorating supplies

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.320
Also, you can just use a regular frosting bag that has the right frosting tip. So you're also going to need

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.200
31 cupcakes. And this is the order that you're going to set them in

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.300
So there's going to be 8 on top, 3, 4,  2 rows of 5 and one row of 6

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.600
So I'm just taking each cupcake and with my frosting decorator starting on the outside

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.950
And going in a circular motion and then just pulling up once I get to the middle

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.200
So that's how you're going to decorate every cupcake.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:51.740
[Music]

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.390
Once you've got it all put together

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.400
you're gonna want to dollop some frosting in between just to give it a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.780
Fuller look and wherever it needs it. Just fill in the gaps. Now, doesn't that look better?

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.169
I have pink sugar sprinkles. This is an optional thing. It gives it a little bit of a glittery

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.839
Look, I like it. So I'm doing it

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.209
I got these by the cake decorating section just where the candles are in the baking section at Walmart

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.899
They are right by the six lits. They're just a tiny bit smaller. They're just

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.989
Candy, so we're just gonna line the whole bottom of this address with these little beads

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.040
Give it a little bit more Flair put a few more of these beads onto

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
Just the middle to give it title in a little bit more. Are you ready to add some bling on a roll?

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.630
This is in the craft section. I have the hardest time finding it, but I'm giving you guys

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.049
The heads up. It's in the craft section at Walmart

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.059
So these are just the width of these three cupcakes and I washed them off and dried them

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.070
So they'll just be able to go right on here right in the middle of these three cupcakes

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.659
And I'm just trimming them to make them the exact right size. This is a little keychain

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.929
I got in the jewelry section at Walmart and I just I'm gonna stick it on there and then whoever wants it afterwards

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.320
I'm sure my one-year-old will just use it on her keys every day when she gets in her car drives places

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.620
If you want

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.920
You can put a little bit of a dollop of frosting

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.760
Underneath it just to give it something to stick to I'm just putting it right on this corner right here

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.519
and then I added a little heart necklace. And last but not least a

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.239
Princess crown and a princess wand from the dollar section at Target.

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.319
I have washed all of these by the way, and I'm just sticking this crown right

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.720
Into the frosting. Just like that.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:45.820
It turned out so amazing. It's so cute. And what little girl wouldn't want a cake like this. I love it so much!
