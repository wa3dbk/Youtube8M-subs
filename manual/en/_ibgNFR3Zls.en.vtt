00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.109
There was something
surprising about this priest.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:14.669
So what was it ?
This is what these people come to find?

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.999
They are in need of a personal contact with Jesus Christ

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.679
and I think that this priest, Jean-Marie Vianney,

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:25.810
truly allowed the presence of Jesus to shine through him.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.279
I believe that the curé d'Ars's vision is,

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.399
one of hope for mankind first and foremost

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.220
because it is with this same vision 
that God Himself sees us

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.960
The Curé d'Ars was truly a pauper

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.180
humanly and intellectually speaking, he was a pauper
He had found it very hard to become a priest,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.120
he did not have a good memory,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.380
He was very nervous.
He was terrified of speaking in public.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.950
These are serious handicaps for a priest...

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.000
But he gave himself to the Lord, 
just as he was.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.500
The Curé d'Ars only did what every other priest does

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.130
He gave catechesis, visited his parishioners

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.000
took the sacraments to the sick,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.700
celebrated Mass and confession like every priest

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.440
but he did it with the conviction
that it was truly God who was acting.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.210
When you begin a career as an
ordained minister,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.430
a new mission

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.270
you think that you're going to develop your talents, 
you want to become a Christian leader

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.540
not for yourself but for the Gospel.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.390
but thinking of someone like Jean-Marie Vianney

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.310
I have learnt that my ministry can be 
much more effective in everyday life

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.510
even more effective
when God works through my weaknesses

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.060
We hear a lot about Jean-Marie Vianney

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.740
spending many hours in the confessional

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.350
and about his way of celebrating the Eucharist

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.900
the Curé d'Ars was a man of God.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.700
But maybe we don't always emphasise enough

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.490
the Curé of Ars was also a "man for the people"

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.490
"I've seen God in a man"
