00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.679
It was very cold tonight. We're getting closer to the 
 south so that's why the nights are getting colder.

00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:55.581
I think it's nice because you don't 
 wake up in a really warm tent.

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:57.495
Yeah, it was cold tonight. I couldn't find my sleeping bag so...

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.391
Did you sleep without a sleeping bag?

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:03.657
Yeah... it was inten(t)se..

00:01:03.657 --> 00:01:07.974
What? No, I'm not cold. I'm just trying to get a bit of Friesch accent on today.

00:01:07.974 --> 00:01:16.528
In about 1,5 hours we'll drive by Alice Springs. And after that... I 
 don't know really.  ...   How should I know?

00:01:16.528 --> 00:01:23.748
It's the third day of the race. Tokai just got in a little bit closer today. So it's time to expand our lead.

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:34.436
We just got a lot of extra energy by powering  up so I think we can manage. Let's go!

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:37.436
I think we just need to drive really fast today..

00:01:52.911 --> 00:01:59.910
It's going well. We're ready to go.
We have a good  lead on Tokai and a lot of energy!

00:02:00.723 --> 00:02:10.720
It was crazy today. There was a lot of wind so we needed 
 to work a little bit harder. But it all went well.

00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:30.273
Today was a great day. Earlier in the race I managed to drive 111km/h. It's a really great experience to drive with that speed and have the view of Australia everywhere around you.

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:38.200
We're almost at Coober Pedy, that's the 2127th km of the race. We just need to push it just a little bit and I think we'll take that trophy home!
