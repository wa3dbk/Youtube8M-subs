00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.980
In this video we will be quickly cover the
suspension seat post options for hard tail

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.570
XC mountain bike riders.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.860
For clarification, this video will not cover
dropper seat posts and not intended for racing,

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.119
riders of full suspension bikes, all mountain,
endureo, or downhill.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.490
Not all XC riders need or want a dropper post
and there are plenty of dropper post compare

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.490
videos out there.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.330
I will also not review any of beach cruiser
linear suspension posts since they function

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.210
at the wrong angle.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.160
As with all other bike parts, weather, temperature
and rider weight should also be taken into

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.180
account before purchasing.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.949
Currently, there are several seat posts that
are appropriate for cross country ridding

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.140
that function at an appropriate angle.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.809
Since weight is a big factor for XC riders,
I decided to start with the heaviest seat

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.340
post and end with the lightest.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.210
At the top of our list:

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.330
SR Suntour NCX SP12
This seat post uses a spring loaded piston

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.510
inside the post.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.130
It weighs 765 grams or 1.69 lbs and has 50mm
of travel

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.560
And the price is typically about $125
This post is recommended for riders that donï¿½t

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.940
want the un dampened spring bounce that occurs
with other posts.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.270
The bottom of the post has an adjustment for
the preload.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.310
The biggest complaint about this post is it
can wear against the saddle rails.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.240
Also, the rail clamps from the sides, instead
of the top and bottom.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.530
Therefore, if you have carbon or other 7x9
rails, they will not fit properly.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.330
It is possible there may be a 7x9 adapter
for this post, but I have not found one.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.210
So, the dampened shock is good, but the rail
rubbing is not a good sign.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.409
With all that said, it is important to note
this post is top heavy.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.700
As a beginner XC rider, when you gain confidence
and speed, the top weight starts becoming

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.710
a hassle when making tight quick turns.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.759
The safe angle of the bike in turns is much
tighter and you run a higher risk of a washout

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.509
or overshooting a turn.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:11.509
Next up

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:16.659
The Cane Creek Thusbuster LT
This seat post has become the recommended

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.659
standard in suspension seat posts for casual
XC riders

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:28.099
it weighs 495 grams or 1.3 lbs and has a huge
75mm of travel

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.719
It is available in various sizes and lengths,
accommodates various rider weights with an

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.799
included set of insert elastomers.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.269
The build quality is excellent as well.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.749
I rode my thudbuster LT for four years, and
it still looks and rides like the day I got

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:46.749
it.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.489
It can also get bouncy in rough terrain if
you do not get off your saddle much.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.709
Also, the extended amount of travel can be
a concern.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.859
At a going price of $130, it is a reliable
post and great for beginners and riders concerned

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.079
about their back side.

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.680
But, it is still very top heavy.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.680
Next on the list is

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.349
The Tamer Pivot Plus XC
This suspension seat post also has a spring

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.670
piston like the suntour.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:19.529
Its weight is just 460 grams or 1.01 pounds
and has 65mm of travel

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:23.239
Like the thudbuster, it does not have dampening
and can get bouncy.

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.109
However, it does have a preload adjustment
like the suntour.

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.659
The price is just $115 and I consider it to
be a slightly lower weight, lower quality

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.220
and price from the thudbuster.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.930
And we also have on the list the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.230
BodyFloat Bike Suspension Carbon Post
This post is rather new and there are not

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.790
many long term reviews on it yet.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.310
It weighs just 428 grams or 0.94 pounds and
has 38mm of travel

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.419
It uses replaceable springs and also has no
dampening.

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:03.339
The price is a whopping $395 and is the most
expensive one available.

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:05.239
And last is the honorable mention of the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:12.209
Niner RDO seat post
This seat post is just 220 grams or 0.46 lbs

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.060
The price is $190, but the travel is just
8mm.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.260
(Less than 1 cm)
So it may take a tiny bite out of the ride,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.600
it is not intended for the casual middle aged
schmuck like me.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.810
So, what suspension seat post am I using now?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.270
Well, like a true lab rat, I am trying something
that may not be the best of ideas for an idiot

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.270
XC rider.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.759
I am testing out a knock-off seat post of
the canyon VCLS 2.0.

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.720
I know the seat post is a knockoff because
I got the 31.6mm size, and the real canyon

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.879
seat post is only available in 27.2mm.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:57.120
With that said, it weighs just 225 grams or
0.5 lbs and cost me just $55.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.449
Since it uses a side rail clamp, I had to
special order a 7x9 flip head kit from Germany

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.580
for it to work with my carbon rail saddles.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.819
The total cost (with the 7x9 rail kit) was
$99.

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.270
So far I love it.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.680
The combined total weight of this post and
my carbon saddle is just 365 grams or 0.8

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.680
lbs.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.970
The travel is only 20mm,
But, I have found that it is enough to ease

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.300
the ride and greatly reduce the top heaviness
of my bike

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.860
Making it MUCH easier to turn quickly with
less kissing the ground.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.130
How long will this knock-off saddle last on
the XC trails?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.220
I have no clue.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.509
I have had to tighten it a couple times on
the first few miles, but for now it is holding

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:43.509
very well.

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.990
How long do you think the knock off seat post
will last?

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.599
Let us know in the comments below.

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.919
Also, if you have a suspension seat post,
tell us your model and experiences.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.199
Thanks and have fun out there.
