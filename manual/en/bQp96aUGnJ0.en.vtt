00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.820
Welcome to the exceptional Harmon home.
I can't wait to show you around this

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.100
spacious, 4-bedroom floor plan. As you
enter the inviting Harmon, you can't help

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.539
but notice the dramatic 2-story foyer,
with its elegant curved staircase. It

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.399
makes quite a statement! Just off the
entry, you'll find generous, formal living

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.030
and dining rooms. And like every room on
the main floor of this home,

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.610
both have impressive 10-foot ceilings.
Now let's walk through the convenient

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.070
butler's pantry to the heart of this
home: the kitchen. Where do I even begin?

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.180
From the beautiful cabinetry, to the
stainless-steel appliances to the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.860
massive center island, this kitchen is a
chef's dream. It even features a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.699
convenient tech center, so you won't have
to travel far to search for new recipes

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.840
online. Right off the kitchen is an
inviting family room with fireplace. Just

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.369
think of all the parties you can throw
with this ideal open layout. Next to the

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.270
family room is a private study that's
perfect for catching up on work, or

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.009
much-needed
relaxation. Now let's head upstairs for a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.780
peek at the private master retreat. Can
you believe the size of this sitting

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.420
room? The optional fireplace and coffee
bar offer the ultimate in comfort and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.939
style. And of course, we can't forget the
deluxe master bathroom with separate

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.009
shower and luxurious soaking tub.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.190
These exciting features are just the
beginning. Additional options include a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.690
cover patio and an extra bedroom in lieu
of the study.We left no stone unturned

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.590
when designing this inviting home. Be
sure to visit the Harmon model in

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.820
person for a closer look.
