00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Hello and welcome to

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.300
the Institute of Applied Corneotherapy

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.700
at KOKO in Leichlingen.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000
Dry skin needs special care and adequate products.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.300
Our dermaviduals - product range

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.400
offers excellent skin care preparations for

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.400
this type of skin.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.500
Together with our model here I'm going

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.600
to demonstrate a care routine for dry skin. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.500
We start with the cleansing of the facial skin,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.400
the neck, and the décolleté.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.700
To cleanse the dryness-prone skin we choose

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.800
our dermaviduals cleansing milk with DMS®.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.700
Our cleansing milk contains derma membrane 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.500
structure which has excellent cleansing

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.400
but also nurturing effects. 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.100
We recommend using a gentle brush to 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.300
apply the cleansing milk onto the dry skin. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.900
Our cleansing milk removes water-soluble

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.600
but also liposoluble impurities.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.900
Use the skin care brush and move 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.800
it evenly over the facial skin.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.300
In a next step thoroughly cleanse the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.300
facial skin with a moist towel. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.900
After the cleansing treatment we proceed

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600
with a recovering peeling product.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.300
Take cotton pads to protect the eye areas.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.300
Our DMS® peeling cream works

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.100
well for the peeling of dry skin.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.200
It gently removes horny scales from the surface

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.200
with the soft rubbing effect of jojoba wax beads

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.700
and is formulated without tensides and emulsifiers. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.800
Gently apply the peeling cream with a brush onto the skin.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.400
Now carefully remove the superficial horny 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.100
scales with a pumice stone.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.500
After about 3 minutes, thoroughly cleanse

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.300
the skin with moist compresses.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.700
Before we proceed to the next step, the toning,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.100
you can now remove the skin impurities

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.800
at this point, if necessary.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.600
We choose our face tonic for the toning treatment. 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.000
The tonic contains D-panthenol which 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.900
improves the absorption of the agents.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.900
That is why a facial toning is an optimal pre-treatment  

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.500
to benefit from the active agents of the following cream pack.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.300
The cucumber extract refreshes and stimulates the skin.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.900
The face tonic remains on the skin.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.000
The cream pack consists of

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.300
3 consecutive applications.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.500
We begin by applying the active agents, 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.600
either separately or all mixed together.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.300
To improve and recover the skin barrier in this  

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.700
specific case, we use the active agent concentrates

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.400
Vitamin A nanoparticles,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.600
Vitamin E nanoparticles

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.100
and Vitamin C liposomes.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.000
Now thoroughly mix these active agents and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.100
apply the blend manually on the skin.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.800
Vitamin A nanoparticles stimulate the recovery of the skin,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.400
Vitamin C liposomes  activate the collagen formation

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.100
and together with Vitamin E

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000
Nanoparticles, they eliminate free radicals.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.900
Vitamin E also supports the formation of new skin cells.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.000
Now, use a brush to apply DMS®-base cream 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.800
High Classic mixed with avocado oil (1:1) over the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.000
active agent blend.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
Avocado oil basically consists of triglycerides and a 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.200
high proportion of plant sterols plus the vitamins

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.100
A, D and E, and can be added to the DMS®-base creams.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.300
After leaving the pack on for about ten minutes, a facial

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.000
massage makes the skin feel soft and satiny.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.800
If necessary, gently dab off any 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.000
residues of the facial pack.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.900
As a finishing treatment, we apply DMS®-base

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.300
cream High Classic Plus on the skin.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.600
The cream contains valuable skin care substances

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.600
like sheabutter, ceramides and squalane

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.900
as well as natural moisturizing factors.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.700
The cream is now handed over to the customer for the home care

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.600
