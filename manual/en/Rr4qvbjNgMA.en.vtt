[Music]

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.730
Glasgow Angling Centre has made its open weekend
one of the highlights of the angling year.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.810
It attracts literally thousands of keen fishers
to this part of Glasgow - and not just Weegies

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.240
(that's Glaswegian for Glaswegians).

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.869
So forget the grand old rivers, the grand
old men pouring whisky into the grand old

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.990
rivers for the official start of the game
fishing season in Scotland.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.440
It actually takes place here in central Glasgow
at the Glasgow Angling Centre.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.080
John Wilson has been the angler's angling
presenter of choice on British TV screens

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.060
for more than 30 years.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.239
He retired last year, so why is he here?

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.129
I have been making TV programmes for the last
25 years and it is nice to see all the people

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.700
they come and they reminisce about which programme
they liked or which one they didn't like and

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.739
it is nice.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.460
It is a constant nice thing to hear really
from people.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.829
What have you got coming up.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.829
I haven't.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.949
I have actually given it all up now.

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:11.700
Like I said I have done 25 years of appearing
before the camera and the pressure of it because

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.510
what people don't realise is that when they
see a series that they are watching this year.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.979
I filmed it last year and while filming I
had to research what I would be filming the

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.020
following year so I have actually being doing
twice that amount of work for all those years

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.000
and I am 70 this year.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.850
It is nice to step down and let somebody else
take it up.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.370
So let's go inside.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.310
And what a place it is.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.990
I have come nearly 150 miles today to come
up to this stall.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.040
We have come every year since this event started
and it is a super place to come.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.540
Really like it.

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.299
From sharks to wiggly shrimps, there is something
for everyone.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.020
It's more like a game fair than a shop.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.740
Scott Mackenzie is a former spey casting champion
and record holder.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.479
Today he designs rods for a living, and shows
them off at fishing events and game fairs

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.460
up and down the country.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.070
This is now the biggest fishing tackle show
in Europe and it is a one stop shop for absolutely

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.310
everything, it really is.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.080
But it is a shop in Glasgow, how can it be
the biggest tackle ...

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080
It is amazing it really is.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.090
You name it they have got it here, they really
have.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.580
They have got all the top brands from right
around the world and the good thing about

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.920
today is because you have representatives
from all the different tackle brands you can

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.330
actually try out all the products and stuff
like that.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.160
So rather than just going to a shop and having
the sales assistant say to you well sir go

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.250
for this one.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.610
Today they have the chance to see myself and
other people who are associated with the brand

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.080
who know in depth things about each individual
product.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.120
Another expert is Davie McPhail, whose fly-tying
and dressing YouTube channel gets millions

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.319
of views a month from keen fly tyers the world
over.

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.090
All these people watch Youtube for some reason.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.720
Why am I here?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.159
Simply because I enjoy tying flies.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.200
Try to pass that on.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.390
At one time I used to work in the Glasgow
Angling Centre so I got to know a lot of people

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.440
over the years.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.370
Fly tying in my view is a great mix, if you
can tie flies and fly fish you will always

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.450
enjoy the sport much more.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.379
He is dressing a streamer fly on a double
hook for us.

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.750
And watch those nimble fingers go.There - the
perfect salmon fly, says Davie.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.730
If you are interested in dressing a fly like
this, click on the link on the screen to watch

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.310
it slowed down and with Davie's expert commentary.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.959
Everyone you stop will tell you stories about
fish they caught and fish that got away, and

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:43.019
some know about almost every fish caught in
the country, like the representative from

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.180
FishPal

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.769
Customers can come and buy fish aids, they
can check their availability, they can check

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.840
water levels, how many fish have been caught
and then when they have actually made a booking

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.901
they can either make a booking on line or
they can actually go and contact the owner

00:04:00.901 --> 00:04:07.040
and then what they can do is make a donation
to the river trust at the end.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.569
So we are helping to raise money to the different
river trusts as well.

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.180
The tackle trade are here in force to enjoy
the surely historic occurrence of Scotsmen

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.100
and women willingly spending money, even on
a sport they love.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.800
One of the things I really enjoy about working
with the Glasgow PL Sports is the staff that

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.170
they have got here.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.050
The guys couldn't do more for you and anything
you need if you ask them they are willing

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.010
to help and I think that reflects through
to the customers and as you can see it is

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.450
unique premises in the UK and it has got the
capacity to be able to do something like this.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.950
Paul Devlin started what is now the Glasgow
Angling Centre on a wheelbarrow in a Glasgow

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.280
market.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.570
It's a business success story that now employs
ninety people - and it is born from a passion

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.200
for the sport.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.360
It is an open weekend, spring open weekend.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.660
It celebrates the start of the fishing season
and it is good to get all anglers and all

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.770
the personalities together at the one time.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.670
We are in the centre of Glasgow here.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.030
Is this the Glaswegian equivalent of pouring
a bottle of malt into the river Tay?

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.660
Yes, from a retailer's point of view yes.

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.950
