Now that we have our starter bucket we basically
got enough yeast in here to do about a barrel

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.370
of wine. We’ve got 2 big 5 gallons of grapes
so this is really going to get going. That

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:24.590
is why it boils. Now this is what we have
to do is get this prepped for tomorrow when

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:35.360
this is going in there. We are going to put
and we are going to have Austin open it up.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.620
This is the sulfite that we use and we are
only using 2 teaspoons; that is virtually

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.100
nothing but it is enough to neutralize the
yeast. So pour that around there, Austin?

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:00.190
Next we are going to put in the super food.
Okay. There are a couple of chunks in here;

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.110
I’m just trying to break down. We are going
to put in the super food. Actually we need

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:11.789
an adult to do this because this has some
nasty odors so don’t want the kids to. Just

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:36.850
spread it around evenly. This

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:51.270
is the super food. This is to help the yeast....It
binds to the sugar. This is all natural. Where

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:03.249
do you buy these things? You buy them at a
company that actually makes chemistry for

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.539
wine making.
