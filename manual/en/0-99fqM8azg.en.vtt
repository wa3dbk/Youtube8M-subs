00:00:00.328 --> 00:00:03.046
- Okay, so we are here
with one of the booths

00:00:03.046 --> 00:00:05.227
that I think is most
important and most cool.

00:00:05.227 --> 00:00:06.411
This is Rajesh,

00:00:06.411 --> 00:00:08.919
and he is gonna tell us
about UNICEF Kid Power

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:10.220
and Force for Change.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.937
So, the quick and dirty elevator pitch,

00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:13.587
what is this?

00:00:13.587 --> 00:00:15.445
- Alright, so, thanks Holly.

00:00:15.445 --> 00:00:17.487
So, Force for Change is
a charitable initiative

00:00:17.487 --> 00:00:20.204
from Disney and Lucasfilms
that's focused on finding

00:00:20.204 --> 00:00:22.758
creative solutions to some of
the world's toughest problems.

00:00:22.758 --> 00:00:26.356
And, most importantly,
empowering kids and young people

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:27.960
to be forces for change

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.329
because they can be and they are.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:33.950
And UNICEF Kid Power is a
movement that's powered by kids

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.738
to end global malnutrition.

00:00:35.738 --> 00:00:36.783
- Okay, kids have energy,

00:00:36.783 --> 00:00:38.036
this seems like a smart plan.

00:00:38.036 --> 00:00:39.244
- Yes (laughter)

00:00:39.244 --> 00:00:40.241
You know what?

00:00:40.241 --> 00:00:42.262
Kids have energy and you
know what else they have?

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:43.656
They have the power to do good.

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:46.557
If you give a kid the
chance to help another kid,

00:00:46.557 --> 00:00:47.535
they'll take it.

00:00:47.535 --> 00:00:48.833
And that's what Kid Power's all about.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:49.831
- Yes, I love it.

00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:51.945
So, what happens at the booth?

00:00:51.945 --> 00:00:53.361
How are kids doing it here at the show?

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:55.381
- Alright, so kids come in,

00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.657
they've got to pick whether they want

00:00:56.657 --> 00:00:58.167
to be light side or dark side.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:01.372
As you can see, the dark
side's winning right now.

00:01:01.372 --> 00:01:03.067
I don't know what that
says about the world.

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:05.271
But, kids pick which
team they want to be on,

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:07.269
they get a Kid Power band,

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:09.358
which is the world's
first wearable for good.

00:01:09.358 --> 00:01:12.308
And, this band tracks their movement,

00:01:12.308 --> 00:01:14.537
so the more they move
the more steps they take.

00:01:14.537 --> 00:01:15.210
- Right.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.534
- They earn Kid Power points.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:17.926
And every point they earn

00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:19.761
turns into a packet of therapeutic food

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.154
for a malnurished child.

00:01:21.154 --> 00:01:22.826
So, the story to kids and grown-ups is

00:01:22.826 --> 00:01:25.495
hey listen, get active, save lives.

00:01:25.495 --> 00:01:26.564
And you know what' s more fun

00:01:26.564 --> 00:01:29.792
is seeing kids and grown-ups in costume

00:01:29.792 --> 00:01:31.184
run around our space chase.

00:01:31.184 --> 00:01:34.993
So you start here and
you jump into hyperspace,

00:01:34.993 --> 00:01:36.781
and you run, run, run, run, run,

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:38.336
then you go around the moon a few times,

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.423
then you duck in and out of
the tie fighter rigs there,

00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:44.722
and then you gotta make it
through an asteroid belt,

00:01:44.722 --> 00:01:47.298
which is not easy,
especially for the grown-ups.

00:01:47.298 --> 00:01:49.295
And then you've got to
hop over an asteroid field

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:51.664
and end back, jump back into hyperdrive,

00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:53.079
come home.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:53.892
- I love it.

00:01:53.892 --> 00:01:56.586
And through all of that, people
are actually getting fed.

00:01:56.586 --> 00:01:57.538
- Yes.

00:01:57.538 --> 00:01:58.607
- Nourishment is happening.

00:01:58.607 --> 00:01:59.256
- Yes.

00:01:59.256 --> 00:01:59.695
- This is the best thing.

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:00.905
- Thank you.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:01.904
- I could not love this initiative more,

00:02:01.904 --> 00:02:03.552
it's so smart and just such a great way

00:02:03.552 --> 00:02:06.872
to marry people's love of
a really beloved franchise

00:02:06.872 --> 00:02:09.148
with actual benefit to the world.

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:09.845
I love it.

00:02:09.845 --> 00:02:10.517
- Thank you.

00:02:10.517 --> 00:02:11.122
- Rajesh, thank you so much.

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:11.817
- I'm glad you do,

00:02:11.817 --> 00:02:13.095
and I hope you'll join us.

00:02:13.095 --> 00:02:13.699
- I'm on it.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.348
I'm running it.

00:02:14.348 --> 00:02:15.324
- And go save some lives.

00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:16.764
- Band me up and I'm doing it.

00:02:16.764 --> 00:02:21.764
(slow rhythmic music)

00:02:55.004 --> 00:02:56.811
Cardio.

00:02:58.151 --> 00:03:01.460
R-2, who's your favorite
Star Wars character?

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.153
- ^(R-2 beeping)

00:03:04.153 --> 00:03:05.849
- I mean, obvious answer, right?

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:07.288
So I have to ask you next,

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:09.657
like, if you could live anywhere
in the Star Wars universe,

00:03:09.657 --> 00:03:11.560
where would it be?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.954
- (R-2 beeping)

00:03:12.954 --> 00:03:16.477
- Right, I hear you, no
Dagobah, I understand.
