00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.340
I think I'm slowly getting it - by 'it' I
mean Llamasoft, and by 'get' I mean I'm not

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.430
sure if I'm just losing my mind or if their
games have simply grown on me like some sort

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.570
of hyper-color retro-tastic mold.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.070
Their latest arcade focused title Caverns
of Minos may owe its inspirations to titles

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.249
like Caverns of Mars, but in typical style
the game will either inspire joy thanks to

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.390
its many self-referencing gags and over-the-top
mash-up of gameplay, or will simply feel like

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.600
an unholy mess; in other words, it's Llamasoft
doing what they do best.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.309
Amongst the terrifyingly eye-watering hyper-color
pixelated visuals lies a game with roots that

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.379
tendril along some of Atari's greatest including
Asteroids.

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.219
Much like its inspirational title, your aim
is to plunge in to the depths of a hostile

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.820
pit, avoiding or decimating enemies in turn;
collecting an object at the bottom (be it

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.219
a piece of cheese, an ox, or something even
more abstract); and then attempting to reach

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.140
the mother-sheep at the start before running
out of fuel or shields.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.030
These last two can be replenished by collecting
minotaurs and are often best saved for the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.100
trip up as you encounter far more resistance
from the enemies that range from bouncing

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.890
asteroids to Space Invader-esque aliens and
minotaurs cosplaying as robots from Robotron:

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.100
2084.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.110
Thankfully the controls provide a surprising
amount of fidelity, with the thrust and swipe-to-move

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.049
controls also being paired with tilt-based
aiming for the bullets spewing forth from

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.110
your ship.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.810
Should the challenge prove to be too simple
you can kick things up a notch by selecting

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.680
different vehicles, with the last being reserved
for an Asteroids-ship with insane firepower

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.200
and game-appropriate controls.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.890
Caverns of Minos is a cacophony of styles,
themes and inspirations bundled in Llamasoft's

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.340
typically childish sensibilities ('fart' sounds
for firing enemies are not uncommon).

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.840
Despite its rough appearance, the game features
a solid core of fast and furiously challenging

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:04.170
gameplay, though your ability to stand playing
the game will depend on whether you 'get it'

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.759
as well.
