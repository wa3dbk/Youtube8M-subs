Hi, this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:08.830
On this episode let's take a look at some
power user tips for the new Mac Photos App.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.580
So my first tip is to turn on the sidebar.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.180
People get lost in this interface and can't
quite figure out how to navigate around.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.590
It is much easier if you do View, Show Sidebar.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.540
You've got a sidebar that looks a lot like
iPhoto.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.310
You can quickly and easily jump to Albums,
jump to Photos, and see other things as well

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
as drag and drop.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.579
You can drag and drop a photo very easily
here with the sidebar turned on.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.739
When viewing photos, your entire photo library,
the top level is Years.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.550
You can go down into Collections and then
Moments.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.960
Now the top two levels, Collections and Years,
you can click and hold over a strip of photos

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.579
and you will see an enlarged version of that
photo and can easily find the one you want,

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.629
release, and it will jump right to that photo.

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:03.159
So it makes it very easy to find a photo even
though you might be viewing tons of them and

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.159
jump right to it.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.620
Now a lot of people mistakingly thought that
Photos doesn't have titles for photos like

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.750
iPhoto did.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.750
That is wrong.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.010
If you go down into Moments where you can
see individual photos, or even jump to an

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.320
Album where you see them in a similar view,
you can see the titles by going to View, Metadata,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.570
and turn on Titles.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.390
There is even a keyboard shortcut for that.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.860
Then you can see titles for different things.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.910
So, for instance, here is a title there.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.590
I can turn off with the keyboard shortcut
titles and you can see how it goes away.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.680
If I want to add a title I simply click right
underneath it where it says untitled and I

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.760
can add it or I can edit the one that is there.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.230
So it is very easy to see and edit titles
in Photo.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.880
It is just not on by default.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.640
You just have to turn it on.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.210
Now what happens when you delete a photo?

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.770
Say I'm going to select this photo here.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.610
I'm going to hit the delete key on my keyboard
and delete and you can see because it is syncing

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030
with iCloud that it says it is deleted from
all devices.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.500
You do have a trashcan.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.670
You are not using your Mac's trashcan because
it is now using iCloud.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.770
It is going to sync to all your different
devices so it wouldn't be right to put it

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.370
in your local trashcan.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.070
It is in an iCloud trashcan.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.429
You can view it by going to File, Show Recently
Deleted.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.159
It brings up kind of a special album here
which shows you recently deleted photos.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.560
You can see that I've got several in here
spanning some time.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.349
It tells me how many days are left before
they are permanently deleted.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.560
So the one I've just deleted here in thirty
days it will be permanently gone and I don't

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.629
have to do anything else.

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.080
I've got some older ones here that will be
deleted pretty soon.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.920
If I want something to go away now, permanently,
I can select it here in the recently deleted

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.260
view and I can hit Delete One Item.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.950
Now it gives me a warning and now it is gone
for good.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.810
So I've pushed it forward instead of waiting
that many days.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.099
I can also, of course, select one here and
hit Recover and it will undelete it and put

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.700
it back where it came from.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.049
Now Photos doesn't really have that many sorting
options but you can manually sort an Album.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.019
So I've created an album here called test
album.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.340
I've put some photos in it.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.269
I go to View and I've selected Keep Sorted
By Date.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.819
So there is nothing else I can do.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.670
They will be sorted from the earliest to the
latest.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.100
If I uncheck that now you can see it goes
to a manually sorted order and I can drag

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.480
and drop as much as I want and this will be
the order they appear in.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.959
It will remember this even if I say Sorted
By Date and then I turn off Sorted By Date

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.209
it goes back to my manual sorting.

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.299
So you can't sort by titles or anything like
that but you can kind of create your own order

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.580
if you plan on doing a slide show or you want
some special photos available on your iPhone

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.950
say or Apple Watch, you can sort them the
way you want.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.689
Now if you need to adjust the date on a photo
you can.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.730
You can select a photo, go to Image, Adjust
Date and Time.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.920
This will allow me then to go take from an
original and make an adjusted date and time,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.919
change the time zone, for this photo here.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.480
So it is nice to be able to do.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.319
What would be nicer is if you could also change
the GPS information but it doesn't appear

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.159
to be a way to do that currently in Photos.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.879
Hopefully that will be added in a future update.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.669
One of the nice things about editing photos
in the Photos app is that you can apply all

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:15.700
sorts of different changes to the photo and
no matter how much you do you can always get

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.150
back to the original.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.450
So I'm just going to do a ton of different
things to this photo and now I'm going to

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.480
click Done.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.750
You may think that well now the changes are
permanently applied.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.570
I can go to Edit and even though it is a new
editing session I can hit Revert to Original

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.530
and it takes me all the way back to the original
photo.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.540
So that is always available to you.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.800
Now how about exporting from Photos.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.110
Well, as you might guess you can Drag and
Drop.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.300
So I can take this photo here and drag it
to the desktop or to a Finder folder and it

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.480
exports a jpeg.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.640
But I can also do some other things.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.710
I can go to File, Export.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.570
I've got my standard export option which is
what I basically just did.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.370
But I can also export the unmodified original.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.340
This will hold the original out of the library
and allow me to save it.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.110
So, for instance, if you are using raw format
for your photography you can get raw image

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.650
out that way if you need it for something.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.210
If you want to share a bunch of pictures with
somebody online and say you want to make a

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.510
slideshow and put it on youtube you can export
a slideshow as a video.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.120
I've selected a test album here.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.420
I'm then going to create a slideshow and it
will create this project here called test

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.420
album.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:28.960
It's got the slideshow here.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.050
I can do all the things I want to adjust for
the slideshow like timing and music and things

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.050
like that.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.420
But I can also hit the export button here
at the top and I can choose as a format a

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.770
video format, save out a video that will include
the music and everything like that.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.490
Once I have that video I can then upload that
to youtube via the youtube web interface or

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.980
any video service that I want.

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.870
Another cool editing thing to do is that you
can go into a photo and say apply a bunch

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.110
of filters or maybe do some adjustments.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:11.370
So let's do some lighting adjustments here
and then a filter adjustment, and hit Done.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:18.210
Now I can go in and edit it again because
I like how these filters look and copy those

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.020
adjustments.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:27.550
Then I can go to another photo and apply the
same adjustments when I'm in Edit mode.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.110
It will give me the same result.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.610
So it is easy to take a set of changes that
you made and apply them on another image.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.670
So here is one last tip.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.390
You can get info on a photo.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.480
You can select it and bring up the Info Window,
and Command I is info, and you can see basic

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.910
stuff about like the camera settings and things
like that.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.910
Also you add a description.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.280
You can't really view that anywhere else except
for here in the info window.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.700
You can also add keywords.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:07.070
So I can add say Denver and then skyline to
this and you can view these keywords if you

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.500
go to View, Metadata, and turn on Keywords.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.130
You can see a little keyword tag there and
I can click it and I can see Denver and skyline

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.570
there in the keywords and of course these
are searchable.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:24.480
So now if I were to search for skyline I would
see that it would come up with one result

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.820
there because I have tagged it.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.400
So you can use Keyword tags.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.650
You even have a window here where you can
bring up a Keyword manager that shows you

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.950
the keywords you've added and some basic ones
and you can edit them as well.

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:41.340
So this can come in very useful for tagging
your photos for quick and easy searches.
