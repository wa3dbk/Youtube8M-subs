00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Light is mission-critical for mankind.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Light is the most important 
thing in nature that we have. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
If there will be no Sun on this 
planet in 20 minutes from now,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
there will be no life anymore. innovation 
doesn't happen in a vacuum anymore, it's

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
something you do together.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
it's really important to team up with designers,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
specifiers, engineers, architect specialists

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in sciences and put together 
a team that collaboratively

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
works on the same objectives. 
Open innovation is

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
all about what you do with all these kinds of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
game-changing technologies. 
I think that makes it so relevant

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to collaborate and on top of 
that it makes it so much fun

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.500
because

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
we learn every day from the teamwork.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.500
You know, with the lighting designers, 
with the architects, we take the architects

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
with us in the lab and in the 
Application Centers that we have.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.500
They see people who know a lot about 
lights, but about the lights that they’ve

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.500
already made, not about the products of the future

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000
that we can co-create together with those 
designers and architects. It's a very

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
personal question of course to talk 
about inspiration because we all

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
experience it differently
 
22
00:01:29,000 --&gt; 00:01:34,000
and I think roughly speaking there are designers 
who are inspired by the world around them

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and there are designers 
who are much inspired by

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the world inside them. But I'm inspired 
by what people do in the light that I make

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
how they work, how they live, how 
they relax, how they get excited

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
how it can captivate them in a story

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
in the theater, how it can tell 
them about the artwork in the museum.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The design function in Philips Lighting really

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
works a great deal with 
people research and really

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
observing behavior and 
the psychology of people.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Everyday normal people in the city, at work,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in the hospital, we always start to 
design process by looking at them and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
understanding what motivates them. Lights

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
have always been so important in architecture. 
If you would be an architecture student

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you will mostly study light, you would study 
how light shapes the spaces, how the shadows

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
change over the course of the day, 
how people would move through

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
space being attracted by light. it 
was a main component of architecture

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then came electric lighting and 
it kind of functionalized everything.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Suddenly we made light just for functionality

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because we could turn it on and we could turn 
it off now with the latest technologies.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The LED's enable us to embed lighting in 
building materials for example, we can do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.000
things that we could never do. That the architecture 
student of the 90s century could only dream of that he could

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
never make it real and we can make it real.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Cities today need more campfires because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
a campfire is a pure form 
of light. It is beautiful

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
there's no story about the light. 
It’s just the light of the fire.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Around it, the stories come and the 
connections and you make friends and you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
make music and you eat something. 
So besides that or

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
maybe, moreover, light is something 
so beautiful and expressive,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it's an art and a science 
all at the same time.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
There is nothing like light in the world 
and that's why I'm so passionate about it.
