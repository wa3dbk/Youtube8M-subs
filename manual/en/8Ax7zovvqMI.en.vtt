00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.390
Hi I'm Seth Maxomalus and I'm an artist and
illustrator and I am working on detail. Again

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.790
I am pulling the brush through the ink and
turning it and, and pointing out the brush,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:23.891
pointing out the brush to a fine point. Now
for this just think of a when using the brush

00:00:23.891 --> 00:00:30.140
we are doing a series of tiny little lines
and kind of connecting your lines and making

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:40.340
like the smallest possible line and pulling
it and pulling it and using my eye as well

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.360
as my hand when I am pulling the brush because
my eye is telling me when to pull it up because

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.810
when you pull the brush up you get a finer
line and a finer point. So now I have did

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.350
that more or less bizarre oval of her eye
and not the perfect oval eye as I drew before

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:08.920
as a map to draw her eye. Now like this is
like all going into details but not just a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:17.100
circle for an eye but I am going to add a
line below it to define her cheek bone a little

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.120
bit and then above it here I don't know if
you can see this or not but hopefully you

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.960
can as an eyelash. When I use the brush I
pull it up and that will give me a line with

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:48.320
a little point to the end and it is like a
little sweeping movement.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.560
Now here this is where the illusion of shadow
comes in too, shadow of the eye because remember

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:01.439
even though you are just laying down black
all you are doing is creating an illusion,

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:11.810
an illusion. Now we are going to pretend she
has a lot of eye makeup on and the same with

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:20.959
this eye, she has some more of her eyelashes
slightly, lightly penciled and drawn here,

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:37.410
pull the brush here and here, down below here
and add a bunch of black in so that it defines

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:47.180
her face. She is more or less coming to life
by adding all this detail that's pulling her

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.300
deeper in the picture to life.
