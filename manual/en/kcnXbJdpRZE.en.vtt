00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:09.430
So to start with the honey, buttermilk, bran
waffles, I'm adding a special healthy ingredient.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.080
Some flax seed which I just buy in bulk at
the health food store and then I'm going to

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.480
grind it myself, because, although flax seed,
they're extremely high in omega three fatty

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.930
acids, they're not absorbable to the body
and will pass right through your digestive

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:42.929
system unabsorbed if you don't grind them
up. So, I'm going to.

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.499
They're not completely into a meal, they're
just a little bit finer than they were before,

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:57.859
broken up, and that's all you need. So I'm
gonna take three quarters of a cup of white,

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:11.000
all purpose flour.
Add to that three quarters of a cup, equal

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:26.890
parts, of whole wheat flour.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:38.810
To that we're gonna add half a cup of wheat
bran. Up the fiber a little bit. Then we want

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:56.001
two teaspoons of baking powder
and a quarter teaspoon of baking soda. Add

00:01:56.001 --> 00:02:20.319
to that a pinch of salt.
Sift that together to get all the lumps out.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.269
Okay, the lumps have completely come out,
so we can just shake in the rest of the bran

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:40.709
like that. And then we're gonna spoon a few
tablespoons of flax. That is all we need to

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:47.010
do as far as our dry ingredients. So let's
begin on the wet ingredients.
