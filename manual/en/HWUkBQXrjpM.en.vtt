00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:21.260
I was sitting with my children listening to
the speaker and taking care of them some people

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.460
came in line and stood in front of me so I
couldn't see and they just stood there blocking

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:39.360
my view and stood there in front of my family
with signs about their agenda which is they

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.471
were the gay movement they were with signs
in front of me blocking me me and my family.

00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:50.649
Did you ask them to move?

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:57.120
I did and they would not I even asked them
to turn around so I could feed my baby and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.309
two of them did the other ones didn't.

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.610
How many were there?

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.820
I would say eight, eight. And it was me and
my three children my husband was up front.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.770
So you came here to watch the traditional
marriage rally?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.220
Yes I did and they were here to make sure
that I wasn't gonna enjoy.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.380
So how did you feel?

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:34.600
I was scared in the beginning and after a
while I figured they were their goal was intimidating

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.090
my family me and my three children small children
five and under which I think they did the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:49.090
job but I felt that was more than just standing
there this is what they are doing to our traditional

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.854
families is intimidating so we can back off
and I wasn't going to back off.

00:01:52.854 --> 00:01:54.410
And you stayed your ground.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:04.790
For my family this is my family and you know
we need to stand for our families and we are

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.710
not going to back off.
