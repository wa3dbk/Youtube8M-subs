00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.720
What's important to teach people,
is not capitalism, but markets, free markets.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.720
And that's important, because right now on
the campuses is the last hold out of socialist

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.410
thought. The world at large, everybody in
the world, not only in the United States,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.300
but in all countries around the world, ever
since, especially since the fall of the Berlin

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.480
Wall, the climate of opinion in general is
that capitalism is a success, socialism is

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.190
a failure. But you would never learn that
on most college campuses. On most college

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.190
campuses it is the last resort of the people
of the socialist sentiment that was so dominate

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.050
twenty thirty years ago. It's very, just because,
of socialist pablum that's distributed on

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:01.549
campuses, that it's important to counter that,
by making young people recognize that it is

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.010
pablum, making them recognize that wherever
it's been tried, it's been a failure. You

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.010
know it's an interesting, there is no country
that ever achieved reasonable growth or development

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.320
which hasn't relied primarily on free markets
and private enterprise. Russia or Soviet Russia

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.350
was supposedly the great experiment that was
going to demonstrate the virtues of it. But

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.350
it's not only Soviet Russia, countries like
Britain, Germany, France, the socialist measures

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.770
they have adopted have been a failure and
you've had a recognition of that, privatization

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.210
has been a major activity in many countries.
So it's important that young people know the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.460
truth. It's important that everybody know
the truth. It's not something that should

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.190
be restricted to the young. What I would like
young people to know about markets is that

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.190
markets work and they work best if they are
freest. The way to have a free market economy

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:18.239
is to get government out of the picture 
to eliminate regulations, to eliminate control

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.779
over prices.
