00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.140
My name is doctor Endre Sos, and I will tell
you shortly how to express a dog's anal glands.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:14.400
Expressing the anal glands of dogs can be
quite discussing, and it's not really favored

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:23.660
by all dog owners, but if you're giving the
bath for your dog and if you are wearing rubber

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:34.530
gloves, it's not difficult. You can easily
learn it. Anal glands are bilateral small

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:44.609
organs which can be found on the two sides
of the anus of the dog and the usually the

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:53.149
direction or it can be found, it's at about
four and eight o'clock. So, the size is not

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:02.800
so big. It's about a cubic in size. If you
gently try to palpate them usually it's not

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:13.750
difficult to feel. You can use a tub and if
you also wear the rubber gloves, you can just

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:24.950
avoid the very, very, unpleasant odor and
the very unpleasant looking content of the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:36.500
glands. The color is usually brownish or greenish,
and you have to use your index finger and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.539
your thumb and gently press it from outside
after the spotting, exact spotting of the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:54.310
location of the glands. What is also very
important if you can see that, that the content

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:03.670
is not brownish or greenish but contents pass
blood or is very thick, always consult your

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:15.810
veterinarian because the gland and the inflammation
are another problem which needs proper treatment.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.629
The regular expressing of the anal gland is
important because it can prevent certain diseases

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:33.150
if the anal gland is inflamated or there is
a impaction in the gland, it can cause even

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:40.930
skin conditions which are very, very unpleasant
for the dog. So, the regular checkup and the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.010
regular expressing is crucial.
