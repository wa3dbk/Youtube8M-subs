On the 21st of July 1969

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.040
The world watched in wonder as the United
States of America

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.860

the irst man on the moon

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.050
However, unknown to the world a team from
Cornwall

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.940
lead by Captain Malcolm Pascoe

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.590
achieved this goal a mere seven months before

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.500
Not wanting to make a fuss their success went
completly unnoticed

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.239
That is until now

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.850
