bjbj Bedtime stories for Kids Is it bedtime
already and you re looking for a story to

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.549
read to the kids? Well, here s a good one
I can recommend: Loafy Lion &amp; The Accidental

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:07.279
Dinosaur:, that s just been upload to Amazon
s Kindle store, which of course means that

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:14.100
you can download it to your Kindle, your PC
or even your Smartphone I would like to introduce

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:23.609
you to 'Loafy,' the friendliest lion in the
whole of Africa. All his animal friends love

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.169
Loafy, and I hope that you will too. Loafy
the Lion is back for another adventure, along

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.600
with some familiar characters; Fee' Loafy's
mate and Marty the Martial Eagle, also meet

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.600
Rusty the lion cub, and Danny the dinosaur.
"What," I hear you cry, "A dinosaur!" I know,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.600
hard to believe. Even Loafy didn't believe
it at first, that was until he had to race

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.670
to rescue Danny from a group of mad, bad scientists.
Just to get you in the mood, I want to read

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.680
you a small part of the story: Loafy Lion
was hot, but he likes it that way, which is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.379
handy because Loafy happens to live in the
eastern plains of Africa, near the foothills

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.129
of the Drakensburg mountains; a very hot place
indeed but of course, if you have been following

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.390
Loafy s adventures, you know this already
do pay attention at the back! You might then

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.190
also know that Loafy is the friendliest lion
in all of Africa, loved by all the lions in

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.650
his pride and admired by all other animals
on the African plains. Although Loafy has

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.250
a heart of gold, he also has a roar which
can instill fear into any foe, be they man

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.460
or beast. Indeed, such a roar would surely
win an Olympic Gold for roaring, if there

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.049
were such an event. What you maybe don t know
is that Loafy, along with his lioness mate

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.450
Fee (short for Feline) has a lion cub called
Rusty. Now Rusty, who is a bit of a rascal,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.119
was named after his rust coloured fur coat
which allows him to blend in easily with the

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.500
hot sun-drenched boulders, the Bushwillow
shrub and other trees of the African plains.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.850
Such camouflage means that, to the casual
observer, if Rusty keeps quite still he is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.890
as invisible as a cloaked Klingon bird of
prey. And then, quite out of the blue he will

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.340
spring at you with a playful pounce, scaring
you right out of your fur every time. On this

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.950
beautiful hot day, under a blue azure cloudless
sky, Rusty was creeping up on his dad, Loafy,

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.890
all ready to pounce. He had planned his maneuver
carefully, approaching Loafy in a pincer movement

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.260
and with the sun behind him like all good
ace fighter pilots but stealthily ever so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.370
stealthily. Now it is a well known fact amongst
Loafy s closest friends, that he is as deaf

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.150
as a post. But strangely, Loafy s eyesight
is sharper than that of an eagle. Loafy can

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.560
spot trouble a mile off, so spying Rusty s
attempts to bounce him, out of a half closed

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:48.480
sleepy eye as he dozed in the hot sun, was
child s play to Loafy. Just as Rusty pounced,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:55.379
with a rather high pitched grraagh Loafy lazily
hoisted an enormous hairy paw and swatted

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.650
Rusty out of the air, mid-leap, as easily
as you might swat a fly. Rusty hit the hard

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.909
flat-stone boulder where Loafy was relaxing,
and tumbled to a halt, nose-down on Loafy

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:13.959
s open newspaper The Daily Roar. Stunned for
a second; Rusty s senses swirled as he looked

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.060
at the headlines. His vision cleared and Rusty
read the words, Large unexplained footprint

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.569
found near foothills. Armed scientists sent
to investigate. Loafy s smile, at his latest

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.069
victory in Rusty s game of Bounce Wars , quickly
turned to a look of concern, as he saw Rusty

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.940
looking so still and quiet. Are you OK Rusty...or
are you just playing dead? growled Loafy.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.709
Rusty suddenly leaped up, and with a huge
grin quickly bounced Loafy as payback for

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:49.750
the paw swipe and scampered off into the scrub
bush, with a parting comment over his shoulder,

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:56.110
Yes, I m OK Dad got you anyway. And as he
disappeared from view, Loafy faintly heard,

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.549
Gotta go, see you at dinner. Be back before
sundown, Loafy growled after him, before sleepily

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.629
dropping his head onto his hairy front paws
once more to resume his snooze, thinking,

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:17.830
that cub has got far too much energy. Well,
