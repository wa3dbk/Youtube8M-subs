00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.340
It's often said that humans have stopped evolving,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.600
but is this true?

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.080
 The fact is, we're still evolving today. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.280
Well, sort of 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.860
and we'll continue to do so into the future. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.140
It's built into the basic fabric of our biology. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.080
Evolution will continue because of the way our DNA copies itself 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.380
and mixes itself up when sperm and
eggs are made. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.460
Between generations, genes shuffle about at random

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.240
making each generation genetically unique. 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.880
Charles Darwin's idea of natural selection is based on the fact that most organisms, including people, 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.700
show physical and genetic variation. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.780
Change the environment just a little bit, and some individuals will be better adapted because of their DNA. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.860
They'll have more offspring who'll survive to pass on their DNA to future generations. 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.420
Currently, we're changing the environment a lot. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.300
Global warming

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.060
rising pollution levels

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.400
the overuse of antibiotics

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.520
pesticide resistance in insects

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.560
a lifestyle based on little physical activity and focused on technology 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.240
and even delaying having children until our thirties or forties.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.880
Any one of these might lead to pressures that accelerate evolution in humans. 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.480
Changes could be in the genes for our immune system

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.760
our sweat glands 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.020
the number of disease causing genes carried in sperm cells

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.140
even others affecting our skeleton, muscles and nervous system. 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.840
Sound far fetched? 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.740
Well actually, we have a pretty good case study from recent evolution. 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.380
The invention of agriculture around ten thousand years ago led to dramatic shifts in our genes. 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.120
For those of us with farming ancestors, scientists reckon that more than 70% of our genetic variation 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:22.500
and about 90% of diseased genes, arose in the last five to ten thousand years. 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.200
That's a staggering amount of genetic evolution in a very short time. 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.180
And this was all the result of a remarkable shift in lifestyle. 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.800
The end of hunting and gathering and the beginning of agriculture.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.960
We went from just a few million people worldwide ten thousand years ago

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.880
to around seven billion people today, all crowded on a tiny planet.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:54.340
Some geneticists even think the amazing number of rare gene mutations built up over the last five thousand years 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.100
could trigger a whole new species of human to evolve. 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.460
But could we see large, physically obvious changes in the future?

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.580
 Like those we see between species?

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.000
It's even predicted that we humans will shape our own evolutionary destinies in the future

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.680
engineering our bodies through genetic technology to live for hundreds of years 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.060
or to be perfectly built for a life in space. 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.900
The challenge for us all is to make sure no person or population gets left behind 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.900
because they don't have the cash to enjoy the benefits of genetic engineering or new medical technologies. 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.800
Evolution will continue but unlike any time in the past, we now understand its causes 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.460
and can deal with the consequences for the benefit of all humankind.
