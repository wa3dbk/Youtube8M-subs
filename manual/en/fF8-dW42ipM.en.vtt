bjbjLULU Manual restraint is required for
most medical procedures in the companion parrot.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.189
Before handling the bird, obtain a thorough
history to identify and avoid potential problems.

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.470
Carefully observe the bird at a distance for
signs of illness. If the patient is severely

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.460
debilitated or dyspneic, consider supplemental
heat and/or oxygen before handling. Discuss

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.329
with owners the inherent risk of handling
the critically ill bird. Parrot handling also

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.010
carries potential risk for medical staff since
even friendly birds may bite if they feel

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.699
threatened. Evaluate the exam room for any
potential safety issues. Make sure all doors

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.489
and windows are secure. Pull down window blinds
to cover glass. Minimize potential hiding

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.810
places, and ensure electrical cords are not
exposed. Reduce activity around the bird,

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.410
and if the cage must be moved, do so carefully
to avoid jostling the patient. Gather all

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.890
equipment that may be needed, including a
towel or paper towel of appropriate size.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.880
Inspect cloth for fraying as threads can catch
on feet or other body parts. Approach the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.440
parrot calmly and quietly. Keep the towel
out of sight until you are ready to begin.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.700
Some birds handled roughly in the past, will
react as soon as they see the towel. Slowly

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.890
introduce your hand (with or without a towel
covering it), and encourage the bird to step

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.690
up. Never remove a bird from the owner s arm
or shoulder. Gently hold the second and third

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:02.720
digits of the foot, and slowly move the bird
into your chest, being sure to keep the parrot

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:09.289
s beak beneath your chin. Bring a towel towards
the bird and drape the cloth over the bird

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.860
s back and/or head. For small, flighted birds
or for larger parrots that won t come out

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.620
of their enclosure, slowly remove any items
that might hinder capture or pose a risk to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.700
the patient. Then gently yet firmly use a
towel to secure the bird in a corner or against

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.280
the cage wall. Restrain the head with one
hand and support the torso and the wings with

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.060
the other hand. With the palm of your hand
resting on the bird s back, encircle the bird

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.420
s neck with your thumb and forefinger without
constricting the neck. To ensure that you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.530
have good control, you can place the knuckle
of your thumb in the bird s intermandibular

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.090
space. With this hold, you should have full
control of the bird s head without a tight

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.650
grip. Be careful not to put excessive pressure
on the bare facial patch of macaws or African

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:12.400
Grey parrots since the skin will bruise this
is not a practice builder! Small birds can

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.990
be restrained by using your palm to support
the bird s back, thumb and last 2 digits to

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:25.190
cradle the wings and second and third digits
to restrain the head. Use your second and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:32.970
third digit to control the bird s neck by
placing its head towards your finger tips.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.860
Birds breathe by moving the sternum in and
out, so be careful not to inhibit movement

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:46.160
as this will rapidly lead to respiratory compromise.
Minimize handling time so the bird does not

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.340
overheat or become overly distressed. And
monitor the bird closely for any change in

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:00.560
strength, breathing, or attitude. Immediately
after handling, some birds are tachypneic

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.310
and agitated while others become quiet and
subdued. Most birds return to normal activity

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:13.560
within 2 to 3 minutes unless there is underlying
debilitation or if the restraint period was

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560
prolonged. Manual restraint is required for
most medical procedures in the companion parrot
