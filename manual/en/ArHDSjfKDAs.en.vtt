Fruit Flies on the International Space Station -

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.460
presented by Science@NASA

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.380 position:58%
Fruit flies are bug eyed and spindly,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.510
they love rotten bananas, and,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.060 position:70%
following orders from their pin-sized brains,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.520 position:63%
they can lay hundreds of eggs every day.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.800
We have a lot in common?

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.290
Genetically speaking,

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.720 position:72%
people and fruit flies are surprisingly alike,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.370 position:63%
explains biologist Sharmila Bhattacharya

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.300
of NASA's Ames Research Center.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.360 position:61%
'About 77% of known human disease genes

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.610 position:95%
have a recognizable match in the genetic code of fruit flies,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.130 position:92%
and 50% of fly protein sequences have mammalian analogues.'

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.480
That's why fruit flies,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.510 position:73%
known to scientists as Drosophila melanogaster,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.890 position:64%
are commonplace in genetic research labs.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.620 position:63%
They can be good substitutes for people.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.530
They reproduce quickly,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.480 position:80%
so many generations can be studied in a short time,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.160 position:69%
and their genome has been completely mapped.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.740 position:67%
Drosophila is being used as a genetic model

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.370 position:97%
for several human diseases including Parkinson's and Huntington's.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.440 position:84%
They're about to become genetic models for astronauts.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.330 position:97%
'We are sending fruit flies to the International Space Station,'

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.310
says Bhattacharya.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.240 position:69%
'They will orbit Earth alongside astronauts,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.090 position:88%
helping us explore the effects of long-term space flight

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.380
on human beings.'

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.510 position:86%
The flies will be living in a habitat developed at Ames

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.090
called the 'Fruit Fly Lab.'

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.050 position:89%
Inside, they will lead the hurried lives of fruit flies--

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.120
living, dying, reproducing,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.870 position:64%
and experiencing the same space radiation

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.730 position:70%
and microgravity as their human counterparts.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.250
Cameras will record the behavior

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.500 position:70%
and appearance of these miniature astronauts;

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.930 position:69%
and at intervals some of them will be frozen

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.080
and returned to Earth for analysis.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.870 position:81%
Although fruit flies are bug-eyed and funny looking,

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.470
this is serious work

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.920 position:81%
recommended by the National Research Council itself.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.810
In a recent Decadal Survey,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.120
the council noted that

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.220 position:97%
'model systems offer increasingly valuable insights into basic biology.'

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.560
And they called for

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.760 position:97%
'an organized effort to identify common changes in gene expression

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.950 position:56%
[among] key model systems in space.'

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.890 position:97%
'The Fruit Fly Lab will allow us to look into a variety of questions

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.240 position:69%
such as the effect of space flight on aging,

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.980 position:58%
cardiovascular fitness, sleep, stress

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.520
and much more,' she says.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.920 position:84%
Bhattacharya's personal interest is the immune system.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.410
It has long been known

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.940 position:97%
that astronauts' ability to resist disease is weakened in space.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.750 position:77%
Turns out, the same thing happens to fruit flies.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.530
'We sent Drosophila to Earth orbit

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.190 position:63%
onboard Space Shuttle Discovery in 2006,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.590 position:89%
and they all experienced a decrement in immune function,'

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.910
says Bhattacharya.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.560 position:63%
The shuttle flight was relatively brief,

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.300
only 13 days,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.060
but astronauts traveling to Mars

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.780 position:84%
and other distant places will be in space much longer.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.480 position:97%
A fruit fly habitat permanently installed on the space station

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.440 position:86%
allows researchers to conduct studies directly relevant

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.520
to such long-duration space flight.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.220 position:64%
Immune system studies of human astronauts

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.380 position:88%
can be tricky because every astronaut has his or her own

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.460
idiosyncratic genetic code.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.120 position:73%
'What's nice about the flies we send up is that

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.920 position:88%
they are all genetically identical,' notes Bhattacharya.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.280 position:86%
'We can do much better science with such a population.'

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.230
Flies onboard the space station

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.420 position:64%
will also have their own 'carnival ride.'

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.070
A 1-g centrifuge

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.000 position:92%
will subject Drosophila to the equivalent of Earth-gravity,

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.980 position:61%
allowing researchers for the first time

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.310 position:95%
to unravel the competing influences of radiation and gravity.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.670 position:66%
'This is cutting-edge research,' she says,

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.470 position:67%
clearly enthusiastic about this new device.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.920 position:63%
The Fruit Fly Lab is scheduled to launch

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.260 position:81%
aboard the fifth SpaceX commercial resupply mission.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.720 position:64%
Maybe they should pack some bananas, too.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.790
Rotten, if you please.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.450
For more news about living things,

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.330
