(talking about how you can get banned for canceling match in Trials of Osiris)

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.380
Why I would've gotten banned?

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.140
I'm the real Mesa.

00:00:49.034 --> 00:00:51.034
I'm the real Mesa.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.160
Got Nova Bomb already!

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.424
Hell yeah!

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.340
(wolf howl)

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.540
No.

00:01:51.466 --> 00:01:53.466
Failed my second Nova Bomb....

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.340
I really got 2nd Nova already

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.720
I threw my Nova to the wall.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.800
Crazy streak! Damn beast!

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.040
Noooooo!

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.320
Oh look! Radegast!

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.280
That was totally well earned.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.640
That was earned well.

00:03:03.375 --> 00:03:05.375
That was earned Radegast.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.940
Time to waste motes...

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.580
Oh whaat?

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.568
(perks)

00:03:33.342 --> 00:03:34.722
Pretty damn good.

00:03:34.722 --> 00:03:35.840
Check my Radegast.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.720
Fucking perfect!
