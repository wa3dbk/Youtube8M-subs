off

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:16.789

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.789
the the

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.949

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.740
described below returning i believe it

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.409
the

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.890
harper's island

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.920
alleged dual observational into jacket

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.970
hot

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.030
saris

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.259
but it's nice to see if there is no
longer

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.270
almost solving the problem there

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.890
he almost got the jacket back

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.229
to the right person but it wasn't that
person's jacket of president obama

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.409
heckled here

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.869
in uh... mildly haggle that sounded like
it i couldn't tell that we have also

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.299
they are what exactly that person was
saying to the president cost i would

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.120
jesus i think jesus christ is lord right

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.549
c_v_s_ some along the lines

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.710
whittier presidential privilege here

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.690
friend at the center of the the louvre
this is the future

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.830
anti-fascist jesus passes

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.840
of well

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.460
uh... it was a strange that when there's
so much to complain about

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.500
uh... when you are at a presidential
fundraiser if you're going to be the guy

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.290
that stands up uh... calling obama the
integrity of that would be alone on the

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.410
list uh... but in fact you know people
are complaining about president obama

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.289
everywhere

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.560
and um... you know and at i don't want
to go back a little bit too were just

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.610
talking about with the the numbers

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.199
the approval ratings of monde
african-americans with president omar

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.319
uh... because it you fall into a
difficult

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.769
position when you're the president
you're the president clinton is trying

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.659
to use on track trying to create jobs

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.999
he's trying he has since the very
beginning of his administration tried to

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:28.810
create jobs it hasn't gone terribly well

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.319
he's not getting a lot of cooperation we
know that

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.569
uh... but what happens is as you said
went out the population you hear that

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.840
black americans

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.290
every sixteen percent uh... unemployment
rate as the numbers in july about showed

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.419
the difficult task of the president has
to do right now is he needs to as we saw

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:47.819
on these numbers

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.139
he's and talk to black americans he
needs to be to start working on his base

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:56.909
and even if that means that he has to
see more like a black president for a

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.249
while he has to take some risks

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.509
he has to do some things that energized
the base because the rest of the bases

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.119
not to be offended if he seems to be
pandering for votes from another part of

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.350
the base when he goes to it uh... join a
pack intention

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.450
in washington's adopted a toddler his
position on israel the rest of the cub

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.300
population is complaining that he is
trying to pander four those kinds of

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.019
those

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.110
that they understand what a president
has to do the rest of his constituency

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.890
understands the president has to go to
black americans he has to go speak to

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.870
his constituency his natural
constituency and his democratic

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.870
constituency in order to drum up votes
this is a it among you mentally

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.300
important election

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.060
not just because it was bigger ginsburg
is old but because we need to get the

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.860
economy back on track we need to do with
in a way that does not unfairly create a

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.020
tremendous amount of poverty which if
the republicans get into office and they

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.720
change the tax structure and they change
spending is going to create eighteen

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.989
generation of poverty likely unseen in
this country
