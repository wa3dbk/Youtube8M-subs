one usb port on the side

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.089
no two usb ports on the side

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:51.219
right over here you have

unique himachal

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.349
now the usb port

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:13.349
this laptop comes standard which with
and uh... intel core i have processor

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:17.230
as you can see it does come up with a
comeback

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.589
and that's one thing i don't like about
it it looks good but it's just

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:24.279
it's got the same checklist out keyboard

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:26.829
it's got that same color panel

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.229
um...

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.519
i don't necessarily like this keyboard
too much

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.469
uh... one of the problems i have is the
space bar

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.279
is not so it's the vendor

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:40.899
you have to press down on a very rough

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:42.069
um...

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.479
and this um...

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.759
the uh... cursor

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:50.259
is very sensitive so foul mood just a
little bit

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.089
the mouse will go all the way across the
screen

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.799
but other than that

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.989

right here

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.020
