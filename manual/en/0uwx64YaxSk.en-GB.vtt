00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.800
My name's David Scott.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.600 position:61%
I'm a consultant rheumatologist at the
Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.320
and an honorary professor
at the University of East Anglia.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.600
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic
destructive disease of the joints.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.840 position:63%
It classically involves the small joints
of the hands and feet first.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.360 position:63%
It affects women more commonly than men,

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.400
classically starts in the fifth
and sixth decades of life,

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.360
affects just under one per cent
of the population.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.920
The most common complaint is pain,
pain in the joints.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.280
Inflammatory pain, by that I mean
the pain associated with rheumatoid

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.120
as opposed to osteoarthritis,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.040 position:56%
is characteristically associated
with marked stiffness of the joints.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.680
The joints are stiffest
when they've been rested,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.960
so particularly
first thing in the morning

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.000
and with any periods of rest.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.640 position:56%
The next thing that they complain of
is swelling of the joints

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.880
and loss of function of the joints.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.080
So it's often in the hands,
the hands are painful.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.840 position:63%
The typical joints, these knuckle joints
become inflamed and swollen.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.520
They become stiff in the mornings,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.640
patients get up
and have to put their hands

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.520 position:61%
in hot or cold water to get them moving

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.080
and find they're becoming weak
and not able to function so well.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.040
We use a combination of treatments.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.040
Simple analgesics like paracetamol
are used to treat the pain,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.200
but that just treats
your feeling of pain.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.480
Anti-inflammatory drugs,
which are commonly used,

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.680
obviously treat the symptoms
of stiffness and swelling

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.360
but don't affect
the process of the disease.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.600 position:58%
Patients who have any evidence
that they're likely to damage joints,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.480
and even very early in treatment,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920
and I mean within weeks,
not months or years,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.760 position:63%
the most commonly used disease-modifying
drug is Methotrexate.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.400
That's been used for 30-odd years
in rheumatoid arthritis

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.440
and is a very effective drug.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.280
Others, such as gold injections,
are used much less frequently now,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.640
and there are four or five
of these disease-modifying drugs.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.240
These drugs, by their definition,
slow down the process of damage

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.200
and can be very effective.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.560
But we have a new class of drugs
called biologic agents

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.280
and there is a move
in this country and elsewhere

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.320
to use these drugs earlier.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.080
The problem with drugs
is they have side effects.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.840
The problem with the biologics
is they're expensive

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.560
and we have to use them
for the patients who need them,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.360
but we certainly like to,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.200 position:58%
in any person who might have
the potential for damaging arthritis,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.640
to use these drugs early

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.760 position:58%
because these are even more effective
than the disease-modifying drugs

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.040
and can in almost every case
stop the destructive process

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.960 position:58%
that underlines rheumatoid arthritis.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.640
Once diagnosed, it's usually
a diagnosis you have to live with

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.120
for the rest of your life,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.760
so there are other factors
that are very important.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.200
There are self-help organisations.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.480 position:59%
There is a charity called the National
Rheumatoid Arthritis Society, or NRAS,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.640
which has helplines that can teach
people more about the disease.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.400
We use our nurse practitioners
to do the same sort of thing.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.560 position:58%
It can go into remission and
patients can lead a very normal life,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.800
but currently our understanding is
that patients,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.920 position:56%
even though apparently in remission,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
ie with no symptoms but on drugs,

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.640
if you stop the drugs
all the evidence will suggest

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.120
that in most patients
the arthritis will come back.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.200 position:59%
Many patients who are at a working age
who develop rheumatoid arthritis

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.400
give up their jobs

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.240
simply because the arthritis causes

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.880
so much disturbance, if you like,
to their life.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.240
With new treatment, with effective
treatment, that need not happen.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.760
So the important message is
if you know you've got arthritis,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.160
don't make a decision
about your job too early.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.000
We have good treatments,
they really can work,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.240
and you ought to be able
to carry on working.
