00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.510
Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com and
today I'm going to show you

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.780
how to make a little Christmas tree earring

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.920
out of the new Swarovski Elements dome bead

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.109
shape and here I have the 11 millimeter

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.680
of the large version, so

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.460
there's the small ones which are more rounded and the large ones which are

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.860
longer and then this is the 11 millimeter in Dark Moss Green

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.570
it has a very nice Christmas tree color and
I also have

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.210
some head pins and these are just 22 gauge

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.850
one and a half inch. I have some earring
hooks

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.019
I have four millimeter gold-plated code beads.
They're just

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.050
gold-plated pewter and then I have little three millimeter gold-plated

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.409
sparkle Stardust beads and 6 millimeter

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.769
gold-plated bead caps

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.989
All we're going to do is make a stack on the head pin

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.710
and create a wrapped wire loop. You're going to need

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.869
a pair of chain nose pliers and then you're either going to need

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.500
a pair of round nose pliers or some wire
looping pliers

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.579
and then you do need a pair of flush cutters

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.600
Take one of your head pins and place your cube bead

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.600
onto your head pin and then place the dome bead

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.890
the wide side down onto that, I'm going to place

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.219
the bead cap down next and the Stardust

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.789
bead on top and those are the basic pieces

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.189
they make very cute little trees. We're going to make a wrap wire loop

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.549
I'm going to use my wire looping pliers. If you're

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.590
not familiar with how to make a wrapped wire loop we do have a video

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.609
on how to do that and I do show you in
that video how to

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.240
do the loop with just plain chain nose and
round nose

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.980
this is a really great time saving tool and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.860
all you do is grab the wire

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.390
a bit above the bead, squeeze, bend the
tail

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.480
rotate it around and then

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.070
just like with a regular wrapped loop your just going to

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:39.070
pull the tail around

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.019
trim the excess off

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.430
and then you just always wanna make sure
that you tuck

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.230
the little tail at the end

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.370
in securely so that it's not sharp, it doesn't

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.659
scratch you when you wear the jewelry, so
there's our

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.549
complete little earring dangle. Now we just
need to add it onto the earring

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.400
hook. Open up

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.879
the loop on the earring hook by

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.640
bending it to the side

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.640
hang your dangle from that and then bend it
back to the center to close it up

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.830
you're going to repeat that process to make

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.260
another earring.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.260
