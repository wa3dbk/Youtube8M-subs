On behalf of Expert Village, my name is Jim
Dufrensne, I'm here to tell you about acoustic

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:22.009
guitar amplification. Now this uses a piezo
crystal strip that fits under the saddle.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:31.689
There's another kind of guitar pick up that
I favor. It's made by B Band, a company in

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:39.630
Finland, and it works off of a slightly different
principle, it has a condenser ribbon, and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.621
this ribbon is as thin as a piece of paper.
Now when you install these piezo electric

00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:49.830
pick ups, you usually have to modify the guitar
slightly. You have to make the sure the bottom

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.430
of the bridge slide is flat and you have to
remove material either from the bottom of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.010
this bridge slide or you have to take some
off the saddle itself, or a combination of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.330
the two, and it takes a little finesse to
make the parts fit together. The B Band system

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.940
is as thin as a piece of paper, and normally
doesn't require any modification whatsoever.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:26.460
And it's my thought that the B Band system
sounds much more accurate. Now this is a piezo

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.530
electric system and it has a little bit of
a quackiness to it, and that's, until B Band

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:42.130
came along they all had that. Gibson makes
a real nice system which uses piezo electric

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.690
crystals and their Chet Adkins, I had one
of those guitars. It sounds pretty darn good.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.580
And Ovation was a pioneer in guitar amplification.
They had a really really good system, but

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.130
they were still piezo electric, and you could
still hear that quack if you listen to it.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:17.430
The quack is right there as the notes start.
Now you can hear that quackiness a little

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:30.029
bit, especially with the full chord.
Now with this equalizer, you can change the

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:41.879
sounds. Here's full bass. Here's mid range.
And that one really accentuates the quickness.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:49.040
Let's try the treble, and one called presence.
