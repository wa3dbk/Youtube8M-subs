00:00:02.545 --> 00:00:05.414
A moment of love,

00:00:05.481 --> 00:00:08.751
Even in a bad man, can
give meaning to a life.

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:13.789
None of us knows which path
will lead us to god.

00:00:13.857 --> 00:00:15.524

00:00:15.592 --> 00:00:16.592

00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:56.349
(insects chirring,
birds hooting in distance)

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.991
It's palm wine.

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:15.401
(quiet laugh)

00:01:16.436 --> 00:01:17.570
Jesus christ.

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.238
Yeah, yeah, it takes
getting used to.

00:01:19.305 --> 00:01:20.906
God.

00:01:20.974 --> 00:01:22.140
Drank that as a boy.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.843
In rhodesia?

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:27.246
I'll take notes.

00:01:29.716 --> 00:01:32.317
The shona.

00:01:32.386 --> 00:01:35.254
The shona have a word for me.

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.689
Mukiwa.

00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:39.324
It means "white boy
in africa."

00:01:39.393 --> 00:01:40.726
When did you leave?

00:01:40.794 --> 00:01:42.762
I didn't leave.

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.931
I got sent away
to south africa in 1978,

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.566
When the munts overran us.

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:49.402
Then you joined the army?

00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:54.407
Yeah, yeah,
I did my time in angola.

00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:56.074
The three-two battalion.

00:01:56.142 --> 00:01:57.309
That's right.

00:01:59.012 --> 00:02:02.415
You know, contrary to what
you might think about us,

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:04.784
We fought with the blacks, huh?

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:06.585
Yeah. Side by side.

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:08.587
There was no apartheid
in the foxhole.

00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:10.423
The colonel always
used to tell us that.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.557
This is colonel kutzia?

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:14.727
