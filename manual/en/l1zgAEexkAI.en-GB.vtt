I get quite a few questions about my hair

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:40.769
and how I achieve the fade from blonde to
pink to copper at the tips.

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:43.579
I'm not an expert but this is the routine
I use.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.989
I would always suggest going to a hairdresser
just in case.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:07.080
You can see in the photos the top picture
if after the pink has faded out and the bottom

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.390
is freshly dyed.
This is the end result.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.119
I generally bleach my roots before the beginning.
The pink I use is not permanent but the copper

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:22.340
at the tops is so it doesn't require touch
ups.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:32.740
Normally I do this all while showering to
save time.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.740
Start by shampoo-ing your hair.
Squeeze out most of the extra moisture but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.259
keep it fairly wet.
This whole process is really best done in

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.259
the shower so you don't get dye and water
everywhere!

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:51.149
Divide into two sections and pin your fringe
out of the way.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.310
Give it a good brush through.
This whole process will depend on the dye

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.280
you're using.
Please read and follow the individual instructions

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.380
there.
Twist each section inwards towards your face.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:23.350
Again this technique is just what works for
my dye and my hair type, it may not work for

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.400
yours.
The dye I'm using here is called "Wakk Stain"

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
in pink.
Squeeze a good amount on to the palm of your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.400
hand.
Depending on the type of dye you may need

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:40.960
to wear gloves.
Put a little dye on the tips of your fingers

00:02:40.960 --> 00:03:01.349
and rub it on where you want the bottom of
the gradient to start.

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.239
Rub in by twisting the section of hair around
your fingers.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.610
Continue adding colour little by little by
twisting arund your fingers.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.099
Add more towards the bottom to make the colour
brighter.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.939
To make a nice fade up the top just use your
fingers to move small amounts of the dye which

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:32.439
is already on your hair upwards.
Because the hair is wet you should be able

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:40.819
to move the dye fairly easily.
Keep twisting and adding dye.

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:51.519
The twisting prevents the dye from covering
every single strand of hair so when it's untwisted

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:58.880
and dry, the fade is more gradual.
Every now and then you can untwist the hair

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.060
and comb through with your fingers.
This will let you see how the colour is progressing

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.439
and where you need to add more.
After a while you can start to see the fade

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:15.580
forming.
Once you have the top fade in the way you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:33.250
want it just add a bunch more dye to the bottom
section so it's nice and bright.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:39.200
The time to head to the shower and wash it
all out!

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:47.060
The dye I use doesn't need to be left in long
so I generally just wash out and then add

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.020
condition as soon as I'm done.
It doesn't stain so you can see it's come

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.020
straight off my hands.
Hah! I even managed to keep all my make up

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020
on when washing it out. That's an achievement!
Blow dry it out and you're all finished.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.020
You might want to take this time to have your
own slow motion hair commercial moment...

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.250
or not.
Finished! It's much brighter and the fade

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.960
is very gradual.
As I mentioned this is just the technique

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.300
that works for me it may not work for you
depending on hair type or the dye you're using.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.300
Pretty pink hair again and the fade is pretty
good, yay!

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.300
This dye fades very quickly so I usually do
this once a week or if I'm lazy just when

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.300
I have a special event.
I hope this was a useful video, please check

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.300

for more information and tutorials.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.306
Thanks so much for watching.
Bye!
