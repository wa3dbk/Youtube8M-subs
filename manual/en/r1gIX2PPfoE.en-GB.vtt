00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:16.330
Acclimating new tropical or cold water aquarium
fish properly is the most important step to

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.300
adding fish to an aquarium, but is is most
frequently done incorrectly leading to premature

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
fish death.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:33.280
These steps will guide you how acclimating
new tropical or cold water aquarium fish.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.950
1. Turn off any lights in your aquarium.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:56.770
2. Roll down the 
sides of the bag as shown in the video above

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:27.299
and float it for 30 -- 45 minutes to allow
the temperature of the water in the bag to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:38.630
adjust and the fish to get used to it.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:59.670
3. Whilst is it floating add a some of your
aquarium water into the bag every 10 minutes

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:36.010
to allow the fish to get used to the new water
parameters such as pH, hardness etc. Aim to

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:48.120
have added at least half again the volume
of water that is originally in the bag.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:03:07.710
4. Get a fish net and a bowl large enough
to contain all the water from the bag.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:28.080
5. Place the net over the bowl and pour the
water and fish from the bag through it whilst

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.870
catching the fish in the net.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:46.640
6. Put the fish into your aquarium!

00:03:46.640 --> 00:04:04.610
7. Keep your aquarium lights off for at least
4-6 hours to allow your new fish to settle.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.720
8. Discard the old fish water from the bag
(this is to prevent parasites/diseases from

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:11.870
entering your aquarium with the fish)
