00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm Kelly on behalf of Expert Village. I'm
going to show you how to ride your horse at

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.140
the walk. Now there's a couple different ways
that you can teach your horse the back. Backing

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.820
is a command that you definitely want to teach
your horse. Anytime that you're in the show

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.570
situation it's usually the last command that
the judge will ask for. And you want your

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.481
horse to back readily. It's also a really
good training technique. It gets your horse

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:28.179
to lift its shoulders, gets it to set back
on its haunches and gets it to give its face.

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.840
So I'm gonna start by backing her two handed.
So all I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sit deep

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.620
on my seat bones and I'm gonna pull back on
my reins and I'm gonna apply a little bit

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:48.370
of leg pressure. And she's gonna really, easily
back up. Now she's pretty well trained in

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.030
the backing so it might not be this easy the
first time you ask your horse to back. You

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.530
may have to pull a lot harder. Just keep at
it. Keep pulling until, even if you get one

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.400
step that's a small victory if your horse
isn't good at the backing. And you know you

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.360
get one step, pull back, you get one step.
Release, give them the pat, say thank you,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.770
you did what I asked you to do. Now, riding
western, which we're gonna go back to our

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:28.720
one handed here. I actually have, she came
back without having to pull any pressure on

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.470
the reins at all. I just roll my spurs in
her and she'll back right up. You can back

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.880
with the reins riding one handed. If I can,
I just pick up a little bit and she'll back

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:49.850
right off of the bit. Apply a little bit of
leg pressure. But it definitely shows a level

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.770
of training, a level of skill if you can get
your horse to back up without even having

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:01.469
to move your reins. It's a little bit fancier
in the show ring. There's one thing I hate

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.701
to see is people jerking on their horses to
try to get them to back up in the show ring

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:10.179
because if you're showing your horse that's
one thing that your horse should definitely

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:18.490
know how to do. So, you just want to pull
your spurs in and roll them up and down and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.730
your horse will back right up. So those are
some tips and techniques you can use when

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.810
teaching your horse the back.
