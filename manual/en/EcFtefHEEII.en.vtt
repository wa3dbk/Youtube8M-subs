00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.350
Hi there!

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.350
Welcome to the first video of the OpenCV Moments
channel.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.549
In this video you will learn how to install
OpenCV 3 on a Windows 8 machine, the easy

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.549
way.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.230
It is really simple, there is only 3 steps.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.230
1.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.960
Download the precompiled version for windows
from www.opencv.org

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.960
2.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.780
Extract the downloaded file into your favourite
folder.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:28.790
3.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.699
Set a couple of system environment variables.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.640
So, let’s proceed.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.149
Open your browser and point it to www.opencv.org.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.659
You will notice the download link on the top
right side of the page.

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.110
It reads “OpenCV for Windows”.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.090
That will take you to the download page where
you will select the version to download.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.429
Click on it and wait for the download to complete.

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.149
Next, you need to extract the file that you
just downloaded into a folder of your choice.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.010
Let’s say… you are going to extract it
into the root folder of the C hard drive.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.120
Remember, this is just an example, you can
use any other folder.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.939
That’s it.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.700
Now the only tricky part is setting the environment
variables.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.890
These variables tell the system where to look
for OpenCV library-related stuff.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.969
You are going to define an environment variable
called OPENCV_DIR with the following structure:

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:30.149
“path to the library, slash build, slash
architecture, slash visual c version”

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.009
where “path to the library” will be the
path to the folder where you extracted the

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:42.049
library, “architecture” will be x64 or
x86 depending on wether your system is 64

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.329
or 32 bits, and visual c version will be vc10,
vc11 or vc12 depending on which version of

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.140
visual c you will use for development.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.630
If you extracted the library on the root folder
of your C drive and you use the latest visual

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.859
c on a 32 bit machine then the content of
the OPENCV_DIR environment variable will be

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.119
as shown on the screen.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.260
Then, you need to update the PATH environment
variable with the following value.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.580
This will allow your system to locate the
OpenCV Dynamic-link libraries, or DLL, that

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.230
your opencv programs will need at run time.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.840
Lets go for it.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.300
Open your system properties, access “Advanced
System Settings” and click the button “Environment

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.160
Variables”.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.340
Under “System Variables” click the button
“New” and set a variable with name OPENCV_DIR

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.500
and a value according to the previous explanation.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.730
In the case of this machine it will be c,
opencv, build, x86, vc12.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.340
Click OK

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:03.000
Now find the “path” variable under system
variables, select it and click the edit button.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.040
Set the cursor at the end of the “Variable
Value” field and add %OPENCV_DIR%\bin.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.990
Click OK to save the changes, close the environment
variables dialog by clicking the OK button

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.800
and close the advance system settings dialog
clicking OK.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.090
And that’s it!

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.070
OpenCV is installed in your system!!

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.260
Now you know how to install OpenCV 3 in Windows
8.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.840
