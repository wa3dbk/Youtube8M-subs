00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.566
- So you're Australian,
which I didn't know, really,

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:03.933
until Portia told me.
- Yeah.

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.166
- Because you always have
American accents in everything.

00:00:06.166 --> 00:00:07.966
In "Bridesmaids"--
I never would have thought that.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.066
- Yes.
Yeah, I know.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.533
I'm actually more comfortable,
really,

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:13.400
working with an American accent,
at this point, you know?

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.733
To help--to get into
the character?

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.366
So on "Neighbors,"
when they wanted me

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.333
to be Australian,
I was like, "Really?

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.166
"Really?
Do we have to?

00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:22.000
My secret's out," you know?
- Yeah.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.466
And then you were American in
that as well.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:24.966
- Yeah--ooh, no, no.
I was Australian.

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:26.766
- Were you really?
- Yes, yeah, they made--yeah.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:28.800
'Cause they do a lot of improv
on those films, so--

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.166
- That was a hilarious movie,
also.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.433
- Oh, thank you.
- Really, really fun.

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.366
So, do you just sometimes--
is it that easy for you?

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.166
Like, if you were to walk around
during the day,

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:36.633
and have an American accent?

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.966
- Yep.
- You--really?

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:40.633
It's just that easy?
- I could read something out.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.533
- Like, just--just, right now--
- Yeah.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:46.600
- You can just speak with
an American accent.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.833
- [American accent]
What would you like me to say?

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:49.600
- Well, you just did, like--
- [laughs]

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.333
- Like, is there an accent--

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.933
Can you a lot
of different accents?

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:54.600
Are you good--
- I'm not bad.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.666
I'm--New Zealand is tough.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:58.366
[New Zealand accent]
New Zealanders talk like this?

00:00:58.366 --> 00:00:59.833
- Uh huh.
- It's very hard.

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:00.900
- [through clenched teeth]
They don't open their mouth?

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.666
- No, no, they say--
[laughter]

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.133
- "Fish and chips."
- No?

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.333
But isn't it--it all goes up at
the end of the--Australian?

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.666
- Australians go like,

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:10.566
"I'm gonna go get a glass
of water?"

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.400
- "Water?
Would you like some water?"

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.366
That's my Australian, yeah.

00:01:14.366 --> 00:01:15.566
[laughter]

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.966
Can you do, like,
a Southern accent?

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.466
Are you good at--
- I love Southern accents.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:20.266
That's actually a fantasy
of mine, is to do--

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:22.866
I would love to do a character,
you know, like a great--

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.900
you know, a great South--
I think they're so beautiful.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't know if there's anyone
from the South here, but--

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.600
[audience cheers]
Yeah?

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.633
They're gorgeous.
They're beautiful.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.600
[audience laughter]
[mouths words]

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.466
[laughter]

00:01:34.466 --> 00:01:36.500
- You're lying.
- I'm from New Orleans.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.666
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

00:01:38.666 --> 00:01:40.366
[laughter]

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.866
Yes.
- Really?

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:42.866
- Yes, I am.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:44.066
- Well, you don't sound like it.

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.233
- [slight accent]
But I do.

00:01:45.233 --> 00:01:46.700
[audience laughter]
- Oh, there it--[laughs]

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.200
- But I do.
I say "y'all" all the time.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.200
People still make fun of me for
that, but I just think

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.700
"y'all" is easier to say than
"you guys" or "you all."

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.966
I mean, it's--
- Oh, wow.

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.733
- It's saving everyone time.

00:01:55.733 --> 00:01:57.300
[laughter]

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.100
- Wow, gosh--and so
you've pretty much lost your--

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.833
- Well, I lived in Texas
for a short time,

00:02:01.833 --> 00:02:03.366
so when I was in Texas,
they made fun

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:05.266
of my New Orleans accent,

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:06.800
then I moved back to New Orleans
from Texas

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.600
and they made fun of
my Texan accent,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.166
and then I was like,
"Okay, forget all y'all,"

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:12.833
'cause--
[laughter]

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.166
"I'm just gonna move to
California,

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.133
and forget about all of it."
