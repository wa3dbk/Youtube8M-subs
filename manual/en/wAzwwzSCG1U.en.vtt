[BUBBLING]

00:00:03.466 --> 00:00:04.840
PROFESSOR: We're
in the lab where

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.465
Lonnie is going to
show us the reaction

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:08.130
of alkali metals with water.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.620
The first is sodium.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.260
As you place sodium
metal in water,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.450
a reaction will occur where the
sodium is oxidized or ionized

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.590
to sodium plus while
the water is reduced.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.210
Now, the reduction of water
releases a tremendous amount

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.290
of energy.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.189
But in this case, the
ionization of sodium

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.600
requires a significant
amount of energy.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.530
In fact, they about
equalize each other.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.380
So this reaction
is quite subdued.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.830
The energy required
to ionize the sodium

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.670
is offset by the energy released
by the reduction of the water.

00:00:51.562 --> 00:00:53.520
Now, let's look at the
reaction with potassium.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.270
Potassium has a lower
ionization energy.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.670
So when potassium is ionized,
a lower amount of energy

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.110
is required.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.480
The same amount of
energy is released

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.500
when the water is reduced.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.980
So this reaction
proceeds more vigorously.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.670
If we go one element down the
periodic table to rubidium,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.400
a lower ionization
energy, we should

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.500
see more of the energy that's
released when water is reduced

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.962
for the rubidium metal.

00:01:31.962 --> 00:01:33.170
[POP]

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.150
And indeed, that reaction
happened so quickly--

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.914
[POP]

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.172
--we should watch it
again in slow motion.

00:01:40.172 --> 00:01:41.621
[POP]

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.620
The fourth medal in
this series, francium,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.650
has the lowest
ionization energy of all.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.590
So we should see virtually
all of the energy

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.495
from the water reduction
being released.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.410
So here's francium and
water chemical reaction.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.110
