hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.900
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.199
Today I'm going to make an awesome chaat that is a very simple chaat too Aloo

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.330
and channa chaat

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
Aloo is nothing but the boil potatoes which are cut into small pieces

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.270
you know these are well cooked in this
garbanzo

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.190
that is the whole channa which also have
been boiled till they are nicely cooked you

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.840
know these chaats are very very tasty
and half a cup of this chaat will make

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.000
an evening very very pleasant

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.550
so let's go ahead and make this. So mix
this garbanzo and potaotes, in this

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.399
add finely chopped onion, chopped chilli,
red chilli powder

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.989
you know if you like it spicy you can
make it a little bit spicy and chaat

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.119
masala powder; chaat masala powder put lot of it because that is what is going to make

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.490
chaat special and lot of chopped
coriander and a little bit of chopped

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.330
mint

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.530
add some lime juice, salt and now we're going add some tamarind chutney

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.420
Imili ka chutney, this is sweet tamarind chutney,  just add

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.450
yeah this one also you can add a little
extra

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.770
this is Anar that is a pomegranate; adding this pomegrante to the chaat

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.850
will make it even more tasty and every
bite

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.820
you get one pomegranate that makes it
tasty and nobody does this but I love to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.250
add a little bit of melted butter

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.670
guys if you want to add it add it
otherwise not because this is tasty

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.780
without any ghee in it but I love to add
a little bit

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.270
this is an optional just very little ok
you know so just mix all of this you

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.899
know all what we added is very
refreshing but

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.720
nothing like adding freshly ground cumin
to the chaats and sprinkle a little bit

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.420
of freshly roasted and ground cumin will
make this chaat even more special

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.860
look at this is all done then take a
spoonful

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.560
wow.....wow

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.780
usually in hotels this is a standard
feature in all the buffets but even once in

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.060
a while at home make it and you'll
really enjoy it after you boil and cut

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.860
these potatoes and even the garbage 
after boiling just make sure you chill it

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.590
before you make this chaat because this
chaat is best hard when it is cold. Even

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.209
after making this chaat put it in the
fridge for an hour and then have it, so

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.610
you can make this in advance and eat it

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.300
