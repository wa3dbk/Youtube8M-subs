My name is Christine Marquette and I'm a registered
dietitian with the Austin Regional Clinic,

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.740
and I'm going to talk to you about vegetarian
diet delivery programs. These particular service

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.779
programs, the main ones that offer vegetarian
options would be Nutri-Systems, Diet to Go,

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.279
and Chef's Diet. Nutri-Systems actually advertises
themselves as being the major diet delivery

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.140
service program that offers pre-packaged vegetarian
options. By pre-packaged they mean they have

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.460
sixty different options available that are
complete meals, such as vegetarian chili,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.571
vegetarian lasagna, breakfast items such as
waffles as well as desert items. And again,

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:49.970
they have a variety of sixty different options
to choose from. Diet to Go also has a variety

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.500
of vegetarian options, and they advertise
theirs as being lacto-ovo, meaning they could

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.670
have dairy products and they might have eggs
in them as well. These particular meals are

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.520
actually prepared meals that are not necessarily
pre-packaged, meaning it's more of a home

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:10.000
cooked type meal. And you have a variety of
options to choose from. Theirs range anywhere

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.990
from ten to twenty dollars, depending on how
many meals you choose. Whether you choose

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.479
two meals a day, or three meals a day, or
meals plus snacks. The cost will vary. They

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.480
do offer incentives such as free meals....or
discounts based on the number of meals that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.979
you purchase. Chef's Diet is another program
that offers vegetarian options, but it's based

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.720
on Doctor Sear's Zone Diet, meaning that it's
forty percent carbohydrate, thirty percent

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.439
protein and thirty percent fat. And again,
with the vegetarian options, to have that

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:50.149
much fat it's going to include a lot of things
like nuts and seeds as well as avocado as...as

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:55.820
a main source of fat. But they do have that
option as well. And similar to the other programs,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.670
a variety of costs depending on how many meals
you choose to purchase. So those are three

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.219
of the major diet delivery service programs
that offer vegetarian options.
