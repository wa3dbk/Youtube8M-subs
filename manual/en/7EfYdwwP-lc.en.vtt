00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:13.690
Hey YouTube!

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.139
It's time to get Hectic with HMK!

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.730
With the advent of the Legend of Zelda Wii
U being shown recently and all the new thoughts

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.779
and ideas from what we have seen, HMK is here
to bring you a bold radical theory that explores

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.779
the hyped and interesting prospect in Zelda
that can give rise to so many new themes!

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:49.550
Thorough the thought of a NEW TIMELINE, the
Timeline of Hyrule's Prosperity!

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.399
Now from watching the trailer many times over
and gaining insight and information from the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.699
trailer and some many other youtubers I've
come to a conclusion that this game may indeed

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.999
take place after Skyward Sword but not in
the way everyone is thinking.

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.650
This game may take place in a completely timeline
from even the unified timeline.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.960
One that is in a higher prosperity than the
established timeline.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.350
All of this comes from a significant event
in Skyward Sword at it's climax!

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.440
Now first off we all know about the great
timeline split after the event of Ocarina

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.920
of time in the Unified timeline in which the
ending creates a multiverse outcome do to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.280
changing events of the past the create a better
future, however the dark future of Ganondorf's

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.750
Rule still holds true in the adult timeline,
Link returns to his original time to change

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.240
things for the child timeline.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.700
Showing that split timelines are indeed a
possibility.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.130
Towards the end of Skyward Sword, when Link
uses the Triforce to destroy Demise In his

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.420
present, Ghirahim then steals Zelda to the
past to revive Demise in the distant past,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.340
Link follows and then destroys Demise in the
past as well!

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.430
But wait a minute..

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.550
If Link Kills demise in the past, then the
events of Skyward Sword and their struggles

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.930
shouldn't come to pass as theoretically Demise
wouldn't have existed!

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.190
Yet Link returned to his own to, to the future
unfazed.Are we missing something here?

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.849
Well this is where the multiverse theory comes
into play.

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.890
Though Link changed something huge in the
past he returns to his own time, with little

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.500
to no differences as he returns to his original
realm of being.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.319
As evident with Unified timeline split, in
which Link returns to the past to change the

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.130
future in the child timeline, yet the Adult
timeline still continues without him.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.590
Different timelines people.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.920
So it stands to reason that this action of
defeating demise in the distant past created

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.170
a new timeline in which Demise was purged
from this world LONG before Skyward Sword.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.030
Now this is where Zelda Wii U Comes into play.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.140
If this game were to take place soon after
the events of Skyward Sword it would be an

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.570
new timeline of prosperity!

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.560
Allow me to explain!

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.620
The whole reason why the skylofters were on
Skyloft was to be protected from Demise and

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.870
the demons during the great war, and there
they stayed for hundreds of years until it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.260
was truly safe to return to the surface.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.560
Now if Demise was defeated in that distant
past, in which Skyloft was just sent to the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.750
sky and Demise was freshly sealed then it
highly logical that the land was more than

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.240
safe to return for the humans.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.849
Allowing them to rebuild the land way earlier!

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.319
And with them back on the surface it gives
them more access to the lands various re-sources

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.780
such as timeshift stones, the ancient robots
and the various goods for synthesis and building,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.990
thereby using that lost time and resources
to create a Hyrule that is hundreds of years

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.580
more advanced than the Hyrule that existed
after the events of SS in the unified timeline.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.010
A sign of proof would be that giant mechincal
monstrosity in the first Zelda Wii U trailer!

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.209
Since most of the ancient robot tech was lost
due to the humans abandoning the surfaces

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.000
for all those years, It is possible that there
are more technological advances in energy

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.870
and magic that led to the creation of that
beast that the humans could've used the ancient

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.180
robots as a blueprint, and the technology
that Link uses in his new arrowheads.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.230
Areas would be more populated, the land would
be more expanded and the Lanayru region would

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.650
never become a barren desert!

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.459
This can also be proven with the giant map
and the clean landmarks such as the great

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.599
bridge of Hylia the abundance of new vantage
point towers and proof of more animal life

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.730
out in the open since the humans could reclaim
the land from the demons at a faster rate.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.849
Something else that can attribute to this
outcome is that since Demise was soundly defeated

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.340
in the past this could've signaled the Sheikah
to come out the shadows and help Hylia's people

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.960
return to the surfaced, build the land, and
share their customs and items, this is signaled

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.120
with Link's new cloak that is awfully similar
to Impa's Cloak in SS and the shield bearing

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.900
something similar to the sheikah Eye!

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.590
Hell, it may be even possibile that in this
new timeline that the land is not even called

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.600
Hyrule are rather named Hylia, hinted from
the manga as Eiji Aonuma and Shigeru Miyamoto

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.960
has never stated this vast world to be "Hyrule"
simply calling the vast world or the new world

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.590
of Zelda.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.900
If this theory holds to be true than it gives
Nintendo an unlimited amount of possibilities

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.740
to rewrite events of Zelda, create new themes,
items, lore and challenges, and also the route

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.520
to create more games and unbind themselves
from the chains of the old timeline.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.810
With all of this in mind this new Zelda may
be even called, The Legend of Zelda: The New

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.900
World.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.120
Now of course the curse of Demise may still
apply but now it may have a different host

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.850
other than Ganondorf as many people believe,
myself included that in this time of peace

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.940
Gerudos may be aligned with the world and
Ganondorf may even be a Mentor to link as

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.919
highlighted by Link's Gerudo gauntlets so
a new nemesis may be given rise in this new

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.169
Timeline, in this new World!

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.260
With that the Theory comes to a close..
