00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.740
Hey guys, it's time to get indieformed with
our top Kickstarter picks of the last month.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.000
To start things off, we have a couple of honourable
mentions.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:29.140
Koji Igarashi, a co-director of Symphony of
the Nights, is making an ode to Castlevania

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.310
in Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.
Winterflame: The Other Side is an adventure

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.600
game set in a beautifully desolate world and
with a multi-purpose gauntlet for puzzling.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.460
And lastly, Empyrean Rule - Rise of the Ancients
is real time strategy in a large and persistent

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.800
world of magic.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.940
Moving onto the top 5 now, we kick our rankings
off with another Square Enix Collective game

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.970
coming to Kickstarter in Tokyo Dark. It's
a game with a lot of interesting pieces: a

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.260
nice anime art style, deep narrative, dialogue,
twisted themes, and point and click gameplay.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.000
There's definitely a mix of both Japanese
and Western game ideas in there, but they

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.030
seem to be a natural fit as they thematically
overlap. Something else that caught our eye

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.420
was how the events of the game make Detective
Ito question the past and ultimately her sanity.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.190
This has in-game effects, with your sanity
level being displayed on your social networks.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.959
Obviously, the greater your reputation as
a crazy lady is, the more likely characters

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.330
will treat you differently. Also, depending
on how you play the game there are 10 different

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.000
endings. Presumably, some are darker than
others. How dark? Tokyo Dark.

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.019
Ultimate Chicken Horse is a party platformer
that is the ultimate game of chicken and horse.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.049
You play levels against a friend and every
time you reach the flag and they don't you

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.989
score a point. The twist is that the levels
you play are designed by both you and your

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.739
friend. You each take turns placing hazards
and platforms in an attempt to sabotage your

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.390
opponent yet still make the level beatable
for yourself. God forbid that you play against

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.239
a troll who just wants to watch the world
burn*. What we really like about this from

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.329
a design standpoint is that level building
is not some tacked on feature that you'll

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.049
tinker with aimlessly for a few minutes. Instead,
it is given purpose by being placed within

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.000
the core of the game's idea much like Little
Big Planet.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.219
Sony's PlayStation 1 has been remembered as
an iconic and game changing console. When

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:14.409
it released one of its launched titles was
the similarly beloved anti-gravity racer Wipeout.

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.269
However, with both Wipeout and F-Zero being
dormant for more than a decade the anti-gravity

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.289
genre has been severely neglected. Nintendo
gave us a few F-Zero themed tracks in its

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:29.349
Mario Kart 8 DLC, but instead of appeasing
the gaming public's appetite it only made

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.180
it more acute. Thankfully, the original developers
of Wipeout have come together to make Formula

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.090
Fusion. It's the anti-gravity racing we all
know, faster and more adrenaline packed than

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.210
any other game with some sexy ass graphics
and a ruined city setting. It's back to the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.700
future, with Formula Fusion.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.780
Apartment literally means a separated place
and Nick, Apartment's main character, has

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.039
just separated from his long-time girlfriend.
He thinks she's never coming back and so is

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:19.020
left alone to console himself with his thoughts.
This leads him to narrate the past, which

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.430
is essentially what Apartment is. Through
multiple perspectives and a series of texts,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.120
Apartment pieces together and narrates the
past. But what's really neat about it is the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.530
way it does this. A series of texts doesn't
translate to slabs of words to be excruciatingly

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.940
read. The texts are unique and usually interactive,
such as when you are prompted to write out

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.830
the words to a character's story in the demo.
The other residents of the apartment complex

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.840
provide other perspectives that let you construct
your own narrative of the events. Consequently,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.030
this stops Apartment from being didactic or
intrusive and lets the player relate to the

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.000
game in their own way. It started out as a
student project, and now Apartment is continuing

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to tell stories in new ways.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.069
Kickstarter lets us bypass companies and publishers
to directly fund the games we want. The importance

00:06:21.069 --> 00:06:24.729
of this cannot be stressed more than by this
Banjo and Kazooie spiritual successor. In

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.940
a new Banjo game, people wanted a 3D platformer
with a big world full of collectibles to explore,

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.860
but after 10 years of waiting Microsoft gave
us a god damn build your own car game. But

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.020
alas, people power has saved the day. Yooka
Laylee is going to be a 3D platformer with

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.650
a big world full of collectibles and cartoony
characters. It's going to reek of the 90's

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.500
and early 3D gaming and that is exactly what
the people who funded this record Kickstarter

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.500
want. Perhaps the most important part to this
project is that it's being made by golden

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.340
age Rare employees who have collaborated before
and are truly passionate about making this

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.449
game. Not to mention, the proof that these
guys still have what it takes goes beyond

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:08.430
their logic of making the game players want.
Their trademark humour, best exhibited in

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.300
Conker, is already on display in the form
of Yooka Laylee's newest character Trowzer.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.300
He's a snake wearing trousers; literally a
trouser snake. In Yooka Laylee, we trust.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:23.680
Hey guys, hope you liked the new intro. That
was our kickstarter picks for May, thank you

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.020
for
watching, my name's Laurence, and my name's

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:28.000
Josh; we'll see you next time here on indieformer.
