Hi, my name is Jill Weiss, and I'm going to
give you a few tips, on how to go about looking

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:16.280
for youth shin guards, buying shin guards
for your soccer player. First things first,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.980
is you want to make sure that you are buying
shin guards, that fit that specific athlete.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:35.280
You don't want to buy an adult size for a
young athlete. The way that it should fit,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.171
it should mold to the shin. It should fit
comfortably, over that shin, because this

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:52.190
is going to protect that area. You want to
also have your athlete try on everything that

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:03.110
they normally would wear, to practice in competitions,
things like that. Cleats, socks, shin guards,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:12.359
all together. The guard should kind of fit,
right under the tongue of the cleat, right

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:21.109
at the ankle. In Velcro, it's tight enough
to where it's comfortable. It's going to stay.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:29.110
It's comfortable. This one is a little small
for me, so you want the shin to completely

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:37.219
cover that, and right below the knee. You
always want to wear socks over the shin guard.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:45.630
That's full protection. That's something they
need. Price wise, you don't have to spend

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.850
a ton of money, but you want it, it's something
that's going to last. Something that's going

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:00.580
to protect you. Young athletes especially,
full main protection is something that you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.909
want to focus on. Once they're a little bit
older, you can do it more . They're a little

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:14.170
thinner, and mold to the shin, but you want
full protection, for those young beginner

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:21.520
athletes, so those are just a few tips on
what to look for on buying soccer shin guards.
