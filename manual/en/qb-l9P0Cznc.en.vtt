00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The Swedish brand Josse Car was in 1994 very ambitious to build a sportscar

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
In cooperation with Volvo

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Unfortunately, the Indigo 3000 is the only car they have ever built

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
In 1999 Josse Car went bankrupt

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And now, in 2012, we are going to drive the Josse Car Indigo 3000 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This one is from 1998, one of the last Indigos every built

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And it is still a special car

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The 3.0 V6 from Volvo sounds very raw, thanks to the open exhaust

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:44.000
With 200hp+ and a weight of 1000kg, you can call it a sportscar

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It is a bit windy and cold today, but we don't care. Let's get on the highway!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
My head sticks out!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
That this is a sportive car is obvious

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The 3.0L V6 is in front

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
With more than 200hp and real wheel drive

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Very low to the ground and a very loud sound

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And I think we can call that sportive.
But it isn't very fast 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Ofcourse you can drive over 200km/h, but it isn't comfortable and it isn't fun

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You should drive this car to Italy and enjoy the roads, the sun and the sound

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The V6 is great in a small car like this.
No turbos or something like that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This car screams!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I am sure you have all seen that this is a special car

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
There are only 50 Josse Cars every built

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And have you ever heard about it? I didn't..

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But I do like the Josse Car Indigo 3000

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It is a very pure car

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.000
No brake assist, no ABS, no electronical at all

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Back in the days the Indigo 3000 costed about 100.000,- guilder (Dutch coin before euro)

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The value nowadays is around 35.000,- euro

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You didn't lost much money on the Indigo 3000

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Driving the Indigo 3000 is so much fun!
The wind trough your hair!

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
7000rpm!

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:35.000
We sound so much better, all that Italian junk..
This is pure!
