00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.430
This video shows the technique for making
a single-appointment bridge using Ribbond

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.440
reinforcement fiber, which is perhaps the
most common Ribbond application worldwide.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.909
These bridges are quick and easy to make and
very well received by patients. Please note

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:20.230
that this video is intended to provide an
overview of the procedure and that it is not

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.369
intended to be used in lieu of the instructions
that are included in the Ribbond kit.

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.710
A Ribbond bridge can be made either intra
or extra-coronally depending on the and the

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.779
particulars of the specific case.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.579
This video shows a case without preparations
to the abutments.&nbsp; Whether preparations are

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.329
used or not, the technique for making the
Ribbond bridge is more or less the same. If

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.230
the abutment teeth are periodontally mobile,
the Ribbond wings can be extended to multiple

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.899
abutments.

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.680
First, you will need to decide what to use
as a pontic. If you just extracted a natural

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.730
tooth you can use it as the pontic. You can
also make a pontic using an acrylic denture

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.719
tooth or a free hand composite build-up. you
will want to choose and shape the pontic prior

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.690
to making the Ribbond framework.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.140
Measure the area where the Ribbond will be
placed using the dead soft tinfoil provided&nbsp;in

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.050
the Ribbond kit, waxed dental floss can also
be used as well. Then cut the Ribbond to the

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.450
corresponding length.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.270
A small amount of tacky viscosity composite
can be used to help hold the template in position

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.600
Two layers of Ribbond will be used for making
the bridge framework. The first layer will

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.030
extend from abutment-to-abutment. the second
layer will double up against the first layer

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.080
only in the pontic area.&nbsp; Adapt the tinfoil
or dental floss to the teeth as you would

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.590
adapt the Ribbond. Cut or mark the end of
the template to indicate the length that will

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.960
needed to cut the Ribbond. Please note: you&nbsp;may
want to&nbsp;err on the side of cutting too much

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.530
rather than cutting too little as you can
trim the excess Ribbond&nbsp;before polymerizing

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.830
with the special Ribbond scissors.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.410
Cut open the plastic packaging and use cotton
pliers to extract the Ribbond. Cut the two

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.930
Ribbond pieces with the special Ribbond scissors.
Ribbond is made from the same ultra-high molecular

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.769
weight polyethylene fibers used to make bulletproof
vests and normal scissors will not cut it

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:11.319
cleanly.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.010
Reseal the Ribbond by Folding over the end
of the packaging and securing it with the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.430
paper clip. This will help to maintain Ribbond's
indefinite shelf life.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.109
Clean the teeth and prepare the teeth for
bonding. Clean, acid etch the teeth, and apply

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:28.379
the bonding adhesive using your standard bonding
technique and materials.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.469
Please note that since there is no clinical
evidence supporting the use of self-etching

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.739
resins for this type of retentive bonding,
we do not recommend using self-etching resins

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.400
for this procedure.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.769
Apply a thin layer of Ribbond Securing Composite
or soft filled composite to the teeth. We

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.489
don't recommend using a flowable composite
for this step because flowables tend to lack

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.030
the tackiness to hold the Ribbond in position
prior to curing.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.359
Ribbond, Inc. has a specially formulated filled
composite resin designed for bonding the fibers

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:04.170
to the teeth. It has a viscosity that is between
a flowable composite and a filled restorative

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.780
composite. This video shows the technique
using the Ribbond Securing Composite. If you

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:16.599
do not have the Ribbond Securing composite,
we have a list of some of the composite resins

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.200
that we recommend for this step of the procedure
from major manufacturers on our website.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.590
If using a paste viscosity composite, place
a thin bead of composite on the teeth, and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.700
then with an instrument, flatten it to mimic
the contours of the teeth. Flattening the

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.239
composite will make adaptation easier and
reduce the amount of composite that needs

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.950
to be displaced when placing the Ribbond.
Try to make this layer approximately half

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.680
a millimeter thick.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.139
Wet the first piece of Ribbond with a 4th
generation unfilled adhesive bonding resin.

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.810
After the Ribbond is wetted with the bonding
resin, you can now touch it with your fingers

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.439
or powder-free latex gloves.

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.609
Do not wet the Ribbond with a bonding resin
that contains a dentin primer or self-etching

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:02.590
component. If you do not have a suitable resin
already in your office, Ribbond, Inc. offers

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.739
the Ribbond Wetting Resin, which is specifically
designed for wetting Ribbond fibers.

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:12.400
Hold the wetted Ribbond with cotton pliers
and starting on one end, press the Ribbond

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.070
into the composite resin that was previously
applied to the teeth. Use your fingers or

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.950
instruments to press the Ribbond through the
composite closely against the tooth surfaces.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.760
Remember, the thinner the bond line is the
better the results so try to displace as much

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.480
composite as possible. This will not only
minimize bulk and aid in patient comfort but

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.470
it will also maximize the laminate effect
and increase longevity.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.560
Use cotton pliers and bring the Ribbond across
the edentulous area and gently adapt the Ribbond

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.140
into the composite on the other abutment.
Again, place the Ribbond as close to the surfaces

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:54.670
of the teeth as possible. If the Ribbond piece
is too long, cut the excess with the special

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.280
Ribbond scissors prior to curing.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.590
Try to make the Ribbond cross the pontic space
in a straight line, and orient the Ribbond

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.220
so that it is placed under the incisal edge
of the pontic. This way the forces from the

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.030
pontic will be directed onto the Ribbond framework.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.260
After placement, using the same thin tipped
instrument, carefully remove the excess composite

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.810
resin that was displace during the adaptation
of the Ribbond. Move the instrument parallel

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:26.160
to the lengthwise orientation of the Ribbond
to avoid accidentally displacing the Ribbond.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.470
After the first piece of Ribbond is adapted,
polymerize the framework according to the

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.500
composite manufacturer's instructions.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.970
Wet the second piece of Ribbond using the
Ribbond Wetting Resin or a bonding adhesive

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:40.120
that does not contain a dentin primer or acid
etchant.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.780
Place a thin layer of the same filled composite
that we used earlier in the procedure on the

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.620
lingual side of the Ribbond in the edentulous
area. Extend this composite layer onto the

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.650
interproximal angles of both abutments.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.620
Gently place the Ribbond against the layer
of composite. Try to maintain a 0.5 mm thickness

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.410
of composite resin between the two layers
of Ribbond.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.220
Polymerize the second piece of Ribbond.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.910
If using an acrylic denture tooth or a natural
crown as a pontic, cut a lingual channel to

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.070
accommodate the Ribbond framework. If using
an acrylic denture tooth, you will be relying

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.130
on mechanical retention so make undercuts
within the groove preparation to the acrylic

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.860
denture tooth. Small holes can be placed in
the groove for added mechanical retention

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.860
using a small burr. Fill the groove with composite,
seat on framework, check placement, and polymerize.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:40.460
Cover the Ribbond within the channel of the
pontic with composite to build up the lingual

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.860
side of the pontic.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.240
pontic or the pontic can also be constructed
freehand in place with composite.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.420
Cover the lingual surfaces of the Ribbond
bridge wings to make the prosthesis smooth

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.060
and comfortable for the patient. For extra
coronal applications we recommend a flowable

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.770
composite for covering the lingual wings on
the abutments. This can be applied in multiple

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.490
layers using a Microbrush or other small brush
to make the wings smooth and comfortable for

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.670
the patient.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.890
Do not use the Ribbond Securing Composite
for the covering layer as it is too tacky.

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.510
Ribbond fibers do not polish well but they
need to be covered with resin. You want to

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:17.480
avoid having to shape and polish the prosthesis
using rotary instruments.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.240
When the covering layer is finished, thoroughly
cure.
