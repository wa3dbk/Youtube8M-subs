How To Book Publishing
Is It Really Possible to Leap-Frog You Over

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.830
Your Competition and Catapult Your Business
to the Top of Your Industry?

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.510
Here's the Problem:
You want to grow your business, get more clients,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.190
increase your market share and generate more
revenue.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.800
But, with so much competition out there, and
everyone vying for more and more online recognition,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.650
it's really hard to get your business noticed.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.529
Big business can easily capture the attention
of your clients and steal them away from you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.739
because they have the big dollars to spend
on lengthy advertising campaigns.

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.762
But, for small to medium size businesses,
it's a real struggle to get your name in the

00:00:36.762 --> 00:00:40.969
spotlight and make your business "stand out"
in the vast sea of new start-ups and well

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.899
established companies.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.460
The good news is, there is a solution that
works like magic to propel local businesses

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.620
to the top in their field.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.449
It's a fact that authors are seen as "Authority
Figures" no matter what the industry.

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.079
In other words, because they wrote a book,
people automatically "see them" as the expert

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.179
and seek them out to help them solve their
problemsâ€¦

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.910
Often times with a willingness to pay a premium
price for their knowledge and skill set, just

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.180
because they wrote a book.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.010
It's no secret that being an author can almost
magically transform your business into a profitable

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550
entity for years to come.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.280
The only drawback - Getting your book written
and published could take years to happen.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.910
Well, luckily for you, what used to seem like
it would take a lifetime to accomplish, now

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.020
