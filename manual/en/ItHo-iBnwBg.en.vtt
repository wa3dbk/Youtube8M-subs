00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.940
Compact

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.680
Easy to Maneuver

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.500
Simple to Operate

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.280
Outdoor Use

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.600
Hi, I'm Mark from MAX_Mobility and today I'm going to show you the techniques you need to know

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.380
to get the most out of your SmartDrive outside.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.180
Let's go.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.640
Turning with the SmartDrive is the same as
turning without the SmartDrive.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.860
You simply lightly brake on the side you want to turn towards and your wheelchair will go that way.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.440
With the SmartDrive powered,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.260
it will kind of feel like when your coasting downhill and you're turning into a turn.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.720
So the SmartDrive is keeping you going even when you're on a level surface

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.120
and you're turning around a corner.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:12.109
Let's take a look.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.820
Another way to turn with the SmartDrive is
to break with the inside hand

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.980
and push with the outside hand to get around the corner.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.920
Cross-slopes, or side-slopes, are everywhere.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.840
They allow water to drain off of sidewalks,
parking lots and driveways.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.480
Without a SmartDrive, cross-slopes can be difficult. But with the SmartDrive, cross-slopes can be very easy.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.620
Let's take a look.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.120
With the SmartDrive turned OFF on a side-slope,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.140
I have to continually push with my downhill
hand to keep going straight,

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.820
otherwise the wheelchair will turn a fall down the hill.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.280
So with the SmartDrive turned ON, you simply give it a push, brake with your uphill hand

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.820
and the chair will go straight while on a cross-slope.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.660
When you're turning with the SmartDrive it's important not to turn too sharp

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.360
or too quickly for the environment you're in.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.260
You'll know if you're turning too sharply or quickly because you will lose traction

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.780
and start to drift into the corner.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.840
The trick is to hit the button, stop the motor and push at a more reasonable speed for that corner.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.880
The SmartDrive has small rollers on the wheel which allows it to smoothly float over surfaces.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.640
However, you need to be careful so it doesn't get caught on things like curbs or small sidewalk cracks.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.400
Be careful when you're turning.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.680
It's better to think of it like a railroad track and go diagonally up and over the bump,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.740
and not turn directly into it.

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.960
Pushing up into a van can be tough. With the SmartDrive, it's easy.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.100
However, it's important to practice.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.080
The best way to climb a ramp is to go as slow as possible.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.600
It's a very confined space, and you don't want to get into trouble.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.660
From the base of the ramp, push as slow as you can to engage the motor, then allow it to do the work.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.040
Once you get all the way in, you want to press the button and power it off.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.020
Climbing a ramp with the SmartDrive is simple.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.150
Pick the speed you want to go up the ramp
with that first push,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.150
and be ready to stop at the top.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.110
So first push to get a nice comfortable
speed; and then be ready to stop at the top of the ramp.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.560
It's always safest to turn OFF the SmartDrive before going downhill.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.180
That way to don't accidentally
activate the motor and find yourself in trouble.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.260
That way you can easily stop at the end of
the ramp.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.120
If you forget to power OFF your SmartDrive before going down a hill,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.440
it's important to know how to keep it from turning on.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.280
The SmartDrive is sensitive to acceleration.
So the trick is to not accelerate

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.800
and go as slow as possible, at a nice, even speed all the way down,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.120
and brake to a near complete stop before the end, just to be safe.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.240
When starting on a hill with the SmartDrive, feel free to start sideways to the hill so
you can rest and get ready.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.840
Once you're ready, turn into the hill, give it a first push

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.640
and then you can do successive pushes to get to the speed you want to climb the hill at.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.420
So turn into the hill, give it a push and let the SmartDrive start to go.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.000
If you want to go faster, push a little bit faster and climb the hill.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.640
If at any time you need to stop,
the SmartDrive has anti-rollback

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.780
which keeps you from going back too fast.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.720
Just grab the rims do another push and get going again.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.680
Two things you should know about when using
your SmartDrive when going through doorways.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.200
The first is how to negotiate over the door
threshold, or that bump that's inside the doorway.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.960
And the second one is what to do
in case anti-rollback fights you

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.400
 and makes it difficult to roll backwards.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.640
So the trick with the door threshold is to lean back a bit

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:08.620
and allow your casters to float up over
the door threshold smoothly.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.180
If the anti-rollback comes on while you're going through the door, just pause;

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.820
it will turn off and allow you to freely go through the door.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.620
It's important that you pay attention to things like sidewalk cracks, roots and obstacles

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.760
while you're cruising in your SmartDrive.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.760
If you are not careful and hit one hard enough, it can dump you out on the ground,

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.780
and you can get seriously hurt.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:37.060
So pay attention, watch where you're going and do whatever you can to minimize the impact of those cracks on your travel.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.120
The trick with cracks is (1) know they are there,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.420
and (2) get the weight off your casters so they can float over the crack.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:49.440
So as you approach the crack, you want
to lean back and give it a little bit of a push

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.960
so your casters float up and over the
crack.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.180
It's important that you know your limitations, and the limitations of the SmartDrive.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.280
If the crack is too big, the SmartDrive is not
going to help you and it may get you into trouble.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.420
It's best to deactivate the motor,
negotiate the crack manually

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.240
and then get under power again.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.000
While the SmartDrive will allow you to drop off curbs and climb curbs,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.200
it doesn't help you do either one of them.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.620
So it's best to turn the unit OFF before you are going to do that.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.540
That way you don't accidentally turn it on when doing a wheelie before dropping
off a curb.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.200
It's important that you protect your SmartDrive while you're travelling,

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.880
otherwise someone could mishandle it, drop it, break it and you're out for the trip.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.160
If you are getting into a cab, transfer in normally, and then tell the cab driver how to take the unit off

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.780
and have him hand you the drive unit and battery, and put it in the front with you.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.000
You don't want it in the trunk, rolling around, possibly getting broken.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.540
If you are travelling by plane, use your SmartDrive just like normal.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.400
Ride all the way down to the door of the plane, transfer onto the transfer seat

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.420
and then ask the attendant to take the SmartDrive off,

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.900
and the SmartDrive will go in the overhead
bin next to your luggage.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.700
The SmartDrive does have a Lithium-Ion battery,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:12.760
but it is compliant all airline regulations. Happy travels.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:21.050
So now you know everything you need to know to get the most out of your SmartDrive outside.

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.230
Be careful, have fun,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.410
and from all of us at MAX_Mobility, thanks for choosing SmartDrive.
