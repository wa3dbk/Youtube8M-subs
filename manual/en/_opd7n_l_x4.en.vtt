00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.400
The piece of work that I’m choreographing for these students, 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.220
for the Aboriginal dance ensemble, is called “Gapan”. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.520
It’s inspired by Bangarra’s landmark work called “Ochres”.  

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.620
So I’ve taken bits out of “Ochres” and another piece 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.930
called “Dry Mud”, and reworked it for schools. 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:53.530
My name is Karwin Knox from Tamworth and I go to Peel High. 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.530
Working with Sidney has been really good. 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
I know he’s been dancing with the Bangarra dance group 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.040
for a while now and I see that as an opportunity 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:19.040
to do my best in front of him. 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.820
It’s been really inspiring being able to work with all 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:36.130
these other kids who love to dance just as much as you. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.650
I’m Sharnae Widders-Smith.  I come from Armidale.  

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.630
I go to Armidale High School. 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.540
I enjoy it ‘cause I love dancing. 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.150
And I just like meeting new people, and new dance styles.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.250
It’s not an easy thing to pick up the style of Bangarra 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.630
because it’s not just steps. 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.750
You have to learn the emotion that comes behind it, 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.750
and where it comes from - 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.260
the earth or the sky, or the animals. 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.940
You really have to pick up on that and it has to 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.930
come from within you and not from the external stuff. 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.560
And so I think the kids who are learning now are slowly 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.760
developing that essence and where it comes from. 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.940
And how Bangarra makes it look so easy on stage is because 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:42.350
it does come from these essences.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.570
It’s been really good that I got into this place 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.070
and I sort of experienced a new level of dancing, 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.370
and I’ve just been loving it here. 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.270
It’s just amazing you know. 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:21.980
I can’t wait to come back and enjoy it again.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.180
The process this year sort of worked for us. 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.460
We went out and auditioned these kids, and they came along 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.780
and they were hungry for it, you know?

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.370
I was just begging to myself, “Just please let me make it in”, 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.680
and when I found out I made I was just all teeth, 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.280
all happy and that.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.370
‘Cause I’ve spent years learning from traditional communities and stuff, 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.690
their dance style and techniques, and now I’ve transferred all 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.090
that into contemporary style and movement. 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.590
And it’s about, since it’s been given to me it’s about, 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.690
handing it down, passing it down to the next generation. 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.690
So it’s been fantastic watching it develop and grow.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.100
I just want to keep on working myself up and 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.880
keep on practising, so I just hope in the future I can be a member 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.470
of the Bangarra dance.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.000
I think it’s very, very, very exciting for them - 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.800
cause I’m from a small country town like most of these kids.  

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.480
Back in my day I had nothing like this. 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.900
So you know for them to actually grab onto this opportunity 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.400
and have a go, it’s fantastic.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.933
I want to learn the basics and then come back and do it even better!
