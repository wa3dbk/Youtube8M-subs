00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.019
Summarizing briefly the Global MBA program
is a big challenge. It is a challenge because

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.640
we have worked on this program for the past
two years and have come up with an innovative

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.820
strategy where participants would do a lot
of things in a one year time period.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.910
Also we conceptualized the program which is
in one year we give a generalist MBA flair

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:39.399
plus we bring in the strengths of ESSEC Business
School which is a 104 years old and has many

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:50.409
innovative concepts, innovative ideas and
strengths which we all build in this program.

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.920
We included some topics which are "frontier
courses". These "frontier courses" have been

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.089
decided after much analysis. We analyzed the
top 100 business schools in the world, understood

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:13.970
what they offer, how they are offered and
what changes they would like to do.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.360
The ideal candidate is an open-minded, curious,
and responsible individual who has the ability

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:28.310
to move out of her or his comfort zone and
to think out of the box.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.539
I believe that the career development would
be an integral part and why is it so, because

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.420
most of the participants would like to enhance
their career and to have better opportunities

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.899
when they graduate from this Global MBA program.

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.700
Any educational background at a Bachelor level
minimum is suited when applying for a MBA.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:57.630
Majors can be in engineering, business economics,
science, law and others...

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.580
