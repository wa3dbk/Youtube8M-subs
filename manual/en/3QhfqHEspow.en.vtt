00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Nowadays, the streets are abuzz with my name.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
This world's stylishness makes a splash.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.400
Attention everyone,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.300
I'll humbly be taking...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.600
... all of the fashionable items in the world.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.000
Sincerely,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.000
A Sharp Dressed Thief

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.100
Ah, you've got me now. This and that too...

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.300
So wonderful, fascinating.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.000
Strange, sharp dressed humans.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.400
High collar propaganda.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
Necessary modernism.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.400
Again today I prowl the town.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.100
Keep a lookout.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.600
Heart pounding,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.400
5 seconds before I go for it,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.400
a high fashion revolution.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.000
The world envies me.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.600
I'm a charisma thief.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.400
Don't have enough,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.200
have enough,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.000
still don't have enough.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.800
Until I've stolen...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.500
... six billion fashions,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.200
I cannot die!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.800
To be frank,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.400
I am the best.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.000
The world envies me,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.800
a high collar burglar.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.500
A fashion that I...

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.800
don't know of...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.200
certainly...

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.500
does not exist!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800
Alright, it begins.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The world's greatest,

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.300
unprecedented

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.400
fashion show.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.600
A pure and simple

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.900
reception.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.200
Shall we begin...

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.900
a fashion coup d'etat? Now...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.600
Again today I prowl the town.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.300
Keep a lookout.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.800
Curbing sweat,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.800
5 seconds before I go for it,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.300
a high fashion revolution.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.800
I deceive the world.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.200
I'm a charisma thief.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.100
Don't have enough,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.000
have enough,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.700
still don't have enough.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.400
Until I've plundered...

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.300
... six billion fashions,

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.000
I cannot die!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.700
Whatever you say,

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.200
I am the best.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.800
The world envies me,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.500
a high collar burglar.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.300
A fashion that I...

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.500
don't know of...

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.200
certainly...

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.600
does not exist!
