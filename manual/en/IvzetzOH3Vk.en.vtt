00:00:11.507 --> 00:00:13.098
(Finebros) So what're we 
having you play today?

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:15.991
I have no idea what...Goat Simulator? What?

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.504
What? Wait, what?

00:00:17.504 --> 00:00:19.651
Goat Simulator! I love this game.

00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:22.708
You play as a goat!
I mean, there's nothing better.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.505
Yes, I bought this game.
I have this game.

00:00:26.225 --> 00:00:27.016
I know this game.

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:31.683
I'm really, really, really hoping
that I'm gonna be a goat, roaming around.

00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:36.304
Okay. I'm already a goat.

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:37.810
I'm a goat.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.532
I knew it!

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:42.708
Oh, I love goats!

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:45.457
I'm a goat! Wait, am I the goat?
That's me, right?

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:46.722
Flippin' easy.

00:00:46.953 --> 00:00:49.278
Well, if it's flippin' easy, I'm gonna 
feel bad if I'm not good at it.

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:50.842
You guys aren't helping me out, huh?

00:00:50.842 --> 00:00:52.969
Nothing. You're not telling me anything.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.304
I don't know what I'm doing, you guys.

00:00:56.114 --> 00:00:58.316
What am I doing?
I'm scooting on my butt?

00:00:59.016 --> 00:01:03.076
Can you help me with anything?
I'm in a gated community.

00:01:03.076 --> 00:01:04.538
Can I get out?

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.788
- I like the music.
- (goat bleats loudly)

00:01:07.748 --> 00:01:09.897
- (goat bleats)
- (laughs)

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:13.162
I am like Kusko.

00:01:13.162 --> 00:01:14.213
Let's make him 'baa'.

00:01:14.222 --> 00:01:16.291
(goat bleats demonically)

00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:19.457
That is not a cute baa.

00:01:19.457 --> 00:01:22.499
What's in my mouth?
Oh, that's a tongue.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.672
Let's lick someone.

00:01:23.672 --> 00:01:24.545
Can I lick you?

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:29.100
Lick the bench?
I get points for licking a bench.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.778
I'm gonna go lick a person.

00:01:31.968 --> 00:01:33.632
Come here!

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:36.992
- Oh!
- (people scream)

00:01:36.992 --> 00:01:38.710
No, no! I just wanna lick you!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.785
(people scream)

00:01:42.815 --> 00:01:44.879
I am so confused!

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:46.275
I want to lick this.

00:01:48.615 --> 00:01:49.840
What did I do?!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.979
What did I do?

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.343
What, is he dead?

00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:58.240
I thought this was gonna be a happy game.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.038
Oh yeah, you're mine. Bye!

00:02:00.798 --> 00:02:02.323
Head butt goat!

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.256
(people scream)

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:07.223
Oh my god!
Did you see that?

00:02:07.713 --> 00:02:09.409
My goat did that.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.297
Are you okay?

00:02:13.827 --> 00:02:15.105
You okay, buddy?

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.311
Oh, he's alive!
I thought I killed him.

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:24.980
Oh my god, there's a party.

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:26.775
Time to go crash this party.

00:02:26.927 --> 00:02:28.831
- Hello!
- (people scream)

00:02:29.141 --> 00:02:30.295
Hi!

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:33.024
I'm guessing the point 
of the game is to kill people?

00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.065
Right? With the goat?

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:37.498
I don't understand how you can make
me play a game where I'm a goat

00:02:37.498 --> 00:02:40.284
and not tell me the objective of it,
expecting me to figure out

00:02:40.284 --> 00:02:43.366
why I'm a goat that licks and kills people.

00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:46.031
(people scream)

00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:50.476
This is so much fun.

00:02:51.386 --> 00:02:52.902
This game's still so much fun.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.656
Hey, man.

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:58.788
I'm just...what's going on, guys?

00:02:58.788 --> 00:03:00.292
What're you making here?

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:03.952
Oh! I'm so sorry! I am so sorry.

00:03:03.961 --> 00:03:06.097
Let's run into cars.
Let's go.

00:03:07.971 --> 00:03:09.326
Oh, it didn't work!

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:10.670
Is there a way to get up to the crane?

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.884
Hmm! RV, RV, RV! 
I did not move in time.

00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:14.858
(chuckles)

00:03:16.877 --> 00:03:18.315
Oh!

00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:23.149
(bleep)

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.518
I'm trying to kiss her and make it better.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.724
(person screams)

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:32.768
Can I drive?!
Ooh, can we go drive?

00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:35.971
That was the wrong bu--(GASP)

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.063
I'm practically driving.

00:03:39.064 --> 00:03:41.111
Guys? Guys? Are you watching this?

00:03:41.507 --> 00:03:42.718
Oop, I died.

00:03:42.718 --> 00:03:44.062
Wait! I'm alive?

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:45.905
What the?!

00:03:45.905 --> 00:03:49.149
What's the objective of the game?
I still don't get it.

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:50.803
Okay, this is a terrible game.

00:03:50.803 --> 00:03:52.345
Ooh, ladder! A goat can climb ladders.

00:03:52.345 --> 00:03:53.742
That's science.

00:03:53.742 --> 00:03:55.950
If I can get--
Oh!

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.450
Is he using his mouth?
That's impressive.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.970
He climbs up with his neck.
That's the best way to climb.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.797
Um...

00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:05.105
What?

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:09.229
Ooh! More ladders.
Hmm? Nope. No.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:10.474
Oh, I gotta walk around?

00:04:10.474 --> 00:04:12.752
Really? Why they gotta
make this so difficult?

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:13.829
Oh!

00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:18.514
Okay. Well, that was a fail.

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:20.327
Here we go!

00:04:21.113 --> 00:04:22.017
Okay.

00:04:22.431 --> 00:04:23.817
Ooh, a person! Let's push him off.

00:04:24.692 --> 00:04:25.955
Oh, he looked so happy. Oops!

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.853
(laughs) Didn't mean to do that.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.423
Will this explode?

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.022
Ooh!

00:04:33.327 --> 00:04:35.075
Okay. Wasn't expecting that.

00:04:35.075 --> 00:04:36.547
(laughs)

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:38.582
Oh!

00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:41.513
That was awesome!

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:43.377
(goat bleats and people scream)

00:04:43.377 --> 00:04:45.603
Oh, I just scared them.
Come back here!

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.658
Ugh! Wha--?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.510
Whoa!

00:04:52.037 --> 00:04:53.940
Hacks? Whoa! I'm a--

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.629
What?!

00:04:56.826 --> 00:04:59.391
Ooh! (laughs)

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:01.913
I can play this game for so long.

00:05:01.913 --> 00:05:03.583
How long am I going 
to have to play this for?

00:05:04.483 --> 00:05:06.794
Ooh! Can I lick it?
Can I lick this thing?

00:05:06.794 --> 00:05:08.985
Ooh! Ah! Ah!

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.273
What do I do?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.277
Oh, geeze! (laughs)

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.258
Here we go.

00:05:16.832 --> 00:05:18.299
What? No!

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.056
Last time it carried me in the air
and then just detached to my back.

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:24.871
Whoa! Whoa!

00:05:25.363 --> 00:05:26.561
Goat, no!

00:05:27.303 --> 00:05:30.504
This can't be the end.
This can't--go towards the pool!

00:05:31.414 --> 00:05:33.164
Come on! It's empty!

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.493
No! Oh...(laughs)

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:38.855
It's Grand Theft Auto for goats.

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:40.561
How do I backflip?

00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:44.282
No! No!

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:49.970
Satan? This is why you don't screw 
around on trampolines, guys!

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.649
Okay, well...

00:05:51.678 --> 00:05:53.480
(mashing keys)

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.060
What did--wha!

00:05:56.952 --> 00:05:58.846
He's going to hell.
He's Satan. I told you!

00:05:58.846 --> 00:06:00.022
A gas station?

00:06:00.838 --> 00:06:03.274
Not on my watch!
I just nut-shotted him.

00:06:04.208 --> 00:06:05.888
I wish there was 
an achievement called Nut Shot.

00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:09.433
Oh my god, that scared me!

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:10.947
Okay, let's try looking--

00:06:10.947 --> 00:06:12.645
Oh! I...

00:06:14.002 --> 00:06:15.898
I'm taking this girl with me.
I don't even care.

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:17.807
We're gonna die together.

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:22.536
I like the irony of the fire extinguisher 
right next to my dead body.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.065
(Finebros) That's enough for today.

00:06:24.782 --> 00:06:26.146
That was so weird!

00:06:26.146 --> 00:06:27.651
This is a popular game?

00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:29.774
Why would you play a game 
without an objective?

00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:30.955
That was so awesome!

00:06:30.955 --> 00:06:32.192
I could play this forever.

00:06:33.202 --> 00:06:35.176
Honestly, I could play this forever.

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.894
Thank you so much for watching 
me kill people as a goat.

00:06:38.894 --> 00:06:41.475
This is an all new channel 
with all new shows.

00:06:41.475 --> 00:06:42.838
Don't forget to subscribe.

00:06:42.838 --> 00:06:45.463
Let us know in the comments what game 
you want to see us play next.

00:06:45.463 --> 00:06:47.224
Bye! (laughs)
