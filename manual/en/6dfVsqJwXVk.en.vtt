Hey guys, welcome to the TSM house!

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.780
We just moved here pretty recently and as
you can see, I got a little dog here actually.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.340
Right now, it's just pretty much like boxes
of like gear and computers.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.300
It's still kind of like in the making as you can see because itâ€™s kind of messy right now.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.640
Let's go to the kitchen. The kitchen is pretty
small, but we have a nice little microwave

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.680
for Dyrus and Turtle to burn down the house and we have a little fridge we put a couple things in.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.260
We have eggs. We have Jell-o shots. We have some lasagna, some apple juice, some oranges

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.070
and some broccoli when we're healthy.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.140
We can go check out the first couple rooms. This is my room. I think it's one of the bigger ones.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.180
It's fairly nice. I made it kind of
cozy. I have my moving box. I have a place

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.520
for my dog to stay when we're practicing.
That's pretty much it for this room.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.939
We can head to the bathroom.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.610
We have two bathrooms in the house. This is
the first one. Finally, the toilet has been

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.250
unclogged because Dyrus and Turtle got food poisoning so it actually got clogged.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.640
This is a nice little shower and sink and everything.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.560
As you can see, it's Xpecial's room.
This is like clothes, bed, window and that's
just pretty much it.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.160
I think this is OddOne and Reggie's room.
Reggie is not actually going to be living here,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.960
but right now he just has his...he just
has like a mattress that he sleeps on.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.510
As you can see, this room is just mostly used
for sleeping.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.990
So, we have another bathroom in here. Much
like the other one, you can see it's actually

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.660
a little bit bigger. It's a little bit nicer
too with the tiles and the mirror is a bit bigger.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.360
This is where Dyrus sleeps and this is where Turtle sleeps.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.900
They chose to share a room to get less chores.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.720
Dyrus has a lot of plushies on his bed. This
is actually pretty funny. Dyrus was accusing

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.280
C9 of stealing his plushies because they accidentally
got one his plushies when they were all in

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.800
a bag downstairs. Pretty much it for this
room. Not too much, all the walls are pretty much blank.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:21.620
Here's OddOne watching SK vs. Fnatic, I think.
Dyrus, Turtle. Say "hi" to the camera Turtle.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.870
Nice guy Turtle.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.530
XSpecial! "Hi".

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.680
This is my desk. I have a fish at my desk
actually as you can see over here.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.040
We have a little fridge over here too which has water and caffeine pretty much.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.650
This is our new place. It's a little bit smaller
than last time, but it's a lot more cozier

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.750
and now we all sit in the same room so I feel we kind of bonding a bit more than the old house.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.360
It's a really nice place in town. It's in
Santa Monica so we all really like it.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.500
So, I hoped you liked it. I hope you enjoyed
the house tour and I'll see you guys.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.530
Bye HyperX, thanks for coming!
