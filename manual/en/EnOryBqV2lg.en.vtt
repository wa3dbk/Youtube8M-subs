00:00:00.384 --> 00:00:01.235
- [Apple] Looks like a beautiful night

00:00:01.235 --> 00:00:03.458
for racing at the Twisted Mansion.

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:04.291
- [Orange] Meh.

00:00:04.291 --> 00:00:06.275
I was looking forward to the
Curvy Bungalow, but it'll do.

00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:08.157
- [Apple] Man, this
controller's really heavy,

00:00:08.157 --> 00:00:10.297
I didn't expect it to be real gold.

00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:11.343
(laughs)

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.374
(laughs) Nice Prius, Mario.

00:00:13.374 --> 00:00:15.925
- [Orange] Seriously, the
guy looks like a hair dryer.

00:00:15.925 --> 00:00:18.674
- [Apple] Three, two, one.

00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:19.741
Go!
- And they're off,

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:21.735
and Orange is the winner. (laughs)

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:23.142
- [Apple] We haven't
even started the race.

00:00:23.142 --> 00:00:24.317
You can't call yourself a winner, yet.

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:25.150
- [Orange] Yeah, sure I can.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.410
All right, okay what am I gonna get?

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.243
All right green shell,

00:00:28.243 --> 00:00:30.783
♫ I'm on a Highway to Shell

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:32.616
and you're going down!

00:00:33.552 --> 00:00:35.503
Ah, man, I spoke too soon.

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:36.635
- [Apple] Stupid banana peels,

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.322
I can't hit anything with these.

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.276
Where were you on that
one, golden controller?

00:00:40.276 --> 00:00:42.143
- [Orange] What? Are you just peeling out?

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:43.084
Hey! Watch it, Toad.

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:44.126
You're all over the road.

00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:45.034
Where'd you get your license?

00:00:45.034 --> 00:00:45.867
- [Apple] Okay, okay.

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:46.700
Here we go golden controller.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.696
Give me something good, give it good.

00:00:48.696 --> 00:00:49.686
Oh yeah, red shell!

00:00:49.686 --> 00:00:51.510
I got a red shell with
your name on it, Orange.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.343
- [Orange] Yeah, right.

00:00:52.343 --> 00:00:53.550
- Oh, no
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.383
Eat green shell.

00:00:54.383 --> 00:00:55.801
- [Orange] Oh, eat red shell.

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:57.384
- [Both] Oh, no, no!

00:00:57.384 --> 00:00:58.976
We got hit at the same time.

00:00:58.976 --> 00:00:59.966
Jinx!

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.035
You owe me a coke.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:03.787
No, you owe me a coke. (laughing)

00:01:03.787 --> 00:01:05.977
- [Apple] Aw, no, he slimmed me.

00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:07.303
- [Orange] See, this is
why windshield wipers

00:01:07.303 --> 00:01:09.146
should be standard on all Mario Karts.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.561
- [Apple] Ew, it's like he ate
a pen and then puked it up.

00:01:11.561 --> 00:01:14.160
- [Orange] Gross, seriously
what a naughty little squirt.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.302
(laughs)

00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:17.138
- [Apple] Whoa, I'm actually
ahead of you for once.

00:01:17.138 --> 00:01:18.394
Aw, crap, I hit the wall.

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:19.928
- [Orange] (laughs) Looks
like you spoke too soon.

00:01:19.928 --> 00:01:21.400
- [Apple] What? How did you go from--

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.343
- [Orange] Magic.

00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:23.786
(frustrating yelling)

00:01:23.786 --> 00:01:25.639
(laughs) Use your words. (laughs)

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.367
- [Apple] My words are
I'm gonna get you, Orange.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:29.279
- [Orange] Gotta catch me first!

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:30.112
Yeah!

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:31.070
- [Apple] Oh, don't you worry about that.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.149
I'm only at 7, I'm gonna catch
up to you, just you wait.

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.734
- Oh, yeah.
- Get him toad.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:35.935
- [Orange] Toad, get outta here Toad.

00:01:35.935 --> 00:01:37.968
- [Apple] I love you, Toad.

00:01:37.968 --> 00:01:38.880
- [Orange] What'd you just say?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.767
- [Apple] Oh, yeah, gold mushroom.

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:40.804
Coming at you. Here we go.

00:01:40.804 --> 00:01:44.107
Gonna catch up to you in no time. (laughs)

00:01:44.107 --> 00:01:45.450
Oh, man.
(Orange laughs)

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.275
You know, Bowser's definitely
not built for control,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:48.730
but if you like slamming into walls,

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.066
he's pretty good at that.

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.224
Thanks, golden controller.

00:01:51.224 --> 00:01:52.755
- [Orange] What's that, I'm
sorry, were you talking?

00:01:52.755 --> 00:01:54.994
I can't hear you all the way
up here at third! (laughs)

00:01:54.994 --> 00:01:56.269
(frustrated yelling)

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:57.863
Whoa, who hit the midget switch?

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.035
- [Apple] That's little switch!

00:01:59.035 --> 00:01:59.868
- [Orange] Well, pardon me,

00:01:59.868 --> 00:02:02.972
but I think it's irresponsible
to shrink and drive. (laughs)

00:02:02.972 --> 00:02:04.370
- [Apple] Hardy-har-har-har.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.745
- [Orange] Yeah, you could
say I'm a hit-and-pun driver.

00:02:06.745 --> 00:02:07.912
(laughs)
- Ah, seriously?

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:08.899
- [Orange] Get it, hit and pun?

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.108
- [Apple] Yeah, I got it, I got it.

00:02:10.108 --> 00:02:11.055
- [Orange] It's a joke.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:11.899
- [Apple] You know, informing people

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.267
that your jokes are jokes,

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:14.876
doesn't actually make them funnier.

00:02:14.876 --> 00:02:16.975
- [Orange] I beg to differ. (laughs)

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:18.721
- [Apple] But then laughing at your jokes

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.118
doesn't make them funnier, either.

00:02:20.118 --> 00:02:21.603
- [Orange] Oh man, I
gotta pay attention more.

00:02:21.603 --> 00:02:22.799
I went down to fourth place.

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:23.863
- [Apple] Good, that means it'll be easier

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:25.255
for me to catch you.

00:02:25.255 --> 00:02:27.104
- [Orange] Meh, to be fair,
it'd be easier for you

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:29.322
to catch me if you were
good at this game. (laughs)

00:02:29.322 --> 00:02:30.345
- [Apple] Zip the lip.

00:02:30.345 --> 00:02:31.280
- [Orange] Oh what's that? Second place?

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.113
Yeah, that's right.

00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:32.946
I didn't like being in fourth place,

00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:33.995
so I choose to be second.

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:34.828
And what's this?

00:02:34.828 --> 00:02:36.036
Oh, oh, oh, yeah!

00:02:36.036 --> 00:02:38.446
First place, I win! I win!

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:40.366
- [Apple] There's still
one lap left, you idiot.

00:02:40.366 --> 00:02:42.059
- [Orange] He said from
sixth place. (laughs)

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:43.166
(frustrated yelling)

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:43.999
What's the matter?

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:44.837
Having problems there, bud?

00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:47.450
Maybe you should reload
your Bowser window. (laughs)

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.808
- [Apple] (laughs) Okay, that
was actually kind of funny.

00:02:49.808 --> 00:02:50.872
And kind of accurate.

00:02:50.872 --> 00:02:52.948
Every time I hit a
curb, I'm like, "Turn!",

00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:55.851
but my cart's all like,
404: File not found.

00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:56.684
- [Orange] Dude, come on.

00:02:56.684 --> 00:02:58.673
Stop making it sound so nerdy.

00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:00.610
- [Apple] Whatever, I'm
gonna get an awesome item.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.931
Come on, come on, golden controller.

00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.764
What?

00:03:02.764 --> 00:03:03.789
You gave me a mushroom again.

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:04.622
(laughs)

00:03:04.622 --> 00:03:06.186
- Oh, oh, I'm in fifth
and you're in fourth.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.599
I'm catching up with you.
- Oh yeah.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.198
- Oh, now I'm in sixth again.

00:03:09.198 --> 00:03:10.071
- Sorry there, little buddy.

00:03:10.071 --> 00:03:12.059
- I ran into a corner again.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.360
♫ Pa pa pa pasta face

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.607
♫ my my pasta face

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:15.655
(laughing)
- What?

00:03:15.655 --> 00:03:16.488
what are you doing?

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.652
- [Orange] I don't know, I
just felt like saying that.

00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:18.526
- [Apple] Oh, okay.

00:03:18.526 --> 00:03:19.359
Whatever.
- Come on, green shell,

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.300
don't fail me now.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.127
Ah, you failed me now, now, you're all--

00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:23.684
- What happened?
- You failed me, green shell.

00:03:23.684 --> 00:03:25.297
I'm never gonna give you
a good job recommendation,

00:03:25.297 --> 00:03:26.398
if you can't do your job well.

00:03:26.398 --> 00:03:27.231
- [Apple] Are you making a habit

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:28.329
of giving good job recommendations

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:29.488
to all the items in the game?

00:03:29.488 --> 00:03:30.686
- [Orange] Well, I have to for banana.

00:03:30.686 --> 00:03:32.011
I don't wanna hurt his peelings. (laughs)

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:32.844
- [Apple] Are you kidding me?

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:34.008
You just said that joke last race.

00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:35.023
- [Orange] All right, fifth place.

00:03:35.023 --> 00:03:36.017
Well, it's not great,

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:38.634
bit it's way better than eighth. (laughs)

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:41.041
- [Apple] This stupid golden
controller didn't help at all!

00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:42.023
- Nope.
(frustrated yelling)

00:03:42.023 --> 00:03:42.856
Ah, too bad.

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:43.861
- [Apple] It ain't over yet, though.

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:46.232
- [Orange] Well, it kind of is. (laughs)

00:03:46.232 --> 00:03:48.676
- [Apple] It ain't over until
the fat lady sings, Orange.

00:03:48.676 --> 00:03:50.350
- [Orange] Well, how about
when the orange sings?

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.433
- No.
♫ Yeah

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:52.595
- [Apple] No, stop it.

00:03:52.595 --> 00:03:53.797
That's horrible, stop it.
♫ Yeah, yeah, yeah
