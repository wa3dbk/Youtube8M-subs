00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.230
Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this next segment we are going to start

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.680
getting our water up to a boil, adding our
extract, and then getting our boil rolling.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.120
As we are getting in close to our boil, say
around one-hundred and ninety to two-hundred

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.210
degrees, we're actually going to turn off
the heat now and we are going to add some

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.039
of our malt extract. First we are going to
take our kettle off the main heat. Then we

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:32.270
are going to take the malt extract, which
has been soaking in hot water, and start mixing

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:44.839
it in very nice and slowly, trying to make
sure that it all gets blended in. Now, a tip

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:50.109
that you may not get from a lot of other brew
starters is that you don't actually want to

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.559
add all the malt extract right now. Instead,
we're going to add roughly half to two-thirds

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.309
of the extract. What this will prevent is
some of the caramely flavors which are sometimes

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.500
associated with extract brewing. The rest
of the extract we are going to add with about

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.960
fifteen to twenty minutes left. During this
process you want to continually stir to make

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.130
sure that everything is all mixed together
and that none of it is going to be left on

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.170
the bottom in order to scorch. Now that you've
got two-thirds or half of the extract put

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.050
in, just continually stir it, turn on your
heat and start working on getting it up to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.030
a boil. In particular, if you're going to
be using dry malt extracts, you never want

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.130
to add that while it's boiling, you want to
add that before hand or else it will clump

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.250
heavily and it will be very hard to break
into the solution. As you can see, we are

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.829
getting very nice and close to a boil and
you can actually start to see some of the

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:52.140
first bubbles come up. At this point, it's
going to be very important to start controlling

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:01.210
your temperature. You don't want a boil over.
At this point, you are going to start to want

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:11.750
to closely regulate your temperature and turn
down your heat. Now we are getting a nice

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.970
boil here. We want to turn down our heat so
that we don't reach any high levels. It's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.670
going to foam up, but with a little temperature
management you should be okay.
