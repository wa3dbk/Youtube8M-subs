Losing fat shouldn't be as hard as many people try to make it. People who are desperate to lose fat are often prone to take more risks (something that I try to help you avoid).

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:53.200
The truth is that with some basic principles you can make some serious progress toward fat loss without any major effort.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:05.600
Often a client will come to me looking for some hints that will help them shed weight quickly. I am always happy to tell them my 'secret' tips that are always surprisingly efective

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.800
In fact, many people have found these fat loss factor tips to make an easy ten pound difference as they get started on a new program.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:29.030
You might think that these suggestions are really hi-tech or mysterious, but in reality, they are basic principles that I've seen used successful, over and over again. Here they ar 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:52.430
1) Avoid 'white' food. This includes white breads, pastas, many cereal products, and even cracker-type snacks.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.620
Think about some more white things too., like flour, potato products, rice, and even processed milk and cheese products.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.840
Some white foods that are OK for you to eat are cauliflowers, fish, and chicken.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.650
2) Ditch the sodas and other drinks that have calories, sugar, or even artificial sweeteners. I don't want you to drink much coffee either

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:21.860
I want you to take in at least half the weight of your body in ounces of water. This means that if you weigh 250 pounds, you should be consuming 125 ounces of water every day

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.960
This will be essential for getting the fat loss process in gear.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:40.060
3) I've already taken you off white products, now you need to do away with wheat products. I don't care if the package says 'whole wheat' on it or not: it has to go

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.280
Check the ingredients of everything you're eating and if it has wheat in it, don't eat it.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:55.590
These three fat loss factor review rules are pretty easy to follow, aren't they? Sure, you'll have to adjust your habits a little bit, but it really won't be very hard once you get started

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.470
If you consistently adhere to these hints, you will be surprised at the progress you make in just a couple weeks.
