00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.390
One of things that separates National Cycle

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.880
from I would say many other companies

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.209
that do motorcycle accessories

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.759
You guys are strictly an American based company

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.939
Everything is made in the USA

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:19.359
and I'm assuming distributed worldwide

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.210
Absolutely. We distribute internationally

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.419
but everything we manufacture and sell

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.039
is manufactured in our facilities in Maywood, IL
a little bit West of Chicago

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.140
Who says USA doesn't manufacture
anything anymore? Exactly.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.110
We're one of the few and we pride ourselves in that
when everything's American made

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.770
All the materials that we use are
American made

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.260
So that's a big bonus

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.650
We can ensure quality fitments
because we do everything in house

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.590
at our factory

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.210
We do all of our engineering

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.250
All of our production. Everything gets done
at that facility

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.580
uh... that's terrific! One of things that I found

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.080
a little bit uh...well frankly a little offputting

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.600
is when i was ordering my

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.530
windshield combination

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.380
things that I franlky didn't realize is you 
have to be very careful

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.500
to order to the right mounting kit with the 
right windshild

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.630
That can be really tricky

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.820
Sure, and that's because things are bike
specific just because our fitments

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.680
cover so many different model years

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.900
We ensure quality fitment because we do
sell the mount kits separately than the windshield

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.800
because they are bike specific

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.350
But you guys kind of simplified that

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.120
with the Switchblade windshields
Some of the windshields fit a number of different model bikes

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.340
but the mount kits

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.790
also fit

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.820
different model bikes depending on the specifications
for the bike

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.020
and then another thing that also is
a good thing about National Cycle products is that

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.660
we guarantee all of our windshields to
work

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.010
with all of our light bars, and
our chrome lowers, our highway bars

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.750
So all National Cycle product will work together

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.240
as opposed to if you get one of our windshields

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.930
with another company's light bar, you don't know
if it's going to fit or not

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.520
to get everything from National Cycle it is
guaranteed to all fit together

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.090
Which brings me to another point

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.739
You guys are not just windshields

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.109
You guys have a full line of accessories

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:17.269
tell us something else that's not necessarily
a windshield type accesory

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.319
Mainly in the cruiser business
we have a full line of accessories. We have

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.439
everything from

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.369
chrome fender tips

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:26.359
to highway bars, light bars

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.089
everything...exhausts, Peacemakers exhaust
It is a sound-adjustable exhaust

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:35.109
and also our our quick release hard
saddlebags

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:41.689
our quck release passenger backrest with luggage rack
and also a fender tip for the rear

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.049
a full line of accessories from tip to tip
for cruiser motorcycles

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.969
American and metric motorcycles

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:54.759
I understand National Cycle is a relatively small company
How many people work at National Cycle

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.389
it's actually a family owner

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.189
and operated company

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.069
Barry Willey took the company over from his father

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.139
We've been in business since 1937

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.540
Including the factory and everything there is about
130 employees, we work shifts

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.999
obviously everything again in the
factory and in the office

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.199
engineering staff, production staff

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.819
that's everybody. About 130 of us

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:20.959
what's your role with

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.129
National Cycle

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.689
other than to do these shows and stuff?
I do a lot of the traveling and the shows, I'm on the road quite a bit
I handle a lot of our quality or returns for the company

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:33.479
my answer

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:40.479
I answer customer service related questions
Also a little bit of fitment questions

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.309
mainly customer service

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.559
calls and emails I try to get to

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.789
that's terrific Steve

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:50.359
thank you so much
thank you

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.489
Pleasure working with you guys
Thanks a lot
