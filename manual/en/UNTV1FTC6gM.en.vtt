00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:08.356
In this video you'll see how to create the leaves for your origami willow bonsai.

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:10.797
Start with a couple different sizes of paper.

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:17.020
Here we've got a one inch by two inch piece, and a three quarter inch by one and a half inches.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.828
These are both made out of tissue foil.

00:00:20.828 --> 00:00:26.446
Take the paper fold it in half to create a center line.

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:32.167
This acts as a point of reference for the rest of your folds.

00:00:32.167 --> 00:00:40.791
Take the corner, fold it from the center line so that the tip reaches over to the far side.

00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:49.789
and then crease along until you come to about the same distance from the top of the paper

00:00:49.789 --> 00:01:02.630
as from the  top to the center line, so it forms a square in the top corner. And do the same for the other side.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:13.527
Folding across from the center line, and then fold the overlap over to the other side.

00:01:13.527 --> 00:01:18.146
So this creates the stem part of your leaf.

00:01:18.146 --> 00:01:26.469
Now create a little crease just below where the first folds meet the side of the paper.

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:38.876
And then fold from the center fold over so that the tip is about half way across to the opposite side.

00:01:38.876 --> 00:01:45.761
And fold the other tip down so that it meets the fold of the previous tip.

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:49.111
Like that.

00:01:49.111 --> 00:02:02.414
And then the new tip that's formed, fold it over into the center, to form the top part of your leaf.

00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:10.642
Now to make the stem, you want to fold the bottom third, up towards the top,

00:02:10.642 --> 00:02:17.160
so that the tip ends up about half way between the fold and the top of the leaf.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:29.775
Then fold it back, and create a little indent underneath the fold, like this.

00:02:29.775 --> 00:02:35.225
And then crimp it together.

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:41.773
Then take your finger nail and crease the center of the stem.

00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:50.805
And then pinch it while at the same time pressing down on the top part of the leaf.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:55.218
and then do a little shaping to round the leaf a little bit.

00:02:55.218 --> 99:59:59.000
And there your go.
