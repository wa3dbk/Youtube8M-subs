00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:11.980
Bradshaw: Kyle Bradshaw from cruiser customizing,
Greg Beck from Tucker Rocky with his episode

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.130
eleven of Wednesday with Greg. Now Greg, every
time that we ride a motorcycle together we

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.939
usually have some sort of helmet communication
for the emergency where I need to get ahold

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.089
of you, there’s a whole lot of reasons to
have helmet communications, and as you can

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.380
see, they come in every shape and size.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.570
Beck: Well, Kyle, if you weren’t such a
sissy, we wouldn’t really need that (laughs).

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.609
Bradshaw: You’re right Greg. But, helmet
communications, on a serious note, is an extremely

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:39.430
important thing to have to have when riding
in a group

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.269
Beck: Yeah, and they’ve come a long was.
When I first, when I first started doing this,

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.000
the love-phone was the best communicator and
it was, simply, a tube, and a mouthpiece,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.170
and an earplug, and you talked, pretty much
through, through, the tube, like talking through

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.170
a straw.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.859
Bradshaw: Wow. Kinda like the string in cans
you had back in the old days, uh?

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.089
Beck: Yeah, pretty much, pretty much. With
the advent of Bluetooth, uh, they’re a lot

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.690
more useful, easier to work, and the prices
have come down dramatically.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.890
Bradshaw: As you can see here on the table
in front of me, the advance in technology

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.450
of motorcycle communications have come a long
way. Originally units were huge boxes that

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.950
were bolted to the outside of your helmet,
and this V1-() helmet is a great example of

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.140
an integrated unit. As you can see there’s
almost nothing on the outside of this helmet.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.860
And on the inside, you have just this little
nub. Lots of helmet manufacturers are putting

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.890
audio into the helmets straight from the factory.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.100
Beck: I know shark is coming out with one
that’s called sharktooth.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.566
Bradshaw: (laughs) If that’s not for you
or you already have a helmet that you truly

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:34.890
love and don’t want to give it up, they’ve
got all kinds of after-market options.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.890
Beck: True.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.979
Bradshaw: One of the major things you need
to take a look at when choosing a motorcycle

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.030
audio system is all the features and benefits.
Most of them offer Bluetooth, most of them

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.060
are wireless, rider to passenger, but there
are specific details,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.729
Beck: Yeah. You know, I, I, prefer to use
a fairly simple one. Uh, generally I won’t,

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.910
I don’t want to talk to anybody when I’m
riding the bike. Um, I do wanna listen to

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.619
my GPS, and, I do talk on the phone sometimes,
um, and it also has FM. Um, figure out what

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.920
you want. Do you wanna talk to someone, maybe
the passenger, another motorcyclist, a buddy,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.349
um, and then, buy a unit that will do that.
Um, also, your, your needs might change.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.140
Bradshaw: Absolutely. Now, these units are
usually purchased either as a single unit

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.340
or as a set. This scale-rider G4 and this
 () unit are two of my personal favorites

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.610
when it comes to, a rider-passenger set. Absolutely
easy to install, super simple to use, and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.190
they give you features and benefits that you
can’t find with any other unit.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.200
Beck: Yeah. When you’re using your intercom,
pay attention to the road (laughs), I mean,

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.400
we are motorcyclists, and we’re riding down
the road, it’s kinda dangerous, um , a lot

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.959
of accidents are caused by people, interfacing
with their GPS, and this is a, uh, another

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.990
distraction, so pay attention.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.489
Bradshaw: One other thing on the safety prompt
that I’d like to mention. Say you off your

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.519
motorcycle, and, you’re away from your phone,
you can’t get to it, maybe you’re pinned

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.380
under your motorcycle, and you can’t get
up. With one of these units you could hit

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.130
the button, which would active your telephone,
which would then allow you to call, emergency

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.569
911 or a family member, so you can get help
right away.

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.650
Beck: That’s a good idea. Yeah, that’s
pretty cool. Something that I never really

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.951
thought about was uh, a friend of mine said,
in some of the units that there’s two people

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:27.269
involved, you're riding two-up, and, the person
on the back has the command unit, they can

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:33.200
call ahead to a restaurant for you, they can
take incoming calls easier, safer, so, something

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.200
to consider.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.500
Bradshaw: So for a lot of us our motorcycles
are the way to escape. The way to get away

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.599
from life, and to think, and to have alone
time to ourselves.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.599
Beck: Yeah.

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.390
Bradshaw: Having a communication not only
allows you to be able to, still have your

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.440
peace and serenity, but allows you to reach
out to the outside world if the necessity

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.440
arise, arises.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.440
Beck: Yeah, cool.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.790
Bradshaw: Thanks for joining us for this,
episode eleven of Wednesday with Greg. Until

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:07.379
next week, take care. And ride safe.
