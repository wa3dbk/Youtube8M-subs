00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.020
All right. In this segment, we got the truck
all up in the air. We're sitting under it

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.000
right now. We got our safety goggles on just
in case we get any dirt in our eyes or anything.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.321
First thing we're going to do is undo these
torsion bolts right here. Now, when you're

00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:19.289
working on a truck and you're doing a lift,
you got to make sure you have at least three-eighths

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.510
or half inch tools. You don't want to be doing
no little quarter inch tools or nothing. You're

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.810
going to break those tools right in half.
Make sure you got yourself a good set of tools,

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.349
all the right sockets. Make sure you're using
the correct socket on the correct bolt. Don't

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.290
try to use something that's just a little
off. Make sure you have your metric and your

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:42.070
standard, everything sorted out. It's always
a good idea to go through and see what you're

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.330
working with. Line up all the sockets, get
them all ready that way, boom, bam. You got

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.570
the right tool for the right job. So right
now, Stevie's going to get in there right

00:00:50.570 --> 00:02:15.860
now, take these bolts out, and we're going
to start tearing it down. These right here,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.120
these are the torsion bars that we just removed
from the Colorado. This is actually what they

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.980
use in this truck as the spring. This is attached
in suspension and when the truck suspension

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.282
goes down, this whole bar twists and basically
this is the spring of the truck.
