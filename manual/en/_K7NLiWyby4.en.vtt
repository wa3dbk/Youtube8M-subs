Ram 2500 Big Horn.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.610
So you can see is the black appearance group.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.980
So everything is blacked out.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.510
20" black painted alloy wheels.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.360
On the front you will see you have the blacked
out grill, headlights, foglights and blacked

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:34.739
out tow hooks.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.489
So you can see you have the two toned, gray
cloth seats.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.949
Very comfortable captain seats.

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.449
Center console here, big enough to hold pretty
much anything.

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.120
On the inside, you have the media hub.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.379
Its got an SD card, aux por and ipod port
and a 12V dc adapter.

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.640
It is 4WD and an automatic w/ the autostick
right here.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.659
Cruise control, phone connections and the
auto control on the back.

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.100
This is the 8.4" touchscreen from Uconnect.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:20.150
It has travel system from Sirius, Satellite,
yelp, BT connections, AM/FM radio, navigation.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.790
Pretty much anything you can think of!

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.650
Heated steering and heated seats.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.310
You have a 115V AC adapter.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:38.710
So know we will hope in the back and see whats
back there.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.390
So back here you can pretty much everything
this truck has to offer.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.440
Tow package, rear sensors along the bottom,
camera right here.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.630
There is no bedliner, but whats cool about
this truck is that it has the ram cargo package.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:04.650
So it has this divider in the back and on
the side it lifts up and you have a big compartment

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.610
for anything you might need to put in there!

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.400
If you want more dividers, you can go to ram.com
and you can order more!

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.760
So take a look at the back!

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.290
It is a crew cab, so that means there is extra
length in the leg room area.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:36.260
They do fold down, this folds down for two
cupholders.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.250
Also right here at the bottom, you have this
nifty cargo area on both driver and passenger

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.740
