00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.003
[Mooji:] I don't know 
if you have ever

00:00:02.003 --> 00:00:04.436
heard anything like this.

00:00:04.436 --> 00:00:07.251
Please, it is an idea

00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:09.538
that you can forget

00:00:09.538 --> 00:00:10.975
or remember yourself.

00:00:10.975 --> 00:00:12.741
You are 
always yourself.

00:00:14.284 --> 00:00:15.505
But when we start

00:00:15.505 --> 00:00:17.289
to have to

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.073
think,

00:00:19.073 --> 00:00:20.858
you think you are 
an individual.

00:00:20.858 --> 00:00:22.984
And that you have
to do something,

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:25.220
you have to practise 
to get back to where you are.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.520
All these are concepts!

00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:33.430
You are not a concept.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.306
You are earlier 
than all concepts.

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:40.508
Because you are 
the witness of them.

00:00:40.918 --> 00:00:43.098
But we have an idea

00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:44.499
that we forget.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:46.920
And in the play 
of existence,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.801
because we are 
functioning as

00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:52.484
individual entities 
on a journey

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.519
towards awakening.

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.130
This is also a concept.

00:00:59.968 --> 00:01:02.748
But, very few 
are going to get

00:01:02.748 --> 00:01:05.260
this what I'm speaking.

00:01:06.008 --> 00:01:08.640
Nevertheless, 
it has to be said.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.163
Very few 
are going to get it

00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:12.416
because

00:01:12.416 --> 00:01:15.810
it is so 
deep rooted in us

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.310
that we are 
not yet That.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.951
[Woman laughs]

00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.062
[M:] She understands
what I am speaking.

00:01:22.062 --> 00:01:24.123
[Laughter from audience]

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.407
And so all together,

00:01:26.407 --> 00:01:28.531
we are believing,

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:33.085
all together 
we are believing;

00:01:33.085 --> 00:01:35.032
a collective consciousness,

00:01:35.032 --> 00:01:38.109
that we are not 
what we are.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.331
And because 
we believe it

00:01:41.891 --> 00:01:43.493
we have to believe 
in a journey

00:01:43.493 --> 00:01:46.137
to get back to 
what we already are.

00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:48.861
It's like we are here

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:51.985
and some of you 
get up and you ask me,

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.069
'How can I get to

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.423
the Caribbean 
Hindu Centre?'

00:01:57.423 --> 00:01:59.297
I said, 
But your are here!

00:01:59.297 --> 00:02:00.393
[Laughter]

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:02.225
He says, 'I know,

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:05.653
I know intellectually,

00:02:05.653 --> 00:02:07.224
[Laughter]

00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:09.689
but how do 
I know actually?'

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:11.803
I said, 
But you are here!

00:02:11.803 --> 00:02:14.075
He says, 
'Yes but, I believe you,

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.817
but it's not yet 
my experience.'

00:02:16.817 --> 00:02:19.049
[Laughter]

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.485
Isn't it?

00:02:21.485 --> 00:02:23.251
So then I look 
at your face

00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.097
and I see 
you're totally gone.

00:02:26.097 --> 00:02:28.123
So I said, Okay, 
I'll tell you what,

00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:29.812
you go outside 
this door,

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:33.051
turn first right 
and first right.

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:35.460
Walk 200 metres,

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.290
then you get to 
Brixton Hill,

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.912
take any bus 
going that direction.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.850
Get to Brixton,

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.810
when you get 
to Brixton Town Hall,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.687
cross the road 
[Laughter]

00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:50.564
and get a bus 
on the other side.

00:02:50.564 --> 00:02:52.383
159.

00:02:52.383 --> 00:02:54.202
It will only take 
you 15 minutes.

00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:55.562
You come up again,

00:02:55.562 --> 00:02:58.551
and you get off at the stop 
opposite Bombay Inn.

00:02:58.551 --> 00:02:59.740
[Laughter]

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.141
Then you cross the road,

00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:04.477
walk down 
and you turn first left

00:03:04.477 --> 00:03:05.855
and first left again.

00:03:05.855 --> 00:03:06.983
[Laughter]

00:03:06.983 --> 00:03:08.611
And after 5 minutes,
you get there.

00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:10.601
And you say, 
'Thank you Mooji.'

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.595
[Applause and laughter]

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.183
[M: ] And this is the way

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:21.379
that a

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.285
spiritual journey is born.

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:27.682
Either you can accept this,

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:29.085
either you can 
accept it immediately,

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:31.367
some people 
get the point!

00:03:31.367 --> 00:03:33.869
And others 
they don't get it.

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:36.079
You see?
And we are all like this.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.329
Even though 
we are laughing.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:39.969
We are like this.

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.283
So, this point 
I make about it

00:03:43.283 --> 00:03:46.077
that it is an idea 
that you forget!

00:03:47.637 --> 00:03:50.431
And if you believe 
in the idea that you forget,

00:03:50.431 --> 00:03:52.101
then you have to
believe in the idea

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:54.334
that you must remember.

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.723
And myself, 
I will also remind you,

00:03:57.723 --> 00:04:00.298
while you have inside you

00:04:00.298 --> 00:04:02.880
the urge to be reminded.

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:06.321
One day you'll go beyond

00:04:06.321 --> 00:04:08.797
remembering and forgetting.

00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.751
[Music]

00:04:25.081 --> 00:04:30.021
You are earlier 
than any concept
