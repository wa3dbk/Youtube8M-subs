00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.230
Sony Xperia ZR.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.210
Expected Q2 2013.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.910
One of Sony's success stories this year is
the Sony Xperia Z, an impressive piece of

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.670
kit with a lovely 5" HD display on the front.
But the problem with it is that it is rather

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.670
big.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.640
If the sheer bulk of the Xperia Z puts you
off, then the new Sony Xperia ZR might well

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.520
be the solution that you're looking for. It
replaces the 5" 1080p display with a more

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.430
modest 4.6" 720p display which shaves 10%
off the footprint of the phone and saves about

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.790
5% of the weight, while keeping all the other
powerful features that make the Xperia Z such

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.130
a desirable device.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.910
But the Xperia ZR is more than just a more
compact version of the Z.. it's also more

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.620
rugged. The Z is highly water and dust resistant,
but the ZR takes it one step further with

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.909
IP58 certification which means that you can
immerse it in up to 1.5 metres (almost 5 feet)

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.040
or fresh water for up to 30 minutes.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.650
So, what sort of applications might involve
taking HD video or making phone calls under

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.440
1.5m of water? Photographing something in
the bottom of a shallow swimming pool? Surviving

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.050
a fall down a very deep puddle? Making a video
call in the bath? Playing Angry Birds in the

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.840
rain? Well.. yes, perhaps. You wouldn't want
to try any of those things with an iPhone.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.480
Inside the Xperia ZR is a quad-core processor
with 2GB of RAM plus 8GB of onboard storage

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.480
plus a microSD slot. Inside is a large 2300
mAh battery which is quoted as giving up to

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.870
13 hours talktime and 21 days standby time
on 3G, or 45 hours of music playback and 8.5

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.300
hours of video viewing. In some markets an
LTE 4G version will be available.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:07.080
On the back is a 13 megapixel camera with
flash and 1080p HD video recording plus a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.450
secondary VGA resolution one on the front.
The camera is enhanced with Sony's Exmor technology

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.310
plus all the usual tricks you'd find in a
Sony smartphone. There's a FM radio on top

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.700
of all the usual multimedia features, and
the Xperia ZR is NFC capable and supports

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.010
HDMI output via an MHL cable.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.910
This is an Android 4.1 smartphone with all
the normal Android features plus the usual

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.110
Sony enhancements. Unlike some other "mini"
devices, the ZR really is almost the same

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.790
as the Z under the hood and is a very high-end
device in its own right. No guidance was given

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.370
on price although we would expect the ZR to
retail for about ï¿½500 SIM-free. Sony say

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:56.069
that the ZR should be available during Q2
2013 although availability will vary by market.
