Hi, my name is Andrea!

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.500
In this video I'm going to show you how I built this egg holder.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.180
I made out of cedar and I handcarved all the details with my wife Barbara.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.320
This is for Kitchen utensil build challenge 2015.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.360
Please check down in the description for the other participants and support their videos, too.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.800
Enjoy my video!

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.840
 And you can build something too!

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.609
I started by drilling one and a quarter inch
hole

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.749
and one and a half inch hole to check for
a better fit of the egg.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.220
Then I drew the circles and marked holes in
a scrap piece curled red cedar.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.580
Bottom piece has 8 holes and top one
6 holes to hold total of 14 eggs.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.880
I drilled half inch hole in the center for
the dowel.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.320
Then I continued drilling one and a half inch
holes.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.500
When I had all the holes, I cut the circles
out with the jigsaw.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.400
Then I sanded all with 120 grit followed by
220 grit sandpaper.

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.249
Barbara drew the design to carve and then
we both started carving.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.160
Since I don't own carving chisel set
I went ahead sharpened flat screwdriver to

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.840
be able
to carve some thicker lines.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.740
For thin lines I used exacto knife and...

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.520
...a lot of patience.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.360
No room for big errors here.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.300
After 2 days of carving I painted it all
with black acrylic paint.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.030
I took the excess off with the cotton cloth
and when it was dried 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.210
I sanded off just the high spots.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.600
Then I applied my signature to the bottom
piece.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.120
I used CA glue to attach the dowel to the
base.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.869
Then I marked the desired height for the second
base

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:02.149
and cut it with the hack saw.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.040
Squickity - Squick!

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.700
Using handplane and sandpaper I leveled the
dowel

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.620
so it sits flush with the bottom.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.200
Then I painted the dowel black.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.240
For the finish I used beeswax and oil mixture

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.220
which I applied with toothbrush and piece of cloth.

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.859
I felt like it was not finished without top
piece

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.379
by which you could easily lift up the entire
holder.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.080
So we did the final piece.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.280
With the rasp I scraped the finish off the
dowel

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.640
and mixed some epoxy to glue the top piece.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.940
And that's it!

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.400
This project was a lot of fun and it's I first
time tried

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.260
to carve wood and to do stop motion video.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.900
I hope I'll get a better camera with shutter control

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.720
so the camera doesn't move when taking pictures.

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.520
I hope you have enjoyed this video.
