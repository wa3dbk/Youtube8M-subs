00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.430
When crossover SUVs hit the mainstream, the
Nissan Qashqai was the poster boy, but, alongside

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.570
the Qashqai were models like this, the Kia
Sportage.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.642
This crossover has been an integral part of
the south Korean-manufacturers success in

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:31.970
the UK over the last few years, along with
models like the Picanto city car and Rio supermini.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.800
With a minor facelift back in 2014, the Sportage
is in its third-generation, and judging by

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.870
the sheer amount of them you will have seen
on the road, it’s clear to see that it’s

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.160
Kia’s bestseller.
I just want to start by showing off the Sportage’s

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.109
practicality, which is really important as
some vehicles in the crossover segment tend

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.691
to forget this and go for style over substance.
The boot for example offers 564 litres with

00:00:53.691 --> 00:01:00.239
the seats up and 1,353 with the seats down,
meaning its bigger than the Honda CR-V – it’s

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.659
just a shame those seats down fold flat. Still,
very practical.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:13.340
Sitting in the back feels more like a large
saloon than an SUV as there is plenty of space

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:22.210
from head to toe, particularly important if
you plan on going on long distance journeys.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.440
Inside, the Sportage is pretty swarve. It
may not quite have the German manufacturing

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.760
edge of VW or Audi, but you’ll pay a premium
for that anyway. On a whole, the materials

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.270
used are good quality and the dashboard layout
is very logical. Standard Sportage models

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.780
come with essentials like Bluetooth and air
con, as well as luxury features like cruise

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.990
control and leather trimmings.
The flagship KX-4 model we have has a handy

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.430
7-inch touchscreen with sat nav and a reversing
camera display as well as a panoramic sunroof.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.280
There is even a parallel park assist system
which analyses your surroundings and steers

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.190
the car for you, which is a bit strange at
first, but, it really does work.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:17.569
Right, enough of the robotics, let’s do
some actual driving.

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.750
Just like the Hyundai ix35 that it shares
its blueprints with, the Sportage is very

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.459
much built for comfort, with a supple suspension
that makes everything from city to motorway

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.459
driving a breeze.
What it fails to offer though is high levels

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.200
of engagement as the steering lacks feedback
and weighting. There’s also a fair amount

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.420
of body roll when you chuck it into corners
and the diesel engines can be noisy. But before

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.099
we get too critical, let’s not forget, the
Qashqai hasn’t really got the X factor in

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.430
the driving dynamics department either and
in fact, apart from the likes of the Ford

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.049
Kuga, crossover SUVs tend to struggle when
it comes to excitement behind the wheel.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:57.040
Although there is an entry-level 1.6-litre
petrol with 133bhp available, it is the diesel

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.779
options that will most likely get people’s
attention, and these come in two forms, a

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.879
1.7-litre and 2.0-litre.
With power outputs including 114, 134 and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.989
181bhp, it is pretty easy to find a diesel
to suit you. It is however a bit disappointing

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.700
that the most efficient engine, which is the
114bhp 1.7-litre diesel, emits 135g/km and

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:28.280
returns a claimed average of 54mpg. This still
remains the best overall pick in the engine

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.529
range though.
If you really want to spruce your Sportage

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.840
up, then there is an AWD model available with
the 181bhp 2.0-litre diesel, which is what

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.760
we are testing. This will allow you to explore
more of the countryside, with the ability

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.709
to split power evenly between all four wheels,
so you don’t slip in the mud, along with

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.329
a hill descent assist feature. Word of advice
though, go for the manual box, because the

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.659
automatic is rather sluggish when changing
in-between gears.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.459
While the Sportage might lack some driving
excitement, its good levels of kit, impressive

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.510
practicality and comfort definitely warrant
it a place on your shopping list of crossover

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.819
SUVs.
It’s also cheaper than the Nissan Qashqai

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.310
and Ford Kuga, plus you get Kia’s seven-year
warranty, which in itself is worth a great

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.099
deal, especially if you’re a family car
buyer.

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.430
But has the Sportage’s tiger-nose face won
you over? Let us know in the comments section
