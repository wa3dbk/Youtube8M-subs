Hi, my name is Nat McCullough on behalf of
Expert Village. In these clips, we're going

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:11.390
to talk about the proper way to remove and
replace a front wheel drives vehicles ball

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:17.310
joint. In this clip, we're going to talk about
the proper location for placing your floor

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.060
jack and jacking up the vehicle. What you're
shooting for is the pinch weld or sub-frame

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.009
of the vehicle. The pinch weld is one of the
strongest parts of the car. It's where they

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.410
establish a lot of the structural integrity.
On this particular vehicle there are ground

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.130
affects in the way so you won't be able to
see it. But what you're looking for is a sandwiched

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.880
piece of metal. It will be approximately an
eighth inch thick. This is your vehicles pinch

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.640
weld. As you can see, I have my jack located
right on it. Another or an alternate jacking

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.000
location is the vehicles sub-frame. Which
is going to be this piece here. You can see

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.670
it runs a significant portion of the length
of the body. That is another place where the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.941
vehicles entire structure is built off of.
Once you have your jack placed, you can go

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:09.080
ahead and take your jack handle. Make sure
to tighten down the release screw and begin

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:20.570
jacking up the vehicle.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.820
You can see as I'm working the floor jack,
the vehicle is coming up off the ground. The

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:33.799
suspensions traveling. Once you have it high
enough in the air, it's okay to go ahead and

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.069
place your jack stand. What you're looking
for is just a very sturdy part of the vehicle.

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:49.330
It can either be control arm, sub-frame, or
pinch weld. I'm going to slide this guy in

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:57.619
place. And I going to leave it on the jack
and have my jack stand in place. Because two

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.850
things holding the vehicle in the air is better
than one.
