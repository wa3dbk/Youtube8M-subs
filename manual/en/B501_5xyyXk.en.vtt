One day, Noa, Silvan and Bob the minion were all very bored.

Noa, I'm so bored.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.640
Suddenly, Noa had an idea.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.260
I know Silvan, let's sing "The Wheels on the Bus"!

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.260
[ah!] Oh yeah, I love that idea!

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.000
