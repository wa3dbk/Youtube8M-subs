00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.960
Bridget Kelly: Radiesse specifically is a
little bit different make up than hyaluronic

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.630
acid type products and that it is both a little
bit of instant gratification as well as giving

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.199
you a little bit of your own collagen stimulation.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.910
I always tell my patients, because of that
collagen stimulation, the treatments not only

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.310
corrective but it is also going to be preventative,
to prevent things from getting worse in the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.310
future.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.100
So it is very versatile and it does give people
are really nice, natural looking results.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.400
So today we are going to be doing treatment
on Teri.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.090
And we are going to be doing treatment with
Radiesse.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.280
She was complaining that she is having a little
bit of sagging through the face so we're going

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.890
to be building up the cheek area and then
also filling in a little bit in the nasal

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.000
labial folds.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.270
Teri has had a numbing cream on for the past
20 minutes, which is about average for people.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.430
She will still feel a little bit of pressure
but she shouldn't feel too much pinching,

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.890
so it should be a very comfortable experience
for you.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.439
The injection part of the treatment probably
takes about another 20 minutes or so.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.580
So I would say from start to finish, people
are usually in the office for anywhere from

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.090
45 minutes to an hour.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.370
Teri Henderson: When you first try this process,
I think you are a little bit nervous about

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.040
the outcome, about the pain.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.650
There was no pain.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.800
The Radiesse was just fabulous.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.990
I mean, it looks absolutely natural, my cheeks
are filled in, it's just, I'm thrilled.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.990
I'm really thrilled.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.450
Bridget Kelly: It's nice to be able to have
a tool like this to replace that overall volume

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.850
rather than just always filling a line or
a wrinkle.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.230
It's a good idea for most patients to come
back at that 3-month mark, where most of the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.340
gel has been reabsorbed and you've gotten
that collagen stimulation.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.890
At that point, we can be sure that the patient
has had maximum correction and add another

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.390
syringe or so if we need to.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.530
And from that point out, the filler should
last at least a year.
