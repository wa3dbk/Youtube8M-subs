00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.710
Working in an inclusive classroom

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.070
is nothing you're ever prepared for.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.569
You're told how to do it, you're told that these
kids will come in

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.099
and you're told just to do it.

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.060
The best preparation is talking to people
who've done it before,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.050
going to conferences and getting ideas from
people who've been there before,

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.039
and opening your mind

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.449
and letting it in.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:27.619
So you have

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.710
your special education teacher is going to
come in and say, “Okay these are the goals that my student

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.870
is working on.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.180
How can they meet these goals in your classroom?”

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.100
And you be open enough to say

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.250
”Oh, he's writing his name, I can do that because
everyday we give them a paper and they can write their name.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.680
Oh, I see he's working on greetings, hello goodbye
I can do that everyday 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.460
by sitting him next to a student who doesn't talk much.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.270
And really you need to do that,

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:53.570
learn how to greet.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.590
Oh he's working on some simple math skills.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.210
Well I can do that by giving him a paper
that the other students are using

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.720
and just showing him to do this and this.”

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.599
By opening your mind and allowing people to

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:07.039
give you ideas

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.510
and accepting that,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.220
that's your best preparation.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.870
Plus there's

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.970
lots of conferences to go to, there's lots of
experts to go to.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.830
The inclusion specialist is the best person to
talk to about what has happened in the past and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.960
what 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.049
this certain student’s needs are.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.809
Talking, getting a paraprofessional to come
in and help you set up the classroom

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:28.270
in order for this

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.330
student’s special needs to be successful
in the classroom,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.549
those are all ways.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.680
The way I was prepared,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.960
go to school, take classes, go to conferences,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.260
and then open up your mind

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.910
and talk to people who've done it before.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.700
Another thing that we have to do,

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.170
of course special ed is always changing, they're
always finding new ways to teach

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.700
things that work better

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.700
than they did before,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.370
you have to keep going to classes and educating yourself and
keeping up with what's going on

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.530
in the new areas of thought

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.210
and things like that.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.769
And with us especially we have a school
nearby us that is a Special Ed school

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.359
so we learn a lot from that them. We've gotten
students from them

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:22.359
and it's a great learning experience for
the kids and for myself as well.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.799
I think one of the bigger problems
for teachers as they're beginning their career

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.159
is that there really isn't any preparation.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.099
You learn a little bit from a class,

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.729
there is a class that you're obligated to take,

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:38.279
you learn more about the legal aspects

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:40.010
but what is 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.159
day to day dealing with that situation
and how to manage

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.389
one child's needs

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.669
within a larger classroom

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.189
of needs

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.729
is not taught very well so it's a matter of
experience.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.510
There's a lot you learn from other teachers,
you know

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.799
and you look through the school, who are the
teachers that deal very well with these children

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.339
and you can get some of their strategies.

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:10.529
A lot of it is just experience and I think

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.900
since there are so many different kinds of
disabilities,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.019
what you may have learned last year

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.749
from one child

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:20.430
does not carry over to the next child and you have
to kind of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.090
discover, pull things out of your bag, what
will work

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.779
and what won't work

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:26.739
and discover it on your own.
