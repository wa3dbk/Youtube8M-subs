00:00:06.108 --> 00:00:07.051
(Man in Suit) Mr. Matheson

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:10.005
(Man in Suit) I know that you are in financial trouble.

00:00:11.148 --> 00:00:12.232
(Man in suit) This box...

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:14.428
(Man in Suit) may be the answer to your problem.

00:00:17.464 --> 00:00:20.470
If you push this button, two things will happen.

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:26.264
(Man in Suit) One, someone, somewhere in the 
 world, who you don't know, will die.

00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:27.130
(Mr. Matheson) Okay.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.648
(Man in Suit) And two-

00:00:27.197 --> 00:00:27.895
(click-click)

00:00:30.722 --> 00:00:31.706
(Man in Suit) You- you just-

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:33.305
(Man in Suit) You just pushed- you just pushed the button.

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:33.775
(Man in Suit) You ju-

00:00:33.923 --> 00:00:34.408
(Man in Suit breathes in sharply)

00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:35.354
(Man in Suit) You didn't let me finish.

00:00:35.136 --> 00:00:35.396
(Mr. Matheson) Yeah.

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:36.088
(Man in Suit) Um...uh...

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:36.028
(Mr. Matheson) Sorry.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:36.389
(Man in Suit) Ye- yeah.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.784
(Mr. Matheson) Um...

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:38.758
(Man in Suit) Someone somewhere in the world will die...

00:00:38.758 --> 00:00:39.077
(Mr. Matheson) Got it.

00:00:39.077 --> 00:00:39.584
(Click-Click)

00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:40.183
(Man in Suit) Don't hit it again!

00:00:40.418 --> 00:00:40.815
(Mr. Matheson) I...

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.085
(Man in Suit) That's the second-

00:00:41.085 --> 00:00:42.104
(Man in Suit) No! Just let me finish.

00:00:42.624 --> 00:00:44.245
(Man in Suit) But you'll get a million dollars.

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:44.757
(Mr. Matheson) Oh.

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:45.295
(Man in Suit) Yeah.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:47.321
(Mr. Matheson) Okay.

00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:47.858

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:51.818
(Man in Suit) Great. That's great. Yeah. You just 
 hit it three times. You killed three people.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:52.318
(Man in Suit) Wonderful...

00:00:51.928 --> 00:00:53.625
(Mr. Matheson) Can I have my million dollars?

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.232
(Man in Suit) It was supposed to be like a moral puzzle.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:00:59.404
(Mr. Matheson) Solved.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.341
(Click-Click)

00:00:59.404 --> 00:01:02.286
(Man in Suit) Yeah, no, that's not how you solve 
 the puzzle. It's not that kind of puzzle.

00:01:02.148 --> 00:01:02.738
(Mr. Matheson) I don't- I don't-

00:01:02.738 --> 00:01:04.032
(Man in Suit) You just killed four people.

00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:04.691
(Mr. Matheson) Okay.

00:01:04.406 --> 00:01:05.130
(Man in Suit) Do you understand that?

00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:06.164
(Mr. Matheson) Yes.

00:01:10.041 --> 00:01:12.079
(Man in Suit) You killed four people. You hit the- four times.

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:13.822
(Man in Suit) What?

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:15.905
(Mr. Matheson) Is that-

00:01:16.488 --> 00:01:16.972
(Mr. Matheson) Should I...

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:18.541
(Mr. Matheson) Rou- Round up?

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:17.751
(Man in Suit) Don't clic-

00:01:17.396 --> 00:01:18.005
(Click-Click)

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:18.955
(Man in Suit) Don't hit it again!

00:01:18.955 --> 00:01:19.377
(Mr. Matheson) Round up?

00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:19.978
(Man in Suit) You just- ok no don't-

00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:20.477
(Man in Suit) Round up?

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.740
(Mr. Matheson) Round up?

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:21.341
(Man in Suit) Round up to what?

00:01:21.444 --> 00:01:21.841
(Mr. Matheson) Five.

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.393
(Man in Suit) To five?

00:01:22.393 --> 00:01:23.817
(Mr. Matheson) I don't understand...what...

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.190
(Man in suit) You don't want to kill-? Here. Just. Okay.

00:01:24.092 --> 00:01:24.657
(Mr. Matheson) Where's the...

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.477
(Man in Suit) Look, yeah. Here.

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:26.769
(Man in Suit) Okay.

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:28.838
(Man in Suit) Here's your million dollars. There you- there you go.

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:29.722
(Click-Click)

00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:31.592
(Man in Suit) Why'd you hit it again? Why'd you hit it again?

00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.883
(Mr. Matheson) I would like a second million dollars, please.

00:01:33.883 --> 00:01:36.865
(Man in Suit) It doesn't work that way. You 
 just get one million dollars. Take it.

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:38.798
(Man in Suit sighs)

00:01:40.052 --> 00:01:40.350
(Click-Click)

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:40.670
(Mr. Matheson) No deal.

00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:42.240
(Man in Suit) That's not- What!? No. What deal?!

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.710
(Mr. Matheson) I choose the box.

00:01:42.236 --> 00:01:42.600
(Man in Suit) What?

00:01:42.826 --> 00:01:43.130
(Click-Click)

00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:47.350
(Man in Suit) Stop hitting the button. You're not choosing the box. You 
 don't get the box. The box isn't part of the deal!

00:01:47.554 --> 00:01:47.910
(Man in Suit) What...

00:01:47.913 --> 00:01:50.680

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.000
(Click Click Click Click)

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.000
