00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:11.250
bjbj The Samsung Galaxy S4 has landed at Carphone
Warehouse, and we couldn t wait to get our

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.910
hands on it and tell you, everything you need
to know so Listen UP! If you are a Samsung

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.290
fan, you ll be please to know, the new Samsung
Galaxy S4 has plenty of unique features to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.180
make it stand out from its older brother S3
and if you are flirting with the idea of a

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.680
new phone the S4 should definitely make your
decision even harder now. To start with the

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.230
Samsung Galaxy S4 is thinner and lighter than
previous Samsung models. It also has a larger

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.930
battery and vastly improved screen, making
it perfect for web surfing, video playback

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.539
and photos, The camera for example, can take
two shots at once! One with the rear camera,

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.010
another with the front one. The dual camera
also allows Dual Recording and Dual Video

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.079
Calls. Now, have you ever wonder what phones
will be like in the future? Well, we can safely

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.770
say that with features like Air Gesture and
Smart Pause, we no longer have to imagine!

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.610
The future is right here. s say for example
you are cooking, or in the bath, and want

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.700
to change a playing track, Air Gesture will
let you do that only with the wave of your

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.050
hand. And Smart Pause lets you control the
screen on your phone with your eyes! Videos

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.300
will automatically pause once you look away
and restart again when your eyes are back

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.150
on the screen! Impressive right? And these
guys from Samsung really thought of everything!

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.470
They do know how important health and wellbeing
is now days so they come up with S-Health.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.270
S-Health automatically tracks your daily exercise,
calorie intake and even your sleep patterns.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.030
It s almost like having a Personal Trainer
right there in our pocket. And there is even

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.360
more tech built into the S4! S-Translator,
Watch On and S-Voice Drive are some of the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.500
other impressive features we know everyone
will want to get their hands on. Like what
