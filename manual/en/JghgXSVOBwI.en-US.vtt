00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.500
This is my electric insect killer

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.600
Here's the electronic part

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.460
It is very modest. It uses two capacitors

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.360
Two diodes

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.480
And one resistor

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.960
And that's it

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.580
Those components are responsible to shock

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.420
How does it work?

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.800
When the lamp is on, it attract the insects

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.140
Then they collide with the grid

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.380
Take the shock, get glued and die.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.840
This brush is used to clean the grid

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100
Now, I'll turn the lights off and show how it works

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.500
It operates at 110V

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.140
I will demonstrate

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.620
I will touch a screwdriver on it

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.440
That's what happen when the insect touches it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.220
To show  that it really works

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.540
I used it outside home for three nights

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.660
Here's the result

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.160
For those who intent to build...the circuit that makes the shock

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.380
Here's how

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.860
This is the circuit entrance, from the 110V socket

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.620
Then comes the resistor

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.920
And both diodes

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.800
The capacitors

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.520
And the exit, which will produce the shock

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.740
You cannot link them to each other

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.160
You're going to need two wires parallel to each other

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.620
When the insect touches both of them it will be shocked

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.040
You must not link them. Or otherwise it will not work

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.200
The electronic components needed are:

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.560
Two diodes 1N4007

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.160
They are represented by D1 and D2 on the circuit

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.320
Two polyester capacitors 250V, 3ÂµF

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.560
Here, C1 and C2

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.880
One 10K and 1/2W resistor. Represented by R1

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.980
And that's it. Very simple, easy to make

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.840
For those who do not know a diode works

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.440
I will draw a scheme

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.000
It have two terminals

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.580
It has a white tape in one of the sides

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.980
The diode is black

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.260
And it has a white tape

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.260
If the tape is on this side

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.740
It means that...

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.820
the symbol is this

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.520
If it was on the other side, the arrow would be inverted

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.860
As I was talking about the diode. Now I will explain the capacitor

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.960
The polyester capacitor is brown

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.280
With two terminals

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.000
It does not have polarity, so it does not matter if you link...

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.840
For instance, on this system. If you link the same way in the scheme here or invert the two terminals.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.660
That's because it does not have polarity, so there is no problem.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.520
For the resistor is the same

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.000
You can invert both ends

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.800
For example

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.540
This is the resistor

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.900
Here are both terminals

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.000
I can connect this way, or invert them, this way.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.280
Its cleanliness is very simple to be done

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.840
The remotion of the insects trapped

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.220
Grab the brush, which stays here

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.960
And brush the grid this way

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.640
Done. It is clean now

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.820
I was forgetting to talk about the voltage of it

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.660
The schock's voltage

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.020
Which is 320V

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.040
This is the voltage that is discharged on the insects
