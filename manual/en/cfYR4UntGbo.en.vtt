00:00:07.037 --> 00:00:08.490
Hey becareful you're squashing me!

00:00:12.927 --> 00:00:14.982
Not suitable for children

00:00:15.457 --> 00:00:18.377
God and his friends

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:21.844
And I say, I bite and I'm not chili

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:26.626
Can a werewolf eat his breakfast in peace?

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:32.266
Good morning!

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:37.720
I came to share with you God's word
Would you allow me a minute of your time?

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:38.596
No!

00:00:38.818 --> 00:00:45.025
Chapter 2 verse 4.52 Pi per radio
According to "Elver Galarga"

00:00:45.424 --> 00:00:48.893
What hope is there for the loved ones who have died?

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.166
Well revived as zombies

00:00:51.666 --> 00:00:57.092
Son's dead, is a terrible experience
specially for a mother

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.749
That's why Bible recognizes the bitter grief that a mother can experience

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.880
I don't have sons,
I hate children!!

00:01:05.304 --> 00:01:09.001
Talking about hate.
Do you believe in god?

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:13.040
As you say, believe, believe...
Believe, not

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:18.254
An opinion on that, it would extend with controversy
over the existence itself

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:23.895
Well, you have to believe, if not
I will keep bothering with visits at 7:00 am

00:01:23.915 --> 00:01:27.158
Talking about a million years old book
until you say I believe

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.330
Well, "I believe"
happy?

00:01:29.653 --> 00:01:35.171
Oh brother!
then we can start to talk deep about God

00:01:35.393 --> 00:01:40.446
What do you like more about God?
I like that is misterious and...

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:43.239
And even turns me on

00:01:43.487 --> 00:01:47.398
Emm... emm...
It's magic!! I go away

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.801
I don't want to know nothing about God

00:01:53.124 --> 00:01:56.303
Good morning!
I don't know why you don't want to know nothing about God but

00:01:56.298 --> 00:01:58.298
Did you know God is an Alien?

00:01:58.596 --> 00:01:59.662
Who are you?

00:02:00.843 --> 00:02:02.517
and Why are you still here?

00:02:02.714 --> 00:02:06.289
God an Alien?
is so absurd!!

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:09.170
As the same as revive dead isn't?

00:02:09.392 --> 00:02:13.225
Not as much as your religion created by Star Wars

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:16.569
Worst you that believe the man was created from nothing

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.110
Hey hey! you are talking about my God
I'm Christian

00:02:21.428 --> 00:02:26.943
and only blaspheme against my intolerant beliefs
that have caused carnage on behalf by hypocrisy and for the good of the church

00:02:27.443 --> 00:02:33.311
My religion is better!!
No!! mine, not yours, mine

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:43.041
I think God will punish you

00:02:43.222 --> 00:02:44.992
Yeah?
Which one?
