Hi I’m Dr. Scott Chandler with Silver Creek
Dental on behalf of Expert Village.com. This

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.950
clip is about using a special little tool
to help clean your teeth called the floss

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.850
threader. Now some people have difficult to
get between places in their teeth where teeth

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:30.089
have been bonded together for example or you
may have a dental bridge and a bridge here

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:36.540
is where you have three or more teeth that
are connected together. You’ve got the teeth

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.350
under there but they are missing one in the
middle. So there all bonded together and they

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.160
are glued on there and that’s a permanent
restoration. You can’t take it off to clean

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.760
under that space between those two teeth.
It is very important to clean under there

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.030
and I am going to show you how. The first
thing I like to show you here is called the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.000
floss threader. It is a little piece of stiff
nylon kind of like fishing line almost and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.670
what you do with that is you take your floss,
just stick it through there, leaving some

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:21.549
hanging out on both sides. Now with that floss
threader, you thread right behind the post

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:29.869
on that bridge. You poke that through so that
it is coming through the other side and you

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.979
pull that through, hold one side of your floss
and then pull the other side through. So walla!

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.880
There’s your floss all the way through underneath
that spot that you couldn’t get under before.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.329
Now you take your floss and you just move
it back and forth all the way underneath that

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:58.229
area there. Show you here and that goes underneath
the gums. My model is a little tight but we

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.170
will show you here. Go all the way underneath
the gums and up the other side and when you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.050
are done, you just pull the floss out. That
is how you use a floss threader to clean under

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.470
a bridge. Now there is one other variation
on this theme here and it’s called super

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.420
floss. You can buy these pretty much at any
drug store around so just go take a look.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.690
Super floss has a section here of thick ropey
tight floss. You pull it and it gets tight

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.990
and gets skinnier and you let it go and it
is kind of like a sponge almost. At the end

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.830
of that is a piece of that stiff nylon so
you use that stiff nylon there, poke it underneath

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.600
that bridge again, same as before, pull it
through and then you use that good thick part

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.840
of that floss to clean down underneath that
bridge and of course, getting along those

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.900
teeth that are used to support that bridge.
If you lose one of those teeth, you lose the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.650
whole kit and kaboodle so you want to make
sure that you floss that area really good.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.560
The good thing about the super floss is that
they rest piece of floss is pretty regular

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.451
floss that you can use for flossing everywhere
else in your mouth so go ahead and use that

00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:13.990
and get everywhere else in between those teeth.
