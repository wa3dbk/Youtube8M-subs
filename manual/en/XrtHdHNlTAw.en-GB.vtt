00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.100
[Music playing]

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.300
Arriving into the Northern Territory is as easy catching a three-hour flight from the East Coast.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.800
[Music playing]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.400
Once you get off the plane, you'll be treated to this luxurious accommodation in the middle of the desert called Sails In The Desert.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.700
The highlight yesterday was going straight to the river and spa and having a dream treatment.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.400
And it literally was a dream treatment, it was so beautiful and I was so relaxed.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.100
[Music playing]

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.800
From there we jumped on this warrior bus, went down to this beautiful red, sandy dirt roads into the middle of the desert.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.900
Watching the sunset over Uluru was just the most spectacular way to end the day.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.600
And then we had the most amazing dining experience under the southern desert sky, the Tali Wiru dining experience.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.700
[Music playing]

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
I thoroughly recommend the biking experience around Uluru.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.600
It gives you the time and opportunity to see the rock from every aspect.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.900
[Music playing]

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.900
Today we then go and visit The Olgas.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.700
I felt so nurtured and connected and so protected in that environment.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000
They're beautiful, they're so enormous.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:37.100
[Music playing]

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.300
We were then treated to the Under the Desert Moon dining experience.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a beautiful, trunkful dining experience where there's just a few tables set up on the beautiful little gardens.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.900
And just surrounded by nature. It's just truly extraordinary.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.600
If you look at the kitchen it was not truly just the hot plate and a barbecue, but really five star food.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.060
Such a wonderful experience, you really have to do it.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
[Music playing]

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.300
In the morning we got up bright and early to beat the heat of the day

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.500
and went on a three and a half hour walk around the Kings Canyon Rim.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.680
It starts with the five-hundred step climb to the top

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.900
and then you continue to just hike around the top of the rim, going down into the Garden of Eden.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.400
This is all in the Watarrka National Park.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.100
And it's a beautiful adventure because there's no better way to really capture all the views and all the diversity in contrast.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.200
Getting up high and being able to look at it from observational point of view.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.300
It's a really spectacular view and a spectacular experience and one that I truly recommend for everyone.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.200
It's just a magnificent environment.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.100
It's something that truly has to be experienced to understand it.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.400
[Music playing]

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.900
. . . for a whole a lot of adventure these days

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.200
we decided to give our feet a bit of a rest and jumped on a quad bike at the Kings Creek Station.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.900
And it's a great way to experience The Outback.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.300
Fanging it around through paddocks and red dirt, and spin effects on these quad bikes was a whole lot of fun.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:08.300
[Music playing]

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.400
Every stop along the way starting at Uluru and working our way to Alice Springs

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.400
we have found truly beautiful and comfortable accommodation.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.100
And Lasseters down here in Alice Springs is no exception.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.000
We've been truly looked after when we moved in, we're in a beautiful, comfortable accommodation.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.400
And it made us refresh and re-energise and set us up for the activities the next day.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.000
Today's ride took us through the Telegraph Station Reserve which is a national park in Alice Springs.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.000
It's a brand new mountain bike trails, only been opened since April 2014.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.100
And we got a beautiful view of the MacDonnells Range as we rode through the park.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.100
It's a beautiful way to experience Northern Territory.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.300
The Alice Springs Desert Park is a wonderful way to wander through the ancient landscape.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.200
Make sure you walk through there with a guide because they give you bit of an education

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.200
on how the local people use all the natural surrounds and the trees for medicinal purposes and also just for bush tucker.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.800
We were treated to an amazing bird show.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.300
And I actually got to hold one of the wedge-tailed eagles.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.300
And it was pretty remarkable experience, something you truly have to experience for yourself.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200
[Music playing]

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.700
Competed the day with a beautiful sunset ride at the Pyndan Camel Park at back of Alice Springs

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.500
where we went on a one hour, very nice, leisurely camel ride through the McDonnell Ranges.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.300
[Music playing]

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.900
As the sunset over the MacDonnel Ranges had lit the sky with this beautiful kaleidoscope of colours

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.900
it was a wonderful way to end the remarkable adventure in the Northern Territory.
