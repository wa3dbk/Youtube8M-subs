The result against Atletico is not a defeat but only a partial result. This is the way that I am looking at it and the players are doing the same. As for the display, we've taken the positive performance through to this week's preparations ahead of our next match, which is very important, against a side which is doing very well. I saw them play a good first half against Roma. It's obvious that the environment and situation changes , but our goals remain the same and are very clear, that is, to grow and improve in every match. We've made a big step forward in terms of team spirit, unity and the ability to help each other out on the pitch, elements which are the basis of everything, and to which I assign great importance in this moment in time. We're on the right track and I want to see all of this in action against Sampdoria

It was a fortuitous goal. It wasn't exactly a cleanly struck cross from the corner which went straight to an Atletico Madrid player, there was a deflection and in football you need a bit of luck. In this case we were unlucky and we need to increase the concentration levels, but the same applies to them and they also had similar moments in the first half. But this is simply a part of football

Iím still honestly struggling to understand this bad side to Mario Balotelli. He's anything but bad. I'm sorry that such a prestigious magazine has to stoop to this level and not focus on footballing matters because where is the nasty side in football? Where is it? It isn't a nasty sport. I repeat Mario Balotelli for me is a sweet, positive and kind lad. Heís made some mistakes in terms of his behavior just as many other youngsters have done in football. Since Iíve arrived, Iíve seen a great improvement with his behavior during the matches, during the training sessions and the day to day life at the club. I would say that Iím very happy with Mario Balotelli.
