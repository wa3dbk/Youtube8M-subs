Hello guys, it's Delta249er here with a tutorial on how to install OptiFine with Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.7.2.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.500
Now the first thing you want to do is go into your Minecraft launcher...

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.200
...and once that loads up you want to click "Edit profile" on any profile...

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.300
...and under "Use version" select "Release 1.7.2," and click "Save Profile."

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:36.280
Now you want to click "Play," and wait for that to load up and that will download a new version of Minecraft 1.7.2 for Forge to use.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.800
And once you get to the menu click "Quit Game."

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.720
Now you want to go into your web browser and go to the OptiFine forum thread...

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.740
..and scroll down until you find the downloads.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.040
And you want to pick the newest version that is compatible with Minecraft 1.7.2...

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.420
...and read the fine print, and look for which version of Forge it is compatible with.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.620
So this one right here is compatible with Forge 998, and you want to keep that in mind when we go to download Forge.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.660
Now you want to click the "Download" button for OptiFine.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:16.000
And on the adf.ly page wait for the "Skip Ad" button to show up in the top-right, and click "Skip Ad."

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.200
Now you can see in the middle of these ads there is a link, and you want to click that, and then save it on your desktop.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:31.880
Now go over to the files.minecraftforge.net page, which is also linked in the description, and you want to find the corresponding version of Forge...

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.860
...and we said that was 998 for this current version of OptiFine...

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.160
...and you want to go ahead and download the "Installer."

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.120
And then wait for the adf.ly page to load, and click "Skip Ad" in the top-right.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.820
Now you want to save that on your desktop as well, and go ahead an go to your desktop...

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:01.000
...and you want to double-click the Minecraft Forge installer, make sure the install client radio button is selected, and click "Ok."

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.340
And then click "Ok" again.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.600
Now you want to go into your Minecraft launcher.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.860
In the "Profile" drop-down you want to select "Forge."

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.140
Click "Play" to re-authenticate,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.020
and then as you can see it says "Ready to play Minecraft 1.7.2-Forge,"

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.500
and you want to click "Play."

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.740
This will download all of Forge's libraries and all it needs.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.620
And then once you get to the menu, you should see in the bottom-left that there is a little bit of a title here,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.780
and it says "Minecraft Forge" and all.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.760
Now once you see that, you can click "Quit Game."

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:46.880
And then, on your keyboard, press the 'Windows' key and the 'R' and type "%appdata%" and click "Ok."

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.300
Now go into your ".minecraft" folder, and then go into your "mods" folder,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.340
and drag the OptiFine JAR into the "mods" folder.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.200
And then you can close that window.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.960
Now let's go ahead and test it out.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.700
Open the Minecraft launcher, and then here you can see that the "Forge" profile is selected, and click "Play,"

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.940
and once that loads up we will hopefully see OptiFine is installed,

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.500
and it will tell us in the bottom-left.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.720
As you can see right there, and also on the "Mods" menu it shows up.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.560
Now let's just go ahead and test it out in a world...

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.720
...and as you can see if we go into the F3 menu it says "OptiFine 1.7.2,"

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.860
and if we go into the menu here you can see that in the "Video Settings" there are a whole ton of different video settings that you can use.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.360
And that is really about it for this tutorial, but if you did find this helpful a "like" and a "favorite" would be greatly appreciated.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.280
Also if you'd like to share it with your friends, feel free to do that as it does help me out as well,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.620
and it probably will help them out too.
