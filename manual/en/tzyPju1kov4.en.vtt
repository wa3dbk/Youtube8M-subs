all the obstacles that you had to up by
that i personally have to overcome when

i was going to college right and all the
different times i had to

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:22.670
ask my parents for help

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.680
whether it was financially more
transportation allies or

fix my car liza whatever it was right

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.109
my parents were there for me ought every
single step of the way and you think

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.439
about how easy it was when i was going
to call it right so i graduated with

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.009
from andy that in two thousand seven so
that was before the economic collapse

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.899
um... and everything was the pretty like
everything was alright and i would

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:46.860
manage to graduate and it was

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.709

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.840
astronomer

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.579
with parents helping me

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.709
from people who don't have that network
of support

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.349
in the united states right intense
nearly impossible to graduate

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.280
and then the third thing too is bad

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.170
from what i could get from my parents
then is the role of the intended

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.050
