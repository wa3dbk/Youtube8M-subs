00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.040
Who said games need to be "normal"?

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.160
What's normal anyway?

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.320
In TowelFight2, you play an elderly chap who
shoots small animals out of his monocle.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.161
Not only that, but the story sees you and
your friendly dog companion sucked in to a

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:23.640
strange dimension of evil oddities and beasts.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.300
Of course, you're the only one capable of
cleaning up the place.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.499
The controls are simple enough.

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:32.220
The left virtual d-pad controls movement in
any direction and the right virtual d-pad

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.520
allows for shooting in any of the 4 cardinal
directions.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.530
You've seen controls similar to this in games
like Smash TV, Geometry Wars and The Binding

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.530
of Isaac.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.899
The game did originally launch with some teething
issues in the controls department however

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.620
these have mostly been ironed out with an
advanced control mechanism that allows the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.969
user to reposition the controls and activate
a floating style where the d-pads will follow

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.539
movement of your thumbs.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.649
Sounds weird, but works really well.

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.670
In saying all this, it's still much easier
to control on a larger tablet device than

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.670
a phone.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.960
As I mentioned earlier, the protagonist shoots
animals from his 6-shooter monocle.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.420
You'll start the game with frog projectiles.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.140
These are basic "bullets" that have no special
attributes outside of doing damage.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.920
From bears to eagles, pigs to zombies and
goats, to elephants, each animal you collect

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.190
throughout your adventure has a unique power
that will help you in your mission to rid

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.890
the world of evil and return to your home
world.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.780
Each of the animals you collect can also be
upgraded by picking up their corresponding

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.000
augments.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.610
These enhance or alter the attributes of the
projectiles and mix things up significantly.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.250
The number of possible attack types available
is quite insane and you’ll have loads of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.780
fun mixing and matching different types of
ammunition to find your ideal loadout.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.110
The only downside to all of this is that with
all the mayhem going on on-screen, it's sometimes

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.470
quite difficult to tell exactly what's going
on.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.820
TowelFight2 brings back old feelings of nostalgia
with its top-down style adventure.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.690
Traversing from map to map in an over-land
setting will remind old-school gamers of the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.770
glory days.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.310
Its simplicity of the controls and the ease
at which the game introduces new mechanics

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.870
will appeal to new and casual gamers alike.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.649
Once you've picked up your boss key, head
on over to one of the game's many bosses.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.850
All of the target locations are nicely displayed
on your mini-map so getting lost is actually

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.200
quite difficult.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.940
Some of the bosses do provide a challenge
although others won’t give you much trouble

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.940
at all.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.190
Truth be told, you may have more trouble fighting
some of the minion monsters than the bosses

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.310
themselves.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.890
If you do happen to die, you’ll lose a little
bit of money and be teleported to the very

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.360
beginning of the game.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.641
Fortunately, fast-travel portals can be unlocked
throughout the game that allow you to get

00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:36.450
back in to the action quite quickly.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.800
There's nothing particularly impressive with
the graphics or sound, but that doesn't stop

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.370
this from being one genuinely fun game.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.530
The dialogue and gameplay are entertaining
in their own right and don’t need any bells

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.230
and whistles to accompany them.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.000
Because you have infinite lives and item progression
is persistent through death, there isn't too

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.500
much in the way of replay value to be had,
but, that's not necessarily what this game

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500
is about.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.210
TowelFight2 is available for iOS and Android.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.770
Pick it up and play through a really fun little
mobile game.
