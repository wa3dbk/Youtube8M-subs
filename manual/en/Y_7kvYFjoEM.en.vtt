00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.850
You can use the new Photoshop CS5 Mixer Brush
to create fine art paint effects on your images.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.490
Photoshop now offers an intuitive paint mixing
brush that allows you to apply colors and

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:22.470
blend them with underlying existing colors
as you go, just like a fine art painter would.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.630
In this project we will apply this effect
to a photograph showing three colored candles.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:41.120
Click on the Brush Tool icon, hold, drag down
and select the Mixer Brush Tool

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.739
Right Click to bring up the Brush Panel

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.780
Select the Round Point Stiff brush as shown

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.960
Click on the icon w/ the artist brush palette
on the Options Bar, this will bring up the

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.790
Brush Preset Panel

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.500
Click on Shape Dynamics and click on Transfer

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.810
Select Transfer

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:20.360
On the Control scroll area click on Fade.
Set the Slider to 12% The Fade option will

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:31.170
always give you a "fade out" effect that is
typical of most fine art brushes.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.579
Before proceeding, here is a quick example
of what happens with the Mixer Brush Tool

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.140
when applied.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:52.439
Notice that my Mixer Brush Tool is loaded
with a RED solid color.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.060
As I click and drag my brush through, see
how the red paint interacts with the yellow

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.770
and blue areas, mixing the colors as it goes
through; turning yellow into orange and blue

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.920
into purple as it would with real paint.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:17.470
In our exercise, we will choose a color to
blend a single-light-source shade on our candles

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.420
Create a new layer

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.400
Make sure that "Sample All Layers" is checked
on the Options Bar

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:43.940
Choose a color similar to a violet shade.
Paint near the left edge of one of the candles

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.480
as shown.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.200
Because you are working on a separate layer,
you can correct your paint strokes at any

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.870
time using any of the Photoshop editing tools.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.710
Now Click on the Eye Dropper tool

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:09.430
Drag, and select a color adjacent to the bluish
tone you just applied.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.420
A Sampling Ring will show with your cursor
to help you make the selection you want.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.210
Press the shortcut key "B" on your keyboard
to return to your brush.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:30.170
Your Mixer Brush is now loaded with this new
color which you can blend with your new color

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:49.630
and the background.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.360
Proceed with the same steps just shown with
the rest of the image.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:05.290
Now Your image feels like it is painted, without
the need of pre-defined filters or other gadgets.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.840

Tool adjustments provided by Photoshop .
