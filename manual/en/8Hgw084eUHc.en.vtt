00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.669
"Launch day approaches for NASA's next Mars
mission ..."

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.149
"A show of power from our Sun ..."

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.249
"And activity picks up on The International
Space Station ...Those are some of the stories

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.620
trending, This Week at NASA!"

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.170
During a news briefing at NASA headquarters
officials and scientists discussed MAVEN,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.070
the agency's next mission to Mars.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.060
"When we send human missions we want to understand
what the structure, the composition is at

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.870
all parts of the atmosphere, including the
upper atmosphere."

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.350
Scheduled to launch November 18 from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, MAVEN

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.030
will study the history and change of Mars'
atmosphere, climate, and planetary habitability.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.199
NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden visited
Langley Research Center to thank employees

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:49.800
for the great work they're doing and for their
patience during the recent government shutdown.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.069
Langley's history of aviation research goes
back almost a hundred years - to nineteen

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:55.649
seventeen.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.819
The Orion spacecraft came to life at Kennedy
Space Center as engineers powered up the spacecraft

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:05.780
to check out avionics and flight hardware
for the very first time. The power-up is a

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.430
major milestone in Orion's preparation for
a September 2014 flight test.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:17.430
A power up of another kind from the middle
of our solar system. Lots of "X" and "M" class

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.340
solar flare activity from the Sun recently.
We're protected by our atmosphere from the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.740
powerful bursts of radiation, but they can
disrupt GPS and other satellite communication

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.590
signals.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.299
A busy time at the International Space Station
-- after delivering over seven tons of cargo,

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.490
the "Albert Einstein" Automated Transfer Vehicle
4 left on Oct. 28 ... not long after, the

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.439
crew hopped into a Soyuz spacecraft and changed
parking spots -- from the Rassvet module to

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.759
the Zvezda Service module to make room for
the arrival of Expedition 38 and the Olympic

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:56.149
Torch. Rick Masstracchio of NASA, Russian
Mikhail Tyurin and Koichi Wakata of JAXA -- arrive

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.479
with the torch on November 7 -- it returns
to Earth with Expedition 36 November 10 and

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.479
will be used in the Winter Games in Sochi
, Russia in February 2014.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.030
Although the first approach-and-landing free-flight
test of Sierra Nevada Corporation's Dream

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.180
Chaser spacecraft experienced an anomaly with
the left landing gear deployment, the high-quality

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.819
flight and telemetry data through the critical
phases of the test will help refine Dream

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.450
Chaser's design. SNC is one of three companies
working with NASA to develop spaceflight systems

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.450
that could eventually launch astronauts to the International Space Station from U.S. soil.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.750
Data on seasonal land and sea ice melt in Greenland collected by a NASA C-130 research
plane from Wallops Flight Facility may give

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.540
researchers better context and a more comprehensive
view of seasonal changes in the region, when

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.519
compared with measurements of future satellite
missions, such as ICESat-2. The C-130 uses

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:57.790
laser sensing technology called LVIS, or Land,
Vegetation and Ice Sensor, to map terrain.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.060
And that's what's up ... This Week at NASA.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.730
