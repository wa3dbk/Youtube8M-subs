00:00:19.781 --> 00:00:22.781
I'm on fire

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:26.905
My emotions runs so deep

00:00:28.047 --> 00:00:31.047
You vowed to love me

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.169
Is that a vow you'd keep?

00:00:36.262 --> 00:00:39.262
Your smile is so tender

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:43.046
You've got me sighing a sweet surrender

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:47.616
Your touch is so pleasing

00:00:48.203 --> 00:00:52.203
Make me warm inside, makes me feel I'm alive

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:54.956
And I can't resist

00:00:55.024 --> 00:00:57.024
Your heavenly bliss

00:00:57.092 --> 00:01:01.092
The magic concealed inside your kiss

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:05.467
You must realise what I see in your eyes

00:01:06.836 --> 00:01:09.336
Takes me beyond the skies

00:01:09.728 --> 00:01:13.728
Silent morning

00:01:13.804 --> 00:01:17.804
I wake up and you're not by my side

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:22.139
Silent morning

00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:26.412
You know how hard I try

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.720
Silent morning

00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.811
They say a girl's not supposed to cry

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.920
Silent morning

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:43.130
Why did your love have to be a lie?

00:01:59.857 --> 00:02:02.860
I'm on fire

00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:06.890
And you're my every desire

00:02:07.768 --> 00:02:10.070
A living fantasy

00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:14.670
And you know just what to do for me

00:02:16.568 --> 00:02:19.570
I love the things you do

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:23.560
I'm here open arms waiting for you

00:02:24.712 --> 00:02:27.710
Welcome whispers

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:32.270
Make me warm inside, makes me feel I'm alive

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:36.090
And I can't resist your heavenly bliss

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:40.030
The magic concealed in your kiss

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:44.270
Must realize what I see in your eyes

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.670

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.560
Silent morning

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:14.720

Silent morning

00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:23.100
Why did your love have to be a lie?
