00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.540

of articles in the l_a_ times this week

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.290
if you haven't read this

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.630

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.749
for sure

00:00:09.749 --> 00:00:13.419
and easily series of articles on used
cars

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.109
and uh... what better place to write
that than here in los angeles their

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:21.869
legal really have an effective public
transportation system and everyone dr

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.589
but uh... and help me here richard but
the gist of it is if the focus is on

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.300
something called by here pay here

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.320
blocks

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.019
these were people go in

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:33.320
they look at the car

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.170
in some cases work bhalo use this is an
example it's a mitsubishi with a hundred

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.960
thousand miles on it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.890
andy

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.010
if you have crappy credit

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.260
this dealership will offer you alone on
this car

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.340
at about twelve thirty percent interest

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
and ill design a monthly schedule for
you to pay on that card and the payments

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.520
could be around five hundred dollars a
month were three hundred ninety nine

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.080
dollars a month on a mitsubishi with say
a hundred thousand miles on it and let

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.560
you drive off with that car and you pay
them each month

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.460
the moment you default on one of those
payments

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.640
they entice you back to the lot

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.780
and they say we're going to refinance
your your loan

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.030
on this car since you can't afford it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.630
and when you drive back in

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.430
take your car throw you out and make you
walk home

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.250
and then it may sell that car onion

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.650
and again and again cars are being sold
four and five times like this but they

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:34.720
are sexually

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.350
uh... loans

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.240
mortgages well not mortgages their car
loans designed for people who can't

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.119
afford them these cars

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.939
and then they are deprived of the
transportation that they were so

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.799
um... provided for by these lots at the
same time

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.829
so it's another one it's like
mortgage-backed securities but with with

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.459
cars is our right and what kind of yummy
think it is a big system there's a

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.209
here's the uh... highly technical term
for people who are involved in uh...

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.139
this business you referred to as

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:04.250
assholes

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.829
and uh...

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:08.829
model again denoted by the deal is this

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:09.729
e

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.060
susanna like asshole motorstorm wilshire

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.440
yes and i got scott shell of actually
gusta mucho isn't really alone over

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.510
there and i know that for you know there
was an old tex-mex songs if you've got

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.779
the

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.620
needed narrow i've got the camaro denied

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.719
that but here's the deal problem

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:31.060
this is very closely related to the
electroplating on industrial where

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.510
if you think of it is a big system they
marginalize certain people city make it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.900
difficult for them to get credit and
then they refer to them the bankers will

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.680
refer to them as the on banked and we
wanna help beyond bank with these like

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.919
the horrible lonesome rip them off

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.910
they trapped them in a cycle it that
they exploit them

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.739
and they've done studies that show that
these kinds of auto loans for example

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.779
these kinds of all the long to
discriminate very happily against

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:04.769
black people black people cannot hire
interest rates and minorities waha races

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.819
and ethnicities

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.519
pay much higher interest rates then

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.889
white males or or you know a white
people in general so there's a racist

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.660
element to this flat-out in the whole
process

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.400
and if there's a huge role for the big
banks and as you know these guys

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.940
their underwritten by j p morgan chase
wells fargo and bank of america so what

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.609
you have is a nice fat system where ed

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.219
and j p morgan chase let's say remember
there is a carry these bank forgetting

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:33.239
zero percent belongs

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.349
from the federal close to zero sometimes
i get your one percent two percent three

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.150
percent willis dressing up to that if
you ever uh... allegedly if you have a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.610
good credit as a consumer you qualify
for a zero percent loan no money down

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.140
come and get this new dodge truck

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:51.740
and you walk away with like a three
hundred dollar payment on a brand new

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.220
car right but that that's what we're
sort of bombarded with everyday day-in

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.139
and day out but the reality is

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:04.039
no very few people have that perfect
credit score to get those yet but these

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.379
are people who are

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.349
who need basic transportation to get to
their jobs that they're losing

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:11.569
and they're being

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.339
they're given a car they can't afford

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:18.539
that is the equipped with a low jack on
it by the dealership so they can know

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.680
where you are phil connelly ralph first
and take the car

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.770
we'll come to where you work in his
ticket out of the parking and bear in

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.620
mind

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.139
if this is this system is being funded
by the same bankers in the same economic

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:31.689
interests

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:34.460
we're making sure that we cut spending

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.600
on public transportation right so that
they have to get a car so it is very

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.200
neat as system of slavery

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.250
it's gotten so that the i_r_s_
absolutely ruthless people the were

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.639
exploiting soldiers families in
particular so they were

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:55.110
nestling ernestine whatever you want to
say it around a military bases in this

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.530
country so that uh... you know soldiers
families restore active-duty soldiers

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.110
would go out and be ripped off by these
people exactly this way because we have

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.080
some tragically under pay our military
in this country could care for it and we

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.220
have to give tax breaks to hedge fund
managers so these people then exploit

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.000
the sentencing people by the way

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.930
then exploit the military and their
families so much so that holly betrayals

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.849
david betrays his life

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.070
mated personal issue for her to go after
payday loan auto loan in these people

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.240
who works for the military families
because she was so

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.600
outraged by this so it's it's again if
you think of it is a big system if you

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.509
think of it is

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:38.270
you've got these banks at the top
holding all the resources

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.540
deciding who gets loans at what rate
holding back the money sometimes just

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:46.930
making money off treasury department
unanimous uh... t_-bills assault and

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.289
then the um...

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:50.740
then creating the system asserted

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.059
near like indentured servitude basically
where these people have to work for

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:58.669
their debts and if they don't the car
gets we sold and resold and resold we'd

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.340
know by

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.759
mill

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.100
accountability for it

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.200
and their outrage that there would be
something like a consumer financial

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.319
protection bureau

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.000
and in fact man sixty senators including
our own very liberal barbara boxer here

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.900
in california

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.759
signed a letter saying that these are
regulars should be exempt from this
