00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.430
So this is a video for an origami tulip flower.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.830
It comes with the tulip on the top, and then
also the stem and leaf on the bottom.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.780
So in order to make the top flower of the
tulip, go ahead and grab a sheet of paper,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.640
and what we're going to do is start with the
white side up and we're going to use a book

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.640
fold.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.600
So go ahead and fold the bottom edge up to
the top edge, where these two line up and

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.031
get it as precise as you can, so that it's
not off to the side at all, but where they

00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:39.080
all meet up nicely.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:45.770
Open that back up and then do the other one
as well, so this'll make a nice plus sign

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.260
right in the middle of the paper just like
that.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.559
Next we're going to do a blintz fold.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.420
So we're going to take all four of the corners,
we're going to fold them into that X center

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.540
that we just made.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.010
So right there in the middle, find that X,
and get each of these corners to go exactly

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.129
into the center.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.570
Try to be as precise as you can, so that they're
not overlapping or on top of each other and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.060
there's not too much white space in between
them, so just like that.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.640
Get all four of those corners locked in there.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760
Next we're going to fold the entire module
in half.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.590
Just take one corner up to the top just like
that.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.970
Next we're going to take the two outside corners
of this new triangle and we're going to fold

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.760
them up, and there's no specific spot for
this, just get it where it lines up, where

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.510
it makes a nice point.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.200
This is going to be the top of the tulip and
make sure it come up to this spot right here,where

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.490
this is the middle of the paper.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.040
So don't fold it where it comes over too far,
but just right up to that center spot, and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.450
try to get them as symmetrical as you can
where they're the same on both sides just

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.580
like that.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.270
Once you've done that these are the preliminary
folds, instead of just using it as a simple

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.320
fold in front or a fold behind, we're going
to actually use what's called an inside reverse

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.320
fold.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.170
Where instead of the flap just going up like
this or even if it was juts going into the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.769
back, we're going to make it where it goes
on the inside.

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.010
So the way to do that is to sort of open the
paper up, to about right here.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.290
And you can see these lines that we've made.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.489
What you want to do is you want to make the
creases go in this direction on both of those

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:33.489
lines.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.239
So one of them already does, like this for
example, already wants to go in this direction,

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.349
but the other one is folded that way.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:46.209
What we want to do is reverse that, so that
now this paper as well, right along that crease,

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.209
comes up.

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.040
And then if you look at it back at this spot
you can see how, once we have both creases

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:58.640
going the right way, you can sort of push
this up inside, and it'll reverse the spine.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.390
So this crease right here that was going in
this direction is now going to go and flip

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.499
it inside out and reverse, so that's an inside
reverse fold just like that.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:12.310
So if you look at it from the top you can
see how now, this flap has been put on the

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.099
middle of the paper just like that.

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.390
We're going to do the same thing on the other
side.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.340
You can go ahead and just, see I'm taking
a little bit of a shortcut there, just pushing

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.990
it straight in, but that's the exact same
idea just like that.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:35.610
And then finally we're going to fold this
edge into the center line, and we're going

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.219
to do that where it terminates up at this
point, the top of the tulip.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:46.640
So we fold just like that, where it comes
over that points in the middle and it goes

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.019
up to the top.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.780
The other one should come over on this side
and basically just touch right there.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.530
The two of them come up right to the same
spot, and that should be symmetrical just

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:00.530
like that.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.220
Flip it over and do the same thing on the
back, where these flaps are going to line

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:14.529
up with the ones behind them just like that,
and that is the final step for the flower

00:04:14.529 --> 00:04:16.609
of the origami tulip just like that.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.220
So once you have that, put that aside and
grab another sheet of paper, and now we're

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.290
going to make the stem or the leaf for the
origami flower.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.610
So the first step of making the stem on the
lower half of the tulip is we're going to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.500
make a diagonal fold, again with the white
side up.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.210
We fold it over and the color will come out,
get it nice and lined up.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.860
All the way across, a nice diagonal fold,
then open it up.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.160
We only need to make one of the diagonal folds
on this one.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.259
And we're going to take both of these outside
edges and we're going to make a kite fold.

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:53.030
So this right here is going to go into the
middle of the paper just like this.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.870
We'll do that on the top and the bottom, so
they line up and this is called a kite base.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.460
You can sort of see from here, how it gives
it that nice kite shape.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.090
So we've done that on the bottom, and now
we're also going to do it on the top, so the

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:16.840
same thing over here like this, and this paper
is going to overlap on the top of the one

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.650
that we did underneath it just like that.

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.501
Now once we've done that fold, we're actually
going to do it one more time.

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:36.410
We're going to fold these edges in, so we're
going to thin it down once more on the bottom,

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.389
so two more kite folds right there like that.

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:50.379
And then after this, we're going to fold the
bottom, all the way up to the top like that,

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:59.220
so that these two points are now coming all
the way up to touch each other.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:04.530
And we're going to fold the entire thing in
half from the left-hand side over to the right-hand

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:05.530
side.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.199
So we're going to fold the whole thing over.

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:13.810
Now there's a lot of paper in there, but try
to be as precise as you can just like this.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.960
And you'll see how this one sticking out a
bit right there.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:22.199
All we want to do is, we want to rotate it
over, so that now it's lined up along that

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:24.510
outside edge of the leaf.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.639
You'll see once that's finished, we have a
nice little outside leaf you can make.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.350
You can sort of pick it up and pull it out,
with a stem right there.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:42.780
Then once you have the tulip flower, that'll
go right on top of it and that'll give you

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.470
the finished origami tulip flower.
