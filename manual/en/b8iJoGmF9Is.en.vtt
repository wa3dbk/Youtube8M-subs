Hi.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.800
My name is Joy La Rosa and I'm a hair stylist
here in New York City.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.389
I work downtown in Soho at a salon called
Sam Brocato Salon.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.400
I've been styling hair professionally for
about six or seven years.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.750
I have been cutting and coloring hair though
since I was 13 years old.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.189
So it has always been a very natural art form
for me.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:31.929
As an artist, using other means to create
art, it just seems like a natural extension

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:32.929
to that.

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:35.060
As far as that goes, I love all types of beauty.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.060
I love make up.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.060
I love hair.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.199
I love fashion.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:42.579
And I think that it's really exciting to kind
of blend all those things together to create

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.579
something.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.579
One of my greatest passions is working face-to-face
with actual real people.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.170
I get an opportunity to work with a lot of
great celebrities, but I really love working

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.570
with you know, the everyday men and women.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.710
I really love teaching women to pick up on
things that are really beautiful about themselves.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.500
I think it's a really special opportunity
to make somebody feel beautiful.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.280
I also am really passionate about tutorials.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.820
Every person that sits in my chair and gets
a haircut or style with me ends up leaving

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.480
with a little lesson on how to recreate that
look at home.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.340
I think that as a hairdresser that's one of
the biggest gifts that I can give you, is

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.810
how to expand your knowledge base too.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.520
So I've had a lot of people that I've been
working with for a couple of years and they

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.030
started out not knowing very much about how
to style and little by little, integrating

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.760
little tricks into their routine, and now
they're pretty savvy about how to style hair.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.540
They could probably come on and teach us something
here on HowCast.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.500
So a great way to keep in touch with me or
find out what inspires me, would be on my

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.530
Facebook page, so just search for me on Facebook,
Joy La Rosa hair stylist.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.200
That's how you'll find me.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.210
I also have a website coming soon that will
be JoyLaRosa.com.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.460
And now I've created a series called Hairstyling
101, that touches base on, you know, all kinds

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:14.500
of topics, anywhere from hair extensions to
bangs to curl techniques to vintage styles.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.010
A lot of really great things to check out,
so please keep watching.
