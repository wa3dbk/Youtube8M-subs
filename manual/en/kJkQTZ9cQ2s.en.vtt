00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.110
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	Hi I’m Brad Ross, Head of Corporate 
Communications for the Toronto Transit Commission

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.350
and I’m at Union Station with Andy Byford 
0:00:11.110,0:00:10.350
our Chief Executive Officer. Andy welcome.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.130
Andy today we’re talking about a major service change

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.001
to the 509 Harbourfront streetcar, 
what exactly will be happening?

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.450
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	Well that’s right Brad. 
This Sunday the 29th of July

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.950
we will be replacing the 509 
streetcar service, the Harbourfont 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.210
streetcar service, with a dedicated 
bus service that will go from here

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.059
up Bay Street, Union Station, go along to 
Queens Quay and then to the CNE Exhibition site, 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.649
and that’s a replacement service 
that will last up to a year 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.510
while Waterfront Toronto undertake 
major works on the Harbourfront.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.900
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	I guess one of the most important things 
for customers to understand 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.900
who come to Union Station, take the 509,

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.180
is that they’re going to have to come through 
the moat not go down to the streetcar platform

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.989
because buses won’t be going down there, 
is that correct?

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.999
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	That’s correct, so the purpose 
of this video is to explain to our customers 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.149
where to get the bus from , we’re going to make it 
nice and simple for our customers

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.090
and there will be plenty of signage. 
One important point to note is customers

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.509
will need to have a transfer, 
so it’s really important that customers 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.880
pick up a transfer from their point of origin, 
in other words, where they start their journey.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.830
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	We’re here at the bus stop 
on Bay Street just south of Front

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.990
where the 509 will begin it’s westerly journey, 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.409
can you maybe just explain for our customers 
what they can expect with this diversion.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.050
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	Sure, well we tried 
to keep it as simple as possible,

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.510
so starting here at Bay Street by 
Union Station the bus will go south

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.990
down as far as Queens Quay, it will 
then go along Queens Quay all the way

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.469
along to the Exhibition Loop 
which is where it will terminate.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:44.150
These buses will be labeled as 
509 replacement service

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.560
so it will be nice and simple 
and easy to spot.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.003
Coming back, pretty much the same route,
all the way along Queens Quay

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.720
and then back to where we’re 
standing now, just north of the junction.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.500
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	So the bus stop for people 
coming easterly and then northerly on Bay Street 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.659
will be on the north east corner of 
Front and Bay Streets.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.000
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	That’s right, again we’ll make it nice 
and clear, we’ll make sure everything is properly sign posted

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.059
and again please don’t forget to use a transfer.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.160
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	Alright, we’re going to head down now 
to Queens Quay to look at some of the work that

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.390
we will be undertaking together 
with Waterfront Toronto. 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.819
We’re onboard the 509 streetcar, 
what will customers see in the first

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:16.989
few weeks of construction?

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.650
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	Well in the first few weeks 
there won’t be a huge amount to see up at street level

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.799
although we will be doing some work to 
remove the overhead wires. Most of the work 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.359
in the first few weeks will be down here in the portal.

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.109
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	We’re here on Queens Quay 
where the bulk of the work is going to be occurring 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:33.829
on the streetcar line. 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.559
What is going to be happening, 
what is it going to look like in the end?

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:40.390
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	Sure, this is a good example 
of where the works going to be taking place.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.040
Working with Waterfront Toronto we’re going to 
move the streetcar tracks

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.080
from where they currently are, they’re going 
to be pushed to the south of where they’re

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.580
presently located to create a whole 
new roadway to the north

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.969
of where the road currently is located. 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:55.479
The important point to note is

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.709
we would have had to replace the streetcar 
tracks anyway, they’d reached the end 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.949
of their useful life, so we’re working 
in coordination with Waterfront Toronto

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.779
to get the work done all at once, 
which I think makes a lot of sense

00:03:05.779 --> 00:03:11.899
and minimizes the inconvenience.

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:11.899
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	Any final words for our customers?

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:13.650
&gt;&gt; Andy Byford:	Sure, I guess two points really. 
Firstly if you’re going to the CNE 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.090
why not take the 511 Bathurst streetcar as an 
alternative,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.049
that route will not be affected by 
these works and secondly, more broadly,

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.920
to our customers thank you in advance for your 
patience, we’ll make sure this bus service

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.549
runs properly and is well time 
posted and thanks ever so much 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.779
for your patience and

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:33.709
putting up with the inconvenience 
while this work goes on.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.500
&gt;&gt; Brad Ross:	Great Andy, thank you very much, 
and thank you very much for watching. 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.120
