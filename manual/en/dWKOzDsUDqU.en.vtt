Hi there.

00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:16.290
So I see that you found our troubleshooting video,

00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:20.653
which means that you probably neglected your hair care and maintenance routine.

00:00:21.523 --> 00:00:24.545
If your hair extensions already look like this,

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:29.903
you're not going to get them back.  You need to 
 scrap your hair and start over with a fresh batch.

00:00:30.332 --> 00:00:34.932
These are a pretty good quality hair extensions and they have still matted, so,

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.973
just like your natural hair can mat, 

00:00:37.307 --> 00:00:39.565
so can ANY quality of hair extensions.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.764
If your hair is in the beginning stages of this process,

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.282
there may still be hope.

00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:50.930
The way that you're going to get it back, is the first thing that 
 you're going to do is make sure your hair is bone.  Dry.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.364
I know you want to put detangler on it.  Don't.

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:55.592
Don't do it.

00:00:55.965 --> 00:00:58.013
The first thing you're going to do is 
 you're going to start with a comb

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.826
and you're going to comb out all of the tangles.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.924
The next thing that you're going to do

00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:09.614
is you're going to use the nylon bristle brush.  You need this for 
 your care and maintenance routine anyway, so make sure you get one.

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:12.326
These will pull out any of the finer tangles.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.381
So, comb first, brush second.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:16.823
The next step

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:19.682
is to use a professional clarifier.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.157
The clarifier is going to strip off all of the junk, 
 down to the bare bones of that hair extension.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:29.030
The most common cause of hair matting

00:01:29.417 --> 00:01:32.109
is from people using too much conditioner,

00:01:32.413 --> 00:01:36.127
or too many other conditioning products that then build up like a wax.

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:40.950
Wax is used for making dreads because it makes the hair stick to itself.

00:01:41.403 --> 00:01:43.480
So make sure that you clarify twice:

00:01:43.648 --> 00:01:49.810
Once will get almost all of it.  Twice will get pretty much 
 the entirety of anything that you could have put on your hair,

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.710
as long as it's a professional product.

00:01:52.498 --> 00:01:53.870
Once you get done with this step,

00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:56.330
your hair is probably not going to feel super great.

00:01:57.378 --> 00:01:59.810
So that means that you're going to need to do a restorative mask.

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:03.260
I'm recommending the Moroccanoil Restorative Hair Mask.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:09.610
What that's going to do is it's going to go in to the cortex 
 of the hair and help add any proteins and help bind it up.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.560
That's going to be good to help it maintain that integrity 
 so your hair doesn't become brittle and break off.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.230
Next,

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.610
you're going to want to dry that hair really well.  At 
 this point it should be feeling a little bit better.

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:24.070
Probably not going to be 100% there yet.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.730
You're going to use Moroccanoil once that hair is dry.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.490
You're going to smooth it through the hair and you're going to take 
 a flat iron and you're going to run it over the top.

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:35.990
What that's going to do is it's going 
 to help seal in that cuticle layer.

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:43.940
That cuticle layer is CRITICAL for maintaining the integrity that you just 
 put back in the hair with that restorative mask. 

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:46.580
Now that your hair should be feeling back to normal

00:02:46.745 --> 00:02:53.110
it's critical that you maintain your hair with proper hair care and maintenance 
 techniques because I don't want to see this happen to you.

00:02:53.983 --> 00:02:54.760
Good luck.
