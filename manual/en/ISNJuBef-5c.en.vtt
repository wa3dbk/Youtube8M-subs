00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.720
Hi, I'm Frank Pope with FBI Guitars, and I'm
here on behalf of Expert Village to talk to

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.969
you guys about how to build your own guitar.
One thing that you need to decide early on,

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.490
is whether you want to build a guitar that
has a tremolo system in it for the bridge,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.740
or whether you want to go with one that has
a fixed bridge. I'll explain the differences

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.539
to you, as far as what the guitar is going
to be able to do, and then tell you some of

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.490
the construction techniques that are going
to differ between these two guitars. The guitar

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.820
that I'm holding right now is what is commonly
referred to as a tremolo guitar. That means

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.400
that the bridge, the whole assembly, through
the use of a little metal arm, can tilt to

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.130
lower, not only the tension of the strings,
but the tuning as well. This is commonly the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.390
sort of thing you would hear in the early
playings of Eddie Van Halen, and other players,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.430
when you hear big dive-bombs on the guitar,
that's what you'll hear. If you look a the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.120
back of this guitar, you'll see that when
you build a tremolo guitar, not only do you

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.040
have to route through the body to put the
block in, but that you'll have to route some

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.620
of the back as well to be able to put the
springs and the control claw that holds the

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.610
springs, into the back of the guitar. So there's
going to be a limit at some point as to how

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.590
thin you can build a guitar, before the pickup
spaces actually emerge through the back of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.980
the guitar into the tremolo space. So that's
something that you'll have to keep in mind.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.470
If you'd like to have a guitar that's as thin
as possible, you can actually build one with

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.720
a set bridge, a hard tail as it's called,
and I'm going to show you that one in just

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.721
a minute. This is the other type of guitar,
commonly referred to as a hard tail. If you

00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:48.320
look at this bridge, it is secured to the
guitar with two posts, which adjust the height

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.651
of this particular bridge. When you look at
the back of this guitar, you can see that

00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.180
there is no routing coming through. There
is no routing in the back. Now the beauty

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
of a hard tail bridge, although it will not
let you do the divebombs, is that because

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.280
these posts are set directly into the wood,
the sustain on this guitar will usually be

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.549
better than the sustain on a tremolo guitar.
If you are simply after tone, and you don't

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:17.439
need a divebomb effect, it's a lot simpler
to build one like this, and you may want to

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.589
consider this one of the first ones that you
build.
