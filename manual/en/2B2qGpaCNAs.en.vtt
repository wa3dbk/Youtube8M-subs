00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.510
Hello and welcome to Web DM, my name is Jonathan
Pruitt. To my right as always, my DM Jim Davis.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.309
Today we're gonna be talkin' about 5th edition
Dungeons and Dragons. We're talkin' classes.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.459
Druids and fighters. Monks, rangers and rogues.
Now let's kick down the door and talk some

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:17.910
D&amp;D.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.960
Now, in 3rd edition the Druid was like. CODzilla.
You just couldn't stop the Druid. You couldn't

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.169
stop a Druid. Then they nerfed him a little
bit in 3.5. A little bit. Yeah, a little bit.

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.940
A little bit. So, 5th edition. The Druid.
Yeah. No animal companion, right off the bat.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.690
Yeah. And that stings. It's kind of like...
It stings. it hurts, y'know. What's up with

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.750
that? Yeah. You're friends with nature but
you can't have an animal companion? There's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.800
like the spell. But it's not the same. It's
not like the ranger. And that's, at the same

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.610
time, as a character concept they're one of
my favorites. You're still a Druid. you're

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.450
still turning into other animals. You are
still casting a lot of nature themed spells.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.610
A lot of which are really good spells. And
so the core of what the Druid was is still

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.910
there. And in my mind looking at the 5th edition
Druid and looking at how it plays and just

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.240
kind of how the game is its reminding me more
of the 2nd edition Druid than the 3rd. Whereas

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.690
3rd edition Druid was "give me the Monstrous
Manual, I'm gonna turn into one of those monsters

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.220
right now." It's like "give me this thing.
I'm gonna be this. And my guy's gonna be it.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.880
And I'm gonna be awesome and I don't need
the rest of the party." It was hard to get

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.590
Druids to play well with others. Now, Druids
play well with other because they're not outshining

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.170
the wizards, the fighters, the thieves, you
know what I mean. They've toned it down a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.080
bit but they've kept the heart of what the
Druid is which is a nature caster focused

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.270
around connection with the land or with animals.
For people who like that kind of stuff, it's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.409
still there. It's just, you've gotta lower
your expectations from what third edition

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.920
did, which is probably a good thing. Overall,
though, that's what 5th edition has done.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.549
It's kind of toned it down a bit. It's taken
that hyperbole and turned it into a normal

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.799
arc of character advancement. Particularly
for the casters. I'm anxious to see how higher-level

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.299
5th edition plays out, how they balance casters
and non-casters, but so far it seems like

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.650
they've got a good balance going. Now we're
on to my neck of the woods, the fighter. What

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.609
do you like about him? What do you like about
the fact that they kept over maneuvers from

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:16.450
Book of Nine Swords. To me Book of Nine Swords
changed 3rd edition and I almost consider

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.639
it core. I almost consider it, "this part
of the regular game". Yeah. So the fact that

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:27.069
there's something for people like me that
really liked the maneuvers. Part of what drove

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.239
me away from the fighters in so many other
editions is eventually I get tired of "I roll

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.930
to hit. And I'm done." And I roll for damage.
And I roll for damage, and I'm done. Playing

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.230
the Battlemaster Fighter gives you those options.
It gives you the ability to manipulate the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.739
game, to have resources that you can use,
try different things out. The other archetypes

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.560
for Fighter, it looks like the Champion just
makes a better Fighter. Yeah, you'll be a

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.489
badass. But, you're still gonna be like, "I
roll to hit, now here's my damage. I roll

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.779
to hit, now here's my damage, so." I'm really
glad they've done the Fighter this way, and

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:06.659
all of the fighting classes in 5th edition,
in which one of the things I really like about

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.709
4th was they looked at the game from a game
perspective and they said "Playing a fighting

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.120
class should be as interesting as playing
a casting class". Wherein other editions of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.129
D&amp;D the casters are over there poring over
their books. They are looking at things. They're

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.200
checking stuff out. They're finding all these
different ways that they can manipulate the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.609
game and the game world. And the Fighter is
just roll the dice, roll the damage, there

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:33.370
you go. And I like that they've tried to keep
some of that so that it's as interesting to

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:41.449
play. In terms of just equality of interesting
things to do at the table, it seems maybe

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:46.370
not equal, but certainly getting there. The
Monk. So, the Monk. Pruitt, tell me about

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.209
the Monk. I love Monks. I love them a lot.
I've taken martial arts. I'm a Black Belt.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.939
It's my thing. It's your thing. I consider
myself a second level Monk. That's up to...

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:00.559
a point of debate over the years. I don't
see why not. But that's fine. I love that

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:05.370
you can be a ninja in 5th edition. You can
just be an awesome Monk. You can be Bruce

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.599
Lee. Or you can be a ninja. Or, you can be
the Avatar. Absolutely. Which, the Way of

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.829
the Four Elements, I'm sorry, there's a lot
there that's like, "I wouldn't mind doing

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.659
that." Yeah. I wouldn't mind being a Fire
Bender, sure. And that's how you get me into

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:25.840
it. For me, I always saw the Monk as this
kind of odd man out like, "Oh, well, the game

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.190
was written in the seventies, and Kung Fu
was big back then, so, Monk!" But they're

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.759
just a guy that hits things. Right. The one
that summons elements from their being and

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.129
manipulates them, it's like that's the Monk
I want to play. Yeah. I want to play a Bender.

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.319
I want to play an Elemental Bender. Cover
myself in rocks and smash things. I wanna

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.979
shoot fire from my hands, that kinda thing.
That's what's exciting about it. Yeah. You

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.009
still get the old favorites, y'know, you get
your Slow Fall. You get your Mind and Body

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.060
Protection, y'know. But that's good point
about all of the classes in 5th is that there

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.430
is a way to create a character from earlier
editions of D&amp;D that fits in that classic

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.490
mold. That's the Open-Handed Monk. That's
the Monk that people from 1st and 2nd edition

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.050
are gonna be familiar with. Then, there's
the other two where it's like, play a different

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.909
kind of guy that hits things with his fists.
Wrestle a Dragon into submission. Why not?

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:23.680
As much as they get, the Ranger though. The
Ranger. I think that the ranger, much like

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.949
the Druid, I mean, yeah, you can be a Hunter.
Or you can, whats the other one, Beast Master.

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:34.550
It's not like it was in 4th Edition. And a
lot of you could say the same about the Rogue,

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.360
where, the Rogue and the Ranger in 4th edition
reached their height in terms of just raw

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.319
damage output and power. To me, the Rangers
a real heartbreak, because the ranger archetype,

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:49.180
that Aragorn, they're always scruffy, they've
got the cloak, it's like that's a Ranger,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.889
right? That's an adventurer. They live their
life outside, overcoming all these hardships

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:59.319
to do whatever it is that they're doing. But
then I play one and I'm like, meh. Yeah. And

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:05.000
so I'm hoping that the way Rangers are set
up now, the way streamlined skills work, the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.759
way proficiencies works, they get the animal
companion, so if you want an animal buddy,

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:14.319
there you go. I would just say that it's gonna
be a different type of game for people playing

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:19.949
Rangers now. You have to spend your actions
to let your animal attack. And so I'm curious

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.530
about how they'll play. And I think that like
everything else with 5th edition, I think

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:30.620
they've got the tone right, and they're on
the right track, and so my reservations are

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.750
more me saying like "Well, I don't know about
this yet, but I'm curious about what it is.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.569
I'm optimistic about it. So I think that hopefully
when we see some rangers in action at the

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:43.289
gaming table that they'll be really fun. You
spoke about Rogues just now. You have your

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.789
Assassin now. You have your Arcane Trickster.
You don't just have to be a thief, you don't

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.590
just have to go and open locks anymore. You
don't have to, but if you want to, you can

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.789
do it really well. Yeah. the one time I've
played a Rogue in 5th Edition, went with a

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.249
thief, and had a blast with it. Skills all
over the place, you're doing a lot of things

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.870
with bonus actions, you're doing a lot of
things just faster and better. In my mind,

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.249
the Rogue still suffers from the, you need
to be careful if theres a Wizard in the group,

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:11.699
that the wizard isn't just like "why do I
need to climb over walls when I can fly over

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.650
it? Why do I need to sneak when I can become
invisible?" But, you can say that about so

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.379
many different classes that it's hard to say
like, "Oh, well that's the fault of the Rogue,

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:22.249
is that they're not a Wizard". It's like,
that's not the Rogue's fault. It's just, y'know,

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:29.310
it's just the way it is. The skills and the
way that expertise kind of works in there,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:35.909
like proficiencies do, I dunno. Like the Ranger,
I'm excited to see them in play, in action.

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:40.620
Just reading through them and playing them
the one time that I did, they were fun enough

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.810
for me, and I'm not usually a Rogue guy. Yeah,
that's very true. Thanks for watching Web

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.749
DM. We're gonna have new ones every Wednesday,
tell your friends, come back next week.
