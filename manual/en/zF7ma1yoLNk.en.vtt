00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.180
Give me to drink.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.340
How is it that thou, a Jew,
askest drink of me, which am a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.266
woman of Samaria?

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:54.790
The Jews have no dealings
with the Samaritans.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.740
If thou knewest the gift of God,
and who it is that saith

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.250
to thee, Give me to drink; thou
wouldst have asked of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.600
him, and he would have given
thee living water.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.700
Sir, thou hast nothing
to draw with.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.420
The well is deep: from
whence then hast

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.790
thou this living water?

00:01:25.532 --> 00:01:30.850
Art thou greater than our father
Jacob, who gave us this

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.490
well, and drank thereof himself,
and his children, and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.470
his cattle?

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.610
Whosoever drinketh of this water
shall thirst again: but

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.310
whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.630
shall never thirst; the water
that I shall give him shall be

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.370
in him a well of water
springing up

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.620
into everlasting life.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.860
Sir, give me of this water,
that I thirst not, neither

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.110
come hither to draw.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.180
Go, call thy husband,
and come hither.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.490
I have no husband.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.865
Thou hast well said, I have no
husband: for thou hast had

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:30.740
five husbands; and he whom
thou now hast is not thy

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.060
husband: in that saidst
thou truly.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.715
Sir, I perceive that
thou art a prophet.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.560
Our fathers worshipped in this
mountain; and ye say, that it

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.950
is in Jerusalem that men
ought to worship.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.420
Woman, believe me, the hour
cometh when ye shall neither

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.220
in this mountain, nor yet at
Jerusalem, worship the Father.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.450
Ye worship ye know not what: we
know what we worship: and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.720
salvation is of the Jews.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.100
But the hour cometh, and now is,
when the true worshippers

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.740
shall worship the Father in
spirit and in truth: for the

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.000
Father seeketh such
to worship him.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.730
God is a Spirit: and they that
worship him must worship him

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.110
in spirit and in truth.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.020
I know that Messias cometh,
which is called Christ: and

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.925
when he is come, he will
tell us all things.

00:03:52.925 --> 00:03:54.790
I that speak unto thee am he.
