hi jim hensing with gm parts now today we are going to be talking about brake pad wear

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.430
and i've got josh here to give us a hand

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.310
take some time out of his day talk about what he
looks for in brake pads

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.560
and when we might want to

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.229
bring your vehicle in and have it looked at

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.420
when do you

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.989
typically inspect breaks

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:20.029
every time we do a tire rotation

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.839
okay so every time the tires come off you

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.199
take a look at all four sets of brakes or all four stations
yup

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:27.730
and then how do you determine

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.680
if brake pads are good or if they're bad

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.390
well we uses this gauge

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.770
which shows

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.240
a good brake pad

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.880
brake pads that are starting to get
worn

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.990
and red definitely should be replaced

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.010
after i have the tire off i

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.220
look in here with my flashlight

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.270
and find the gauge that matches up with the brake pad

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.240
I check it you know at top bottom and middle

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.609
to make sure there's no

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:59.810
abnormal wear

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.200
is there anything that would let
somebody know that should be coming in

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.120
soon

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.759
to have their brakes looked at or as their driving

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.130
a squealing noise or excessive
amounts of brake dust on the wheel

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.520
ok so if their front rim is darker

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.420
in the back rim that could be an issue there

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.980
yes if it's a lot

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.869
if its you know you're gonna there gonna be darker than

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.840
the back rims

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.000
that is an indication of

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.520
brake pads
alright is there any kind of pulsating when they're driving like some people feel

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.990
like a shaking is that
well that means that the brake roaters themselves

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.010
are warped

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.119
sometimes

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.460
it can also indicate that the pads are worn down

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.380
than what do you do for drum brakes

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.669
those are typically on the back right

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:47.909
yes
okay let's take a look at that

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.210
ok so looking at a drum brake now you can't

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.020
physically see the brake pad correct

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.149
brake shoe

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.250
ok the brake shoe

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.130
the first thing you have to do is remove the drum
ok

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.039
then you have your brake shoe right here and the lining

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.129
what we look for on the rear is

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.549
we inspect the wheel cylinder

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.379
and all the springs makes nothings broken 
make sure the wheel cylinder is not

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.109
leaking brake fluid

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.109
and then we use our gauge

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:24.329
to inspect the rear

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.529
and these are at four millimeters

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.989
now with rear brake shoes

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.439
they're not as thick as a front brake pad

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.369
brand new out of the box

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:37.859
but rear breaks don't as much breaking
as the fronts

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.679
so the front brakes would usually get replaced

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.739
sooner or often than the
usually two to one on the back brakes

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:44.749
ok

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.239
well thank you I appreciate your time today
no problem

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.479
I'd like to thank josh for helping us today to go over brake pad wear and look for more informational and

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.340
how to videos at your favorite place

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.360
