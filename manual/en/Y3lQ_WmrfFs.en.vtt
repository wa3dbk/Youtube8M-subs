Hi, I’m Farley still talking about wine
today. I think something that also confuses

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.570
people is determining if wine is bad or not.
I think a lot of times people use the term

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.600
cork and they are not really sure what they
are talking about. This is sort in reference

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.070
to ordering wine in a restaurant because a
wine can be not what you expected and it can

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.010
also be something you did not like but that
does not necessarily mean that it is bad technically.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.419
It can be a fine wine and somebody else could
like it but it’s not just to your taste

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:40.230
so you can’t really blame your lack of knowledge
or you not knowing what to order from the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.710
wine being bad. Times when a wine can be bad
include when it is corked. What that means

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:55.530
is that the actual cork which these corks
that are not synthetic that are actually cork

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.190
come from a particular tree in Portugal in
which the bark is stripped off and then the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.970
trees are cut into slabs. Sometimes those
pieces of wood are just thrown onto a forest

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.720
floor while they cut the rest of the trees
and what can happen is that wood can get wet

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.590
and it can develop an invisible mold. Now
that mold you can’t see, and so when the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:30.659
corks are cut and sent to various wineries
across the world and put into the bottles.

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.860
If that mold is present, then as the wine
is stored with this cork that mold is actually

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.920
going into the wine and it is sort of a musty,
just off flavored and you can pretty much

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.790
as soon as you smell the wine as soon as it
is poured, it smells like extremely over exaggeration

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.360
of the cork itself. Usually you can’t smell
the cork which is why you don’t smell it

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.399
in a restaurant. But if the wine itself smells
kind of corky and is off, then it has gone

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.090
bad and you should not have to pay for that.
Another thing that can be wrong with wine

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.860
is if it does get air into it some how and
it becomes oxidized. You will be able to know

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.120
that almost immediately. It’s a flaw that
is easier to recognize than a corked wine

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:31.379
I think because it smells like vinegar. It
has already started turn and its had the oxygen

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:38.180
go into the wine and it is going to smell
like Sherry or Madara or just vinegar that

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.959
sort of pungent, over the top smell. There
are other flaws that are present in wine that

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.379
can come from too much sulfur that can come
from improper storage. Sometimes you will

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:59.900
have wine that has cardboard mustiness to
it and that is from improper storage. Sometimes

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.870
it will go away after the wine has been opened
and it will sort of fade out and the wine

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.540
will still be good. So if you do open a bottle
of wine that you think might not be quite

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.269
right and you don’t feel like trying to
take it back or it’s a wine you have had

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.129
for a long time, come back to it. Don’t
just immediately assume that it has gone bad

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:28.510
and pour it out. It might dissipate so put
the cork back in it, maybe come back to it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.592
12 to 24 hours later and you might find that
it has taken on a different taste and you

00:03:33.592 --> 00:03:39.129
actually like it. But there are times when
a wine is bad and those are few and that might

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.930
help you to do determine when they are.
