Hey, what's going on? It's Bauer and you're
watching Computer TV.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.210
Of course you can get all the forums and all the
blog posts and all the information that you want

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.560
including more videos on great products like this
one from VuPoint at Com.puter.tv.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.790
But lets go and jump into this because the
VuPoint folks have come up with a very simple

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.150
solution to a problem that a lot  of people have, 
and that's getting their old printed photographs

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.970
into their computer, and being able to do it
really really easily.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.970
And the VuPoint Digital Photo Convertor does just
that. It does one job, does it pretty well.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.190
It's very simple, very simple operation.
Basically, you have one USB port, or one USB plug,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.390
attached to your device plugged in into your 
computer. Your Vista or Windows XP machine.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:03.300
It comes with a few trays, for various photo
sizes. A 3x5, 4x6 and 5x7, so depending

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.470
on which size photograph you're trying to scan, 
you just take your photo and slide it in there.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.940
This right here, I believe, is the, what was it, 
4x6, I believe.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.810
If you want to scan your 4x6 image you simply 
slide it into the tray, just like that, you can

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.080
see it just slides right down in there.
And once you have the image slide in a tray,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:28.520
open this up back here. See there is a slot in the
back for it. You drop your tray into the slot,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.830
and you push the copy button which will launch
the software, take a snapshot of your image

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.700
and put it into whatever photo editing software
that you like to use.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.130
In fact, it does it very very quickly, pretty much
instantaneously, it will convert it to a 5

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.110
Megapixel Image and it will scan it at 1800 dpi,
so you've got a nice high resolution image

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.950
that comes from your original printed photograph.
So it will also automatically adjust exposure

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.190
and will automatically adjust color balance to 
make sure that all of your photos look as good

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.840
or maybe even better than they do on the printed
paper. So if you have a whole bunch of photographs

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.170
 laying around, and you really really want to get 
them all onto your computer, and you want to do it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.780
really really simply, all you need is the VuPoint
Digital Photo Convertor.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.880
It's literally as simple as sliding your picture 
into one of these trays and droping the tray into

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.020
the back of the device right here. That's all you
have to do to get all of your photos scanned into

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.160
your computer.
So to get more information on this device, and

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.160
more, as I said earlier go to com.puter.tv to
participate in our forums and read all the blogs.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.600
Otherwise, happy picture scan!

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.510
To get more info on the VuPoint Digital Photo 
Convertor go to any of the retailers you see

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.160
