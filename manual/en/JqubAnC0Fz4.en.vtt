00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.970
great to have you with us on this Monday
let's talk about

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.090
focusing on the family as a strategy for
the right-wing

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.660
Senator Mike Lee r-utah was the first
speaker

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.650
at the Values Voter Summit we've already
heard earlier in the show before that

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.859
compelling interview

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.619
we just had we heard from Michele
Bachmann at the Values Voter Summit we

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.480
heard from doctor ben Carson at the
Values Voter Summit

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.980
and Senator Mike Lee from Utah says that
he actually feels conservatives haven't

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.859
been focusing

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.000
enuff on the family check out what he
had to say it may surprise you

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.570
to hear me say this but I think they
make a great port

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.899
times have changed we do need to broaden
our appeal

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.940
and we need to change the way that we
talk about the family but ultimately

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.070
the critics have it exactly backwards
the problem is not that conservatives

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.530
have focused too much

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.879
on the family but far to little

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.829
so I think Lewis this is kind of an
issue love quality

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.550
verses quantity they have focused on and
in fact

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.260
so-called family values have been almost
the exclusive focus

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.049
have many right-wing groups it's just
all the wrong ways that they've been

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:11.880
focusing on

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
like being against gay people being
against reasonable sex education being

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.920
against

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.310
legal medical procedures being against
democratically past

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.780
and Supreme Court upheld laws around
health care

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.909
the focus has been on very specific
types

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.579
a family's two-parent heterosexual
families

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.560
probably not minority families
definitely not gay families so the focus

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.040
has been on the family

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.939
it's just been completely selective and
partisan

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.159
and destructive focus yeah

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.299
it's just the AZ ne phobic

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.470
racist homophobic view

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.210
and manipulation basically or control
method

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.490
I how they want these families to be if
there was more focus on the family from

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.560
the right wing from those the from the
so-called Values Voters

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.250
I think the only the only way they could
in the way that they focus on family is

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.580
the next step would be

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.720
jailing women who get abortions and
publicly hanging gay people like it

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.900
based on their definition of focusing on
the family I don't know what else they

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.470
could meet

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.190
yeah I mean what's the ultimate goal
here to make sure that the only people

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.690
in the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.690
this country that are reproducing are
are white

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.110
straight Christian I Jesus lovers

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.220
I'm not really sure its it's really
tough to figure out but I think that

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.560
bitten if if the argument is going to be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.430
that conservative Values Voters need to
focus more on the family

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.860
it has to be a different type a focus or
or I can't even imagine

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:47.860
what that could possibly
