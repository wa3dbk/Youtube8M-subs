Hi, [I'm] Bobby crispy this video is part of a guitar lesson series

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.450
So today, I'll show how to pay the soul from come on feel the noize [buy] quite, right?

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.379
So I'll play it first then I'll show how it's played note for note using tabs

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.350
[ok] here goes

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.389
Okay, I've taken the [distortion] [up] so we can hear the notes better. Look more clean

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.470
Okay

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.739
there's too many notes to verbally explain, so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.589
I'll show the tab and I'll play it as it is in the tab and just follow along

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.500
Okay, so here's the first part

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.369
next part this

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.740
Next part is this

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.829
Okay, and this is the next part

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.760
that it's

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.450
Okay, this is an expert

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.950
Do that again?

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.459
an expert

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.410
Okay, the next [part]

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.130
You do that twice

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.769
Okay, expert is this

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.229
and

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.229
The next part it's the same run

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.220
going down

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.059
Or up, whatever you want to call it at the beginning

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.690
So it's just the same as [the] beginning beginning

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:58.249
it's

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.459
then the last part is

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.899
Okay, and that's the soul. [I] hope this lesson has been helpful and thanks for watching
