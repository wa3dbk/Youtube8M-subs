00:00:03.101 --> 00:00:07.092
let me give you some fun and depressing
fax about money in politics in america

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.522
so all mama's campaign although it had a
lot of donors

00:00:10.522 --> 00:00:14.041
uh... actually had over two-thirds of
the money sixty eight percent

00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:16.741
come from

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:19.882
ronnie's david of course at eighty two
percent of the money coming from large

00:00:19.882 --> 00:00:20.642
donors

00:00:20.642 --> 00:00:23.232
of surprises that low for on me

00:00:23.232 --> 00:00:25.212
uh... so in reality

00:00:25.212 --> 00:00:28.331
present no bomb is more beholden to big
donors that he is a small donors of

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:29.152
course

00:00:29.152 --> 00:00:30.252
in fact is

00:00:30.252 --> 00:00:33.242
over point three percent of americans
donated two hundred dollars or more to

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:34.401
candidates

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:35.652
impacts this year

00:00:35.652 --> 00:00:38.201
so that is a very very small percentage
of us

00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:40.492
but they actually care about

00:00:40.492 --> 00:00:43.532
but it's actually even smaller than that
because look if you give two hundred

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:46.862
bucks for four hundred bucks you think
it'll bomb was in a related to the white

00:00:46.862 --> 00:00:50.762
house beating george w_ bush is gonna
have used part of his energy task force

00:00:50.762 --> 00:00:53.092
a dick cheney rent of course not

00:00:53.092 --> 00:00:56.742
but as a cannot who was a cube over ten
thousand dollars

00:00:56.742 --> 00:01:00.412
so what percentage of americans here
over ten thousand

00:01:00.412 --> 00:01:02.512
or one percent

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:05.342
so in reality we're not talking about
the one percent

00:01:05.342 --> 00:01:07.652
where you can talk about the point one
percent

00:01:07.652 --> 00:01:09.742
the guys who actually run this country
although

00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:11.342
point or one percent

00:01:11.342 --> 00:01:14.452
and you could be among the top one oh
one percent richest but if you don't

00:01:14.452 --> 00:01:18.292
give money to politicians that you don't
get the bible

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:22.932
the ones that actually purchase our
politicians are not point no one percent

00:01:22.932 --> 00:01:25.062
and they set the loss of their advantage

00:01:25.062 --> 00:01:27.042
so that they would

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:31.412
speed which properties elbows in two
thousand four they had what was called

00:01:31.412 --> 00:01:36.132
amusing lee than american jobs creation
act which did no such thing several law

00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:36.851
passed

00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:40.612
a lot of these companies did not hire
people u_s_a_ fire

00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:43.222
it was about job creation it was about
lining their pockets

00:01:43.222 --> 00:01:46.222
well they lobbied for that and spent a
considerable amount of money to do that

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:47.022
it was actually

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:51.282
to repatriate their money back here in
the u_s_ that money abroad they want to

00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:52.322
bring you back here but

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:54.992
and pay very little taxes are paid
thirty five percent

00:01:54.992 --> 00:01:58.512
they want to pay in the ball part of
about five percent

00:01:58.512 --> 00:01:59.782
and they got their way

00:01:59.782 --> 00:02:04.142
you know what rate of return they got on
the money they invested in politicians

00:02:04.142 --> 00:02:05.682
twenty-two

00:02:05.682 --> 00:02:07.222
thousand percent

00:02:07.222 --> 00:02:09.012
rate of return

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:13.561
gee i wonder why corporations and big
business wants a by politicians

00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:15.501
invaded be immediate nafta

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:18.841
we allow legalized bribery here in the
united states of america

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.192
and you'd be a sucker not to participate
now

00:02:21.192 --> 00:02:22.991
but a former bribery is

00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:26.531
now i just campaign donations and not
just lobbyists but hey if your

00:02:26.531 --> 00:02:27.621
correctional staffer

00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:29.921
or you're actually congressman a senator

00:02:29.921 --> 00:02:31.662
wait till you get out of office

00:02:31.662 --> 00:02:33.251
and how we greece europe

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:35.901
in fact over the last ten years that we
know the numbers for from two thousand

00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:40.651
one to twenty eleven five thousand four
hundred congressional staffers and close

00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:43.231
to four hundred members

00:02:43.231 --> 00:02:46.781
left capitol the gulf of reliance

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.381
and it was the guys who admitted

00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:52.051
not like newt gingrich who says he's a
historical advisor to companies well

00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.621
please

00:02:53.621 --> 00:02:58.081
so that's a huge number on the stand
four hundred members of the house and

00:02:58.081 --> 00:03:01.531
there's only five hundred thirty five
members now of course number ten years

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:05.341
as a larger number before hundred to
give me a sense of perspective

00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:06.141
is endchar

00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:09.421
and trunk of those folks

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:11.232
what pay increase

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.912
that those people get when they

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:15.142
left the actual congressmen senators

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:17.381
to become lobbyists

00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:21.191
they are paying crease of one thousand
four hundred and fifty two percent on

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.011
aff

00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:26.081
she ever wonder why they do

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:29.551
exactly what big business tells them to
do it

00:03:29.551 --> 00:03:32.571
because that's how they get reelected
that setting at their funding for their

00:03:32.571 --> 00:03:33.422
elections

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:35.121
and that's how they get paid

00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:37.731
was saying leave office

00:03:37.731 --> 00:03:40.481
in the rest of the world might not quite
be aware

00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.741
americans are aware

00:03:42.741 --> 00:03:44.361
in fact when they ask

00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:46.191
the what is your top

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:49.261
priorities in the top runs in the
country

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:50.891
at at this election

00:03:50.891 --> 00:03:53.732
jobs came in number one but just behind

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:57.762
the issued that nobody talks about none
of the media asked about in this

00:03:57.762 --> 00:04:00.262
election cycle one of them did stories
on

00:04:00.262 --> 00:04:03.582
something of course both parties and
both candidates should not discuss

00:04:03.582 --> 00:04:04.962
number two overall

00:04:04.962 --> 00:04:06.911
was corruption

00:04:06.911 --> 00:04:09.482
eighty seven percent of the country

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:15.021
ease seven percent had never seen number
that large says that a money influence

00:04:15.021 --> 00:04:16.461
our paul

00:04:16.461 --> 00:04:18.431
and at least of corruption

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:22.351
so we know it here in the united states
you might not know all the details that

00:04:22.351 --> 00:04:25.731
i just gave you but we know what it
almost as we see it everyday they take

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:27.041
the money from the lobbyists

00:04:27.041 --> 00:04:29.002
and they do exactly what the lobbyists

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:31.522
asking to do when they don't give a damn
what we think

00:04:31.522 --> 00:04:32.702
the polls and

00:04:32.702 --> 00:04:34.182
and and how we vote

00:04:34.182 --> 00:04:37.682
is ignored immediately after the
election ballot the world might not know

00:04:37.682 --> 00:04:38.272
that

00:04:38.272 --> 00:04:39.942
in my come as a surprise to them

00:04:39.942 --> 00:04:41.092
that in america

00:04:41.092 --> 00:04:43.881
bribery is done on a professional level

00:04:43.881 --> 00:04:47.071
that it's not something that is
underhanded and you're right a little

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:51.082
you give me a little money in an
envelope in a stash in a way no we

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:52.631
legalize that'd

00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:55.941
and institutionalize that we made it
systemic

00:04:55.941 --> 00:04:58.132
so it has taken over the whole

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:00.132
body of politics in america

00:05:00.132 --> 00:05:03.902
this is how it works and that's how the
american people get screwed this is how

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:05.791
we lost our democracy

00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:08.851
you know what i think idea i have a we
need to get a constitutional amendment

00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:13.501
to fix this to get money out of politics
so that big business cannot spend are

00:05:13.501 --> 00:05:14.752
limited money

00:05:14.752 --> 00:05:16.342
corrupting our politicians

00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:20.712
doing crony capitalism and so that we
publicly finance elections so the

00:05:20.712 --> 00:05:22.662
politicians work for all us

00:05:22.662 --> 00:05:24.102
is so their donors

00:05:24.102 --> 00:05:26.962
wolpe dash pack dot com

00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:29.701
the website that we set up to try to
fight back

00:05:29.701 --> 00:05:33.501
we'll be joined us in that fight this is
the number one issue in america
