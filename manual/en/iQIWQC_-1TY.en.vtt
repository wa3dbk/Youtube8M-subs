Okay, what we do with halter training is we
start them out when they're about two months

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.420
old, where we just put the halters on them,
and we do that for a few days so that they

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.619
get accustomed to having that halter on their
muzzle. And just a couple minutes, too. It's

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.970
not a long period of time. None of halter
training lasts for very long. And then, what

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:28.710
we do is, we take them, the babies out with
their moms, and walk their moms with the babies,

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.790
and the babies want to be with their moms,
so they'll follow along and that way they

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.570
get used to the halter, the lead and a person
walking next to them and giving them commands.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:48.010
And then after they have that done, and actually
Evita was very very easy to halter train,

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.789
after that though we may take them with another
Alpaca their age, that is more advanced in

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.420
being halter trained, and walk with them.
And then after they get that down, she's nibbling

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.660
at me, after they get that down, we take them
out alone and halter train, and walk them.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:16.370
And we walk and they walk next to us. We always
walk with them on our right, and this is it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.500
right here, we use a loose lead so there's
no pulling, no force at all. It's all where

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.260
they're learning what we want, and we're going
back to that trust factor again. They trust

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.450
us and they know we're not going to take them
places or do things to them that would hurt

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.740
them. Another thing we try to do is we take
them to as many new places as possible when

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.720
we're halter training, so that they don't
get alarmed when something different happens

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.040
in this process. We'll take them all through
the pastures and walk them on the pastures,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.390
different directions. We'll take them on the
road and walk them in different directions.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.220
We'll even take them in the house and walk
them around the house to see just different

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.590
surroundings. We train them to walk into a
trailer and just walk out of a trailer so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.519
that they have all these different experiences
that give them more comfort and more self-assurance

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:26.090
in life surrounding them. The real purpose
of halter training, actually, is to calm them

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.019
down. Sometimes, we, you'll learn later, is
that we weigh them every month, and putting

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:40.580
the halter on them tells them right away,
"they want something out of us, and we will

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.609
comply," and they will comply. That halter
teaches them something of our relationship.

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:58.730
I don't know exactly what it is, but having
that halter on them modifies their behavior

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:59.620
and calms them down.
