00:00:39.854 --> 00:00:42.462
We decided to change
our daily routine,

00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:44.816
we performed a regenerative work
under the water,

00:00:45.216 --> 00:00:48.509
it seems to be a recreational work,
it's quite entertaining,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.697
but we're working on
their strength under the water,

00:00:50.698 --> 00:00:53.371
focusing on their well-being,

00:00:53.372 --> 00:00:54.876
in order to recover them
for the next match.

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:57.916
Water aerobics are rarely used,

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:01.172
especially when it comes
to women's soccer,

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:04.287
but we've been given
everything we need,

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:05.932
and that's something spectacular...

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:08.028
for our Coaching Staff
and for our players,

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:10.073
besides improving their performance,

00:01:10.074 --> 00:01:12.056
it motivates who's been
working with them.

00:01:55.978 --> 00:01:59.571
The Club's infrastructure is great.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.926
The last time I was here,

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:04.955
we didn't have
the same infrastructure...

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:06.388
to help getting recovered.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:07.980
That's very important to us,

00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:11.427
we disputed three matches
in one single week,

00:02:11.428 --> 00:02:15.988
and this treatment
is extremely important.

00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:18.689
It's a dream come true,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.724
in terms of infrastructure,
Santos FC is the number one,

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:27.780
and I hope this new season
turns out to be even better!
