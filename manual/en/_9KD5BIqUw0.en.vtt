00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.660
Yow whats up guys its xrayz and welcome to
the call duty zombie storyline part 1.5 weâ€™re

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.100
going to call this the Marine extras.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.830
now I never really did than episode on the
Marines and I always wanted to go back and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.830
do it but there's not really a lot of info
on them which is kind of funny and ironic

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.910
at the same time since they were the first
ones to be in the zombie storyline ah but

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.350
lets talk about the Marines for a second because
it saves one of the most I goes overlooked

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.450
most overlooked things in call duty zombie
storyline and in really and in in any call

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.310
duty zombie game after the first map not thrown
told we had Chino

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.820
she otolith have to after the first map not
been told we had Rugova Ruth actually takes

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.890
place when take them see is trying to take
Peter back from you he was basically undercover

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.330
at the root at the time and he found out that
he was a spy that he was kind aspirant rudimentary

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.860
five Peter so obtained Dempsey was sent in
with Marines no matter know of these Marines

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.240
are the same Marines from nocturne told it's
no details but the end result is that take

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.560
Dempsey was the only one that survived the
mission to rupee was anyone a surviving on

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.850
the back which was then captured by Richthofen
and then he was experimenting on and that's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.960
help you know the form Takeo take them see
all them came together as a group because

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.740
of these experimentations and before that
there was not duotone and the details are

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.310
not during tone is that not baritone was the
second outbreak now when people first saw

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.289
this was the first artist from the radio message
you like first outbreak where those were was

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:50.600
the first one so in essence the first outbreak
was origins is what we saw in the last which

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.549
is again a lot of irony here is ironic that
the last map pack for blackouts to was the

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.310
beginning of the whole zombie storyline which
was the first outbreak at the excavation point

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.319
that we all know already one of you don't
know what I'm talking about watch part 10

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.759
of my zombie storyline of the bartender part
zero in a really ended up deciding when one

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.030
college but it's it's how it all started that
was the original outbreak and then not duotone

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.707
was the second outbreak in this all happens
after degrees the Rees eyes weren't you know

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:15.707
basically Richthofen and Max is working in
the run the zombies and the zombies kind of

00:02:15.707 --> 00:02:16.707
escape the overrun the facility because of
Samantha who controls them if he gets managed

00:02:16.707 --> 00:02:17.707
to think about again kind of rambling on hearing
going on for something you can go back and

00:02:17.707 --> 00:02:18.707
see the call duty zombie storyline and codify
notes holding but we never really talk about

00:02:18.707 --> 00:02:22.470
the Marines the kind of faded into the past
and even even if you look them up like if

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.380
you look him up on Google insufferable Dese
unidentified Marines but does a few details

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.001
about them that a lot of people missed and
we discussed Senegal been able to the story

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:38.760
so now great starts from the cut scene that
we see in the cut scene we see a plane that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.569
crashed see someone was kind of just getting
up from possibly being unconscious and they

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.290
get up at the right kind of zombies are running
out of and they eventually start off in the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.060
map which is whether holding down the bunker
on trying to survive the night of the dead

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.549
and live as it is called he was easily when
not baritone means so it looks like they were

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:07.209
Marines they were on a plane of some sort
it comes down it crashes and they find themselves

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.659
in enemy territory which is overrun by zombies
so this basically means that there was some

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:19.400
sort of outbreak in the middle of the war
World War II there was some sort of outbreak

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:26.430
at the frontlines and the German soldiers
were infected by 115 and were treatises zombies

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.349
and we see the Allied forces these Marines
were possibly there you know just the soldiers

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.109
their plane goes down in the end of seeing
all the zombies and trying to kind of all

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.700
down the fort know where the interesting things
is one of the quotes at the mention the Marines

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.842
himself it is ironic that a game mode that
the fellas his community siphoning and they

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:51.500
never put any thought into it they ended up
becoming a huge story but when the cause of

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.320
the mention is were doing this for Peter and
Peter is actually one of the characters a

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.281
play in the world at war campaign threatened
the beginning he's only there for about a

00:04:01.281 --> 00:04:04.810
few seconds and he actually ends up dying
out of a lot of he gets play the world of

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.579
work campaign but in the campaign when you
wake up in the campaign you see that there's

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.540
other soldier with you and he ends up getting
killed and then tell you escape all that stuff

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.160
but that soldier who ends up dying the Marine
is mentioned in the zombie is one of the quotes

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.130
of his cut ironic that the know each other
in a weird you wake up in shock and the zombie

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.630
storyline he also wake up and shot in the
campaigns was kind of cool may be the Marine

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.300
that woke up there and saw that person dies
one of the persons that's in within the Marines

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.500
so that's about as much as we know on the
Marines at the moment it's kind of sad that

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.630
there called an unidentified Marines of the
never mention them again in the storyline

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.430
of the biggest can replace him and would like
you know the former is a resisted it was just

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.970
tacky outthink them see Nikolai and retail
finance Richthofen and sat at the kind of

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.250
blurred amount they don't exist anymore and
it is called the Marines but the kind of sad

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.990
if you guys ever want play is coming go back
go play world war the original world war plate

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.940
not duotone and you'll see the actual Marines
not be overconfident them but anyways guys

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.180
always enjoyed the video Sad really is short
video talking about the Marines that are never

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.770
mentioned after not duotone slightly mentioned
in Peru which we still don't know if they

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.160
even survived not baritone if they ever survived
the outbreak of the zombies is an ends with

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.680
you dying in the actual game but we never
know if the survivor if anything happens that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.610
