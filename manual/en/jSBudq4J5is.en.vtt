"speaker 1: I'm Katy Blumer.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:24.000
We're in the Douglas Lab at UCSF and I am
volunteering for the summer.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.570
I basically e-mailed Sean and asked if I could
work for him for the summer because I thought

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.439
his research was really cool.

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:38.890
I have partly been working on code for him
and partly been making nano structures.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.090
speaker 2: So my name is Sean Douglas and
I'm an assistant professor.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.079
One thing that we're trying to address is
how to build chemo therapies or better cancer

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.309
therapeutics.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.129
You would want it to be safe and effective
and you'd actually want to destroy only the

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.500
cancer cells and leave everything else along.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.190
So you want to spare all the healthy cells.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.680
speaker 1: I actually went to college wanting
to work at the state department.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.460
I wanted to be a translator.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.440
I ended up taking science my first semester
because I just, I couldn't imagine not taking

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.590
a science class anymore.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.730
And I was trying to sort of narrow down what
feel I liked and I all thought they were really

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:18.730
cool.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.500
But I wanted to pick the one that I thought
would have the most impact on the world at

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.620
large.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.970
And I think nano tech is very clearly that
because if you can manipulate matter at like

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.080
the smallest scale, which if he succeeds in
making his nano pods he could, you can do

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.800
anything you want.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.970
Like, you wouldn't have waste anymore because
you could just recycle anything into anything

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.490
else.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.160
And you could have better medicines.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.880
I don't know, I always liked science but I
never really saw it as something I would end

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
up doing.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.030
Like I wasn't the sort of person who ended
up being a scientist.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.710
But I just kept doing it and then I became
a scientist.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.320
I'm working on one program to help stuff on
design sequences for something he's working

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320
on.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:15.459
So that's a lot of just like looking at DNA
strands and doing things with them.

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.340
And then also I'm working on another project
where I get to make my own DNA nano structures.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.750
And so for that Sean wrote what's actually
the, I think the main program in the field

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.930
for DNA nano structures.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.319
So basically we use this program called CAD
Nano where you just sort of route the DNA

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:42.150
strands in this interface that he designed
and it does everything for you and it can

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.980
output the sequences you need once you've
sort of drawn what you would like to happen.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.159
Well, we're working on the precursor.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.780
It's a part to larger things.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.549
A lot of the products I'm working on have
to do with making it easier to produce nano

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:57.950
structures.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:04.639
So like larger scale structures or making
a lot of them.

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.469
I think they wanted to be moving into clinical
trials in the next couple of years.

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:13.069
And so when you do that, you have to be able
to, if you're making a medical device you

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.920
have to be able to make a lot of it so that
you can inject it into someone.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.439
You can't just like give them one nano structure.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.650
So it's very important to be able to make
a lot cheaply.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.170
So that's one thing we're working on.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.519
One of the reasons I like nano tech is I read
this one book where they like, they just had

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.139
these nanobots that could cure anything and
they could stop people aging so like they

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.219
just kept you in perfect health forever.

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:42.870
And I think that is probably I mean eventually
possible right.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.739
Maybe not exactly soon but I think that's
a pretty good goal, to have everyone in good

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:48.029
health."
