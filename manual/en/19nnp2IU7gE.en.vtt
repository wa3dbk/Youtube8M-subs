00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.819
My name is Craig Lind, I'm a university lecturer in law at the University of Sussex in Brighton.

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.210
I've been working in the UK for over 20 years.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.969
I came to the UK study family law at post graduate level and then settled

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.500
to find a job teaching family law and
and have never left.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.199
Family law of course is about the relationships
between individuals,

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.090
particularly about the rights the that
derive when people have problems with

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.449
the people to whom they related.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.769
I'm interested in the relationship that
adults have with one another, how do people

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.619
go about arranging to have their children?

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.000
What are the consequences of making those
arrangements particularly in the more difficult circumstances of assisted reproduction

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.500
where doctors can assist people to bring children into the world.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.500
 We have to of course work out how lawyers respond, it's not just a bunch of practicing lawyers

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
deciding for themselves who the parents of children should be.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.100
In the UK we've had two major pieces of
 legislation, one in 1990

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.680
and one in 2008 which determines who the parents of 
children would be

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.190
where donor sperm and donor eggs
were being used.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.500
So our 1990 legislation basically
reallocated parenthood for the first time we said

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.119
that the parents would be the people who
raised child and people we knew

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.000
were not genetically related to the child.  

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.530
What the law in 2008 did was to catch up, all it did was to recognize that those people who were

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.900
having children in these ways were in fact parents of children. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.939
I mean it really becomes problematic for lawyers when

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.119
donors started to be involved, so when people
donate their sperm

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.000
or people donate eggs to other couples to have children,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.829
I mean in those instances we have to determine

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.900
what the relationship is between the
sperm donor or the egg donor and the child,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.560
what the relationship is between the 
commissioning couple

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.110
and the child and what should happen to
the people who are and the donors

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.200
of parts of the procreative genes.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.700
In the old days of infertility we
were only really concerned about married couples

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.600
but the world has moved on, there are a lots of
people who live together without getting married,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.200
there are lots of people who want children
without having a partner and then of course there are same-sex couples.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.060
So if a lesbian couple went to a to a clinic
and

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.400
decided to have children they would clearly have to
use donor sperm,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.800
we would have a child born as a
result of the one woman carrying the child

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.400
using her own eggs and carrying the child
using donor sperm, she would be the mother

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.740
but what would be the person who
accompanied her? What would be her partner? 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.000
What status would her partner be? 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
The regulation of assisted reproduction has become quite international, we are

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.910
interested in the ways in which other states are doing, it simply because

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.300
lots of the problems of assisted
reproduction are becoming internationalized.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.400
People are crossing boundaries to have children.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.370
Young people should grow up in a world
in which they have views on

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.300
how assisted reproduction and the
various medical techniques that are going to develop

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.280
are going to affect the legal status of
parents and the relationships that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.750
parents and children have with each other

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.140
and in particular of course the relationship
that children have with people

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.519
who are genetically related to them
but who are not their parents. 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.910
If you were minded to study in UK, you might also find

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.959
a similar framework for study

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.510
in North America, no matter where you
studied either in

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.650
the UK or in Canada or in the US or possibly

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.630
in most other jurisdictions in the
english-speaking world you would come to

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.459
know something of those other jurisdictions anyway.
