00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.160
If you're keen to both protect and maintain
your Android device then Advanced Mobile Care

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.210
might be the application for you.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.690
It combines several applications into one
and can be as simple to use as tapping one

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.890
button and as advanced as being able to deal
with all your concerns.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.160
Let's start with the simple one button method
of the application.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.789
The main screen consists of a single scan
button which, when pressed, will check for

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.580
viruses, running tasks, cached files and junk
files. This process takes little more than

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.410
20-30 seconds and when it's finished, all
you need to do is press the repair button

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.920
to clear the tasks and junk files. It can
be as simple as that.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.030
But, if you want to you can investigate each
of these areas in more detail by pressing

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.800
on the specific areas. You can check the tasks
that are running and see the distribution

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.211
of those cache files to identify which applications
are creating an excess amount of them. The

00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:01.120
junk files screen will show you stuff like
old log files, picture thumbnails and browser

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.309
history. And from each of these screens you
can clean up what you like.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.139
But we've only scratch the surface of Advanced
Mobile Care. Pressing the box at the bottom

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:15.029
of screen reveals even more cool things you
can do to look after your device.

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:18.840
The applications manager allows you to check
on applications that are installed on the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.939
device and uninstall them if you wish. You
can also check on application files you've

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.070
downloaded as well as install or remove them
if you wish.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.149
You can also let Advanced Mobile Care manage
your battery life. This requires a single

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.710
press of a button. But again, if you want
to tailor the battery saver options to your

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.590
preferences and adjust individual settings
you can do so be pressing the customise settings

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.740
button.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.380
You can now begin to see that what Mobile
Advanced Care is doing is bringing all those

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.450
individual apps you've used for such tasks
into one. This task killer is just another

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.749
example of that.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:05.709
This next function is really useful. Privacy
Advisor will sniff through your applications

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:12.000
and give you a breakdown of what your applications
are doing such as reading your location, delivering

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.510
adverts, and accessing your SMS and identity
data. These are usually permissions you agreed

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.480
to when you first downloaded the application
and sometimes these are unavoidable (especially

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.819
adverts in games). But, obviously, if you
find something suspicious you can then remove

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.640
the offended application.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.099
Advanced Mobile Care also comes with a privacy
locker. Once you've created a password you

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.060
can then choose files to hide from general
view of the device.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.310
So, in this example I will choose a picture
from one of my albums, in this case the screenshots

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.469
album. This file becomes locked into Advanced
Mobile Care so I can only view the file from

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:59.790
this location (after I've put my password
in of course). If I go into my gallery application,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:11.709
you can see now that the screenshot I locked
has completely disappeared. All I need to

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.930
do is return to Advanced Mobile Care to view
it or unlock it.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.909
And guess what, we're not even done there.
Advanced Mobile Care includes an Anti-theft

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.010
function. You can set a password, and then
you can alarm, lock, or get the location of

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.239
the lost phone. And you can even save your
contacts and call logs to a cloud service

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.660
to make it easy to copy stuff from one device
to another.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.760
If you want to maintain, improve the performance
of, and protect your Android Device, Advanced

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.739
Mobile Care covers the bases unlike any other
free application available. It even includes

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.799
a game performance improvement option and
while you might have seen me demonstrating

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.249
this application on a smartphone, Advanced
Mobile Care does the business just as well

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:45.969
on tablets.

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:51.749
So why bother having several applications
when you can use one as simple and comprehensive

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.530
and Advanced Mobile Care?
