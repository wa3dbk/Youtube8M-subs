00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.419
Lots of strange things cross my path each
day. But enough about the oddballs at the

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.550
interplanetary shuttle stop, I�m here to
talk about Game Gear puzzle games. Specifically,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.500
Skweek - with two Es, two Ks, and a touch
of affectation - a Q-Bert-style �change

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.820
the colors of all the tiles� walkathon with
some shooting elements, enemies roving all

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.750
about the freakin� place, and... well, that�s
about it. It�s a Game Gear game, after all,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.970
not some big-budget PS3 zombiethon. Oh, and
it�s French, at least, according to that

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.910
armadillo-looking thing in the titles. Normally,
that�d be a reason for me to shoehorn in

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.370
some Wakfu references, but right now I can�t
be bothered. There�s early-90s portable

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.789
puzzling to be had, which means I could be
incommunicado for some time. If I�m never

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.309
heard from again, blame Felicity in Worcestershire
for donating this.

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:16.710
So you�ve got... um... Skweek. (I keep finding
myself unable to spell that word their way.)

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.790
Skweek�s a ball of fur with feet and a face,
and apparently, the ability to fire projectiles.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.250
(Always useful.) His task is to beat those
feet over some number of blue and/or green

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.579
tiles in each stage, turning them pink, and
not getting nabbed by the ghosts or weird

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.500
anemone-looking things or fast UFO-looking
things. Awright, so let�s face it, it�s

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.130
a terribly abstract kind of a puzzle game,
one that feels like a long-walking Adventures

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.770
of Lolo but with unlimited ammo. And, should
you happen to pick up some of the available

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.580
power-ups, said ammo can be distributed in
four or even eight directions, turning Skweek

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.810
there into some kind of death-dealing troll
doll avenger. Which is a terrifying thought,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.700
let me assure you. In a terrifically convenient
move, though, an indicator at the top of the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.439
screen not only alerts you to the appearance
of a power-up, but which direction ol� Skweek

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.280
there has to go in order to obtain it. Some
of these power-ups include increases to running

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.450
speed, the aforementioned multidirectional
firing, or... teddy bears. Yes, teddy bears,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.239
four of �em in all, which soak damage directed
at your party until collapsing into a heap

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.420
of stuffing to be left... wait a minute, I�m
just getting a report that I�m thinking

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.870
of EarthBound instead, and the bears here
serve to give you level warp and 5-life bonus

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.720
if you collect the set. Also, they don�t
have psychokinetic powers, aren�t available

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.109
in department stores spread throughout the
game, or ate any of the tasty eucalyptus leaves,

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:44.940
yum yum.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.090
There are 99 stages in all, navigable by a
four-letter password system. Each stage spans

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.400
a number of screens laterally, with forced-movement
floors, breakaway floors, enemy spawn points,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.970
and narrow causeways aplenty. While the game
itself isn�t particularly tough by any stretch

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.000
of the word, some levels can be a bit tricky
to complete inside the allotted time limit,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.049
which is typically set to give a challenging,
but fair, level of added difficulty. Skweek

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:12.459
never broke the kind of ground a Lolo or a
Puyo ever did, but he had a healthy run throughout

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.549
the European community on those Amiga and
Amstrad systems that remained largely a mystery

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.370
to we here in �Murrica. Skweek lives on
even to this day in an iOS remake of his adventures,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.900
which I recommend you obtain if you�re a
fan of pom-pom-looking guys with guns, puzzle

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.840
action, and tangential relations to Pac-in-Time
(yes, the weird side-scrolling Pac-Man game

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.239
that doesn�t involve a slingshot). But to
dig further into that, I�ll have to find

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.169
a copy of Fury of the Furries in this box
Felicity sent us, and I�ve still got at

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:43.809
least three geological strata to go.
