00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.290
Welcome to Revelation Unraveled,
I'm your host, William Tapley,
also known as the

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:06.819
Third Eagle of the Apocalypse

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.080
and the Co-Prophet of the End Times.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.000
Yesterday, one of my subscribers sent me
a note saying that I should do a video

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
on the mascots for the 
2014 Winter Olympics

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.510
in Russia.  And he pointed out to me 
that the three mascots

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.519
are very similar to the three beasts

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.000
that come up out of the sea 
in Daniel, chapter number 7.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.100
And we know that Daniel is describing

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.610
three ancient kingdoms and kings

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.480
in that passage but he is also
describing three

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.790
present-day kings and kingdoms and we
know who they are.  We know the

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.090
lion represents England, the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.640
bear represents Russia, and 
the leopard represents our

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.129
own Barack Obama and the United
States.  So let's take a

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.000
closer look at these three mascots 
which were voted on by the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.300
people of Russia by the way,

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.890
and see how close they are to the

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.220
beasts from Daniel, chapter number 7.
Now, first of all,

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.799
notice that this leopard is in two
colors, this is the only mascot in

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.939
two colors, the others are 
solid colors. The two colors

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.500
indicate a leopard because they reflect

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.509
Barack Obama who has a biracial

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.860
background and that's why Daniel
uses the leopard to symbolize Obama.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.799
What's really interesting is 
that they depict this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.140
leopard mascot with 4 toes

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.420
on one of his paws but without any toes

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.640
on the other paws and that 4 of course
is important because there are also

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.299
4 little boxes

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.630
on this mountain climbing belt, maybe 
you can see that maybe you can't,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.369
but that reflects the four heads
and the four wings

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.659
on the leopard in Daniel also.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.149
Now this middle figure is not quite accurate.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.689
First of all, these three figures are
supposed to indicate the first, second,

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:05.799
and third places

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.640
on the podium at the Olympics, so 
they are showing this center figure,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.870
who would normally be the first place
winner, much smaller than normal.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.500
If this were showed correctly,
it would be very high

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.980
and if it were to be true to Daniel,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.830
this figure should be a lioness, but at
least they have the gender right.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.400
This little bunny rabbit is 
feminine.  And of course

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.100
on the right we have the bear,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.310
the third beast that comes up 
out of the sea, actually the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.180
second beast.  And they show the bear

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.660
as larger than the other two animals, and
I believe that's because the bear

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.430
symbolizes Russia.  What's really
interesting is that the bear does not

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.510
have four toes.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.599
The bear has five toes on this paw,

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.319
5 toes on this paw,  and 3

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.349
on one of the feet and two 
on the other feet.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.530
I think that they are trying to
expropriate

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.890
the number 555 for the bear

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.760
and that is not accurate 
as far as prophecy goes.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.060
So yes, they are correct in showing

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.319
the bear higher than the leopard.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.780
That indicates that Russia will defeat

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.989
the United States and 
Barack Obama, however,

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.430
the 555 as far as the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.650
toes go, will defeat the final One World

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.159
Communist Tyranny.  And the 555

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.500
symbolizes Mary's rosary and that is
also indicated by the 15,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.739
15 and 15.  15

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.959
is most definitely a rosary number

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.799
in Bible prophecy.  Now you might say
this is all a coincidence but

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.379
let's take a look at the official logo
for the Russian Winter Olympics.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.220
So here on the right we 
see 5 Olympic rings,

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.000
I believe those rings symbolize 
the 5 continents,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.700
and we see the 5 Olympic rings over here

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.590
also,  and we see 5 leaves

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.900
arranged in a semi-circle.  
It's quite an interesting

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.070
design but what that gives us is 555.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.750
Now I'm not sure how much
the designers of these

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.130
mascots or logos knew 
what they were doing

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.990
but on the other hand, the 
numerology of the Bible

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.970
is embedded in human consciousness.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.759
And now, here's another logo I would like
you to get interested in:

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.040
If you would like to receive a free
bumper sticker

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.699
simply send me a self-addressed, stamped
business size envelope to the address

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.900
you see on your screen.
