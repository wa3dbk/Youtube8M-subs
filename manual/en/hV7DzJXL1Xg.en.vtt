00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.860
Today is my birthday!!

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.440
and how to celebrate it better than drinking a lot of crap?

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.180
I'm turning 20 years today

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.020
so I thought it would be fun to do the smoothie challenge

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.960
because many of you guys wanted me to do this

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.660
I thought that I should do it

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.140
I didn't know what it was at first

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.620
so I watched some Youtube videos yesterday

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.220
in every video I watched, they were two people

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.160
and because I don't have my friends here yet

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.860
I decided to do this by myself

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.660
and smoothie challenge is about choosing a certain number of ingredients

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.360
I've choose 14 ingredients

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.360
7 disgusting and 7 that tastes good

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.160
then I have small notes in a can

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.300
and I've written down all the ingredients on the notes

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.880
and then I'm going to pick the notes one by one

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.160
so I'll have a total of 7 ingredients in my smoothie

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.340
it can be anything from...

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.600
I have cat treats

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.900
roasted onions, dressing, blueberries, raspberries

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.240
my smoothie is going to be disgusting or delicious

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.260
you never know..

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.700
I think we'll start now!

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.940
after I mixed everything I'll draw what type of glass I get

00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:13.634
maybe a small one

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.360
a middle or the large one

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.220
and I'll try if I can, to drink up the whole smoothie

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.620
but it can be really disgusting so we'll see how much I can handle to drink

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.535
now we start by taking a note

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.380
the notes are mixed

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.600
everyone asks me where I bought this mug

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.360
I bought it in London at Primark

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.374
okay now I'm taking a ingredient

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.160
mayonnaise...

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.540
shit

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.640
good start

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.820
I hate mayonnaise

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.240
that's one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.220
cat treats...

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.580
SHIT

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.360
I get all the disgusting one's

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:55.900
euuuww

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700
poor Garfield, now I'm taking his candy

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:03.254
oh shit, this are going to be so disgusting

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.000
eeuuuuw

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.420
now I want a good one

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:07.960
Rice Krispies

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.340
it's at least better than cat treats

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.740
this will be a delicious smoothie

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.100
oh no, I spill everywhere

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.500
*singing* I spill everywhere

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.320
down with you

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.960
then we have the next ingredient

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440
please be something good now

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.160
blueberry!

00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:28.613
I don't believe that this will taste good

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.960
it's already cat treats and mayonnaise in so...

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.600
it doesn't matter if I get tasty ingredients or not

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.700
ketchup...

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.560
SHIT

00:02:40.694 --> 00:02:42.694
Oooh it's gonna be so disgusting

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:44.653
it's just this mass of disgust in it

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.660
I've had only disgusting ingredients except blueberries

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660
okay rice krispies are not so disgusting but..

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.920
eeeuuuww

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.900
two left

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.340
and then we have one of these one's as a base

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.560
Lime

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.020
That's good, where do we have it?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.760
heeelllooo?

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.980
just going to cut it

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.480
now I have peeled the whole lime

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.440
oh, I just remembered that I just brushed my teeth

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.720
the last ingredient

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.280
please can i get a good one?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.814
like raspberry or chocolate

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.600
creme cheese

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.200
that's not fun

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.340
cream cheese is delicious on sandwiches

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.160
but not in a smoothie

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.800
it's the creme cheese that smells...

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.040
my mom is calling

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.120
heellllooo

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.800
so

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.160
now I'm are going to raffle and see if I get vanilla yogurt or cranberry juice

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.920
I want to have cranberry juice because it's so sour and maybe take the flavor away

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.400
and this vanilla yogurt is really disgusting

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.240
it tastes like poop

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.440
cranberry juice!

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.500
heeellloooo, is anyone home?

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.994
perhaps that was a little too much

00:04:03.994 --> 00:04:04.614
I don't care

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.500
it's leaking!!

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.880
?????

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.820
that was all the ingredients

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.560
so now I think we'll start this motherf*cker

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.240
smoothie

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.480
it looks very good

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.940
but I haven't smelled it yet

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.000
now let's see which glass I get

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.236
please, I want the small one...

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.820
YES!

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.960
the small one!

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960
okay maybe you don't see what it says

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.640
what the hell

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.780
it smells so disgusting

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.880
I will never make it

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.640
it looks very good but it smells like hell

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.140
it's probably the cheese that smells think

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.674
why do I do this to myself?

00:05:01.674 --> 00:05:03.214
on my birthday and everything

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.260
okay.. I felt the taste of ...

00:05:12.234 --> 00:05:13.754
the cat treats

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.600
this is not fun

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.414
I think it's the cat treats and the creme cheese that tastes so much

00:05:29.414 --> 00:05:30.934
I don't wanna do this anymore!

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.740
okay, I'll take one more sip and then I don't think I can do this

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.740
damn it's disgusting!

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.220
I'm sorry but I can't do this anymore

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220
it's so disgusting!

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.880
at least I drank a little bit

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.500
this is the most disgusting drink I've ever tried

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.440
I feel like I'm going to puke

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.900
this was the grossest thing I've done

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.820
I will probably never do this challenge again

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.380
I feel sick on my birthday

00:06:22.494 --> 00:06:23.214
