00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.667
- WE WANT TO SOLVE 
THE GIVEN RADICAL EQUATIONS.

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.667
IN GENERAL, IF AN EQUATION 
CONTAINS ONE RADICAL,

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:10.233
WE WANT TO ISOLATE THE RADICAL 
ON ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION

00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:12.167
AND THEN RAISE BOTH SIDES 
OF THE EQUATION

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:13.767
TO THE POWER OF THE INDEX.

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.667
THIS WILL UNDO THE RADICAL

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.633
AND THEN WE WANT TO SOLVE 
THE RESULTING EQUATION

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.867
AND CHECK OUR SOLUTION 
OR SOLUTIONS.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:22.433
LOOKING AT OUR FIRST EXAMPLE,

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:26.400
WE HAVE THE CUBE ROOT 
OF THE QUANTITY 2X - 1 = 3.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.967
NOTICE HOW THE FIRST STEP 
HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE FOR US.

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:32.000
THE RADICAL IS ISOLATED 
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE EQUATION

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.367
AND SINCE WE HAVE A CUBE ROOT, 
WE CAN UNDO THE RADICAL

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:39.100
BY CUBING BOTH SIDES 
OF THE EQUATION.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.867
IF WE CUBE 
THE CUBE ROOT OF 2X - 1,

00:00:42.867 --> 00:00:46.867
THIS WILL SIMPLIFY TO 
THE RADICAND OF 2X - 1

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:54.400
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE 3 CUBED 
IS = TO (3 x 3) x 3 OR 27.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.833
AND NOW, WE'LL SOLVE 
THIS EQUATION FOR X.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:01:02.207
SO WE'LL ADD 1 TO BOTH SIDES 
OF THE EQUATION.

00:01:02.207 --> 00:01:09.107
SO WE HAVE 2X = 28, 
DIVIDE BOTH SIDES BY 2

00:01:09.107 --> 00:01:13.373
AND WE HAVE X = 14.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.207
NOW TO CHECK THIS, 
WE'LL SUBSTITUTE 14 FOR X

00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:19.873
INTO THE ORIGINAL EQUATION.

00:01:19.873 --> 00:01:26.340
SO WE'LL HAVE THE CUBE ROOT 
OF 2 x 14 THAT WOULD BE 28 - 1.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.140
THAT'S GOING TO BE 27 = 3

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:41.740
AND SINCE 27 IS A PERFECT CUBE, 
SINCE 27 IS = (3 x 3) x 3,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.573
THIS EQUATION IS TRUE

00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:50.507
AND THEREFORE, 
OUR SOLUTION IS X = 14.

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:53.407
LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR SECOND 
EXAMPLE ON THE NEXT SLIDE.

00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:58.007
WE HAVE THE 4th ROOT OF THE 
QUANTITY X/SQUARED - 6X = 2.

00:01:58.007 --> 00:02:00.413
AGAIN, NOTICE HOW THE RADICAL 
IS ISOLATED

00:02:00.413 --> 00:02:02.347
ON THE LEFT SIDE 
OF THE EQUATION.

00:02:02.347 --> 00:02:04.347
SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO RAISE 
BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION

00:02:04.347 --> 00:02:06.113
TO THE POWER OF THE INDEX

00:02:06.113 --> 00:02:07.347
AND SINCE WE HAVE A 4th ROOT

00:02:07.347 --> 00:02:09.280
WE'RE GOING TO RAISE 
BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.613
TO THE POWER OF 4.

00:02:12.613 --> 00:02:15.380
SO ON THE LEFT SIDE 
THIS SIMPLIFIES PERFECTLY

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.447
TO THE RADICAND 
OF X/SQUARED - 6X

00:02:20.447 --> 00:02:25.280
AND ON THE RIGHT SIDE, 2 TO THE 
4th WOULD BE (2 x 2) x (2 x 2)

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.647
WHICH IS EQUAL TO 16.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.980
HERE WE HAVE A QUADRATIC 
EQUATION TO SOLVE

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.047
SO WE'LL SET IT EQUAL TO 0 
AND SOLVE BY FACTORING.

00:02:33.047 --> 00:02:38.980
SO WE'LL SUBTRACT 16 
ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.213
SO WE HAVE 0 ON THE RIGHT SIDE,

00:02:41.213 --> 00:02:46.913
LEFT SIDE WE HAVE 
X/SQUARED - 6X - 16.

00:02:46.913 --> 00:02:48.047
SO IF THIS DOES FACTOR

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:50.713
IT'LL FACTOR INTO 
TWO BINOMIAL FACTORS.

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:53.680
THE FIRST TERMS MUST COME 
FROM THE FACTORS OF X/SQUARED

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.980
WHICH WOULD BE X AND X.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.753
AND NOW WE WANT THE FACTORS 
OF -16 THAT ADD TO -8.

00:03:00.753 --> 00:03:08.353
AND SINCE -8 x 2 = -16 
AND -8 + 2 = -6

00:03:08.353 --> 00:03:15.387
ONE OF THE FACTORS WILL BE X - 8 
AND ONE FACTOR WILL BE X + 2.

00:03:15.387 --> 00:03:20.620
SO THIS PRODUCT IS EQUAL TO 0 
WHEN X - 8 = 0 OR X = 8

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.220
OR WHEN X + 2 = 0 
OR WHEN X = -2.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.687
AND NOW, WE'LL PERFORM 
SUBSTITUTION

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:29.887
INTO THE ORIGINAL EQUATION

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:32.920
TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THESE SOLUTIONS ACTUALLY WORK.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.020
SO WHEN X = 8 WE WOULD HAVE 
THE 4th ROOT OF 8/SQUARED

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.920
THAT'S 64 - (6 x 8) THAT'S 48.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.453
WELL 64 - 48 = 16.

00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:49.120
SO WE'D HAVE 4th ROOT OF 16 = 2

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.487
AND SINCE 16 = 2 TO THE 4th, 
THIS IS TRUE

00:03:56.487 --> 00:03:58.887
AND THEREFORE, 
X = 8 IS A SOLUTION

00:03:58.887 --> 00:04:02.827
AND NOW WE'LL CHECK X = -2.

00:04:02.827 --> 00:04:07.560
AND WHEN X = -2 WE'D HAVE 
THE 4th ROOT OF -2/SQUARED

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:17.760
THAT'S 4 - (6 x -2) 
WHICH WOULD BE - -12 OR + 12 = 2

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.827
AND NOTICE HOW WE HAVE THE 4th 
ROOT OF 16 AGAIN EQUALS 2

00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.960
WHICH WE KNOW IS TRUE 
FROM ABOVE

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.093
AND THEREFORE, THIS EQUATION 
HAS TWO SOLUTIONS.

00:04:29.093 --> 00:04:33.827
X = 8 AND X = -2.

00:04:33.827 --> 00:04:37.193
OKAY, I HOPE, 
YOU FOUND THIS HELPFUL.
