00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.000
Now that you've completed the limber portion

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.570
of our workout, it's time to start loading
your core muscles. We're going to start lying down

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.330
on our back

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.250
for the first version of our dead bug.
Karen's going to lie down on her back

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.380
with her arms comfortably at her side

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.529
knees and hips slightly bent. Before we
actually move

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.790
let's readdress the bracing.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.220
so deep breath in, pull your ribs towards your hips

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.290
belly button toward her spine like the
world's tightest pants

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.920
and then pinch your pelvic floor muscles
like you're stopping the flow of urine.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.940
Now that the core is contracted let's
take those arms raise them just

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.600
to shoulder height and begin your
exercise at home

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.690
by marching right leg knees-up toes up,
hold that for a second at the top

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.309
and then back down and then left leg.
The key thing here

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.410
is to move in a comfortable pace without
letting that spine

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:14.090
move at all. We want true spine stability at all times. Maintain an abdominal brace

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.420
Relax those shoulder blades down in back as you're marching with those legs.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.960
Very good job. Excellent.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.670
Only bring that knee to hip height. We don't want to bring it any further than that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.010
and make sure that spine stays safe,
stable. Good work.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.110
Good. Abs tight, ribs are down

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.470
belly button toward her spine, pelvic
floors contracted.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.549
Very nice work. Make sure your breathing
here Karen.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.170
Relax those shoulders. Excellent job.
Marching, bring in that knee

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.380
up to hip height. Very good job.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.740
Good job. One more on this left leg.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.020
and relax.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.549
Good. Arms down your side.
