00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.320
going to be part 3 of the tutorial for the

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.100
large sunflower pillow and in this tutorial i'm going to be showing you how to make

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.150
the pedals of the sunflower. Grab your hook

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.900
and let's go. What you want to do is chain three

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.320
slip stitch in your

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.529
first stitch to form a ring

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.679
and chain 3. Now

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.780
in the ring you need to do 11

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.440
more double crochets, the chain 3 counts as 1

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.360
you need a total of 12

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.800
after you have 12, slip stitch in the top

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.070
of the chain 3 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.410
and chain 3 again and in the same space

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.910
double crochet then you wanna do

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.080
double crochet. Then you want to do 2 double crochets in the rest the stitches

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.270
around until you have twenty four

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.780
stitches

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.040
when you're done, slip stitch in the top of the chain 3

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.000
then chain 3 again and double crochet in that same stitch

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.010
then in the next stitch

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.730
double crochet 1 then the next its
double crochet 2

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.270
then you wanna go

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.310
double crochet 1 in the next, then double crochet 2 in the follow. Continue this pattern 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.700
all the way around

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.820
until you get to the end

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.300
when you get to the end of the row 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.550
slip stitch in the top of the chain 3

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.180
now we're going to start to make the pedals

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.590
chain 3 and double crochet in that

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.300
same stitch, we're going to keep doing the

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300
regular increased by one every round
but we're only going to be doing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.640
seven stitches and

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.220
working over 5 stitches, so what we're going to do is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.380
the first ones an increase and for this round we need

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.300
to do 1 double crochet in the next two stiches then an increase

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.690
so one here one here and then you need
to do any increase

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.690
and the last one

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.390
is going to be a single

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.290
so we have an increase

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.780
1 double crochet, 1 double crochet,  an increase, then 1 double crochet worked over 5 stitches

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.070
and we've got seven stitches total

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.300
what you wanna do is

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.989
chain one and turn your work

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.989
and now double crochet into those 7 stitches across

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.209
at the end of the row, chain 1 and turn

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.520
and now you want to double crochet in
all the stitches across

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.930
and in the very last stitch

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.000
you want to do an increase making it eight stitches

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.810
Okay, I increased my last stitch so I now have 8 stitches

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.660
chain 1 and repeat last row

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.070
this time going across all 8 stitches

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.440
and then the very last stitch you increase again making it 9 stitches

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.280
I increased in my last stitch, now I have nine stitches

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.299
chain 1 and turn. And now

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.629
for the next two rows just

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.989
double crochet in those nine stitches.
for two rows

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.849
okay that's the end of the sixth round. Now chain 1

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.700
now you want to double crochet

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.590
across and in the very last stitch you
want to decrease

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.069
by one leaving you with eight stitches

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.600
this round

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.680
so I get my last two stitches here and I
grabbed them both

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.690
pull through 3, then pull through

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.340
the two loops. Chain 1 and repeat that row again

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.019
decrease using the last two stitches

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.160
at the end of this row you should have

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.370
seven stitches

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.689
I now have seven stitches

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.849
now the next rows you're gonna be
decreasing

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:44.600
the first and last stitch

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.070
leaving yourself five stitches

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.700
now the next row also decrease

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.970
beginning then you

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.640
double crochet 1 and then decrease again

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.300
then chain 1

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:09.370
turn your work, now you just want to
double crochet in the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.610
Center. Next row, all you do is chain 1

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.860
skip the stitch then double crochet in the center

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.910
and then just slip stitch into the last stitch

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.970
then chain 1 and cut your yarn

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.700
the next one that you start, we're gonna do
it

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.100
exactly the same. except you're gonna be
going in through

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.430
this stitch where you ended, so

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.960
slip stitch into that last stitch

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.770
area. chain 3

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.540
than double crochet into that same
stitch

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.710
then you wanna do the same pattern as
you did before

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.080
there's your two so you want to do 1 double crochet in the next two stitches

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.080
then you want to do a double

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.460
then you want to do 1 double crochet. SO starting from this stitch to the last

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.910
stitch from the last flower you
do two double crochets

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.750
then 1 double crochet, 1 double crochet, an increase, you'll be working across 5 stitches

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.870
and you have 7 stitches total

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.500
just continue and make another petal and continue that around until you have 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.860
total of nice petals

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.480
