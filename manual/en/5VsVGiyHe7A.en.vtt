00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.750
I've played plenty of stealth games before,
and many of them suffered from the same problem:

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.130
Inordinate penalties if you occasionally just
said "Screw it" to being sneaky and brute-forced

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.290
your way through a problem.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.410
It's my prerogative to get into the scrum
and bounce around like a hyperactive badger,

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.090
dad burn it, and don't tell me that your average
burly dude with a gun wouldn't be just as

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.720
terrified by a warrior of the night attacking
from seemingly every angle at once like Chipp

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.950
Zanuff after a night at Charlie Sheen's house.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.370
But then I played Mark of the Ninja, which...

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.050
well, docked me some hyperactive badger points,
but still got the guard dead.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:01:00.460
Then I figured out the elegant way to do it,
and... well, the blood did flow.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.840
In Mark of the Ninja, you're... get this...
a ninja.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.000
Who's been tattooed and apparently that gives
some mystic powers, like being able to stop

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.790
time to aim a shot at a light to distract
and confuse a guard who then... eats it.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.630
It's sidescrolling, Metroidvania-ish ninja
platforming action, combined with some sweet

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.319
animation that blends a couple art styles
with some magical ink or something and...

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:26.789
awright, so these jokers can't read a haiku
to save their lives.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.060
But the gameplay's sound and responsive, so
long as you don't make the mistake I did and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.810
try to play this with a keyboard and mouse,
or in my case a cramped laptop keyboard and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.220
irritatingly-placed touchpad.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.250
Switch out for a gamepad, though, and you'll
have much easier time grappling, wall-climbing,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.069
crawlin' around in the air ducts, and flinging
kunai all over the place to knock out light

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.009
sources, shut down infrared sensors (which
you can totally see), hit gongs to make all

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.070
the guards go "Huh?" and then turn their backs
on you so you can slip in and... well, let's

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:03.440
just say you need work on your tracheotomy
technique.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.970
But the true measure of a ninja isn't how
many they kill, it's how many notice the killing.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.750
Sure, you can bludgeon a man down and stab
'im as he's trying to get up, but that's kinda

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.750
ugly.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.780
You can crush 'em with heavy objects positioned
precariously above their heads... which is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.340
honestly kinda fun.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.880
You can listen to 'em suffer, which is kinda
macabre but gets the job done.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.290
Or, if you manage to approach completely undetected,
connect with your attack, and then input the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.620
correct quicktime command, you're treated
to a stealth kill animation, the full complement

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.600
of bonus points, and the satisfaction of a
job well done.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.010
That said, if you truly understand the way,
the correct response is to kill no one, pass

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.939
through completely undetected, and only take
the lives of those responsible for imprisoning

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:44.620
your fellow ninja.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.909
As such, there are end-of-level bonuses not
only for never being detected, but also never

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.450
resorting to taking a life.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.519
Or you can just go hyperactive-badger mode
and kill everyone.

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:54.810
Your choice.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.879
Mine is a measured blend of both, at least
until I get really really good due to multiple

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:59.879
playings of this thing.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:07.400
Mark of the Ninja incentivises skilled play
without making frenzied bloodbaths unfeasible,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.760
which is an ideal balance.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:21.189
And I'll save you the hackneyed haiku I was
going to put here.
