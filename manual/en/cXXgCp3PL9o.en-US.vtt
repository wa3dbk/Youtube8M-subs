Welcome to the Learn Special Effects Makeup
channel on Youtube.

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.712
This lesion in the series of severe laceration
is the slit wrist.

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:17.340
You start up, by measuring out the scar wax
you need for your desired wound, make sure

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.050
the scar wax matches the skin tone you are
going to apply it to.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:33.579
Use your spatula to place the wax on you skin.
In order to remove tool marks and create skin

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.700
texture, you need to put some lotion on the
wax.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.949
Use the spatula to feather out you edges on
the skin, and go over the wax with some different

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.739
sponges. I use a textures sponge at first,
and then a soft sponge, to give me my desired

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.179
skin texture.
To create the wound, use you tool to model

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.730
up the shape you want. Be careful, and don’t
use any pointy tools.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:10.080
I always remove some of the wax in the middle,
to make an even deeper wound.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.460
To apply the makeup, I use the skin illustrator
on set palette. It’s a 99% alcohol activated

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.820
makeup, witch allows me to build up my makeup
in layers. I start up by using some blue and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.440
red around the wound, to make it appear more
sore.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:41.510
Then I add some brown to is as well, to make
it look really irritated and a bit infected.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:51.601
For the blood, I use some fresh scratch where
I want my wound to look deep and brutal. The

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:58.290
second step is to add some blood paste. This
gives the wound a nice 3d texture, and I wanted

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.340
to look for this wound to be really messy
and deep. The blood I ad in layers as well.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.880
Take something on, and dap it away with some
tissue, to make it look more realistic.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:22.590
Continue these steps until you have your desired
effect.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:32.709
