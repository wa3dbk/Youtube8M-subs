Welcome to the last episode of the Kate Show in this year. After this I´ll be packing my bags and fly in the mountains to play in the snow.
But first - The Kate Show!

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.020
 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.520
 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:28.040
In this last show I am talking about my year 2014. I loved your feedback in the Kate Show, at BigRedLazor and Gamescom. My gaming highlights after the commercial.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.340
I mean, after the comment of the week.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.820
Last week we talked about all the new game announcements of game awards and playstation experience. Veyd says:

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:59.760
I think, these events of publishers are a great thing. 
I don´t like to wait for conventions. At these conventions you get loaded with news. For me it´s better to get all of the information on a regular basis.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.780
I think, E3 is an exciting convention. This is one event, I definitely want to visit in the future.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:16.360
At first I wanted to talk about Sony making a new Mario movie. But because it's my last show I have something more personal.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.160
I just started here at Zoomin TV Games Deutschland.
This channel is pretty new. 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:33.180
Although I visited gamescom with Tamtu, Tim and Robert, we showed little gamescom stuff on this channel. When I came to gamescom in august, I barely knew the guys.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:45.460
Our days were exhausting and pretty loaded.
I was thrown in at the deep end. Did you ever do quite a few interviews a day, without ever have been doing it before? in English!

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:10.760
Gamescom was great!
We stopped by at Ubisoft, Nintendo and IGN, we played awesome games and met cool people. Tamtu for example met his hero Ed Boone, creator of Mortal Kombat.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.180
One of my personal highlights were the Borderlands cosplayers. Great costumes!

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.580
And I interviewed the Booth Babes.
Ok, I still have to practice the TH.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.440
*Zis is really ze best : )

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.560
My guys didn´t want to do the interviews with the girls. They said it would look awkward. I´m sure they just wanted MORE babes!

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.200
You both look great, have fun!

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:07.480
I am  a Düsseldorf girl, so I love to dress up in costumes. It was a happy coincidence, I had a matching costume for World of warcraft at home.
Perfect for Warlords of Draenor.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.020
And the Lara Croft costume is just waiting for February - Carnival in Germany)

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.020
Helau means yeah, let´s get drunk and party!!

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.863
Hurry up. 

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:15.863
I lost my hairpin.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.840
In summer I sat down on the BRL couch for the very first time. I was really nervous. So I mixed up XBox and Playstation. On our live stream.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.480
In the meantime we have to stop each other, regarding our jokes. They get quite juicy. There´s a reason we call Tim the senpai of dirty jokes.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:56.000
Next to gamescom, where we were playing cool games the whole day, I had another week in summer, where I didn´t do anything else than playing games. Great vacation in Mallorca.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:11.840
40 degrees outside, and 4 people sitting INSIDE in the dark, playing Diablo 3. Why did Blizzard have to launch its first season during my vacation? Monk, magician, barb and archer didn´t see much sun during that week.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:37.260
I wish you all merry christmas and a happy new year!!
I personally wish for a quick release of Hotline Miami 2, a lot of spare time to play The Legend of Zelda for WiiU and a million subscribers!

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.380
What are your wishes and aims for the new year?
Share it in the comments and I see you in the next year in a new Kate Show!

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.580
*Look out behind you!!!

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.580
*told you so : )
