00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.549
You're watching the Sat Nav Warehouse YouTube
channel.

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:11.850
We're here giving a demo on the Snooper Truckmate
Pro Sound DB8500, their highest spec portable

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.180
GPS device for trucks and HGV's.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:21.070
What we're going to show you now is how you
set up your vehicle dimensions, so this is

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.890
the standard mapping screen when you switch
on.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.369
Press the centre of the screen and you're
into the main menu.

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.300
You've got your navigate to, my favourites
and configure.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.030
We're going to go into configure because that's
what we're going to do.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.930
The first option you are going to go for is
"Truck".

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.430
As you'll see here we've entered some vehicle
dimensions into the device already you can

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.210
actually call the profile whatever you like
because you can save multiple profiles on

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.210
the device.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.460
So if you carry a set number of trailer profiles
you can easily select between the relevant

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.460
vehicle types.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.630
If you look at height here we've got 14ft
set and if i just show you quickly you can

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.000
actually choose feet and inches or metres.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.670
Now you've got length, weight, width, weight
per axle and you can add that, say we've got

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.780
5 tonnes per axle.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.300
The truck type we've selected trailer here
but you can also select delivery or public

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.690
vehicle or truck at the top again.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.020
The load type is quite important because obviously
the type of load you are carrying will have

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.090
an effect on where you can and can't go.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.820
We're carrying some hazardous chemicals today
and have selected that particular option.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.351
The tunnel category is the category your vehicle
is permitted to travel through so we select

00:01:36.351 --> 00:01:39.380
this one here and press okay.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.630
That's stored in the memory.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.640
When it comes to navigating to your destination
you can find by city, postcode or via one

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.530
of the many thousand of points of interest
that are preloaded onto the Snooper.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.240
We're going to use the recent route for the
purposes of the demonstration.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.000
You'll see here that it just summarises the
profile that you have set up so if on this

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.460
particular day, you're not carrying hazardous
goods, you can say hang on, i'll just change

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.460
that.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.039
In you go, click on edit, change, load type.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.470
Nothing hazardous or out of the ordinary today,
click okay and then you're back.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.060
You can see that it's changed from hazardous
chemicals to normal.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.730
Click calculate and away you go.
