Add the 1 tablespoon of buttermilk to 1 cup of heavy cream. 

00:01:04.135 --> 00:01:06.738
Mix with a spoon.

00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:10.615
Cover with a plastic wrap. 

00:01:11.374 --> 00:01:21.922
Let the mixture sit on a warm place (kitchen counter, turned-off oven, etc.) 

00:01:21.922 --> 00:01:30.428
for around 12-24 hours until it thickens up and becomes creme fraiche! 

00:01:49.848 --> 00:01:52.420
You can put the creme fraiche in a jar and store 
 it in the fridge for up to 1 week.

00:01:52.423 --> 00:01:56.890
 Also, another tip, if you dont have buttermilk 
 you can just use plain yogurt.
