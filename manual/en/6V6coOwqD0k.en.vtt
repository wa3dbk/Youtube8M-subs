One more note right before we actually get
into the curriculum I promise, we're going

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:10.010
to get to it next time. Remember, everything
I'm showing you here is what I found works

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.370
the best with the students I've worked with
both in regular school settings and in one

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.869
on one tutoring. You can modify this as needed,
any part, don't feel like you have to teach

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.480
one part only and then the next part you can
stretch one part longer if you find the child

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
needs extra help with it. If there are other
little things you remember that you learned

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.260
in school that fit in between what I'm teaching,
by all means, add them. If you know of worksheets,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.430
if you know of text books that you want to
add, this is for you to modify as needed.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.740
You know what this child needs and the best
way that they work better than anybody else

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.910
does. If you want to work completely just
from a notebook and you don't want to make

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.829
all these extra worksheets and books, that's
fine too. Remember, you still have to do,

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.110
you have to write it out by hand every time
and you're not going to be photocopying as

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.610
much, but it might sound like more work in
one sense, but maybe its less work because

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.710
you don't have to photocopy or run to the
store. You do however you think it will work,

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.360
but these feature are just to give you a guide.
Now, remember, as you're working on your child's

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.159
curriculum, you can use your regular schools,
public schools, private schools to supplement

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.320
their education. If you feel that you can't
teach science, that they're going to get a

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.830
much better hands-on feel in a lab, send them
to the public school for the science courses.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.120
If you want them to take baseball, they can
take a sport or drama or something with a

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.421
regular public schools or private schools.
You pay the taxes for those public schools,

00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:48.420
whether you send a child or not, so its not
like you're doing anything that's putting

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.110
them out of the way. Make sure you check legally
if they give you a hard time, push and check

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.260
with all the representatives. I've never of
a case where it wasn't allowed. So, feel free

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.500
to design your child's curriculum as you see
is best for them.
