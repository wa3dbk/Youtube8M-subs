Hello

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.220
Pancake is one of the most famous western desserts that bring a sweet taste to our dinner table.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.040
Today I will prepare it my own way serving 4 people

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.480
with a special Arabian flavor, using Kashta, Honey, and Bananas

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.780
In an empty bowl, we mix 1 and ¼ cup and of flour

00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:39.818
1 tablespoon of white sugar

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.949
1 tablespoon baking powder

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:46.273
and  ¼ teaspoon of salt.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.020
Then, we pour them in Faciclic Glass blender (Tripl’AX) from Moulinex.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.040
We mix a cup of milk

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:06.884
2 tablespoons of vegetable oil

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.314
¼ cup of water

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.140
We add them to our dry mixture in the blender

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.760
mix them altogether to get a smooth and homogenous combination

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.660
We spread a little amount of butter in the pan

00:01:30.202 --> 00:01:32.202
and pour ¼ ladle of the mixture

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.300
We leave it for 2 minutes until it changes in color, and then we flip it to the other side

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.860
We repeat the same steps until the mixture is finished

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.480
Before turning the dough on the other side, make sure that the bubbles have disappeared completely from the top.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.180
And I prefer not to flip the dough more than once.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.600
We have added ready Kashta, slices of banana and strawberries, honey and powder sugar on the pancake.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.563
Bon appétit!
