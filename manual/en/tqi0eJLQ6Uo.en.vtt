Hello and welcome to freshly served healthy
vegan recipes. I’m Heather and a week after

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.130
Christmas I put together a whole bunch of
Christmas recipes for you. You could find

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.930
all of them including today’s at healthyveganrecipes.net/Christmas.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.660
Today what were gonna make is something pretty
special. It’s a recipe that I got from a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.370
very good friend that I worked with for sweet
potato biscuits! Sweet potatoes are one of

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.329
my all time favorite foods. Probably my all
time favorite vegetable. You can’t get any

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.640
better than sweet potatoes really. And making
them into biscuits – fantastic!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:59.120
I have really nothing better to say about
them than they are fantastic. So to start

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.970
with, what you have to do is to bake a sweet
potato. You can boil it if you like but boiling

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.790
does not bring out the same kind of flavor
as baking does. So if you have the time pop

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.409
it in the oven, poke some holes into the sweet
potato, turn up to 350F and give it a bake.

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.640
It takes about half hour depending on how
big your sweet potato.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.810
I’ve got mine baked right here and you can
see the sugars oozing out of that potato and

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:37.250
then if you break it open you can see that
it is nice and soft inside, that’s what

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.399
you’re looking for. And you only need 1
cup of sweet potato for this recipe so if

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:51.909
you have a big sweet potato like me you can
either make a double batch or use it for something

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:52.909
else.

00:01:52.909 --> 00:02:00.520
So put that sweet potato into a bowl with
all that goodness near the skin and then you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.240
are going to mashed it up. Use a four-four
potato masher. Alright, once you get that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.289
nicely mashed up you’re gonna add some melted
coconut oil.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.739
And what I do to melt mine is I put this in
a bowl on top of the toaster oven where I

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.500
am baking the sweet potato and it melts really
really nicely.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:32.459
Ok! So there are three tablespoons in here
and what you wanna do is put half of that

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.720
into the butter. The other half you use to
brush the tops of the biscuits so they get

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.620
nicely glazed.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.690
Ok! So stir that oil in and then you’re
gonna use some maple syrup or you can use

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.730
brown rice syrup. You can also use a granular
sugar but keep in mind the liquid ratio will

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:03.230
be off so you wanna add a little bit of water
to that sugar to make it liquid. Otherwise

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.140
the texture of the biscuits will be off. Ok.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:15.050
So stir the maple syrup in there, to just
add little bit of extra sweetness to your

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.750
potato biscuits. You could also use a little
bit of juice if you prefer, apple juice would

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.290
be nice. Or even apple sauce.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:35.940
Ok! Then the next thing we are going to add
is some baking powder and you want two teaspoons

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:42.629
so stir that in. Alright! Make sure you get
that baking powder mix in really nicely. You

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.670
can also stiff it with the flour if you prefer
and then you’re gonna add 1 cup of flour,

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.840
whole grain flour. I’m using Spelt today
but you can use whatever type you like.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:03.180
You’re also going to add a pinch of salt
and stir that through without over mixing.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:13.620
Ok? You wanna stir it in just so that it mixes
together and not go any further than that.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:21.299
If you mixed too much it will make your dough
hard and a really good way to mix the flour

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.510
in is to use your hands.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.490
I find the fork works really well as well
and what you’re looking to do is to really

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.339
press this together once you get to this kind
of consistency. Just press the flour into

00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:43.040
the dough rather than stirring. Ok? And this
should be the consistency that you’d wind

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.750
up with in the end.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:51.190
Now what we are going to do is form this into
biscuits, put it on the baking tray and put

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:57.390
it in the oven at 375F. It will only take
about ten minutes but you’re waiting till

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:58.740
it browns on the top.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.940
Put it on a parchment paper or coconut oil
rubbed on the cookie sheet, never hurts and

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.450
you can formed them into biscuits either by
rolling them out and cutting them or what

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:18.770
I like to do is take them and place them and
then the tops are more textured so they get

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:25.500
brown differently. You have little crispy
bits and softer bits and that is how I like

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.330
to do it.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.690
You can also take your left over melted coconut
oil, brush that on top and that would give

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:46.200
them just a nice glazed on top, a little bit
crispy and very flavorful.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:57.740
So you just take a, a little brush here and
dab some melted coconut oil on top to make

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.620
them beautiful, golden brown on top. So once
your oven preheats at 375F pop it in for ten

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.520
minutes or so just until they are golden brown.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.360
So here they are after the oven, you should
be able to press them and they should feel

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:19.969
a little bit firm, they smell wonderful. I
usually have a hard time sharing these with

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.480
other people but I do my best.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.530
A big thank you to Aiko my friend for this
recipe, you can find it online with all of

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.130
