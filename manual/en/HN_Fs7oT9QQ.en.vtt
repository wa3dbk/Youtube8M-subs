00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:16.039
Larsen Strings A/S

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.140
25 years with love and passion

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.150
It all starts and ends

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.089
within musicians and with the music.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.449
Curiosity often is much more important

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.600
than knowledge.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.620
I’m passionate about it.
It all began in a garage in 1990.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.449
When Laurits Th. Larsen had failed to fulfill a promise to send 300 cello strings

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:45.610
to an American friend,

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.909
he decided to try to make some himself.

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.250
After 18 months of experiment on an old winding machine

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.220
guided by his ears of violinist and tested by his cello colleagues in the

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.010
South Denmark Philharmonic,

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.190
he succeeded in making a cello A string

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.149
with a great and different sound.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.030
Larsen Strings was born.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.000
Shortly after, a world famous cellist, David Geringas, performed with the orchestra.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.560
When his A string suddenly snapped, Larsen got a chance to introduce his new string.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.590
He turned around and said “Mr. Larsen”,

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.759
Yes, “Would you have a string for me?”

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.760
I said, well, if the conductor would let me leave,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.799
because this was general rehearsal,

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.270
I will be happy to take my bicycle, go back home to my garage and make you one.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.490
And I was excused for about 45 minutes or an hour and I came back

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.090
with two more strings.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.100
Mr. Geringas put it on and said:

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.330
“I like this string” and he has played it ever since.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.920
From there, rumors of this new and brilliant cello string

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.460
spread to musicians all over the world.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.650
Because of this and because they preferred this new sound,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.070
people found me.
During the nineties Laurits Larsen

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.420
worked hard to develop and expand Larsen Strings,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.580
and soon a production site was rented,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.040
modern machinery installed and staff hired and trained.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.170
The turn of the millennium took Larsen Strings to new heights.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.440
Scientific methods were introduced in order to refine the sound

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.620
and the most advanced production methods were established

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.130
to ensure a consistent level of string quality

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.020
and to meet the increasing demand for Larsen Strings.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.860
This development goes on and new quality strings

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.800
keep joining the family of products from Larsen Strings.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.500
Being a musician himself, Laurits Th. Larsen

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.410
is obsessed with sound. So in order to enhance the musical experience

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.080
of not only the listener but also of the musician,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.140
the strings are constantly tested by the best musicians

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.260
in the world.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.500
Music first, music last.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.660
Music is global and so are we.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.730
In the end,

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.380
it did work out.
