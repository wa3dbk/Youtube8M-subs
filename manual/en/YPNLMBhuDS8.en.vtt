Hi, my name is Mike Summers with Jim The Shoe
Doctor in Eugene, Oregon, and today we're

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.780
going to be talking about cleaning and protecting
tennis shoes. This shoe is a brand new shoe,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.850
and before you wore this shoe, you would want
to treat this with a water and stain protector.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.550
It keeps the shoe whiter for a much longer
time, helps the cleanup much easier once it

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.660
has gotten dirty. So if you do not do that,
what you end up with is shoes that end up

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.170
looking like this, really dingy, really dirty.
A shoe like this is pretty hard to clean.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.720
There's a number of different polish materials
that you can use. This is a patent leather

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:53.210
cleaner, a Pattina cleaner, and it's a solvent
based product, and this is a pretty harsh

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.969
product, so this will, you have to be kind
of careful with it because it can remove finish,

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:08.100
but you can see the different that that makes.
That takes that real dingy, dirty, down to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:19.369
pretty clean. You would want to treat the
cloth portion of this shoe with a product

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:27.990
that is also made for suede, and this works
on satin shoes also, any of the nylons, silks,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.119
that sort of thing. And this, you would actually
have to get the entire shoe completely wet.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.770
You would apply the cleaner and you actually
scrub that in. There's a number of spray on

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.270
cleaners that you can use, but pretty much
you have to get the entire shoe wet when you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.179
do this and then you have to rinse all that
back out because you don't want the soap-based

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.200
material to stay in there. Once you've gotten
that cleaned off you can use a white polish

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:15.629
or a white refinish. We've got one that's
open here.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:24.500
Just doing a small portion here,
and you can work this into the stitching and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.680
stuff and make that white also. And with this,
what you'd do is you'd let that dry for a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.540
little while and then you'd rebuff it just
as it's drying so that it doesn't leave any

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.870
streaking. It's very important with white
polish to do that last little step on the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:48.159
process, otherwise you will end up with lines
and it will streak. So white polish is one

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.480
of the most difficult polishes to deal with.
And that's how you would clean and protect

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.920
a tennis shoe.
