00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:12.430
this is what it looks like you know is
what it looks like with the group

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:18.430
sexy actually have messages and people I
know here

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:42.860
maternity shirt off all these old age
and then show you what this is the issue

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.690
of seeing this message again every time
I card it used to be that when you when

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.550
you highlighted text you get the entire
thing but you can just click the button

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:10.830
then just place just look into their
eyes are very different for different

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.710
people just one as well as a as a
certain type of luxury goods here

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.340
icons are totally different we switch to
an hour before you I

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.679
favor of my favorite meal it's gonna be
alright but like someone else might be

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:40.020
different UI and this is the same device
but it's totally different things she

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.270
looks really awesome especially with so
we don't have the personnel have the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.840
color or I assume some of these some of
these just look a lot better example the

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:59.710
paint before I yeah looks weird when you
know thanks / yet

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:11.790
different colors different backgrounds

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:25.030
this is the other day for you I

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.790
it's a pretty pretty stark typically
what people do with the easiest things

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.319
to make the font bigger but what we did
is actually change the layout so you can

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:46.550
notice the size of screen sizes text to
find bigger a lot of fun to just

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.590
overflows yeah you know we made these
bubbles wider today it's more of the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.690
message we changed things like you know
this timer actually larger change change

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.989
the text here and this applies to every
every system at it also works in third

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:16.340
party apps but obviously there are
certainly have likely out for the change

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:44.700
in texture as we reflect on the entire
text content of the UN

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:56.990
travel

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:12.140
save you a lot of time to do it before
we call back and try to get to that

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.530
option

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.200
so you going to sit this one actually we
just call during the numbers ourselves

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.560
recorded it ourselves

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.840
only Hindi I know is from this feature
so I can just like say for Hindi press

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.500
one that's pretty it pretty much
