00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:04.649
Hello.

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.809
I am Lindsay Knapp and I am the practice administrator
here at Utah Surgical Arts.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.549
our team is honored to be working with you
to obtain the oral surgery results that you

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:13.650
desire.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.090
To ensure optimal comfort and recovery after
your surgery, please follow these simple postoperative

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.990
instructions.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.679
This video will cover important information
regarding proper postsurgical care for wisdom

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:27.220
teeth extraction.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.009
If you can scheduled to have your wisdom teeth
removed, it will be important to follow these

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.460
instructions exactly as we present them.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.460
• Discomfort is normal after extraction
of wisdom teeth.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.730
If you are not allergic or intolerant to non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, start taking ibuprofen

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.640
(also known as Advil or Motrin) as instructed
by your doctor at the time of your surgery.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.990
If your pain is not controlled by the ibuprofen
alone, take your prescribed narcotic in addition.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.940
Ibuprofen and your prescribed narcotic can
be taken together.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.840
• Be certain to take your pain medications
with food.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.590
This will help prevent nausea.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.590
• Remember, narcotic pain medicine will
impair your judgment and reflexes.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.070
• Gauze ads should be placed directly over
the extraction sites and held in place with

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.100
firm biting pressure.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.400
Proper placement will help you not swallow
blood, which can make you nauseated.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.640
Replace the gauze pads every twenty to forty
minutes.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.550
When they gauze pads have little to no blood
on them, they are no longer necessary.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.600
The amount of bleeding will vary from person
to person.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.130
Most of your bleeding will flow within three
to four hours, but a small amount of bleeding

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.979
is common for after twenty four hours.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.670
• Do not rinse on the day of surgery.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.520
It may prolong your bleeding.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.340
Begin saltwater rinses the day after surgery
and continue for one week.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.360
Rinse with warm saltwater three to four times
each day.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.440
To make saltwater solution, dissolve half
teaspoon of salt in a small glass of warm

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.140
tap water.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.580
• If you have been given an irrigating syringe,
start irrigation one week following surgery.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.330
Fill the syringe with warm saltwater and place
the tip of the syringe into the extraction

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.569
site to clean.

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.260
Do this three to four times a day for two
weeks and lessen as the surgical site heals.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.620
Swelling is normal after surgery and is a
major cause of post extraction discomfort.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.450
Swelling typically peaks by the third day
and then starts to resolve.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.129
It can be reduced by the use of an ice pack.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.909
Apply the ice pack to the side of your face
for fifteen minutes.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.879
Transfer it to the opposite side for another
fifteen minutes.

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.749
Continue taking the face for the first twenty
four hours.

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:39.580
Do not freeze the skin.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.840
Ice packs are useful for the first twenty
four hours only.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.609
Also, keep your head elevated onto pillows
for two to three days.

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.169
These measures will not eliminate swelling,
but they help to reduce its severity.

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:56.279
• To help with medication tolerance, we
recommend that you eat right away after your

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.279
surgery.

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:02.120
Start with clear liquids such as broth gradually
ramp up your diet as tolerated.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.430
Always cool down any hot foods or liquids
during the first twenty four hours.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.060
If you were sedated for surgery, do not eat
fatty, creamy, or oily foods.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.760
These foods may cause nausea.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.030
You should eat only city only soft foods for
the first two to three days.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.939
For example, soup, eggs, mashed potatoes,
and meatloaf are fine.

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:26.080
• To help prevent dry socket, do not use
a straw for the first week after surgery.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.650
Begin brushing your teeth the day after surgery.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.829
It is important to brush all of your teeth,
ven if the teeth and gums are sensitive.

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.099
Bacterial plaque and food accumulation near
the extraction site will delay healing.

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.480
• Do not smoke for at least a week.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.120
Smoking will increase your bleeding.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.709
The nicotine and tar in tobacco impairs healing
and may cause a dry socket.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.109
• Unless told otherwise, do no vigorous
physical activity for three days following

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.560
your surgery.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.209
Physical activity increases your blood pressure
which will cause an increase in your swelling,

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.859
pain, and bleeding.

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.699
You gradually increase your activity after
jogging or tennis, five to seven days after

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:06.310
your surgery.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.529

call our office.

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:14.019

can to make your postoperative recovery successful.
