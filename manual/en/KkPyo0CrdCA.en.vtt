Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now I want
to decorate this empty space on the board.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:21.310
What I'm going to do is take, I cut a flower
from our poster board. I take the thin and

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:55.190
sharp scissors and cut it around the flower
to make it more appear. We have thin and sharp

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:06.780
scissors it is easier even though it does
not go right according to the flowers it stills

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:22.990
looks nice.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:32.810
Now I'm going to put it here and take the
decorative string and I'm going to make a

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:53.399
little knot over here. I think I'm going to
glue it like that. So first I'm going to glue

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:12.300
the string to the board, just a little bit
so it would not look too loose and then I'm

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:25.450
going to glue the flower to the string. Here
is our pencil holder and a note pad holder.
