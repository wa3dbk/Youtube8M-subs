00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.920
The first time you set up your printer, you'll need to install the printheads and the ink

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:12.639
cartridges. When you run low on ink, you'll need to replace the ink cartridges. This video

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:20.410
shows you how to perform these actions. First, we'll install the ink cartridges.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.689
Press the power button to turn the printer on.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:41.270
Next, open the ink cartridge cover. Remove each new ink cartridge from its package.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.310
Push each cartridge into its slot. Do not force the cartridges into the slots. Each

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.770
cartridge is designed for its assigned slot only. If the cartridge does not snap into

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.470
place, check to make sure that the color coding on the cartridge matches that on the printer.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.420
If it does not, find the right color-coded slot.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.930
When all the cartridges have been installed, close the ink cartridge cover.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:17.620
The printer has both ink cartridges and printheads. The ink cartridges store the ink, and the

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.600
printheads fire drops of ink onto the paper to create your prints. You'll have to replace

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.940
the ink cartridges regularly, but the printheads should not have to be replaced very often.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.330
Open the top cover to access the printheads. The carriage should automatically move all

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.950
the way to the left. If it does not, press and hold the resume

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.350
button on the printer control panel until the carriage moves all the way to the left.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.390
Be careful not to proceed until the carriage is on the left side of the printer. If the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.549
carriage does not automatically move to the left, turn the printer off and back on again,

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.710
and then try holding down the resume button again. The printhead can be damaged if the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.189
carriage is not all the way to the left for installation.

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:17.430
Lift the blue printhead latch. While the new printheads are still in their

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.389
packages, shake them six times. Shaking the printheads helps prevent print quality problems

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:30.510
later. Remove the new printheads from their packages.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.930
Then remove the orange protective caps. Be careful not to shake the printheads after

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:44.689
the caps have been removed. Insert each printhead into its color-coded

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.439
slot. Lower the printhead latch and snap it into

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:56.209
place. Close the top cover.

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.519
After replacing the printhead, the printer will calibrate and then print out an alignment

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:09.290
sheet. Once the alignment pages prints, you can begin using your printer.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.129
Replacing the ink cartridges is almost as easy as the first time you installed them.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:21.959
Press the power button to turn the printer on.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.700
Open the ink cartridge cover. And remove the old ink cartridge from it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:42.650
slot. Remove the new ink cartridge from it's packaging.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.989
Push the new ink cartridge into its color-coded slot.

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.989
Then close the ink cartridge cover. Replacing the printheads is similar to the

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:02.159
way you initially installed them. Open the top cover to access the printheads.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.959
To access the printheads you must press and hold the resume button on the printer control

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.319
panel until the carriage moves all the way to the left. Be careful not to proceed until

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.769
the carriage is on the left side of the printer. If the carriage does not automatically move

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:26.769
to the left , turn the printer off and back on again, and then try holding down the resume

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.530
button again. The printhead can be damaged if the carriage is not all the way to the

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.490
left for installation. Lift the blue printhead latch.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.150
On the printhead that needs to be replaced, lift the blue handle. Then use the handle

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.590
to pull the printhead straight up and remove it from the printer.

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.180
While the replacement printhead is still in its package, shake it six times. Shaking the

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.180
printhead helps prevent print quality problems later.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.930
Remove the new printheads from their packages. Then remove the orange protective caps. Be

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:15.080
careful not to shake the printheads after the caps have been removed.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:22.030
Insert the printhead into its color-coded slot.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.770
Lower the printhead latch and snap it into place.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.229
Then close the top cover of the printer. After replacing the printhead, the printer

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.930
will calibrate and then print out an alignment sheet. Once the alignment page prints, you

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.110
can begin using your printer. Your printer is now ready for regular use.
