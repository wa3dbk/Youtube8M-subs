00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.490
I'm Amelia Smith and on behalf of Expert Village,
I'm going to talk to you about how to do the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.440
perfect blowout. So we just finished the back
and basically what I did was took down every

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.249
layer and blew it with the large brush. Now
we're going to move onto the sides and I'm

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.340
going to use the same brush and I'm going
to be lifting and pulling out so it comes

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.060
more around her face. She does have layering
on her sides as well so I'm going to go through

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:41.390
each layer. So I'm going to life up this shorter
layer and pin it up

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:48.260
and smooth this out. Once I smooth this out
you'll see how it goes in so much better with

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.530
the back. And you can see the shine that the
back has already just from using the brush

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.210
and directing the dryer downward. So we're
going to use the large brush and I'm not going

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.000
to worry about making this section smaller
because you're wanting to lift it up and then

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.100
bring it down. And it's ok if some of the
back gets in there too. What you don't want

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.550
is any of this getting all in there or else
you're going to end up with a mess. I'm actually

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:30.240
going to turn it on low. And her hair for
the most part is dry so really I'm only smoothing

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.560
with the heat of blow dryer. And then I'm
occasionally hitting the cold shot button

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:52.049
which we'll get into later. And again you
see how I'm just directing everything down

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:04.851
and around her face. So I'm going to take
down a second section and work on that. You

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:13.180
see how I've got that nice body there? So
same here. I'm just going to use the round

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:25.020
brush, put the dryer on low, bring it up and
then down. The more you overdirect that brush,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.630
the more volume you're going to get, so depending
on the angle you choose. If you go really

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.370
far this way, you're going to get more volume
than if you just come down straight. I'm not

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:47.350
looking for a whole lot of volume out of Lauren's
hair, so I'm really just coming down at a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:56.140
45 degree angle. And as I'm pulling this hair
up, it's ok if some of this bottom layer gets

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:07.790
pulled up into that. And again I am just angling
the brush towards her face, and just bringing

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:15.410
it down and around. Now you see how that side
is nice and smooth compared to the other side.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.300
So I'm going to go finish up the other side
and I'll meet you back here and we'll talk

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.870
about the top.
