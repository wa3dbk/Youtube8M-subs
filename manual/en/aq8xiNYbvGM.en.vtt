00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.840
Hawker Centres, which are open air food stall
complexes, serve up a variety of inexpensive

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840
food.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.900
From Chinese to Indian and Malaysian to Indonesian
there is a diverse selection of cuisine to

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.980
choose from.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.210
We're having our first lunch here in Singapore
at a Hawker Center and I've ordered myself

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.720
some Chinese food.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:30.999
I have some Hainanese chicken rice, which
looks absolutely delicious and I've got a

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:36.379
butter chicken with butter naan right down
here.

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.690
Here is my dish - it is just a bit of plain
rice and some chicken with crispy skin on

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.980
the outside.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.800
Despite it looking a bit bland it is actually
quite tasty.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:59.749
It is hard not to enjoy butter chicken - this
is awesome.

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:06.370
We've got a few more snacks to complete the
meal.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.370
What are they?

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.370
This is a combination of satay and dim sum,
so we have sweet potato here and this one

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.370
is yam.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.390
We've got tofu cubes over here.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.510
This one is prawn and I believe that is a
shrimp dumpling.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.830
I'm going for something a little sweet here.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
I have some kind of yam spring roll.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.310
Should I dip it in peanut sauce?

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.330
Nah, just have it.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.590
Is it sweet?

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.090
It is.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.720
It tastes like sweet potato except that it
is white.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:54.384
This crab didn't go on a skewer and it will
taste good in the peanut sauce I'm pretty

00:01:54.384 --> 00:01:55.384
sure.

00:01:55.384 --> 00:01:56.384
We'll mix that bad boy around.

00:01:56.384 --> 00:01:57.384
What is happening over there?

00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:58.384
Kind of chewy?

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.320
Here is the crab!

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.560
Nice claw.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.040
Oh, that is delicious.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.140
It is so juicy inside.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.440
As budget travelers these Hawker centres in
Singapore are a real find.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.320
Because it is really expensive in Singapore
- it is one of the most expensive cities in

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.780
all of Asia - certainly in Southeast Asia.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.880
You can find dishes here for between four
to ten Singaporean dollars and it is so much

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.200
cheaper than eating in a restaurant.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.650
I like the variety that you can find at the
Hawker centers.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.590
For example, today we had some Indian food,
Chinese food and we also saw stands selling

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.390
Malaysian food, Singaporean dishes and lots
of other things.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.750
This Hawker center is by the Singapore Flyer
but you can find them all throughout the city.
