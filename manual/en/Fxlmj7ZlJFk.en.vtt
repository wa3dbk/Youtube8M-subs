Hi! Im Jeff yeager the ultimate cheapskate
and host of the cheap life!

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:15.690
Giblets,  you know what i'm talking about
those little baggy's of goodies

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.330
the heart, liver, gizerd, neck and such that come
packaged inside whole turkeys and chickens

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.289
kind of like the prize inside a box a
cracker jack's.  Whatever you do don't

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.409
throw those away! LJ: "Cheapskate alert!

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.129
Theres a chance to win a fifty dollar gift card at the end of

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:36.220
this video". Every year at thanksgiving alone
American's buy within forty five million

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.790
turkeys containing the baggage of giblets and
most people just toss them in the trash.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.910
Even though they are perfectly edible and in fact pretty darn tasty. By my

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.570
calculations that needs were throwing
away more than thirty million dollars

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.790
worth of food or enough calories to feed

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.650
fifty five thousand people for an entire
year

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.120
provided of course you could find fifty
five thousand people willing to eat

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.960
nothing but giblets for twelve months. So
try this, simmer your giblets in water

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.850
for about thirty minutes or at least
until they're fully cooked. Then take the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.990
meat off the mack and cut off any tough
parts from the rest of the innerds once

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.730
that's done just chop it all up and add it to
your turkey stuffing or gravy.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.100
or better yet yet try my favorite recipe

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.750
Giblet pate. Just mix the cooked meat in the
food processor with a little chopped

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.590
onion some charrie

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.079
and butter. Blend it till its smooth adding more butter as needed. Pate

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.630
that's french for good stuff you eat on a cracker.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.340
So. remember S..T..G..

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.910
save the Giblets

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.229
