00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.830
T

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.990
when primes Bishop Ron Gibson

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.120
on the zip code the Macomb

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.920
Prime is TV hatin

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.979
and when chaim my name is Jay haze of

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.610
my name is Nolan job

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.820
this

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.840
as I watched it

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.369
I i was just mystified by the things
that were said

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.729
people talk about how God came to them
and told them to do certain things

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.330
when one of the pre pastors who has a
kid and he's counseling him he says

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.899
listen

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:05.840
I think God is using your life really
well

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.060
I when one of the kids who want to be a
singer

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.470
asks is pastor dad whether he could be
whether he has a chance

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.880
at being a successful worship singer the
dad says

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.130
chance has nothing to do with it it's
all how God wants to use you

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.209
they're wearing the white suits the
expensive cars

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.870
there's one scene where I guess one of
the members have corn Luis the guy who

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.870
goes by the name

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.480
head is like a big Christian and he
hangs out with one of these pastors and

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.310
they talk about

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.950
being tattooed but being Christian I

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.010
it's amazing to me they seem almost is
that

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.440
even in casual conversation but the most
amazing thing about me Lewis

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.079
was that these are clearly very smart
individuals

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:55.049
excellent speakers I mean oratory skills
that really are to be envied

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.750
the amount of good that they could be
doing weed with those skills

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.920
instead of just getting people to cry
and

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.390
paint and put their hands up and scream
hola Louis and give them tons of money

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.160
by the way

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.660
the amount of good these guys could be
some of the best teachers in the world

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.690
this is the level that they are on in
terms of speaking skills &amp;

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.140
and skills of persuasion but instead I
mean

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.150
they're making a ton of money maybe
that's why the did they do it they're

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.200
doing this instead

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.260
maybe they think they are doing now a
world of good maybe I think

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.780
I think they are truly helping people
and I'm sure there are some people

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.060
but they help even though I those people
maybe

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.350
deluded as a result about how well it
can be a powerful thing and I'm sure

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.390
they do help people

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.590
are watching the trailer this show
really made it seem like

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.400
arm like it was a non-biased your these
guys maybe even trying to you

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.870
expose you know at bear lies exposed and
and and show what happens behind the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.959
scenes and kinda

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.140
make them look a little more more human
and

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.800
and I and it does look pretty
interesting yet from the episode I saw

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.150
it wasn't really

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.900
issuing any kind of critique you had the
kind of on your own

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.540
decide to critique it because it was its
its crude done in this way is very

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.440
flashy and income sensationalist I
