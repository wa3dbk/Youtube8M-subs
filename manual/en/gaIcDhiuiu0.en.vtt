Before starting a white water rafting trip
you should always assume that your guests

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.410
or crew knows nothing, and you should share
as much information as with them as possible

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.419
before you get going. Guys, you need to make
sure that your helmet is on nice and snug,

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.480
a finger or two under here is great, much
more than that and it’ll just come off your

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.410
head as you go over backwards into the river.
Your PFD stands for personal floatation device,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.490
make sure its on nice and snug, so you’ll
able to self rescue properly, if its on loose

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.140
it just floats up over your face and its hard
for us to see who you are and whether or not

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.159
we want you back in the boat. Its also hard
for you guys to see where we are and what

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.890
direction you’re supposed to swim in. Your
paddle is uh, probably the most important

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.730
part of your gear; this determines whether
or not you’re able to keep yourselves in

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.030
the boat. Put your thumb under here, this
hand over here, this hand all the way down

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.890
here, for nice strong forward strokes and
nice strong backstrokes and you guys will

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.039
be able to help the raft guide get the raft
where it needs to be going and keep yourselves

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.309
balanced in the boat. You can see where the
raft is an oval shape, with an outside perimeter

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.210
too, sit on the outside tube, you tuck your
feet under the tube in front of you, both

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.379
feet inside the raft, that way, you’re supported
with your feet in the bottom and your paddle,

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.590
every time you take a forward stroke you’re
pushing the raft where it needs to go and

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.510
keeping yourselves balanced in the boat. Every
time you lift your paddle up and scream you

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.630
have a tendency to fall into the raft or out
of the raft. If you fall into the raft, since

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.221
it has an inflated floor you don’t have
to worry too much about it, just climb onto

00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:18.230
the outside tube again and continue on down
the stream. If you fall out of the raft today,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.790
a few things you need to remember, you lay
on your back, you point your feet downstream,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.390
which is the direction the river is going
and you look for help. And then, you guys

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.280
as a crew are going to help each other. If
someone is floating by you, you grab them

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.720
by the PFD, you look them in their face, shout
out I’m going to save you, you fall over

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.210
backward and they land on top of you. You
guys can high-five, exchange phone numbers

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.150
and then continue on downstream. It’s pretty
easy, if they’re slightly out of reach,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.540
it’s the only time you can let go of the
T-grip, you offer them the T-grip, you pull

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.320
them toward the raft, then grab them and pull
them in. You as the swimmer, your responsibility

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.250
is to lie on your back, feet downstream and
look for help. You guys cannot stand up, if

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.180
you stand up in the river, you can and you
probably will at some point get a foot entrapment.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.830
It’s where your foot or feet get caught
in the riverbed, the water piles up on your

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.790
bottom, back, and head and pushes you head
first in the river and you stay there. You

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.780
day goes from being kinda fun and goofy with
your rafting guests to being tragic or at

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.760
least complicated, it’s hard for us to help
you out if you get foot entrapment. So on

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.620
your back, feet downstream, looking for help,
you may be asked to swim back to the raft,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.340
so turn on your front and swim aggressively
back to the raft. The guys carry a bag with

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.610
about sixty feet of rope in it, its called
a throw rope, if you’re out of the boat,

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.640
we may toss you the rope, put the rope over
your shoulder and we’ll pull you back to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.310
the raft and you guys can continue on downstream.
Uh, if the whistle blows we’d like you to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.880
stop, figure out what’s going on, we’ll
deal with that situation and then we’ll

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.931
move on downstream once we’ve taken care
of it. Also I mentioned high sides, and it

00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:46.341
won’t happen today, high sides is where
a raft hits a rock and either sides up on

00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:51.250
top of the rock or sticks there. You can avoid
that by listening to your guide and paddling,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.450
if you hit the rock anyway, the guide shouts
out “high side”, if you climb toward the

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.530
high side of the rock, the high side of the
raft, then the weight will come off the low

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.740
side and you can spin off that rock, celebrate
a close call, and continue on downstream.
