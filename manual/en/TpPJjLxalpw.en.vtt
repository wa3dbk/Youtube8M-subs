00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:22.360
Well, it’s finally happened.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.220
After 27 years of exhibiting a degree of consumerism
so rampant, he’d literally spend his entire

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.460
savings as soon as he earned 100 coins...the
Mushroom Kingdom’s potbellied paragon of

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.960
platforming has finally learned a lesson about
financial responsibility.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:45.940
A coin saved is freaking 20,000 earned in
New Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Nintendo 3DS.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:54.749
Evidently, the Mushroom Kingdom has discovered
capitalism.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:06.689
Released to the 3DS just a few weeks ago,
New Super Mario Bros. 2 is—addition be damned—the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.609
third New Super Mario Bros. release, following
up 2009’s New Super Mario Bros. Wii and

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.200
the original DS release from 2006.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.009
Frankly, to say there’s much difference
between them would be untrue—they’re all

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.270
built from the same timeless gameplay.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.390
But in a relative sense, this one does feel
distinct among the three.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.700
In fact, it might be one of the most distinct
2D Mario games ever.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.400
Now, why is that?

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.130
Well, it has less to do with the gameplay
than how players are encouraged to approach

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.130
it.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.229
New Super Mario Bros. 2 is the same kind of
creative, precise platformer you’re expecting...but

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.119
you might find yourself playing it a little
differently than you played Mario’s prior

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.119
games.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.680
Slower, maybe more deliberate...certainly
greedier.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:04.139
And that’s because New Super Mario Bros.
2 is all about the coins.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:09.360
And yes, they’ve always played a huge role
in Super Mario games...but never to this degree.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.610
The game is really designed for maximum looting.

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.530
You can collect hundreds and hundreds, even
thousands of coins in a single level.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.810
And the game makes sure your total is always
prominently displayed on the map.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:39.400
What this does is change the traditional left-to-right
focus of the gameplay.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.120
Mario is concerned not only with reaching
the flagpole, as usual...but with filling

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.440
his wallet, as well.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.840
Old strategies you’ve relied on for decades
get tweaked a little when you see a string

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.350
of precious coins just out of reach.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.439
Mario basically becomes Golem.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:55.680
Only fatter.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.720
And with a mustache.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.410
To go along with his newfound greed, Mario
naturally finds some new flora to suit the

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.410
occasion.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.189
The shiny Coin Flower turns Mario into Midas—everything
he touches turns into shimmering gold.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.850
So in the same way Super Mario World fundamentally
changed things by giving Mario a dinosaur

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.770
to ride, New Super Mario Bros. 2 also adds
an interesting new element to that time-honored,

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.190
razor-sharp platforming.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:35.150
But of course, the primary difference is that...while
coin hunting is built into the design, it’s

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.730
not to the extent that Yoshi was.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.569
And that’s where the game falters a little.

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.861
It has this interesting focus on coins, it
even brings back the Raccoon Leaf...but the

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.140
design never really exploits those concepts
as much as it could.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.900
I really think these things could’ve been
taken further, but like New Super Mario Bros.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.890
Wii, this one also plays it safe.

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.180
But you know, when the game is this good,
it’s tough to complain.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.060
New Super Mario Bros. 2 isn’t the technical
showpiece or platforming-defining release

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.580
Super Mario 3D Land was, but it doesn’t
need to be.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.230
It’s incredible how sharp it controls, how
fun its levels are...how 30 years later, Mario

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.060
is still the platforming champion.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:29.450
Only this time, he’s not afraid to wear

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.820
the gold.
