00:00:06.389 --> 00:00:07.769
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:10.671
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:26.711
First, let’s make the half boiled eggs.

00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:29.664
Reduce the heat to low 

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:34.699
and carefully place 2 eggs into a pot of boiling water.

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.100
During the first 2 minutes, 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.071
gently rotate the eggs to help the yolks to stay in the center.

00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:53.324
Boil the eggs for a total of five and a half minutes.

00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:58.760
Now, place the eggs into a bowl of ice water.

00:01:00.311 --> 00:01:03.029
Remove the shells in the water.

00:01:04.728 --> 00:01:09.447
The eggs are soft and delicate so be careful not to break them.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.367
Look at that!

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:16.621
The soft-boiled eggs have a jello-like texture!

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.301
And now, let’s make the scotch eggs.

00:01:21.001 --> 00:01:24.285
Add the bread crumbs to the beaten egg 

00:01:26.288 --> 00:01:28.522
and stir to moisten.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.007
For the batter, 

00:01:33.007 --> 00:01:37.259
combine another beaten egg and the flour in a bowl.

00:01:37.406 --> 00:01:39.425
Stir to mix.

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.329
Add a small amount of water 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.033
until the batter has the desired consistency like shown.

00:01:51.032 --> 00:01:56.036
Now, place the mixture of ground beef and pork in a bowl 

00:01:56.036 --> 00:01:58.367
and sprinkle on the salt 

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.151
and the coarsely ground black pepper.

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:07.391
Add the Japanese Worcester sauce or regular Worcester sauce 

00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:09.892
and the tomato ketchup.

00:02:12.396 --> 00:02:15.806
Combine all the ingredients with your hand.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:20.999
Make sure to thoroughly mix the meat 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.384
until it becomes kind of gooey.

00:02:26.235 --> 00:02:29.986
Then, add the egg-moistened bread crumbs 

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:32.721
and the chopped cabbage leaves.

00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:38.441
Combine the ingredients again.

00:02:46.335 --> 00:02:50.392
Now, take half of the meat in your hand.

00:02:50.392 --> 00:02:55.376
And toss it from one hand to the other to remove the air inside.

00:02:56.977 --> 00:02:59.494
Then, flatten the meat.

00:03:03.846 --> 00:03:06.795
Dust the boiled egg with flour 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.083
and wrap the egg with the meat.  

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.563
Make the thickness of the meat even 

00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:18.653
and shape the scotch egg into a ball.

00:03:27.224 --> 00:03:30.726
Now, coat the meat with the batter.

00:03:39.784 --> 00:03:43.181
Then, coat it with the bread crumbs.

00:03:51.002 --> 00:03:56.005
Repeat the procedure and you’ll have 2 large scotch eggs.

00:03:58.288 --> 00:04:01.774
And now, let’s deep-fry the scotch eggs.

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:08.242
Heat the oil to 170°C (338°F) in a pot.

00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:15.047
Adjust the shape and place each scotch egg into the oil.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:20.133
Don’t touch them until the batter firms up 

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:23.592
otherwise the outer layer will break apart.

00:04:25.025 --> 00:04:27.157
Then, with kitchen chopsticks, 

00:04:27.157 --> 00:04:31.459
gently rotate the pieces to brown evenly.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.648
Deep-fry for about 5 and a half minutes until golden brown.

00:04:47.818 --> 00:04:50.420
Now, they are ready.

00:04:50.986 --> 00:04:54.537
Remove and drain the excess oil.

00:05:02.198 --> 00:05:07.094
Then, place the scotch egg onto a plate along with the salad.

00:05:07.563 --> 00:05:09.730
Enjoy the dish with mustard 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.544
or you can add your favorite sauce to taste.

00:05:13.544 --> 00:05:17.402
Scotch eggs are an English dish and authentic recipes 

00:05:17.402 --> 00:05:21.288
use a hard boiled egg and sausage meat.

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:26.000
This version is inspired by a Japanese dish called Menchikatsu, 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.591
a breaded and deep-fried ground meat.

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.790
In this recipe, the meat is well seasoned 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.591
so you should be able to enjoy it with only mustard.

00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:44.341
Good luck in the kitchen!
