00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.590
there's a model who is accused of
stabbing her boyfriend

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.649
and she is now claiming he walked into
the night

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.019
multiple times you you often hear louis
there's this kind of stereo typical

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.219
I at deception where you see

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:18.570
in movies in popular culture and
sometimes in real life

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.910
a kid with bruises or typically a

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.939
a wife with bruises and it abundantly
clear that it's because

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.210
a parent or spouse has been hitting them
and when you ask them what happened they

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.740
say

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.980
I walked into a door I up

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.670
fell down the stairs completely on you
just completely on my own

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.100
and there's this kind of understanding
that okay you just don't want to say

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.890
that your dad punched you

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.160
or your husband pushed you into the wall
and this is exactly the argument that is

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.170
being made by the model that is accused
of stabbing her boyfriend

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.559
this is a Florida model named should ace
Scott

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.059
he's accused of stabbing her boyfriend
after they fought about his dog

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.340
eating her marijuana speaking of
legalization

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.330
the boyfriend Keith Wiggins claims that
should a Scott repeatedly stabbed him

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.750
during a fight that started when his dog

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.159
consumed her stash of marijuana

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.790
and at that point she was in the process
of kicking him out at the apartment

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.460
we can said he couldn't find his
computer and at that point he alleges

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.650
that she stabbed him

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.110
so when when should a Scott was talking
to police

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.009
she had a different story she says the
couple was arguing about dinner plans

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:34.509
it became physical when she tried to
leave the apartment

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.650
and that at that point heat walked into
the night she was holding

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.950
multiple times and cut himself the judge
set her bond

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.950
3500 bucks says she can't possess and I
forget within 500 feet of her boyfriend

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.570
we don't know what happened to the to
the dog according to the pet poison

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.259
hotline

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.720
marijuana intoxication in dogs can lead
to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.369
severe depression and walking drunk
although it is not considered to be

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:01.040
fatal

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.890
you know this story sounds completely
absurd Louis

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.970
but based on the fact that it is Florida
and based on the crime stories we see at

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.709
a Florida

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.160
it's not completely impossible that the
guy walked into a knife

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.450
multiple times but it doesn't seem very
likely right we have to be

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.190
realistic that is we have to use some
rationale yeah

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.190
what are those chances incredibly slim

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.300
I actually blame the dog for the entire
thing well

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.760
I you could you certainly could I don't
think Peter would agree

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.120
right right of course you can certainly
make that accusation it sounds like the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.810
weirdest night if the dog's life

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.980
where that the dog is a has consumed

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.519
one of his owners marijuana stasis

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.769
and then sees his other owner repeatedly
walk into a night

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.680
the dog probably such thought it was
seeing things ok

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.230
yeah it was if it was thinking anything
at all I was probably just that hiding

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.530
somewhere for all the commotion
