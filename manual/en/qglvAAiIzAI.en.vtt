Hi this is Elise McMahon with expertvillage.com
and this video series we are going to talking

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.890
about flea and tick prevention. If you like
to find more about my services you can visit

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.990
my website canineheadstart.com. So in this
short video series we are talking about external

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.310
flea prevention. There are a number of different
products out there you can pick them up from

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.470
the supermarket some of them are from the
supermarket, you can also get them from your

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:35.800
veterinarian or your local dog store. One
product is called Frontline and topically

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:46.230
what you do with these is open one up for
you you apply external to your dog. You want

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.190
to be very careful to read the instructions.
Read the size so if you can see right here

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.999
this is for dogs 23-44 pounds. You want to
make sure that you don't put a larger amount

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:13.040
on a smaller dog. Okay you can see that they
come in these individually wrap tubes. Usually

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.170
you are going to be buying three months supplies.
You put one of these on a dog once a month.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.450
There is a number of different products there
is Advantix, theres Hearts, this one that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.701
I'm showing you is called Frontline, they
all have different instruction on how you

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:44.100
are going to put them on. Some of them will
actually have you apply it to the dog in 3-4

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.560
spots depending on the size of the dog. Topically
they would tell you to put it on the shoulders,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:58.181
1-2 spots on the back, and then on the rear
on the. So you need to read the instructions

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:04.050
carefully the one that I got here is you just
put in all in one spot in the dog. So it is

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.369
very important to know exactly what you/how
you are being instructed to use the product.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.682
So the next video clip we are going to be
talking about and demonstrating some of the

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:14.790
stuff you can use for tick prevention.
