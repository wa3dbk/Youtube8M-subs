00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:37.010

uh... american ingenuity this to me is
the same often s

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.090
but we think about the last five to ten
years we see the growth of some

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.590
astonishing

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.620
waited to hear

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.940
microsoft apples

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.140
d_-day amazon unit

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.210
would be wonderful if us celebrate took
its place with those of the company says

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.050
one of the innovators immaculate

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.300
deliberating about the cell phone zero

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.110
policies could be a big help

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.380
and they're talking about the loving
joining us this morning as ryan were to

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.040
fifty-year-old this new mobile phone
company an extenuating families because

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.890
we thought we invited man and find out
what it's all about the morning to you

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:18.820
right in the morning

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.310
apace elevator explain what it means
that mislead got a lot of important

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.260
people backing your idea

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.080
well soleil we are the new mobile
services company

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.620
offering forty nine dollars a month
unlimited text data voice forgy

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.700
nationwide aunty mobil's network

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.100
uh... we uh... where a company that is
doing things differently today

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.090
were focusing on people in helping to
make a difference maples lysed by just

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.170
using something they use every day which
is a mobile phone okay and you said

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.690
you'd be a part of this idea because
everyone

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.550
basically has a mobile phone in
everybody's connected to social media

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.630
and somewhat

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.530
they are so

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.659
uh... we built everything on a platform
where we see today three million

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.910
individuals country carried mobile phone

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.550
majorie her on today's not connected
through social networks and so we create

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.330
an environment where instead of spending
hundreds of millions billions of dollars

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.729
in typical advertising we move those to
the greatest advertisers in the world

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.010
which i think the people xo individual
happens to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.919
MCA Motor Club Of America refer so late to three individuals and
they get twenty dollars a month

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:24.589
if that continues and through our social
commerce platform

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.739
many people are saying not only and
money to pay for the entire phone bill

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.790
forty nine dollars a month

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.810
many people making fifty under two
dollars a month from doing something

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.870
they do everyday visitor from so using
your phone you were for disservice to

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.700
frenchman a couple of friends

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.599
and it comes right off your cell phone
bill sick if you can be saving money

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:43.480
