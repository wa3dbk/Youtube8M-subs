Lots of things change in my flat.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.030 position:70%
Actually my apartment is constantly changing.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.060 position:77%
Many people think I must have a huge luxury home.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.050 position:98%
And nobody believes I have been living in a 4 x 8 m flat for the last 30 years.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.100 position:94%
Friends often cannot tell the walls and the furniture apart.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.210 position:94%
It is the only solution for creating more space in the flat.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.160
Almost any wall can be moved.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:10.110 position:64%
So I use my space in many different ways.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:36.010 position:98%
People will have to live in densely populated areas. So personal space will get ever smaller.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:49.140 position:98%
I have managed to convert a small, limited room and implement all the things necessary for everyday life. Iâ€™m very proud of that.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.180 position:98%
I have also used the experience I gathered in my flat in my work.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:07.090 position:98%
We designed a multi-storey home. For us, this challenge is even greater as each storey has a living unit in it, and each one of them is smaller than my flat.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.110
How much space do we need?

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.070 position:66%
A small room can also be very comfortable.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.120 position:63%
We just have to design it intelligently.
