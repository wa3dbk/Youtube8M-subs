Hi I'm Bob Schmidt with HomeRemodelWorkshop

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.650
I told myself when I started making these videos that I was'nt going to make a video

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.589
on how to hang a door

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:12.019
there's a lot involved in it and it takes experience to learn how to do it

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.230
properly

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.230
but I found a new product and I think
it'll give you a fighting chance

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:23.310
The product that we are going to use to hang this door today

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.650
is a relatively new product

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.769
it's called Quick Plumb for  Door
Hanger

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.439
it's made by Express Products

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.250
I'm not sure where they're from but

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.820
apparently they have a website and I
believe they did have a video there and

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.560
I have actually already watched it this is what they provide you in their

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.640
package

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.090
supposedly this is enough for doing two doors

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.800
 although I recommend you go to
their site and take a look at the way

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.960
they recommend doing it first

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.930
uh... I want to do it a little bit
different than their directions to try

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.400
to help simplify the process for the
homeowners and do-it-yourselfers 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.760
I ran across this product at my wholesaler

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.780
they were giving them away for free they want
carpenters to start trying to use them and see

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.900
what they think of them

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.870
I did hang a couple of doors with them and I
did like the results but

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.370
there was still some tweaking and
judgment calls that had to be made

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.570
uh... I kind of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.320
went off of what they said and I added to
it and changed the way you use them a little bit

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.240
where I think it'll give you more of a
fighting chance as a novice or a home

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.640
remodeler to be able to to do this.  As per
their instructions they recommend

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.090
that you come to about the center of the
hinge

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.490
you line this little clip up with the
front edge the lead edge of the door

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.460
and then with the screws provided

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.499
put the three screws in making sure that
this is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:49.630
kept tightly against the front of the
door as you're doing it.  

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.880
Repeat the process

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.890
with the middle and the bottom
hinge

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.820
As per their instructions repeat the
process approximately opposite

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.979
the hinge side that you've already put on

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.369
according to their recommendations it's
time to hang the door

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.400
but I've got a little bit of a different
way I'd like to see you try it directly

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.969
opposite the clips you just installed on
the hinge side of the door

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.619
go ahead and install

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:20.549
the remaining six clips

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.470
on the opposite side of the door

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.799
after you've installed it opposite the
one on the hinge side

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.770
go ahead and take a pair pliers

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.879
and bend this flange out straight like
this

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.240
repeat with the other five on this side
of the door

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.140
on the hinge side of your door this tab is still going to be bent just the way it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.109
was sent at the factory

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:42.910
directly opposite enough in all six
locations

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.510
you're going to have a another one where
you had bent this flange straight-out

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.290
according to their instructions

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.659
measure approximately one-half inch in
from your rough opening

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.049
and put a mark

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.599
do the same thing

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.709
on the other three sides

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.649
coming off of your mark making sure that this
is

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:04.760
dead level

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.879
very important

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.290
go a head and start making a line

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.369
and make your line go all the way up and
down the side of the door now that you have

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:16.509
the plumb lines on all four sides of the
door

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:21.559
both sides it's time to take the door
and put it in place take a level and put it

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.370
on the top of your door

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.840
as you see

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.099
this isn't level

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.299
what we're going to have to do is we're going to 
have to stick a shim underneath the

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.179
bottom side of that door

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:36.039
to make up for this difference here
where it's too low on the hinge side

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.909
tap the shim underneath the door until the
header says level

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.679
if this gets carpet you could probably
just cut this shim off and leave it out

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.829
underneath here and the carpet will fill
the void

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.019
if this is tile or hardwood what you'll
have to do is cut the bottom of the jam

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.109
off on the opposite side remove this
shim and let it come down tight to the

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:56.669
floor

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.739
now that you're headers level it's time
to start anchoring the door starting at

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.379
the top hinge

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.209
with about the same space on this side
as the other side

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:13.209
go ahead and run in your first screw

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.299
with the top hinge screwed

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.240
see these three little notches here

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.259
find the little notch and the spot corresponding to
it that is closest to it and put a mark

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.449
now coming down to the one below it

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.199
making sure that your marking in the
same place on the little mark

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.409
mark it here

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.899
coming down below it

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:44.490
again making sure you mark the same spot
as it was up above

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.310
which is here

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.340
then what you need to do is line these
marks up with that plumb line and put

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.339
screws in these two holes

00:04:58.339 --> 00:05:02.789
Now starting on the opposite side of the
door same side as the hinge

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.580
this margin here

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.199
needs to be matched right at this pin

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.030
so what you do is you adjust the door by
putting it in

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.569
you could measure it if you'd like I can do it by eye

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.029
and then once it's in

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:20.629
go ahead and put that top screw in

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.170
as you see by the three notches

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.079
on this last one here

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:28.199
we're right at the high side of this bump

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:33.159
now we're going to go down to the second
one

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:39.770
we're going to mark that same spot at
the high side of that bump

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.770
we're going to adjust that over to the line

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.599
and screw it,  Repeat the same
thing on the bottom screw

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.049
the door does open and close

00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:59.869
i'm not totally thrilled with the
margins though so at this point I'm going to

00:05:59.869 --> 00:06:01.609
loosen this screw

00:06:01.609 --> 00:06:04.979
and I'm going to bring this door over
because it seems like the margin on this

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.989
side is just a little large. Now I'm
happy with all the margins with just a

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:13.509
minor adjustment of backing a screw out and
in adjusting it left and right a little

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:14.030
bit

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.729
I'm very happy with the margins.  The door does open and close fine now it's

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.710
time to go to the other, at this point
would be what they recommend as

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.339
stopping, they're done go ahead and put trim on

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:28.439
I think the opposite side of the door on
the bottom is still a little loose

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.889
so let's go over to the other side.
Starting at the top

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:34.519
where you bent the flange out with your
pliers

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.620
go ahead and take your hammer

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.019
and bend the flange back down

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:46.110
until it is touching the wall.  Go ahead and repeat that with the other five on this side of

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.979
the door

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.310
Starting from the top brackett and working
your way down repeat

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.859
the procedure on this side

00:06:52.859 --> 00:06:54.990
exactly the same way as you did on the
other side

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.990
but you have to start at the top and come
down

00:07:17.499 --> 00:07:18.620
So there you go

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:24.520
the door is set, the margins are good and if I
open the door a crack and I put the level

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.429
on it, it shows real nice and plumb

00:07:27.429 --> 00:07:29.180
seems to be pretty solid

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:30.339
latches nice

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.519
uh... I hope you found this video
helpful

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:38.649
