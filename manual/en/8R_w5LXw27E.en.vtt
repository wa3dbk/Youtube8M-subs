00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.220
Everyone is lost for words like you

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.700
Beyond fourth dimensional, a miraculous view

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.800
Sweetly dip it in and eat the fondue of light

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.660
You can start seeing the color of the music

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.440
I feel that you've become sensitive a clear color and the sixth sense

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.000
Tonight is the night

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:37.140

The sky is beautifully spread

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.120
In the ocean, time is in a bottle

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260
I dream of peacefully walking

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.980
(By my side)

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.280
Now tell me, yeah, yeah

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.280
I feel that you've become sensitive, the soft touch and endless senses

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.080
Tonight is the night

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.140
It's alright if it's weird the moment you pass the limit of your sleeping senses

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.940
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah) Such a beautiful view

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.480

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.800
(Never leave you lonely)

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.360
You were so used to being bored, you forgot about the specialness

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.100
Now slowly lift your head

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.460
Kiss me on my eyes

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.320
To that beautiful place

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.200
There

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.800
To that beautiful place

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.900
There

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.140
Take me (take me)

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.360
It'll be the first time for anyone, like you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.080
(I feel a thousand senses)

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.960
Smelling and tasting the star light

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.680
(I'll never leave you lonely)

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.060
Feeling the weight of the scent

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.480
(I won't let you down)

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.320
Seeing the color and shape of sounds
