00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.460
This video will show you what to do if your printer does not pick up or feed paper from

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.210
the input tray or an “out of paper” message displays on your computer when you do have

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.370
paper loaded into the printer. Sometimes, the problem can be fixed just by

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.990
doing a printer reset. First turn to the back of the printer.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.990
Without turning the product off, remove the power cord from the back of the printer.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.250
Wait 30 seconds. Then plug the power cord back into the printer.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.190
If the printer does not turn on automatically, go back to the front of the printer and then

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:49.730
press the Power button to turn the printer on.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:51.159
Try printing a self-test page. Press and hold the Power button.

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.420
Lower and raise the cartridge access door four times while holding the Power button.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.089
Release the Power button. If the test page prints successfully, the

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:08.570
issue is resolved. If the test page does not print, go on to the next step.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.080
Often the condition of the paper you’re using can cause paper to not be fed into the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.260
printer. Remove the paper from the input tray.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.350
Remove any damaged paper you find. Make sure that there are at least 10 sheets

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.400
of plain white paper but no more than 25 sheets of paper in the paper stack. The printer may

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.070
hold more sheets of paper, but this number of pages is best for testing.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.659
Make sure all the paper is the same size and type; then tap it on a flat surface to get

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.550
the edges perfectly aligned. Finally, load the paper and adjust the guides

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.520
so they’re snug against the stack. Try to print a self-test page again.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:56.209
Press and hold the Power button. Lower and raise the cartridge access door

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.600
four times while holding the Power button. Release the Power button.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.229
If the test page prints successfully, the issue is resolved. If the test page does not

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.640
print, go on to the next step. Printer rollers get dirty from paper dust,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.790
ink, and oil from your fingers. In this step, we’ll clean the rollers.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.360
Before you begin, gather the following cleaning materials:

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.980
Clean, lint-free cloth. Clean cotton swabs.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.420
Clean water to dampen the cloth. Distilled or bottled water is preferable but not required.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:42.460
Do not use alcohol or other chemical cleaners. Press the Power button to turn off the printer.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.319
Go to the back of the printer and unplug the power cord from the back of

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.030
the printer. Remove the printer’s rear access door.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:02.580
Clean the rollers visible in the printer with a clean, lint-free cloth, lightly moistened

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.120
with water. The cloth should be damp, but not soaking wet. Use your finger to turn the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.330
rollers toward the printer. Make sure you remove any buildup or debris from the entire

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:25.290
surface of the roller. Look for the rollers farther inside the rear

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.040
of the printer. Clean the rollers with a moistened cotton swab, removing any buildup or debris.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.209
These rollers are difficult to reach, but they are the most important to clean. If these

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.410
rollers inside the printer are not cleaned, this problem will continue because THESE are

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:52.770
the rollers that feed the paper into the printer.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:03.629
While the rear door is off, check the rollers. Note if any rollers are missing, don’t roll

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.580
freely, or are not springy when you push on them. These conditions could prevent the rollers

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.060
from feeding properly, and mean that the rear door needs to be replaced.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:22.759
Replace the printer’s rear access door. Plug the power cord back in

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:33.580
and go to the front of the printer. Turn the printer on

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:45.529
and load paper into the input tray. Try to print a self-test page again.

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:52.529
Press and hold the Power button. Lower and raise the cartridge access door

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.370
four times while holding the Power button. Release the Power button.

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:04.270
If the test page prints successfully, the issue is resolved. If the test page does not

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.379
print, go on to the next step. Next, we’ll make sure the paper settings

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.800
in the print driver match the settings for the paper you are trying to use.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.639
On your computer, Open a document in the program you’re printing

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:27.939
from.

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:36.659
Click File. Click Print.

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.659
Select your printer and then click Properties. When the Properties dialog box opens,

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.719
Click the Features tab. Find the paper “Size is” drop-down menu

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:53.729
and choose the appropriate paper size. Find the “Paper type” drop-down menu and

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.529
choose the appropriate paper type. Click OK.

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:04.829
Click OK again to print the document. If the document prints successfully, the issue

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.619
is resolved. If the document does not print as expected, go on to the next step.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:14.619
If you’ve tried everything described in this video and you still have a problem, your

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:20.479
printer likely needs some type of service. Contact HP to find out what the support options

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.460
are for your printer. Your options for service may vary depending on how long you’ve owned

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.089
the printer and what country you live in.
