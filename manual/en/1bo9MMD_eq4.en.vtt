00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.420
Today we&amp;#39;ll be taking a look at the Saris
Freedom SuperClamp Hitch Mounted Platform

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.000
Style 2-Bike Rack part number SA4025.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.610
This light weight, compact, easy to use bike
rack has ratcheting padded hooks that firmly

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.290
grip your bikes by the wheels so that there
is no frame contact and it protects your bike&amp;#39;s

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.070
paint from scratches and scuffs.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.480
The SuperClamp 2 has a rust resistant steel
base and arms in a black powder coat finish.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.860
The wheel trays are made of an injection molded
plastic to resist rust and corrosion.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.090
It has a weight capacity of 35 pounds per
bike.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.170
It weighs 28 pounds and comes with a limited
lifetime warranty.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.850
We&amp;#39;ll begin our installation by sliding
the shank of the rack into the opening of

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.850
the hitch.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:03:14.650
We&amp;#39;ll then need to line up the pin hole
and the shank of the rack here with the pin

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:44.460
hole 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:04:22.440
in 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:05:18.400
our hitch.
