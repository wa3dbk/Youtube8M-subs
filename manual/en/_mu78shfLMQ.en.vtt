(music playing)

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.320
JOHN MCDANIEL, U.S. EMBASSY, VIENNA:
Hello, my name is John McDaniel

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.860
and I'm in the Political Section
here at the Embassy in Vienna

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.660
and I'm gonna talk about
my home state of Texas

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.590
also known as the Lone Star state.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.550
It’s the second largest
state in the country

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.750
with the second largest
population in the country.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.230
You may hear people
in the United States

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.500
tell you that Texas
feels like it is its own country

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.730
– and that is probably
because it used to be.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.980
Texas
was an independent nation

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.680
for nine years
back in the 19th century.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.620
Texas has two of the largest
seven cities in the United States

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.949
– Houston and San Antonio.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:50.100
It has one of the largest
metropolitan centers in the country

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.140
– Dallas/Ft. Worth.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.140
Texas has a thriving cultural center
in its state capital, Austin.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.270
Many films are made in the city,
musical bands are discovered,

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.120
and Austin is home to many artists.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.399
A short list of artists and performers
include Willie Nelson, Buddy Holly,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.739
Tina Turner, Z.Z. Top,
and Steve Martin.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.360
Texas also has just about
every kind of geographic feature

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.450
– beaches, forests, plains, deserts,
mountains, lakes, and rivers.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.959
In fact, often Texans forget
that there are other countries

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.250
or even other states out there.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.259
The name of Texas originates
from a Caddo Native American word

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.729
meaning friend.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.020
It has a long history with six flags
being raised over the state.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.890
Those flags are the old Spanish flag,
the old French flag, the Mexican flag,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.000
the independent Texas flag,
the U.S. flag and the Confederate flag.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.569
Texas was sparsely populated
until Mexico agreed

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.420
to allow Americans
to settle its northern territory.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.619
This ultimately led to
a revolutionary victory

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.750
by Sam Houston,
the first president of Texas

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.420
as well as the iconic battle
for the Alamo in San Antonio.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.340
After the Civil War,
the ranching industry exploded

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.709
and the state’s image
as home to cowboys

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.640
and cattle ranchers was born.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.259
Although the legendary cattle drives
as reenacted in the movie,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.959
“City Slickers” were short lived,
the image still transcends the state.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.930
Texas was later transformed
by the discovery of oil

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.530
at Spindletop in 1901,

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.080
adding the oil derrick
as yet another famous Texas symbol.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.410
To this day,
the fictional J.R. Ewing

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.090
from the TV series, “Dallas,”

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.490
is one of the most popular Texans.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.700
In 1961
the Johnson Space Center

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.490
in Houston opened,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.490
which later played an instrumental role
in the U.S. moon landing in 1969.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.410
Texas has its share
of important historical figures.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.970
Two presidents
were born in Texas –

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.000
Dwight D. Eisenhower
and Lyndon B. Johnson.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.910
Eisenhower
was the Supreme Commander

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.020
of the Allied Forces
in World War II

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.110
and LBJ was the president
who pushed through

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.850
the momentous
1964 Civil Rights Act

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.750
that brought the U.S.
on the road to equality.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.920
Two other presidents
have Texas roots,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.100
George H.W. Bush
and George W. Bush.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.220
So where do I fit
into this picture of Texas?

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.250
Like many Texans,
my parents were attracted

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.060
to the state’s opportunities.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.840
My father worked
as a chemical engineer.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.800
After moving around,
my parents settled

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.620
on a suburb of Dallas,
called Plano.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.290
Now Plano is the ninth
largest city in the state

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.670
with about 260,000 people.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.260
Growing up in Texas,
you quickly learn

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.270
what is the most important thing
in the entire state – American football.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.890
While the Dallas Cowboys
remains “America’s team,”

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.760
Texans focus their passion
on high school football.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.220
You may be familiar
with the book, “Friday Night Lights”

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.060
– which then became a movie,
and then a TV series.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.010
Although some of the story lines
may have been a bit Hollywood,

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.100
life in a Texas high school
was pretty accurately portrayed.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.220
I also have to mention
the great universities in Texas.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.180
Of course,
the students and alumnae

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.500
will rave about the schools’ football prowess,

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.569
but universities
like the University of Texas,

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.660
Rice and Texas A&amp;M, where I went to school,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.490
are recognized internationally
for their great academics.

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:06.880
Finally, there is one more word
to associate with Texas – big.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.740
When you are in Texas,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.560
you will discover
that everything is bigger

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.090
– cars, food, universities,
you name it.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.800
It’s just part of the Texas mentality.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.000
I hope you enjoyed learning
a little bit about Texas

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.810
and hope that you will get a chance
to experience it one day.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.590
You may not need a cowboy hat
but you may need some cowboy boots

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.670
or even a belt buckle.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.840
