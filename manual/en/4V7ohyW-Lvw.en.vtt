00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.799
it helps that…

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.599
moms that are busy all the time take time to pray for other kids…

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.299
and that means a lot.

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.320
… it makes me feel really happy and it makes me feel comforted

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.519
because whenever I'm going through something hard

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.640
it helps me get through it because I know my mom is praying for me.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.460
She wants me to be safe and you never know what's gonna happen every day

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.289
and she prays for me so that I will…

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.170
succeed in school and I will always be happy

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.340
and I obey her and when I grow up

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.320
I'll be respectfull and I'll have a good life.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.130
I appreciate that my mom prays for me 'cause 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.660
it makes me feel good

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.480
and when I'm like having a hard time at school during a test… um and I think about 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.489
it kind of gives me comfort so I can focus and so. It means a lot to me because

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.720
I know that she's always praying for me and 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.450
it's like she sacrifices her time

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.860
to like go… go to this place 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.280
with her friends and just sit down and pray for me and like i'll be

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.130
having a test and she's like

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.240
oh I'll pray for you today and it means

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.540
a lot to me because I know she's watching

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.400
out for me and she really cares.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.110
… she prays for me about in school and …

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.410
to help me do good in volleyball and other things.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.250
And since she prayed for me it helped me

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.400
to meet my friends at my new school and I'm finally happy there now. Well I'm

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.350
pretty sure she prays for like drama that goes on at school or like my friends

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.600
and just my other friends

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.460
