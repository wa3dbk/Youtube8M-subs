00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.700
Now we're going to move on to the layer haircut,
okay. So you're at home and you need to give

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.020
yourself a trim or your daughter or your sister
or anyone that has layers on their hair and

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.220
you can't make it to see your stylist, there's
services in between that you can do for yourself

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:27.689
at home. I'll show you how to do that. Get
rid of the knacks and pull it straight out.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.119
So what I'm going to do next is I'm going
to create a soft layer technique that's called

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:39.380
the French ponytail. When you need to give
yourself a trim on your layers, just pull

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:56.960
your hair into a ponytail, brush it through
completely, and she's basically ready. Brush

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.840
it, brush it, brush it, until you feel there
are absolutely no knacks in there. The knacks

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:15.180
can create a shortage in the hair and it'll
give you an unfinished result. Comb, comb,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.159
comb, comb. Okay. So it's completely free
of the knacks and there you go, as you can

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.080
see right there, she's have some layers that
I'm going to remove, it's just the tips, please

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.220
don't do any more than this at home or you'll
create something that you don't want, okay.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.330
So we're going to do it one more time. Notice
how I'm pulling the hair straight up, from

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.060
where the hair grows. I'll turn it around
for you, here her ear and it comes straight

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.200
up. That is the tricks on the layers because
here is where the layers live and you just

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:10.140
want to trim them up and give them a clean
cut. And so here we go. Pull it up a

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:20.690
little and cut. That has assured me that all
of the layers were touched and trimmed. And

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.540
now the ends are out. So you can see, she
keeps the length, she keeps all the movements

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.430
in her layers and I created a removal of the
hair tips.
