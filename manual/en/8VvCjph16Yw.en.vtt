00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.610
Hello and welcome,

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.200
I am Chris Tavano for Tundra Restaurant Supply.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.820
We are here in the kitchen of Bar Lilly at
the Broker Inn

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:06.820
In Boulder, Colorado.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.099
Today, we’re going to show you how to make
some infused flavored oils with some herbs

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:14.190
and peppers.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.450
We are infusing two kinds of olive oil today

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.450
Or two different flavors.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.790
We’re going to have a garlic and chili pepper
one

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.900
With a red jalapeno and a serrano pepper and
some peppercorns.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.960
Yes, jalapenos can get red.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.620
Every pepper starts of green and goes to the
red shades.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.180
It’s just a matter of when you pick them,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.280
That’s’ why you often see green.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.079
But, we got a red jalapeno in a serrano pepper.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.940
The second oil we are going to make is an
herb infused oil

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.060
With some fresh garden picked rosemary as
well as thyme,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.380
Some peppercorns and a clove of garlic.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.100
First off, we are going to start with the
chili peppers.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.030
I just slit them open right in half,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.400
So that way you can get the nice season,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.690
All that capsaicin, all that nice hot spice.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.280
Throw in your peppercorns and a little bit
of garlic.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.580
The reason why we are doing this in a pot

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.510
Is because you’re going to want to steep
this oil.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.059
You are going to want to bring it up to about
a temperature of about 300 to 350 degrees.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.520
Then you’re are want to sit there for about
10 minutes and just like tea or coffee,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.220
You’re going to want the actual perishable
ingredients to steep for a couple of minutes,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.220
So that way,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.299
We don’t incur any kind of botulism or food
spoiling later on down the line.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.650
We are pulling our peppers off the flame right
now.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:26.650
One thing to notice

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.240
Is you don’t necessarily want to fry your
peppers and the garlic.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.380
You don’t want them to start turning brown
and getting crispy.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.100
You really just want them to steep like you
do coffee beans or tea leaves.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.000
You just want to bring the heat out of it
and infuse flavor into the oil.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.830
From here, what I want to do now is get our
peppers in a jar

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.380
And we’re going to have our nice little
funnel and carefully,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.570
This is hot oil.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.150
You don’t want to splash yourself too much.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.610
Got our nice chilly oil, boom,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.560
And once that cools down to room temperature,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.579
Yyou can store it on your shelf for up to
30 days

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.360
Or in the fridge for up to 90 days.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.700
We let our herbs steep in the oil over a flame

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.580
Aor a few, 5 to 10, minutes at about 300 to
350 degrees.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.920
Again, you’re not necessarily trying to
fry your herbs,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.370
You’re just trying to steep them.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.010
You don’t want them to get all crispy and
brown and really sizzly.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.400
You just want to get the flavor and the essence
and the aroma

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.319
Out of the herbs and into the oil.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.101
The nice philosophy to think about it is

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:32.101
Once you smell your herbs,

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:35.349
Your chili peppers that’s a good time to
pull it off.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.920
From here, this one is a little bit trickier,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.310
Just because we got the herbs to deal with.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.489
It is just a little trickier getting it into
the actual bottle,

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:56.300
Carefully using your fingers because that
could be really hot.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.400
The biggest reason why we are just not straining
this

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.090
And discarding the herbs or the chili peppers

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.069
Is really honestly for presentation, mostly.

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.330
Once you let it steep at temperature for a
good 5 to 10 minutes

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.489
Without frying,

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.750
You have gotten all the flavor from herbs
or the peppers.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.450
What you really want to do now is,

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.200
We are using these nice ornate Tablecraft
oil cruets and bottles,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.940
So you might as well just go the route of
presentation

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.239
And throw the herbs in there as well.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.569
Some other nice bottles you could see using

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.599
That I personally like especially at home

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.819
Are the Tablecraft Gemelli style.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.870
These ones are nice because they just got
a nice curvature shape to it,

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.200
So it is a little bit more unique to what
you put in one.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.620
Again if you are in a restaurant and you’re
really cruising through the day,

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.099
You could always just put in a Tablecraft
wide mouth squeeze bottle,

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.480
Works just as nice.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.459
Great for finishing oil or if you want to
decorate the plate.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.739
Here is a couple of infused oils that you
could possibly make,

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.430
The herb and the chili pepper,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.220
However, also keep in mind your options are
limitless.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.540
You could do anything from sun-dried tomatoes
to chives

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.390
To shallots to basil to anything that you
can think of

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.810
That has some sort of flavors or innate flavor

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.660
That you want to bring out and put onto something
else through your oil.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.040
That’s exactly what you could do for infused
oils.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.069
Just always remember,

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:19.799
Steep it because that’s what’s going to
enhance the most essence

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.849
Of flavor as well keep yourself free of any
kind of botulism.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.610
Obviously, there is other practical uses for
olive oil around your kitchen.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.529
You could use it for moisturizer for your
butcher block.

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.270
You could use it to for polish on your stainless
steel.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.439
You ever had those squeaky hinges on your
refrigerator

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.759
Or your ovens, use it as a grease!

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.969
It is a great application for that.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:42.529
As well as other home remedies:

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:44.039
For moisturizing your skin,

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.999
Washing your hair,

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.349
All those kinds of things are great for olive
oil.

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.129
As well, the last thing that we are going
to segue into

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:52.900
One of our next videos coming up this winter

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.119
Is salad dressings and emulsifications.

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:57.830
That’s probably the biggest thing you’ll
see with olive oils.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.009
I am Chris Tavano for Tundra Restaurant Supply

Joining you from the kitchen of Bar Lilly

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:03.939
At the Broker Inn in Boulder, Colorado.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:05.650
Here's to a better mise en place!
