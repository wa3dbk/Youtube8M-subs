Okay, welcome back. Now that we have the face
pretty much how we want it I'm going to move

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.810
into the area of hair. And so with hair you
can really do lots of different things with

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:18.820
the hair. But with this woman I think I'm
going to do, it's kind of like just a straight

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:26.779
bob. And I'm just going to, my pencils really
sharp, so I can kind of come in and draw these

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.590
lines out. Just come in here and usually right
next to the ear there's like a wisp of hair

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:43.460
there and I can bring it down and shape the
face. And just maybe a curl there and then

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.400
real loose come in and then from the side
just come in like this, draw down towards

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:04.030
the neck. And then maybe just give it a little
curl there.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:12.610
It's kind of a texture hair style that it's
turning out to be.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:20.220
If she has dark hair then once I get the shape
of the hair that I like I can shadow it but

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.180
I mean this is a style that can all off a
sudden go long. And then I can, if I add here

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.220
and then go out here, all of a sudden it's
a totally different hair style. So once I

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:41.100
do that then I can come in and if it's a darker
hair color then I can kind of come in and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.610
start to shade. But usually if it's a darker
hair color it's not just all dark. There's

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.420
usually highlights on the hair just from natural
light or a lamp or something like that so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:01.210
in areas where it's a dark strand you can
leave the middle of it light and that'll give

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.659
you a highlight on the hair that gives it
some depth as well. And it kind of helps you

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.520
define the shape of the hair as well. And
then you just want to keep other ones, other

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.420
strokes very clean like they're individuals.
I can come down here and then fill this in

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.170
a little darker. And then all of a sudden
you start to see the shape of the hair.
