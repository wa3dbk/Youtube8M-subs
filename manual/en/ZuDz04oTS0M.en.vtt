Hi it’s Emily with Bite Size Vegan and welcome
to another vegan nugget. Today’s video is

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.349
another installment of my interview with vegan
activist Gary Yourofsky. With the overwhelming

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.129
enormity of unnecessary animal suffering in
the world, it’s easy to lose hope that any

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.279
significant change will occur anytime soon,
if at all. In this interview segment I ask

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.660
Gary his thoughts on whether we will see a
vegan world in our lifetime and then I share

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.330
my thoughts on the matter before asking for
yours. So here’s to a vegan world.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.520
Do you think that there will come a day when
veganism is the norm and meat, dairy and egg

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.880
eaters are in the minority? If so how long
do you think it will take to get there and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.330
is there hope that the Earth will actually
be able to heal? It depends on which day you

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.840
ask me. If you asked me after last week’s
lectures, I had four in Charlotte, I had three

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.840
in Rhode Island. All but two students out
of more than 300 were fabulous. Only two gave

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.690
me a negative response. Oh man, soon. Sooner
rather than later. But you ask me on a bad

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.550
week, when I have more people arguing or people
wanna fight with me or maybe I saw something

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.550
horrible or just was exposed and I’m gonna
end up saying no, it’s possible but all

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.490
I know is that injustice can’t last forever.
Animals will obtain their freedom one day.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:31.270
When? I wish I knew. There was a time I never
thought it would happen in my lifetime. But

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.250
considering what’s going on in Israel right
now, I’m not so sure about that. I’m still

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.340
44 so we still have time a lot of time left
for liberation of animals on this planet.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.549
I think it’s going to happen in Israel first,
in fact, I’m quite positive. I tell you

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.780
what’s interesting about that, I've been
asked by a lot of people in Israel, “how

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.450
come here? Why us?” Well, it’s supposed
to be God’s holy land. It seems to be a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.450
perfect place for speciesism to be destroyed
and for animals and humans to get along peacefully.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.549
It’s gonna happen there first, and then
it’s gonna spread like wildfire. Once the

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.439
majority of people start doing it. They’re
moving their way up, moving their way up day

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.209
after day, thousands and thousands of people
every week every month, Tal Gilboa was just

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.659
on The Big Brother Israeli show. Surveys said
that she converted 80,000 while she was on

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.900
this show in a few months. It’s happening
there. So I definitely think it’s possible.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.389
Again and injustice can’t live forever,
but it took 400 years to convince white people

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:44.569
in America not to own black people, you can
see why this is taking so long.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.349
I hope you enjoyed hearing Gary’s thoughts
on this matter. I would like to believe that

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.829
a vegan world could occur in my lifetime.
Like Gary, for me, there are days where it

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:57.809
seems like a viable possibility, and other
days a distant, unattainable dream. What I

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:03.290
believe is of utmost importance, though, is
that we do not lose hope. And that we never

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.559
doubt the impact even one person can have.
Whether you love or hate Gary, you have to

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:13.959
admit that he's proven how big o fan effect
one person can have. You have a voice and

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:20.959
can speak for those who cannot speak for themselves.
You can create change. You can make a difference.

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.829
I know it’s overwhelming and sometimes the
battle seems far too large. I’ve had and

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.129
continue to have my own struggles with this,
which I shared in my speech about my journey

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:37.129
into activism through Bite Size Vegan. But
change is possible. Just take action. Whatever

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.059
action that might be. And if you’re wondering
just what would happen to the animals and

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:46.120
industrial agriculture and farners if the
world were to go vegan, check out this video

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.349
where I go over those logistics. Trust me.
It's a good problem to have. Now I’d love

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.230
to hear from you about this topic- do you
think the world will ever be vegan? Will the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.099
animals ever achieve the freedom they so richly
deserve? Do you think this can happen in our

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.409
lifetime? Do you struggle with feeling overwhelmed
by all the suffering out there? Let me know

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:10.650
in the comments. I really do value your insights.
Now let's close it out with Gary.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.689
Gary I just want to thank you so much for
giving us your time and I've been asked on

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.650
behalf of so many of my viewers to just thank you for everything that you do. So, thank you so much.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.290
Gary: Thank you. Keep on. Everybody, pass
her stuff around. It's tight stuff, honestly.
