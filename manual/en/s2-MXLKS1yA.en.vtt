The Three Billy Goats Gruff, a fairy tale
from Norway, narrated by Keith Bower.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.760
Once upon a time there were three billy goats,
who were to go up to the hillside to make

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.810
themselves fat, and the name of all three
was "Gruff."

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.530
On the way up was a bridge over a cascading
stream they had to cross; and under the bridge

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.530
lived a great ugly troll, with eyes as big
as saucers, and a nose as long as a poker.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.829
So first of all came the youngest Billy Goat
Gruff to cross the bridge.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.399
"Trip, trap, trip, trap!" went the bridge.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.399
"Who's that tripping over my bridge?" roared
the troll.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.449
"Oh, it is only I, the tiniest Billy Goat
Gruff, and I'm going up to the hillside to

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.890
make myself fat," said the billy goat, with
such a small voice.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.080
"Now, I'm coming to gobble you up," said the
troll.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.080
"Oh, no! please don't take me. I'm too little,
that I am," said the billy goat. "Wait a bit

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.840
till the second Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's
much bigger."

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.939
"Well, alright then, be off with you," said
the troll.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:39.150
A little while after came the second Billy
Goat Gruff to cross the bridge.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.700
Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap, went the
bridge.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.159
"Who's that tripping over my bridge?" roared
the troll.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.390
"Oh, it's the second Billy Goat Gruff, and
I'm going up to the hillside to make myself

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.240
fat," said the billy goat, who hadn't such
a small voice.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.610
"Now I'm coming to gobble you up," said the
troll.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.430
"Oh, no! Don't take me. Wait a little till
the big Billy Goat Gruff comes. He's much

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.690
bigger."

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.590
"Very well then, be off with you," said the
troll.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.720
But just then up came the big Billy Goat Gruff.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:28.720
Trip, trap, trip, trap, trip, trap! went the
bridge, for the billy goat was so heavy that

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.260
the bridge creaked and groaned under him.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.260
"Who's that tramping over my bridge?" roared
the troll.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.819
"It is I! The big Billy Goat Gruff ," said
the billy goat, who had a voice all of his

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.970
own.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.700
"Now I'm coming to gobble you up," roared
the troll.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Well, come along! I've got two spears,
And I'll poke your eyeballs out at your ears;

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.640
I've got besides two curling-stones,
And I'll crush you to bits, body and bones.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.300
That was what the big billy goat said. And
then he flew at the troll, and poked his eyes

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.170
out with his horns, and crushed him to bits,
body and bones, and tossed him out into the

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:27.170
cascade, and after that he went up to the
hillside. There the billy goats got so fat

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.860
they were scarcely able to walk home again.
And if the fat hasn't fallen off them, why,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.670
they're still fat; and so,

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.200
Snip, snap, snout.
This tale's told out.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.590
The End.
