00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.890
So this is the Turner-Fairbank Highway Research
Facility of the Federal Highway Administration.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.139
We've been doing research and innovation development
for over 65 years.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.780
So the investment in research and technology
makes the federal government investment in

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.750
the highway and transportation system so much
more effective and adds value to it.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.640
We can produce results that are going to stretch
that federal dollar.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.230
It's going to allow the infrastructure to
last longer.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.360
It's going to allow the system to operate
more efficiently.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:45.219
It's going to allow the system to be safer
to drive on.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.940
It's called the backbone of America.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.609
Our country's economic future depends on its
transportation system and its ability to efficiently

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.930
and safely move people and goods across the
country.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.569
The United States has built one of the world's
largest transportation systems.

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:10.720
With more than 600,000 bridges and 8.5 million-lane
miles, the system is large, complex.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.530
It's also ageing.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.350
The Federal Highway Administration plays a
vital role in leading the nation's transportation

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.600
research to meet current and future highway
challenges.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.440
We work with partners around the world to
improve roads and bridges and increase efficiency.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:38.120
We're saving lives, reducing congestion and
advancing economic growth.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:44.680
Our safety research focuses on the causes
of fatalities and injuries by examining highway

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.720
designs, construction practices and maintenance
operations.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.110
For example, FHWA developed the Interactive
Highway Safety Design Model to help identify

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.090
design details to minimize future crashes.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.480
We're also developing roadside safety features
that guide vehicles back on the road when

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.050
they stray.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.440
FHWA develops innovative tools to increase
highway capacity, reduce congestion and improve

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.410
traffic analysis.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.990
For example, adaptive signal control adjusts
the timing of lights to accommodate changing

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.110
traffic patterns.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:33.670
Cooperative adaptive cruise control allows
vehicles to broadcast speed, following distance,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.090
acceleration and deceleration to other equipped
vehicles.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.230
Our researchers look for ways to maintain
infrastructure integrity and protect investments.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.880
FHWA brought warm, instead of hot-mix asphalt,
to the United States.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.800
Warm Mix Asphalt reduces fuel consumption,
green house gas emissions and costs.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.490
It also extends the paving season.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.870
FHWA's research provided details for connecting
prefabricated bridge elements and systems

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.280
with slide-in bridge construction.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.450
New bridges can now be slide into place and
paved within 48 to 72 hours.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.290
FHWA is looking for innovative ways to get
the most out of existing roads.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.290
We transitioned a good idea into a great one
by furthering the development of the divergent

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.290
diamond interchange, a new method for navigating
busy intersections.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.670
DDIs improve safety and reduce congestion,
and more than 40 are now in operation.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.720
We also support the efficient movement of
freight.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:50.280
FHWA developed the Freight Analysis Framework,
which integrates data to create a national

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.380
picture of freight movement for all modes
of transportation across the country.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.960
FHWA develops new technologies and improves
practices to minimize negative impacts on

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.790
people, the environment and our natural resources.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.770
We worked with the U.S. Forest Service to
develop the Roadside Re-vegetation Technical

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.530
Guide to help ensure native plants are placed
in areas disturbed by highway construction.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.930
FHWA developed e-NEPA, an online tool to help
states collaborate and streamline the NEPA

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:24.930
process.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.560
FHWA is looking beyond today's challenges
to anticipate the emerging issues of tomorrow.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.930
What will personal travel look like in the
future and how will it influence system demand

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.060
down the road?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.490
How do we continue to improve safety and mobility,
manage highway finances and help meet future

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.500
energy demands?

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.520
Imagine using the public right-of-way as a
source of energy.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.560
We're developing an intelligent power system
that may provide cost-effective, efficient

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.020
and reliable renewable electric power production,
storage and distribution.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.830
Picture new technologies like connected and
automated vehicles to streamline mobility,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.229
decrease traffic crashes and congestion, and
save time and fuel.

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.000
It's all about people.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.150
FHWA's research and technology professionals,
in partnership with state DOTs and other agencies,

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.650
provide innovation to improve the safety and
mobility of the highway system and the economic

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.740
stability of our country.
