00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.001
One of the things I do that would be good
for you guys up here, is I do the 20-pound

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:07.460
braid.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.070
I don't usually fish under 16 because... or
under 20 because 16 starts, it will start

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.250
back lashing a little more.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.480
It's so thin and the wind catches it, it will
get, like, wind back lashes, or you'll just

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.600
override and they'll catch a loop and stop.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.810
Basically, it will waste, I mean, it's just
like fluorocarbon.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.810
Braids the same thing.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.830
If you cast a couple of times and it hits
that spot, it always hits the same spot, that's,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.830
can break really easy.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.750
I mean, it's almost like, just like fluorocarbon.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.720
But I do, do a braid on a jerkbait a lot because,
you know, if you throw in a jerkbait a lot,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.390
all day, it's gets even me fishing constantly,
you start to get those pains, it's hard.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.880
With the braid it's about half as hard, about
half the work to move the bait the same.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.230
It's actually a law against doing it now,
but I've done that for quite awhile.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.020
And I'll just do like a 20-pound braid, I
use the SX1, it's really, that's good.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.020
It's a Sunline braid.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.260
I use about that much leader.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.301
But you know when you tie your knots on, usually
you go pull off the spool and just, kind of,

00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.760
pull it off and tie my knot on.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.890
And, you know, you want to give yourself enough
line the way you tie your knot.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.000
You have about that long a leader in between
the bait.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.960
And the reason I do that, I don't like to
cast the jerkbait, the leader through guides

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.670
as I really fire it, and any knot, I've never
had a knot hold up, so, I will snap it too

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.560
hard, and usually those 110s you can throw
them 130, 140, 150 feet some times.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.020
And that just, when you get really a super
long cast, you know, instead of having to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.670
rip it really hard, to get that way out there,
and if you get bit you miss them sometimes.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.280
It's just like, it's the same thing as if
it's, like, right there.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.530
So when you're jerking it, you can get that
bait with the same movement, you can to move

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.320
a ton all the way back to the boat.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.750
It's just like it's five feet from here.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.090
There's no stretch, so, that's why I do that,
and that works really good.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.371
It works, it doesn't seem to spook them or
anything, the braid, but, it just makes it

00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.510
easier to do and you hook them better.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.010
(off camera voice) Do you put 20-pound braid
. . .

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.010
(Aaron) And longer casts.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.020
(off camera voice). . . or 110 bait to what
line?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.250
What weight of line?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.930
(Aaron) If I use 20, and, it depends on how
you catching them.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.879
If it's kind of tough, then I'll use, like,
14.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.790
But usually I use, like, 16 or 20 leader.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.830
And the leader line just keeps the bait from
hanging in the wind.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.840
You go fire it out, just keeps it kind of
straighter, and a lot of times I won't use

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.430
a split ring or a clip.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.939
I'll actually tie direct to the eye, and just
because the braid's so loose in the water,

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.590
the bait moves, it's like it has a split ring
on it.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.450
(off camera voice) You go braid fluoro or
mono?

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.450
(Aaron) Flouro normally.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.450
Shooter, that stiff shooter.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.430
But usually I use, like, sixteen, but, you
know, any kind of good, Sniper will work,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.049
but I use heavier.

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:41.709
Usually when I do that I'm catching them really
good, and I want to get them in to the boat

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.709
quick, and I'm using heavy leader material,
and then just bigger, you know, heavier hooks,

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.560
like the double strong Gammy short shanks
or something, or the new hook we come out

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.049
with, it's going to be phenomenal.

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:53.430
But that's usually, I just, I'm a commercial
fisherman basically.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.919
I trying to get them from point A to point
B quick.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:59.529
So you're just like, [makes noise] and you
get them in.

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.739
And soon as you get out there, they're biting,
and, you know, when the bites good.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.489
But most time, if it's a normal bite and,
you know, you're catching twelve to twenty

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:10.409
fish a day, I'll use, like, you know, depending
on how big they are and what you're fishing,

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.879
and what bait, whether you're fishing a magnum
or the small one, anywhere from 8- to 12,

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.800
I normally use, and in the summertime I use
a lot of 14 and 16, just straight fluoro.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.400
And that's also for being able to move the
bait good, but I don't always do that.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.470
It's just, I probably do the braid on a jerkbait,
maybe 20 percent of the time.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.779
But, I mean, if they're smoking, and it's
a really good bite, and that's all you're

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.639
doing all day, I'd pull the braid out.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:39.049
But a jerkbait for me, most time, is just
like, maybe 20 percent of the day I'm fishing

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.049
it.

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.529
It's not like an all-day deal, I'll use the
fluoro, straight fluoro.

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:43.689
It's just to save my arms.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:49.409
But, like, it gets really cold here in the
winter and the spring when the fish are jerkbait,

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.810
then a lot of times it is 8-pound, and then
the fish aren't pulling really hard, or doing,

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.979
kind of, hard little runs and are stopping.

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.819
You just, kind of, get them in, kind of, quick.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.389
And maybe they're over 30 feet, 20 feet of
water, 15 feet and you want to get your bait

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:01.389
half-way to the bottom.

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.120
You know, like, get your, my 110, and might
get down to 9-feet, which you can do, on a

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.839
long cast, on a 7 or 8.

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:12.870
I do use 7- or 8-pound flouro a lot, but,
there's not, I mean why not?

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.819
I haven't had a problem breaking them off.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.150
It's just you've got to fight them a little
longer.
