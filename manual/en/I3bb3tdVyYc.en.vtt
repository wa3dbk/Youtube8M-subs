00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.689
Ever since the PS Vita was still the Next
Generation Portable, everyone’s been talking

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.900
about how we can finally play a console-quality
shooter in the palm of our hands.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.050
The dual analog sticks would finally make
the dream of playing games like Call of Duty

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.540
on a handheld a reality, and while we haven’t
seen that game yet, Zipper Interactive gave

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.690
us their last game when this was released
just weeks after the launch of the Vita.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.470
This is the first dual-analog stick shooter
on the Vita, except it isn’t, because Uncharted

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.960
beat it to the punch.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.449
Well, it’s here anyway.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:56.780
It’s Unit 13!

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.629
Unit 13 doesn’t really have a plot.

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.519
Instead, the game has a large number of short,
independent missions for you to play through

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.369
using a variety of different operatives from
Unit 13, such as a gunner, commando and infiltrator.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.630
To be honest, this might actually not be such
a bad thing, as the overall vibe for the game

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.030
is so generic that including a similarly generic
story probably just would’ve hammered that

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.030
point home.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.450
Still, the individual missions are exciting
and vary from missions where you can’t get

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.729
spotted to missions where your health doesn’t
recharge.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.250
Gameplay in Unit 13 is surprisingly crisp
for a title released so close to the launch

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.380
of the system.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.189
Aiming and shooting both work really well,
melee combat and interactions also work solidly

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.172
and touch control is, for the most part, optional,
although having to touch the screen to use

00:01:36.172 --> 00:01:37.970
optics was a bit of a pain.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.030
In addition, some buttons are just mapped
strangely, with the square button being a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.299
melee attack and the circle taking cover,
which is probably the weakest aspect of the

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.299
game’s controls.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.799
It feels very stiff and often won’t let
you go to a corner without detaching yourself

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:57.890
from the wall.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.329
Enemies in Unit 13 also have some pretty nice
AI.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.820
They won’t keep their heads out to let you
shoot, and they’ll fire at you if you keep

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.979
yours out too long.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.090
They also seem to be able to take quite a
few hits, while you can only take 3 or 4,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.790
so staying out of their line of fire is a
must.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.390
Luckily, Unit 13 has great hit detection system,
so the whole thing still feels fair.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.850
This is also one of the sharpest looking games
available for the Vita right now.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.180
Characters and environments all look great,
and although the color scheme doesn’t do

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.950
the game any favors, it does what it sets
out to do well.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.040
The game’s music is also excellent, with
lots of bass, but the voice acting feels like

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.170
the actors were told to just use stereotypes
from various countries.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.500
It just comes off as being cheesy.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:50.420
Now, I had heard stories of the demo for this
game crashing Vitas, and while I was playing

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.190
the full version to record this review, it
happened to me.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.560
This isn’t just the app closing; the entire
system turns off and you have to restart it,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840
so take note if you plan to pick this up.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.540
Unit 13 is a solid shooter that feels like
it was made to be played on a handheld with

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.860
its short, intense missions and scoring system,
but I can’t recommend a game that has technical

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.300
problems capable of taking you out of the
experience.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.109
Be very careful
