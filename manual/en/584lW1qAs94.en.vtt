00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.890
How to Get Your Press Release Noticed.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.820
A bad press release can wind up in the circular
file, but a great press release can give your

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.150
business or organization the attention it
deserves.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:25.490
You will need Exciting headline Details Relevance
Sources Quotes Accurate spelling and grammar

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.949
Proper formatting and marketing agency (optional).

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.270
Step 1.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.660
Write an exciting headline that jumps out
at the reader and contains the main piece

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.159
of news you're trying to convey.

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:39.750
Step 2.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.070
Give the details of your business or organization
in the second paragraph of your press release.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.610
Use the opening paragraphs to specify the
who, what, where, when, why, and how of your

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.830
product.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.080
Step 3.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.299
Tailor your press release so it's relevant
to the media outlet you are sending it to,

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.390
and to its audience.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.750
Simply advertising your product or cause won't
get your press release noticed -- it needs

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.290
to read like a news story.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.290
Step 4.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.250
Show why your news is important, don't just
tell.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.810
Write your press release in a way that makes
it informative without making it sound like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.890
a grocery list of attributes.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.150
Hire a marketing agency that specializes in
press releases to write your press release.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.150
Step 5.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.650
Include sources.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.370
A typical news piece uses a minimum of 3 unbiased,
reliable sources.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.370
Step 6.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.140
Put a couple of memorable quotes in your press
release to grab the attention of the reader.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.200
Include at least one quote from an unbiased
source.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.460
Step 7.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.990
Check the spelling and grammar in your press
release.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.640
A misspelled word or an awkward sentence will
make you look unprofessional.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670
Step 8.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.060
Format the press release properly.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.090
Put the phrase "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE" aligned
left and above the first paragraph.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.930
Align your organization's contact information
on the right.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.760
End the press release with three hash mark
signs.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.340
Write an effective press release and you're
sure to get noticed.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.360
Did you know America's first regularly issued
newspaper, _The Boston News-Letter_, published

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.480
its first issue in 1704.
