00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.040
Comic book and superhero games have been a
really mixed bag over the years.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.791
Batman games have been especially good recently,
and Spider-man games have been decent, but

00:00:31.791 --> 00:00:34.990
other series like Superman just haven’t
been able to release a decent game.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.680
Now, I don’t know if you would consider
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to be superheroes

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.630
exactly, maybe you would, but their games
have been surprisingly good over the years,

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.570
especially on the 16-bit consoles.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.460
However, we have a key question to ask about
the game today.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.500
If a series tends to have good games with
its license, and then it gets a movie made

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.860
that subsequently gets a game released, will
it be any good?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.070
Let’s find out.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.520
This is TMNT for the Gamecube.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:10.650
TMNT’s story is interesting in that most
of the game is played as one turtle tells

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.840
his story to the others.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.360
There’s tons of dialogue between them as
you play through levels as one of the turtles,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690
and this style actually works really well
for the game.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.630
It helps to explain why the various turtles
got into the situations they got into, but

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.830
it also adds room for some funny moments.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.900
Playing an entire level as Michelangelo dressed
as another turtle actually got a laugh out

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.540
of me.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.350
TMNT is really a mix between a beat ‘em
up and a platformer.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.909
Most of your time in each level is just spent
moving across it, and as far as a platformer

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.040
goes, it’s not that great.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.140
Camera angles can sometimes lead to some cheap
deaths, and a very slight button delay can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.409
screw up jumps.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.880
The controls also can cause some problems
with jumping off a wall in the middle of a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.880
wall run.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.300
However, the combat is actually a lot better.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.530
It can come down to button mashing at times,
but the different abilities that each of the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.299
turtles get, along with dodging and kicking
moves make this part of the game a huge step

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:10.550
up from the platforming.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.400
Now, with that being said, the game does have
a flaw that is very common in movie games:

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.400
the dreaded invisible wall.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.050
Large sections of the game are spent in areas
that appear to be open and able to be tackled

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.010
in a few different ways, but it’s a trick.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.290
There’s almost always only one way to get
from point A to point B, and if you guess

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.730
wrong, you’re going either going to start
running in place or go through a fake building.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.240
That’s not to say that the problem is going
to drive you nuts, because it isn’t, but

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.799
it is still worth noting, especially considering
our key question.

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.139
TMNT is actually a pretty good looking game.

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:47.489
Characters all have a look that gives them
some personality, even the bad guys, and environments

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.970
vary enough from level to level to keep you
interested.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.700
The game also uses a nice, hand-drawn 2D style
for in between levels.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.523
However, the voice acting is not only performed
badly, but the writing is some of the most

00:02:57.523 --> 00:03:00.260
cringe worthy in any game I’ve played.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.480
The game also repeats the same lines over
and over again, and I don’t have to explain

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.320
how this can get annoying.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.990
TMNT is not a great game, but especially for
a movie game, it is good.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:21.369
However, with a franchise known for some great
games, I did expect a little bit more.
