00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.889
They’re Earth’s mightiest heroes.

00:00:01.889 --> 00:00:03.540
Marvel’s The Avengers have saved

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.960
the planet from alien invasion,
the Norse god of mischief,

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.340
and now face the angry robot
killing machine Ultron.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.660
The Avengers combine amazing abilities
with some pretty amazing science.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.990
(Reactions Intro)

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.279
Let’s start with everyone’s favorite
smartypants billionaire.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.279
No, not Elon Musk - Tony Stark!, better known

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.140
as Iron Man after his original iron suit of armor.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.359
Because iron is heavy and dense, Stark’s O-G

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.399
suit would have weighed around 150 pounds.

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:32.399
Not ideal.

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.440
Stark says he later upgraded to a gold-titanium

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.260
alloy, but that would actually make things worse.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.500
That suit would probably weigh around

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.679
350 pounds, which might work

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:42.559
for the Hulk, but not Tony Stark.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.019
Let’s have Raychelle explain.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.600
“Stark’s suit is probably made of a nickel-titanium

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.350
alloy called nitinol. It’s strong, but light,

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.940
and can be re-formed after taking damage.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.050
There may also be some graphite reinforced

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.539
with carbon fiber, which can take a lot of heat.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.309
Useful if Iron Man doesn’t want to singe

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.480
his feet using those rocket boots.”

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.050
The power source inside Stark’s suit

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.610
has changed over the years.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.510
The “arc reactor” that he designs is actually

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.430
a miniature nuclear power plant.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.360
In Iron Man 2, the arc reactor depends on palladium.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.160
But we learn that the palladium is slowly

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.250
poisoning him, so Stark does what any brilliant

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.370
scientist does, he creates a new element.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.500
You’ve done that before right?

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.610
“Stark uses his homemade particle accelerator

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.650
to smash the nuclei of atoms together

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.030
to make a new type of atom.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.450
It seems like movie magic, but that’s actually

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.430
pretty standard procedure for the
manufacturing of new elements.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.420
Scientists have actually made more than

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.360
20 synthetic elements, so it’s not unbelievable

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.040
that Stark could have made a
new element to power his suit.”

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.660
But enough eccentric billionaires, let’s talk

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.390
Captain America and Black Widow.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.750
According to the Marvel comics, both Black Widow

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.290
and Captain America have peak human abilities

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.970
— they’re super strong, have super quick reflexes,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940
tons of stamina and they age really slowly.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.990
But they also can heal fast, though not as

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.250
fast as a certain other hairy Marvel hero.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.200
How might this super healing work?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.050
It’s probably has to do with white blood cells.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.160
“In normal healing, a type of white blood cell

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.360
called a macrophage fights infections and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.500
oversees the repair process. Macrophages

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.400
also send out chemical messengers called

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.700
growth factors that help repair wounds.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.640
All these steps take between two to five

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.010
days in regular humans, but happen faster

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.190
in Black Widow and Captain America.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.570
Their macrophages could be super productive,

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.480
pumping out more growth factors
to heal wounds more quickly.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.380
Souped up white blood cells is not the Captain’s

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.420
only defense, he’s also got that awesome shield.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.710
Cap’s shield protects him from everything:

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.390
bullets, grenades, lasers, supervillain 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.670
death rays and so on.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.630
Most of that protection comes from good ol’ steel.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.120
Steel is strong and rigid, allowing the captain

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.730
to throw his shield and have it knock off

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.630
multiple bad guys before it comes back to him.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.040
But there’s more to the shield than just steel.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.700
Conventional steel has a lot of super properties,

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.410
but it’s not a great shock absorber.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.520
That’s why the captain’s shield’s steel

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.310
contains the imaginary mineral vibranium.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.660
This material can absorb a near infinite amount

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.680
of vibrational energy without
getting too hot or melting.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.110
But where is all that energy going?

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.890
Well, in the first Avengers movie, we see

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.010
Thor’s hammer strike the Captain’s shield.

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.680
The shockwave knocks both of them to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.390
the ground, but the shield is just fine.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.080
When Thor’s hammer hits the shield, you see a

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.510
huge flash of blue light, implying that vibranium

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.140
converts vibrational energy to light energy.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.920
After all - they couldn’t put it
in a movie if it wasn’t true!

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.040
So there you go, Fearless Viewer.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.560
Keep fighting the fight for Science!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.180
And thanks to Sci-Pop for helping us

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.360

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.430
We’ll put a link in the description.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.040
