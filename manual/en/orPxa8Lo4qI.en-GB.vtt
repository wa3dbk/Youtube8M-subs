00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.141
We're at the Richmond Campus

00:00:02.141 --> 00:00:05.195
talking with OTEN Head Teacher
of Primary Industries, Ian.

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:08.767
He's going to take us through
the pre-start checks for quad bikes.

00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:12.069
♪ (upbeat music throughout) ♪

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:15.912
Now, what we should all do,
whether we're experienced or not,

00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:17.877
we should firstly look
at the operator's manual.

00:00:17.877 --> 00:00:19.950
This is the manual that came
with the machine.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:23.252
The manufacturers know the machine
much better than any of us do

00:00:23.252 --> 00:00:24.490
as operators,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.361
so this is what we should look at

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.419
to find out what the pre-start
checks should be.

00:00:29.872 --> 00:00:31.304
Now on this bike here,

00:00:31.304 --> 00:00:32.915
I'm going to check the tyres.

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.089
I want to check that they've got tread,
I want to check that they're inflated.

00:00:36.186 --> 00:00:38.200
Now inflation pressures
on a machine like this

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.632
are pretty important.

00:00:39.632 --> 00:00:42.511
If you don't have access to the manual,
they're actually imprinted

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.859
on the outside edge of the tyre there,

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.210
so we can check there

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.692
to find out what the inflation pressure
should be.

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.634
Next on a quad bike--

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:55.723
hey, these do go over fairly rough terrain
the bodies get knocked around,

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:58.944
so we're going to check
for any loose bits and pieces.

00:00:58.944 --> 00:01:02.162
They're quite plasticky
so we can get splits and bangs on them.

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:05.105
We're going to check and make sure
no bolts are undone.

00:01:05.854 --> 00:01:10.038
A full walk around the machine
to check for loose body parts,

00:01:10.063 --> 00:01:11.506
loose nuts and bolts.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:13.306
Next on my list,

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:15.173
I'm going to have a look at the radiator.

00:01:15.173 --> 00:01:20.433
This particular model has a coolant
and a radiator - it's not air-cooled.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:23.590
And there's an inlet
for the radiator right here.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.020
You can see this air inlet here.

00:01:26.752 --> 00:01:29.906
Now, operating in agricultural areas,
on farms,

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.567
we're likely to get that full of bugs
and full of grass seeds,

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:35.305
full of rubbish,
all sorts of stuff.

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:37.924
So, a daily check's got to be
to have a look in there,

00:01:37.924 --> 00:01:40.509
there's a screen there
in front of the radiator core

00:01:40.658 --> 00:01:43.212
and we've got to make sure
that's clear

00:01:43.212 --> 00:01:45.064
because the air has got to flow
through there

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:46.960
while the machine's going forward.

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:51.976
Now, next on my list of pre-start checks
will be to check the controls.

00:01:52.704 --> 00:01:56.502
There's lots of cables on a quad bike
as there is on a motorbike,

00:01:56.512 --> 00:01:58.630
and they're quite vulnerable to damage.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.377
And they're quite 'out there'
and can be hit by anything

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:02.677
that's flying through the air.

00:02:02.677 --> 00:02:04.336
So, a good check on that
as a pre-start,

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:06.353
because here, we've got brakes,
we've got throttle

00:02:06.353 --> 00:02:08.713
and all sorts of electrical gizmos,

00:02:08.713 --> 00:02:11.872
so it's crucial that we have
a good visual inspection of those.

00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:14.390
Feel the cables a bit
if you're looking for damage.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.213
Next on my list would be
to check the lights

00:02:16.213 --> 00:02:18.089
before we go out
and operate the vehicle.

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.441
On this model, the ignition switch
has got to be turned on,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.805
we put the button on,
the lights should have come on...

00:02:22.805 --> 00:02:24.033
yes they have.

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:25.381
I can check that they're both on,

00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.048
so I know that they're
in working order.

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:30.813
Next, for me, would be
to check the fuel level.

00:02:30.813 --> 00:02:32.682
This model has a fuel gauge
just here

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:34.671
and this is the entry
for the fuel tank.

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.724
I'll make sure that I've got
a full tank of petrol

00:02:36.724 --> 00:02:38.841
and the petrol is suited
to the engine of course.

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:41.263
I can check the owner manual
if I've forgotten that.

00:02:41.904 --> 00:02:44.391
Nextly, I'm going to check the oil.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.520
And for that, that's down the side
of the engine, down here,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.081
just where I'm pointing now.

00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:51.975
And I've got to remove
this particular cover to get at it.

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:53.251
I've taken this off,

00:02:53.251 --> 00:02:56.981
so that I can show you clearly
the process of checking the oil.

00:02:57.196 --> 00:02:59.790
So, I'm going to remove
the little dipstick now.

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:11.037
I'll wipe the oil off.

00:03:12.953 --> 00:03:14.428
Put it back in.

00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:17.812
Screw it down to the correct level.

00:03:19.712 --> 00:03:23.349
And then check that the oil
is on the [unclear]

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.316
so I know that the oil
is in the correct range

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:30.315
for operation for this vehicle.

00:03:33.227 --> 00:03:39.007
Now, an important check on a quad bike
before we operate in any country area,

00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:40.694
is to check the air filter.

00:03:40.694 --> 00:03:44.295
That's the thing that protects
all the rubbish going into the engine

00:03:44.295 --> 00:03:45.964
that could do damage.

00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:48.663
Now, the air filter on this vehicle
is underneath the seat,

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:50.752
that's not an easy operation
to get into it,

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.290
so I'm not going to demonstrate that
to you today.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.400
But needless to say,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.766
I can refer to the owner's manual,
find out the process,

00:03:56.766 --> 00:03:58.017
and I can do that.

00:03:58.017 --> 00:04:01.045
And I will do that once per week
on this vehicle.

00:04:02.025 --> 00:04:05.179
Finally, my last pre-start check
on this vehicle,

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.631
or any quad bike,

00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:08.110
would be to check the chain drive

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.238
and to check that the chain
is within adjustment

00:04:11.238 --> 00:04:12.745
and not loose.

00:04:12.924 --> 00:04:15.714
Now, this particular quad bike
doesn't have a chain drive,

00:04:15.714 --> 00:04:17.027
it's got a shaft drive,

00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:18.291
so I don't have to do that.

00:04:18.437 --> 00:04:22.908
But on plenty of others,
that's a standard pre-start check.

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:27.805
So, that completes my series
of pre-start checks for this vehicle.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:31.170
I feel that I'm confident now
to hop on it and operate it.

00:04:31.722 --> 00:04:32.830
So, thank you Ian

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.281
for taking us through
the quad bike pre-start checks

00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:39.083
for the wheels and tyres, the body,
the engine and the controls.

00:04:39.083 --> 00:04:41.312
So tell us, what are we doing next?

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:43.735
Well Jason, next we're going
to ride the bike.
