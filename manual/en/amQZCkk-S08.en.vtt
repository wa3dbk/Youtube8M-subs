Hi I'm Melody and on behalf of Expert Village
I'm going to show you how to fold another

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.530
piece of clothing in this segment we are going
to fold this dress. First we want to flatten

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.600
it out and depending why you are folding this
there are different ways to fold it. I'm jsut

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.649
going to show you one basic general way you
could fold this and typically I put the front

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:39.230
down so when you finish you get the front
back on top. I'm taking the arms and I'm laying

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.019
them across the body of this dress and I think
I'm just going to pull a piece over like this.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:56.289
Making sure everything is flat as I go it
would make a nice neater package when you

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:09.000
are finish and I'm doing this again where
I folding it over against itself. Making sure

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
everything is flat because if it is not when
you go to put this on it is going to have

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:21.110
some very strange places that are wrinkle
they are pressed in some cases materials are

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:30.039
not very forgiving. Okay this is a very long
piece of clothing but you don't necessarily

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.350
want ot have to many big creases. So what
I'm doing here is I did go ahead and roll

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.990
it right there because that is where the sleeve
ends are. I'm going to fold this a little

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.890
bit larger I think then I could just right
up t o the neck line this is the front facing

00:01:51.890 --> 00:02:01.100
me now. Here is your turtle neck sticking
out and we pull it forward and push it down

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.740
and that is one way to fold this garment.
In our next segment I will show you how to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.830
fold something else.
