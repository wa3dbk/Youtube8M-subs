IAN LOVEALL: Hi! My name is Ian Loveall with
Expert Village and today we're looking at

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.599
murals. And right now, I'm going to show you
some different types of sponges and the effects

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.770
you can achieve with them. Okay, next we have
your natural sea sponges. These are incredible.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.550
As you can see, no two are alike. And even
on the same piece, you'll have a variety of

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:33.550
different surfaces and textures, endless possibilities
with these guys. They range in size from very

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.620
small to the size of this whole pad of paper.
I had one that big, but, you know, they don't

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.739
last a terribly long time. They tend to break
apart. That's just the nature of the fibers.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:53.420
So, let's just dive in and start seeing what
we come up with. Great for dabbing, you can

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.970
also roll them. Again, you can wear gloves
if you like. I really don't mind getting my

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:13.490
hands messy. So, each surface will create
a different pattern. You can also tear these

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.510
or cut them into certain shapes if you have
a specific need. You can use the same side

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.780
over and over to create a stamp effect or
you can rotate it constantly and you'll get

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:42.180
a new impression every single time. It's just
a really nice random texturizer. You can also

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:52.620
drag.
These are actually my--my favorite tool for

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:00.151
wood graining. You load it up with color.
Obviously, if I were doing this with an actual

00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:07.509
project, I would not be using blue. Get it
wet. Start at the top of your piece, and then

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:15.890
simply by varying the pressure of your stroke
and the position of your fingers, you can

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:24.410
create nice, veining patterns that in the
right colors will mimic woodwork very nicely.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:37.290
And you can go in later with a brush and maybe
paint a knot hole or two. And again, depending

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:50.090
on your own taste. Sea sponge is a great tool,
play with them. You will be surprised.
