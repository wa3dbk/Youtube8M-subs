00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.610
What's Up !
Welcome to PowerDrift Guys

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.090
Now we are going to be spending brilliant
couple of hours with brilliant fast bike

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.010
and the same fast breath i need to be telling
you that we're gonna be rushing through things

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.550
coming straight to the crux of what the proud
RC rabid racoons are all about

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.449
Ladies and gentlemen Powerdrift's first take
first impression of the RC 390 and the RC

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.490
200, Starts Now

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:33.720
TO begin with, the intake air routing has
changed entirely on the RC 390,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.830
The Front fork, well, the rake has been steepened
a bit, which means the front wheel has been

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.840
brought closer to the centre of the bike
This results in an overall reuction of the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.930
wheelbase of the bike, which aids in better
handling characteristics

00:00:45.930 --> 00:01:09.710
So, The RC 390, surprisingly given with its
fairing has higher ground clearance than the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.930
duke 390
which also results in higher centre of gravity

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.090
for the bike,
steering inputs are going to be a lot more

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.729
responsive on the RC 390 than on the DUke
390

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:29.560
The RC is definately one of the best bikes
I've ridden after the R15 and Its just so

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:38.229
nimble and turns quickly
and the front end feel is very very nice

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.270
The front suspension, the WP suspension, its
the same as on Duke 390 but then the travel

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.159
of this bike has reduced for more stiffer
feel at the front

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.520
the rear suspension once again it's the same
as on the Duke 390 but then this one gets

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.759
Preload adjustments

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.810
Even though the front forks are not adjustable
still they feel very planted and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.119
even if you jam on the brakes still the front
end dive is very progressive

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.149
the brakes on this bike, they're most definately
very adequate for the sort of speeds that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.319
the bike can do
and ofcourse there is also the safety net

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.720
of ABS

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.710
Metzelers are downright sticky from the first
lap onwards, no need to heat them up or anything,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.950
these are the stickiest tyres available on
any Indian bike

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:33.230
MRF are bit jittery on RC200

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.241
this gearbox is exactly the same as Duke 390,
Long corners one gear is never enough, no

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:42.780
matter what gear you choose
you have to shift in the corner

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.550
Thats because this is a 375cc engine which
has a lot of mid range but i believe that

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.210
it has no top end of a race bike
so once you are past the mid range you might

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.370
have to shift up, is that what you mean
Ya !

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.680
The footpegs were scraping sometimes
they're like,

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.680
You just need a rear set

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:11.070
Coming over to the front you have projector
headlamps, very handy

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.710
and also DRL
now weird thing about these DRL's is that

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.320
they are not always ON
ofcourse they are always ON if you happen

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:30.320
to switch the button ON

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.400
Now agressive steering geometry usually comes
with a trade off sacrificing straight line

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.850
stability of the bike

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.230
but then Akash Here bets that the RC 390 will
have a firm footing even in a straight line

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.790
We would love to pit it against the Kawasaki
Ninja 300 in a drag race, but that's for laters

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:52.600
for now the national champion on top of RC
390 to tell us 0-60, 0-100 and then ofcourse

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.990
a top whack

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:29.090
Ready Akash ?

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.400
Our time here is over and we thank Bajaj for
letting us test the bike at their test facility

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.870
stay tuned and subscribe to PowerDrift for
next time when Sargent Sheldekar our test

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.610
rider will be frolicking around
on whats perhaps his next bike, will he end

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.240
up buying the RC 390, well, we dont know but
we shall find it out in our comprehinsive

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.120
review, until then guys,
GoodBye.
