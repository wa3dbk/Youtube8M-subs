Hi. I'm Emily Larew continuing now with our
beginning hip hop combination. We're now in

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.000
our eighth count of eight. We're actually
going to do a whole turn of eight in this

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.789
sequence because it's not that hard and I
think we could put it together. So our feet

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:19.300
are apart. We're here on eight. You're going
to snap front, front, sit. Kind of like your

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.190
Soldier Boy. So we're going to snap it right
and you're going to twist to the left, left

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.150
twist to the right and then you're going to
snap and sit. So sit into that right hip and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:39.540
arms straight down. Seven, eight, a one, two,
three, four. You're going to roll five, six,

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.610
we're going to reach seven, down eight, and
that's how we're going to finish our combo.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.560
So ready? We're here on eight, we've got a
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:01.130
One more time. Five, six, seven, snap, one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:11.220
Good! Let's take it from the top. Slow motion.
Ready? Here we go. Five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.280
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
We've got one and two, three, four, five and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.560
six, seven, eight, and one, two, and three,
four, five and six, seven and eight, and one,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:40.380
two, three and four, five, six, a seven and
eight, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:50.920
down to eight. One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight. Push off on one, two, three,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:00.590
four, five and six, seven, eight, one, two,
three, hold four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.650
and that was your eighth count of eight.
