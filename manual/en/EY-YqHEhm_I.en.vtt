00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.780
uh hem [clearing throat] I say uh hem

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.819
you who. Here I am over here at the
lectern

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:10.329
you remember that episode? The lectern
as opposed to the pulpit?

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:14.589
over ther.. no, no, [panic voice Chuck] stay here least don't make me run again.

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.660
Anyway I'm here at the lectern today
because

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.740
[deep voice Chuck] I am a liturgist

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.200
Now what's a liturgist, you ask. Beside
someone you're standing at the lectern

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.490
instead of the pulpit ["eh-di-di-di" panic Chuck] stay

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.619
just stay here.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.780
..and do they have to

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.760
speak this way? [deep voice Chuck returns]
well we are about to find out

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.839
on this episode of [deep voice returns] Chuck knows Church

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.219
Wha.. What is over there I'm here I'm
right

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.620
here!!
[super awesome cool fabulous intro music]

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.840
Alright let's see what the dictionary has to say
about all of this.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.840
All right here we are liturgist one

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.950
who uses or advocates the use

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.190
of liturgical forms.. or two

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.400
a scholar in liturgics.. or three a
compiler

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.960
of liturgy or liturgies.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.660
Enough for that

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.500
doesn't always help to use a dictionary when
it comes to how things translate to us

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.970
church folk. Right? Now it may be simple
enough to say that a liturgist is

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.700
someone who helps with the liturgy

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.220
That's fine, if you know what liturgy means.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.430
So let's start there.. um

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.780
Liturgy comes from the Greek word leitourgia

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.070
which could be translated to mean
worship. Also I'm pretty sure leitourgia

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.590
is a European sports car

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.220
for possibly a tween pop star

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.740
or both?... you know tween pop star

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.679
that does 120 on the Autobahn? Something like that?.. Sorry, uh, uh..

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.560
It refers to the regular public worship
according to the specific traditions

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.840
of a religious group. Which comes
out literally meaning

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.880
the work for the people. So if liturgy

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.799
is the work of the people, what is a
liturgist? A worker of the work of the

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:28.400
people...

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.500
okay. Or or maybe a worker who helps the
people do

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.440
their work. In this case worship

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.640
even more simply a liturgist is just a fancy
name for worship leader. Why don't we

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.480
just say that! [Chuck being mad at crew, if Chuck did get mad]

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.620
to start with we need to fill all this?
Is that with the..

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.860
we needed at least three minutes of oh.. It's not
necessarily assisting the pastor

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
as it is commonly thought as the pastor is
really the worship leader and everyone

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.040
else is secondary.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.299
Remember it's not the pastors worship
but rather the

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.910
the people's worship. 
Now some worship leaders

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.620
or liturgist leave music, others may
help lead prayers or

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.459
calls to worship, or read scriptures you
get the idea.

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.120
And he or she [deep voice Chuck returns] 
may or may not speak like this.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.579
So with when you are called
upon to be the liturgist

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.109
consider it an honor and a privilege to
participate

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.530
to help lead the work of the people

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.410
now if you'd like to learn more ask your pastor

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.810
Tell them Chuck sent ya!
