Title: How To Properly Align Multiple Colors
of Vinyl

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.259
Spoken: How Do You Properly Align Multiple
Colors of Vinyl?

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.370
When you receive your vinyl lettering in separate
pieces, aligning each color is critically

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.389
important.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.740
So in this video, I am going to show you an
easy way to align your vinyl graphics.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.000
You will need masking tape, a tape measure,
an Xacto knife or needle, our Vinyl Magic

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.689
Application Fluid and a squeegee.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.030
In this example, we have three different colors.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.680
When you look at each piece, you will see
a registration mark like this.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.770
These are here to help you line up each piece.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.800
Step 1 - Align
The first step is to align each layer by holding

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.760
up each piece to the light.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.050
One of the light sources we like to use is
the inside of a glass door because it makes

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.900
it easy to line up the registration marks.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.649
Once you line up the registration marks, you’ll
want to tape each layer together.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.850
By taping all the layers together, you’ll
be able to see the overall size so you can

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.320
accurately measure and position your vinyl.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.980
Step 2 – Position
Temporarily tape the assembled vinyl up to

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.440
the freshly cleaned surface to determine the
placement.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.170
Then measure and re-position your vinyl until
it’s placed exactly where you want it.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.130
Step 3 – Remove Top Layers
Carefully remove the top layers so you only

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.380
have the one bottom layer taped to the surface.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.320
Step 4 – Hinge
Now tape the vinyl all the way across the

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.320
top.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.520
This tape will act as a hinge and hold your
vinyl in place as you begin the application

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520
process.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.950
Step 5 – Spray
Peel back a few inches of the backing paper.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.380
While holding the vinyl and backing paper
away from the surface, spray the surface generously

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.580
with the Vinyl Magic Application fluid.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.530
Be careful not to get any on the backing paper
because this can make it stick to the back

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.530
of the vinyl.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.030
Step 6 - Apply
While holding the bottom of the vinyl straight

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.700
and tight, take your squeegee and start in
the center, sliding it firmly across.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.530
Always start in the top center and work your
way down and out to the sides, pushing out

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.210
any air pockets.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.640
Once you have applied that section, remove
more of the backing paper and continue holding

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.230
the vinyl away from the surface while you
squeegee out all the water.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.100
Step 7 – Release
Once the first layer is applied, spray the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.030
masking paper with the Vinyl Magic Application
Fluid to help release the protective mask.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.920
Start at the corner and slowly peel it down
and off.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.780
Step 8 – Rinse &amp; Repeat
Gently rinse and clean around the freshly

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.640
applied vinyl prior to applying the next layer.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.780
Now take the next layer and align the registration
marks again.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.300
If you can’t see the registration marks
underneath, you can create a window by cutting

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.500
out the registration marks with an Xacto knife.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.170
Once you have the vinyl aligned, hinge the
vinyl across the top again to apply.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.721
If it’s a small section of vinyl, you can
completely peel off the backing paper, spray

00:02:46.721 --> 00:02:51.810
the surface generously with the application
fluid, and simply place it on the surface,

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.730
aligning the registration marks.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.920
The application fluid makes it easier to remove
and reposition the vinyl as needed.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.890
Once the vinyl is in place, then use your
squeegee to firmly apply the vinyl.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.470
Step 9 - Eliminate Air Pockets
You can use the tip of an Xacto knife or needle

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.470
to pop any small air bubbles.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.470
Simply rub your finger over the bubble to
push the air out.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.900
Over time as the vinyl heats up during the
day and cools at night, any remaining air

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.900
bubbles will disappear.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.450
As always, if you have any questions, please
let us know!

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.400
Thanks for watching!
