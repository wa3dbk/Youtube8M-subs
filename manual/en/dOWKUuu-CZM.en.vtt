00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.350
If you go out riding you may find out more
and more riders as late are chosen to ride

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.950
brake less. Some people do it because they
have issues with mechanical inclination. They

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:16.730
just can't fix their bike up very well, other
people do it cause it allows them more freedom

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.090
on their bike. For me personally, I don't
think the brake less is the right choice for

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.450
me. So then basically you want to make sure
that you stop, it's a safety issue and it

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.859
could be a real concern if you're at a skate
park or something. You're just taking your

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.350
brakes off and you don't have the necessary
bike handling skills to control your bike

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.430
and make sure that you're stopping. You're
going to start running into people and running

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.680
into people is a very quick way to make sure
that you're not going to be popular with all

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.300
your friends at the skate park. Your brake
set up have a lot of different options. For

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.920
me personally, I choose to use to run a straight
cable rather than a cable detangler. It's

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.329
a little bit wider and easier to set up at
the same time. It also wears out a little

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.690
faster so I have to replace my cables more
often than some of my friends were riding

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.590
cable detanglers. If your brakes are not working
very well you want, there's a couple of tips

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.190
that you can use to make sure that your brakes
are working a little bit better. Having a

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.512
rim that's chrome plated will actually allow
your brake pads to grab your rim a little

00:01:14.512 --> 00:01:20.460
better, making sure that rim is also clean
is a necessary part of having good brakes

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.650
and also picking proper brake pads. Right
here I'm running a cool stop sanding brake

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.430
pad. It's one of the crispest brake pads on
the market, basically you have a whole combination

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.540
of simple systems here working together to
give you a really good set of brakes. Another

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.471
final issue, that you generally want to leave
your brake pads toed in a little bit. It basically

00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:46.850
means that as your wheel is rolling forward
if you want the bottom side of your brake

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.770
pad to contacting to the top side. So basically
if I grab my brake, this portion down here

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:00.230
actually touches the rim before this portion
up here and what that does is that keeps the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.140
brake pad from shattering. Basically it won't
give these a high speed vibrations that happen

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.840
when this part here touches down. First the
brake pad actually reflects in and bounce

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.820
out and grab again and it basically shatters.
This happens very fast and creates a pretty

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.940
horrible squeaking noise. It can actually
seem as though you're running over a flock

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.700
of ducks to a point where you have horrible
noise and also is a disconcerting noise with

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.310
your bike. So basically take a couple of minutes
to dialing your brakes. Make sure that all

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.710
your cables are properly lubricated, make
sure that you're running chrome rim brake

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.430
pads and you'll be very happy with your brake
set up.
