Hi. I'm Melina Piroso and welcome to Expert
Village. Today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.660
make cute little bags out of regular everyday
fabrics. And so the last and final step is

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.790
I like to decorate it. So, this is a little
drawing I made and then I colored on Photo

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:27.570
Shop and I printed it on a iron transfer sheet.
And you can get these at, usually craft stores

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.619
will have them, but the best ones you can
buy them at darmatrading.com. That's the best

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.870
place that you can get them and it's about
$10 for 10 sheets and they're really wonderful.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.059
You can print almost anything on any type
of fabric and get a nice, polished, professional

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:52.010
look. WE can just go ahead and apply our transfer,
or if we want, we can - what I like to do

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.960
is I like to add a little bit of glitter so
it has a nice sparkly look. So, first you

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.469
just kind of plan out where you want it. I'm
going to go ahead and put it a little bit,

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.580
not right in in the middle. I'm going to put
it right there. Just put down some glitter,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.400
and again this is optional, this is just going
to give it a nice little sparkly look. And

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.020
keep in mind once you have glitter on your
hands, it's going to be there for about 7

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.520
months so you better pick a color that you
like. We're going to turn over our transfer

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.270
and we're going to take our iron. You're going
to make sure that you don't have water in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.440
your iron. You cannot steam a transfer because
the liquid interferes with the transfer and

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:46.570
it won't stick. So, you're going to press
down and you're going to just press as hard

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.549
as you can. You're trying to get the color,
every nice little bit of color, and you're

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.740
trying to get it all onto your fabric. So,
you're going to press down as hard as you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.450
can and make circle motion. Wahla! There we
go!
