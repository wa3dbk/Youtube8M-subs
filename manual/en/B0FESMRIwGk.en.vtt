00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.230
Welcome to the Department of Education's performance tables website. Here you

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.509
can find the performance inflation for all schools and colleges in England, search for

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:13.429
a school and compare how it's doing with other schools in the area.

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:16.269
Let's have a look at a few of the functions. 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.479
If you're interested in, for example secondary,

00:00:19.479 --> 00:00:23.509
then type in your postcode and select the distance.

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.929
If you want to, you can list the schools in you local authority, or you can search for the

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:34.929
schools near where you live.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.560
In this example we have selected schools
within a one mile radius.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.830
Here you can see a list of your nearest schools on a map or in a table. The 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.250
different colors represent the type of school. 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.350
Now, let's have a look at the exam results.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.900
The first table shows the top line figures for our selection of schools.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.180
You can see how pupils in each school have performed in their exams for the last 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.290
four years.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.040
Because we have searched geographically, schools are listed by their distance from your

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.680
postcode. We can change this order by clicking on any of the columns.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.260
We have lots more information about the exam results:

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.620
for example, here we can see the average grade different groups of pupils

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.980
achieved in their exams.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.950
Now, let's see how they have performed in the English Baccalaureate.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.570
As you can see, there are several tables telling us about the school's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.220
performance and also how many pupils were entered for the subjects.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.930
Another new feature is the narrowing the gap tab.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.010
You can see how many disadvantaged children there are in each school and

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.799
how successful they have been in their exams.

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:54.040
There is also a tab to see how much the school is spending per pupil.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.010
The new performance tables website gives you more information than ever before

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.690
and the chance to compare your local schools and what is most important to you.
