00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.980
Welcome. In this video I would like to show a way
to prepare Matcha.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:15.530
There are already many videos on this topic,
but many of them contain small "errors" one can easily avoid.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:23.640
This doesn't mean that the way shown in this video is the only correct way of preparing matcha.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.340
You can prepare matcha quite casually, the
drinking is the important point, not the "ceremony"!

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:44.240
If you prepare matcha in a way that you can
drink it daily without too much hassle, it's really ok.

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:56.029
What you need for preparing matcha is a chasen (whisk)...

00:00:56.029 --> 00:01:05.029
...a chawan (bowl), in this case a raku pottery...

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:21.050
What isn't neccesary, but really helpful, is a 
chashaku (spoon for measurement).

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.590
And of course, the matcha itself. You can
see it here in a natsume.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:48.090
I already prepared some things, like soaking
the chasen in hot water, which with you can also warm up the bowl.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.510
After that, you pour the warm water away...

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:05.049
...and wipe the inside of the bowl with a
chakin ("tea towel") dry.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.020
What's really convenient if you're preparing
matcha for yourself is a little strainer.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:34.080
With a strainer you can sift the matcha every
time, avoiding lumps.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.720
As I mentioned in another video (see link),
lumps are the most horrible thing in matcha.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:54.360
So, how much matcha do you need per bowl?
Traditionally, it is said one heaped chashaku...

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:01.030
....and another, less heaped one, but that can
vary.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:11.590
But don't overdo it (or the opposite). Personally, I like two heaped chashaku.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:23.719
Now push the matcha through the strainer.
One important point about the strainer is that it should be round bellied.

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:40.019
Otherwise, a lot of matcha will remain in the strainer, as explained in another video (see link).

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:52.000
While preparing matcha, one should not be too
stiff about "what's right" or "what's wrong",

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.400
there are merely some corner points one should consider. The rest is how you like to do it.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:29.660
When the matcha was put into the bowl,
you need water. I use a hishaku (ladle) for that, which can contain about 100ml. [Correction: you pour only half the hishaku into the bowl, around 50-75ml]

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:43.130
Regarding the water, it is often said that you should use around 60Â°C hot water, but I can't confirm that.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:57.330
In the Urasenke tea school (Kyoto), hot, boiled
water is used. Before the water is entering the bowl, it will be already chilled down a little bit by the hishaku.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:26.120
Pouring the water into the bowl...
Regarding whisking the matcha, don't use your whole arm, only the wrist and move top down instead of a circle.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:54.880
You can start slowly, with a firm grip on
the bowl, while becoming faster and faster to dissolve the matcha powder and getting a fine foam.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:12.019
The chasen touches the ground slightly...
...and only after you think it's good enough, you raise the chasen to whisk only the surface to dissolve bigger bubbles.

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:21.319
At the end, you can make a circle like movement, going towards the center and then raise the chasen out of the bowl.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:38.689
In the best case you have a beautiful matcha with a foam without visible bubbles. Thanks a lot for watching! Have a nice matcha!
