00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:06.180
Now I'm going to do the crease of the eye.
Now this is the tricky part. I'm going to

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.769
use a dark gray that has kind of a silver
fleck to it. It's called print. It kind looks

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.970
like a news print color, so it's not as dark
as black, but it's still going to give a nice

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.040
deep smoky look and its going to look great
with the silver. I'm going to use a nice fluffy

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.240
crease brush, and I just put a little color
on the end. I'm going to go right into the

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.840
crease of the eye, little by little, adding
color. The crease of the eye is basically

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.769
the end of the eye, in a sideways "v", and
you just kind of want to fill it in. You don't

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.440
want to go too far into the eye. You only
want to go toward the middle of the eye and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
you want to keep it dark on the outside. And
you don't want to go too far up to the brow

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.550
either because you want to keep the brow,
underneath the brow highlighted. So, I'm just

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.330
going to, little by little, add color, a little
at a time until I get my desired look. This

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.230
is more of a nighttime look, so I'm going
to get a little more dramatic, but not too

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.150
crazy because the silver is already pretty
metallic and dramatic as it is. So we don't

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.830
want to add too much darkness, but we want
to accentuate the eye and make it look bigger

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:28.830
and wider, and a little more sexy and smoky
as well. Open. And see, you can already tell

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.031
how it's getting more sultry. But we don't
want to add too much color. We're going to

00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:38.550
keep it about at this. What I do want to do
it just add a tiny bit underneath the eye,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.362
just to give a little smokiness underneath
the eye as well. You don't want to do too

00:01:43.362 --> 00:01:46.280
much to the top of the eye without doing a
little on the bottom of the eye, otherwise

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.050
everything is going to be on top, and it's
not a very like smoky or sultry look. So that's

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.770
our crease. It's pretty much done.
