00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.933
Hello everyone!

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:08.733
The hero of our story for today is the American tier VI fighter, the F4U-1.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.267
Its precursor in the Tech Tree is the Grumman F4F Wildcat.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.967
The only thing the F4U-1 inherited from the F4F is the HVAR rockets.

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:24.467
It’s not because the F4F is so greedy,

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:31.667
but because the branch of American fighters starting with the F4U-1 becomes totally different, or more “Corsair-ish”.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:37.700
The characteristics of the F4U-1 are much better compared to its precursor.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.767
Durability, fire power, altitude performance, and speed — all these characteristics of the F4U-1 are better, even in its stock configuration.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:49.267
And they only get better on your way to top its configuration.

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:52.433
However, there is no one perfect configuration.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:59.833
For its great set of characteristics, the F4U-1 pays for it with a greater average time to turn 360 degrees.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.000
Now, let's compare the F4U-1 with the other tier VI fighters.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.167
Durability is the most prominent characteristic of Corsair.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:15.467
It has a considerable amount of hit points, especially with the top airframe mounted.

00:01:16.167 --> 00:01:21.433
Only the German Focke-Wulf 190A-5 can boast the same amount of hit points.

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.567
Speed is also great.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:32.467
Even in its cannon-equipped configuration, the Corsair is faster than most fighters, losing only to the P-51A and the Yak-1M.

00:01:32.867 --> 00:01:39.067
And the only aircraft that is able to break away from Corsair in its machine gun configuration is the Mustang.

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:42.467
The Corsair’s armament options are also quite good.

00:01:42.567 --> 00:01:47.733
Autocannon provide average damage for its tier, and their firing distance is quite good.

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:51.933
Machine guns should be used at close range and provide more dense fire.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:58.900
Whatever weapons configuration you choose, it won’t affect the tactics of flying the F4U-1 greatly.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:01.900
Manoeuvrability is not so great, though.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.633
In its autocannon configuration, Corsair turns 360 degrees just a little bit faster than the P-51A and the Focke-Wulf A-5.

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:15.900
This may not seem adequate enough, but manoeuvrability is not crucial for this aircraft.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.833
Now, let’s take a look at the things that are important and test Corsair in combat.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.933
So, we’re at the top of the list.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:32.767
This is great because a Corsair at the top is like a cruiser among sail boats.

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:36.700
At the start, you should climb to an altitude of about 2.5km.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:42.800
Gain speed and move towards the enemy forces together with a large group of allies.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.433
Essentially, the Corsair is what you would call a “free hunter”.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:52.300
It can successfully intercept both high-altitude aircraft and “boom-and-zoom” low-flying targets.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.967
The Corsair can even destroy ground targets.

00:02:55.067 --> 00:02:58.800
Just remember to maintain your airspeed and altitude.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:03.367
Hit and run tactics work best against light fighters.

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:10.467
You can either apply this against single targets or take down enemy aircraft that are busily engaged in a dogfight.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:12.233
Don’t forget to watch your back.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:19.400
If there’s a bunch of low-altitude manoeuvrable enemy aircraft clinging to your tail, gain altitude and keep rolling.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.333
You can easily break away from slower enemy aircraft due to your high speed.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.633
Heavy fighters are even easier to counter.

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:36.433
You have enough manoeuvrability to get behind an enemy heavy and your high speed won’t let them get away from the engagement area.

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:42.400
However, don’t try head-on attacks against heavy fighters or ground attack aircraft.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.800
You won’t be able to withstand their powerful autocannon.

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:52.567
Speaking of attack aircraft, they’re almost completely helpless against the F4U-1.

00:03:52.667 --> 00:03:57.033
You can easily dodge their fire, or break away in case of any danger.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:02.600
So, if there are no other targets, engage attack aircraft with little worry.

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.067
A few words about ground targets.

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:15.200
If you decide to carry bombs or rockets, you should first try to sneak into the enemy base flying at high altitude,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.200
release your weapons, then engage enemy aircraft.

00:04:20.267 --> 00:04:28.133
You can also use rockets to eliminate enemy attack aircraft and heavy fighters quickly, but it’s not an easy task.

00:04:29.433 --> 00:04:37.467
Usually, autocannon are enough to finish off already damaged ground targets and deprive the enemy of any advantage.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.567
Sometimes, you won’t be so lucky, and you will find your Corsair at the bottom of the list.

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:50.667
In this case, you shouldn’t try to play a role of free hunter.

00:04:50.767 --> 00:04:56.367
In this battle tier, enemy aircraft are more durable, and their weapons are more powerful.

00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:03.733
So, you should stay close to a large group of allied aircraft and attack those enemy aircraft that are already engaged in combat.

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:07.367
In general, your tactics will remain essentially the same.

00:05:07.467 --> 00:05:09.167
Let’s summarise:

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:13.067
The F4U-1 is definitely a great aircraft.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:19.300
It allows you to make a great contribution to victory in every battle, and you will enjoy flying it.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:27.100
Great characteristics create flexible tactics, allowing the F4U-1 to control many difficult situations.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.367
So, start your engines and good luck, Corsairs!
