00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.020
So what kind of beer is it that you specialize
in? Ah, German beer.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.220
And where are we right now? Fort Collins,
Colorado.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.460
Hey everyone! Dana here and today I'm hanging
out with Kirk Lombardi of Zwei Brewing, a

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.540
brewery here in Fort Collins, Colorado, that
specializes in German beer.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.720
Thank you so much for being here with me today,
Kirk.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.860
My pleasure. It's really cool to have you
both here and it's gonna be a good day.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.620
So my first question for you is: the Zwei
in Zwei Brewing, that's because you and your

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.540
brother started this, is that correct?

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.250
That's correct.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.270
And how long have you been here? We opened
last August, um, so we'll be a year old next month.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.860
Originally we were Zwei Brüder. - Okay. - Which
is "two brothers." We got into a little bit of trademark

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.240
problem with a brewery in Chicago called Two
Brothers in English. So now you're Zwei Brewing.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.480
Let's do a little tour!

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.120
Okay, so what are we looking at here?

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.220
Alright, so, over here's our brew house. It's
a ten barrel, which, ah, in German terms I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.180
think is about 12 hecto. Three vessel system;
mash ton, hot liquor tank, and brew kettle.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.860
And we keep it nice and dirty 'cause we kind
of like the look of that, that tarnished copper.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.280
Maybe clean it once a year or so. This system's
kind of designed to make lager beer. That's,

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.000
that's what we love around here, so that's
what we do.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.500
It seems like right now in America, German
beer is getting more popular. What do you

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.820
think is the reason for that? What makes it
so popular right now?

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.160
Um, I don't know. It's, well one, it's one
of the untouched niches that - Okay. - are out there.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.240
Two, it's just, you know, it's
the subtle simplicity, I guess you could say

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.660
of German beer. It's just really simple, straight
forward, easy drinking, sessiony, you know.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.950
I think in the past, Americans only really
got imported German beer. - Uh-huh.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.740
And, ah, whenever that beer travels that far it gets
kind of damaged. - Okay, yeah. - So when you

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.040
taste a fresh product, it's really a whole
different world. - Gotcha. Gotcha.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.080
These tanks right here are kind of special.
You don't see those too much in American breweries.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.760
They're horizontal lagering tanks, and they're
designed to help produce those lager beers.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.500
So they lay on the side because it helps allow
more contact with the yeast with the beer,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.940
and helps that long maturation phase lager beers need.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.580
How long does it take for the beer to go from
start to finish, coming out the tap?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.260
Um, good question. So, it's kind of based
on the strength of the beer. - Okay.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.740
Most of our, like, our sessiony weight beers like Pilsner
or Helles are about six weeks. - Okay.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.540
And then if we're getting into, like, Doppelbock
or Märzen or something like that, it's, it

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.900
can be eight to twelve weeks.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.180
Okay. And as for the ingredients; are those
from America from Europe? Where do you get

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.280
the ingredients from?

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.140
We use entirely German ingredients - Wow!
Okay. - in our beer. Except for the water, of course.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.100
Predominantly we use a company
called Weyermann Malt. It's in Bamberg.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.580
But, ah, we do use some other stuff. But, um, yeah,
so all the malted barley's from Germany.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.280
Our hops are contracted out of Hallertauer region.
- Okay! - And then we use a lager strain from

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.209
monastery cloister called Andechs.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.369
Oh yeah, of course, we know that. That's just
a little bit out of Munich. - Yeah, yeah. - Cool.

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:27.889
It's a really cool place.

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.240
Ah, so this is the, the malt storage area.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.800
And all this came from Germany?

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.819
It's all German except for this little pile
right here. - Okay. This is Canadian for our

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.699
American beers, but ah... - Okay.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.600
And what then initially got you and your brother
interested in making German beer?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:54.100
Well, we both took a trip over to Munich and
Austria and I think we were already into

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.380
making German beer before that, but that was
kind of the ah-ha moment. - Uh-huh. Okay.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.400
We kind of both fell in love with the styles - Yeah. - and, I guess, culture and all that,

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.120
so it was a - Okay. - just a, something we thought
would be fun to do.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.360
And then you came back here and you said, "Okay, we're gonna do it. We're gonna make this happen."

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.740
Yeah. We worked for another brewery for about
twenty years - Okay. - making all types of

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.340
different beers, but our, whenever we had the
opportunity we would make a German beer.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.120
And those are the beers we've won medals for and
had a lot of success with so.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:35.990
So I've got my cheat-sheet here. I'm starting
with the Helles. That's Munich style golden lager.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.160
Tastes pretty authentic.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.560
I need my sorbet. This isn't going to be very
scientific.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.100
Okay, that's my favorite so far.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.720
Mr. German Man confirmed the authenticity
of the Helles and said that that one was his favorite.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.120
Thanks so much for being here with me today.
It was a pleasure to have you. Thanks for

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.220
showing me around, thank you. - It was cool. - And for the beer of course.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.760
Thank you so much for watching. All links
to Zwei Brewing down in the description below.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.700
Be sure to go and check them out. Until next
time, auf Wiedersehen!

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.060
We try to keep true to the German purity,
beer purity law.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.660
Yeah, this Reinheitsgebot. - Yeah. Good. - So
what is that and, so you, you keep to it then?

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:30.560
As best as you can.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:39.100
We, we do. Um, so, basically, my understanding
of it is, you know, it's water, malt, hops.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:45.100
Originally yeast wasn't involved but, and
yeast, so - Yeah. - that means you can't add,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:51.680
like, CO2 to the beer. - Okay. - We have to
use naturally carbonated beer. You can't add

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.220
chemicals or clarifying agents to the beer.
Um it's all, you know, straight forward pretty

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.920
simple stuff. - Yeah very cool. Also no blueberries
in your beer or anything like that. - No fruit.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:07.540
Yeah. - Yeah, we dabble in some American
styles too, but, yeah, for the German stuff

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.270
we keep true to style. - That's awesome. Very
cool. - Yeah.
