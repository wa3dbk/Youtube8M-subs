00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.939
Hello Everyone, this is Rachelle and it is
review time.

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.630
Ok, today we're going to talk

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.900
about some snacks alright snackage for the
new year here is a Graze Box.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.539
You can find
this graze box at graze.com it is a snack

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.260
box with more nutritious options for you ok

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.820
a little bit better than Doritos and Cheetos
and all that.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.310
Obviously, that's not nutritious.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.580
But it's not quite you know greens and salad
either and you know it's hard to go from Doritos

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.880
to Salad it really is.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.940
So I'm going to help
you gradually get there and what I am showing

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.480
you today, is an option for you.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.220
They also
provide two options where you can just have

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.600
all types of varieties of snacks coming to
you, again it is a subscription service.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600
You

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.670
can get all different types of snacks or if
you're really trying to bear down they have

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.100
the low calorie option where you can get snackage
from anywhere from 50 to 150 calories ok so

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.940
they have something like that if you're really
trying to get it goin but like I said this

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.480
is a more of a gradual step to like whole
foods that these types of things and like

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.530
I say it's not like apples and oranges here
these are snacks ok but like I said they don't

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.350
have any crap in them YouOpen the box

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.970
up and it looks like this, I like the little
graphic they have here even though there's

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.360
no berries or nothing in here, um but it does
have this nice little picture of it.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.360
Gives

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.530
you the idea that you're eating something
nutritious and good for your body right um

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.990
and then it has these little snacking situations
little um I don't know little dips and cuts

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.270
in these boxes, I believe this box is made
from recycled paper, it's not a very um honestly

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.210
not a very substantial box um but it's I mean
you know I appreciate that it's made from

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:41.000
recycled paper look underneath, which I really
love, you know I love this kind of stuff,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.729
it's go like the grass graphic in there and
also if I didn't say so this is a UK based

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.850
company ok people just kind of got together
and got tired of eating chips and Doritos

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.570
all day basically I think they have Doritos
over there but you know what I mean like the

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.590
crap snacks so they got together and with
a nutritionist by the way a nutritionist named

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.951
Jess I believe her name is to make sure that
you're getting everything that you need in

00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:05.299
here, you can get you some fiber and some
protein and vitamis and all that kinda stuff

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:12.540
again non of the crap foods, no GMOs, no artificial
flavors, colors, no trans fats and one more

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.480
it's another one they didn't have I can't
remember no high frutose corn syrup ok so

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.280
thank you Jess for that.So I'm going to be
testing these out and seeing how they actually

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.090
taste because you know that's all well and
good but does it taste?

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.090
Alright so here we

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.090
go.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.860
The first one is called Turtle Pie then
I have Honey Comb FlapJack then I have some

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.200
popcorn, again non GMO so thank you very much,
and then I have some Banana Caramel Dippers.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.121
Here's what the turtle pie snack looks like,
okay I hope that you can get an idea and kind

00:02:40.121 --> 00:02:44.510
of see that there, they look like cookies,
I don't know, oh some sunflower seeds are

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.030
in here yeah ok now this is something I want
to forewarn you about when you get natural

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.690
type snacks, they don't quite look (laughs)
they don't quite look appealing all the time

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.900
and you'll find that when you start eating
natural or when you're eating vegetables it's

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.150
a bit different but you know what I'm saying
ok there's no frilly no you know tiger on

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.420
the front you know they look a little dusty
ok? but it's real food.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.660
We have actual food

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.720
here so anyway we're going to test that out
and see but like I said there's none of the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.420
crap in it to make it look glossy or shiny
or anything like that ok so just clean snackage.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.990
And I like that you don't have to you know
get a jackhammer to open it up, you know some

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.740
of those plastic containers are you just pull
it on apart alright so here we go.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.740
OK I'm

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:45.130
going to take me a couple or at least a handful
(inaudable) this is kind of what it looks

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.130
like here.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.130
I hope you can see.

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.130
alright.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.130
Delicous-
this cannot be healthy (laughing) this tastes

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.130
exactly like a candy bar.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.130
I'm gone have to
check on this one.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.130
These are delicious ok

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.720
so I think you have the option to choose your
snacks.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.540
Get the turtle pie one this is really

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.460
really good it has fiber in there so that's
good it's got a gram of fiber, nine grams

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.720
of sugar, and four grams of protein, so it's
a good source of protein so that's good it's

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.540
also a good source of um magenese um forty-one
percent um copper thirteen percent iron six

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.119
percent calcium two percent, vitamin c two
percent so there are some benefits here ok

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:21.940
so like i said if you're concerned about the
calories and stuff like that there's a slim

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.039
box or I'm probably saying that all wrong
a skinny box.

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.210
Let's go on to the honeycom

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.210
snack.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.089
Ok, now this says, rustic rolled oat
flapjack with honeycomb and chocolate drizzle,

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:38.559
more chocolate so I guess like I said it's
a sweet situation here this would be a great

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:43.419
option too I feel like to bring to the movies
and stuff like that or just take em and just

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:46.229
have one in your purse everyday for work after
you finish your lunch or whatever, you know

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.229
what I'm saying?

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.180
Well anyway I feel like these
are more well at least these snacks are more

00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:01.069
like desert options so anyway...umm smells
good.

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.110
Ummm.This is delicious!

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.189
What does this

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:12.139
taste like, it taste like a granola, this
is delicous, ummm!

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.300
So ok Get these! (laughing)

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.800
Get these alright?

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.939
Umm Humm (chewing) Delicious,
that is really really good you can taste the

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:31.240
honey, and the oats and it tastes clean, you
know what I mean there's no, that funny little

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.939
bite a the end where you know it's something
artificial it tastes like clean food.

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:35.939
The

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.930
texture is not what you're gonna be used to
as far as what a granola bar texture where

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.900
it's all stuck together and hard.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.169
It's chewy
and it's soft but it still has- it's delicious.

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.710
I think I like that one the best twenty nine
grams of carbs a lot of carbs hear but ok

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:57.210
it's oats um let's see, sixteen grams of sugar,
oh a lot of sugar in here but it's honey,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.300
and lets see three grams of protein ok so
then it also has ten percent vitamin A of

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.360
your daily amount of vitamin A, two percent
of you daily amount of calcium and six percent

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.629
iron so like I said its not like you just
eating sugar guys there's something to all

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:11.629
of this.

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:12.680
I don't know if you want me to read
all the rest of these.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680
They have this graze

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.889
popping corn here that I don't I'm not gone
sit and pop this, I mean I love popcorn, I

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.379
know I'm gonna love it and I love my popcorn
with um pepper and salt and olive oil and

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:29.229
nutritional yeast and it is so delicious trust
me and that's what this is.

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:30.229
It says Graze

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.400
Popping corn and it says twist of black pepper.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.490
Put the black pepper on your popcorn next

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.809
time you pop some and kinda do it like I told
you, it's delicous.

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:39.129
So I know this is gonna

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:40.860
work so obviously, you know I'm not gone pop
that.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:42.550
The last one we have here is going to

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.149
be the banana caramel dippers.

00:06:44.149 --> 00:06:48.159
Um kay this
is what this looks like ok hopefully you can

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:54.849
get a good view of that (smelling package)
umkay.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:55.849
alright.

00:06:55.849 --> 00:06:57.779
Umkay, alright (laughing and

00:06:57.779 --> 00:07:03.310
smelling) smells just like bananas I love
bananas I have bananas every day um let's

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.919
see I'm going to dip it in a little caramel
sauce and see what we get (smelling) it's

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:15.289
something else I'm picking up I can't quite
put my finger on it but here we go.

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.659
Umhmm.

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:28.330
I'm going to try this without the caramel
sauce let's see.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.679
I see why they added the

00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:30.679
sauce it can be a little dry.

00:07:30.679 --> 00:07:33.879
It's good but
it's not like something I would go buy.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:34.879
The

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:37.849
rest of them I actually would purchase those
and the popcorn I have popcorn all the time

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:39.879
non GMO Organic popcorn but anyway.

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:42.199
Overall
I'd say this is a go these are good snacks

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.129
I like them I enjoyed them and like I said
use that discount code and get your first

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:47.539
box for free and test it out yourself.

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:50.250
Graze.com
is an option for you I'm bringing it to you,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.689
I have my stamp of taste approval it was quite
delicious.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:55.289
Let me know if you guys have any

00:07:55.289 --> 00:07:56.289
questions comments or concerns.

00:07:56.289 --> 00:07:58.589
I hope you've
enjoyed this honest review as always and I'll
