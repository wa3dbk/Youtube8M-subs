00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.750
On behalf of Expert Village my name is Jim
Dufresne, I'm here to tell you about the ebow

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.350
and here's the different parts. See that little
blue EDLED it has a channel that the string

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:23.070
that is driven resides in. And there's two
string guides in each side so that fits on

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:31.320
there like that, see where that LED is it's
driven that string. The LED isn't driving

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.149
the string it's an electric magnetic force
inside the unit that strives the string. The

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:52.999
LED access, the guide and I can switch from
string to string cause I have string guides

00:00:52.999 --> 00:01:03.600
and the outside string take more of a challenge
to master the technique. Because there's only

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:13.230
one string guide it has a two position switch;
one for the fundamental harmony, and one for

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:53.470
the upper harmonic. See there's the fundamental
and you can make your notes swell and volume,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:06.700
you can control the volume by getting it close
to the pick up. Then you can back it up a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:30.410
little bit like that you can let it rise up,
can you see that, and you can control how

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.989
much strive you want. You can add some brightness
to that pick up and changes character completely.
