00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.920
You've heard of the human genome

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.920
the whole enchilada of genetic information that's encoded

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.340
in our DNA. But it's more than just genes. It's full of clues

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.780
to our evolutionary history - our relationships to other animals

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.120
and a bunch of stuff that we still haven't figured out.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.320
The key ingredients to out DNA are 4 chemicals:

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.120
Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.160
These are called bases and they pair up together

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.440
to form long chains of base pairs.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.080
And the orders of A's, T's, C's and G's is super important

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.540
because it dictates whether an organism is a human or a hagfish or something else.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.180
Back in 1990, a bunch of scientists decided that if they

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.360
could figure out the exact sequence of all of the

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.920
base pairs of the human genome, they could cure all of the diseases.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.100
So, they started the human genome project.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.500
And researched from over 20 countries worked

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.120
for thirteen years to do it, and when they were done

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.880
thay sat back and were like ehh?

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.300
Because, don't get me wrong, there were surprises.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.320
but they were a little less like "Surprise!" surprises

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.500
and a little more like "Oh... didn't expect that" kind of surprises.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.400
First, it turns out that the human genome has a lot fewer genes

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.400
...(that is, sequences that actually code for proteins that make and do stuff) than anybody expected.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.400
So I got my biochemistry degree in 2002. Long time ago, I recognise

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.180
...but not that long ago, and my biology textbook when I was in school said

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.700
that there were between 80,000 and 100,000 protein coding genes in the human genome.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.840
And that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.980
was wrong.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.580
Really wrong. There are fewer than 30,000 - some less complex animals have more than that

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.460
like a water flea has 31,000.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.520
The second surprise: not only do we have fewer genes than we thought

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.460
but they only make up like 2% of our genome.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.680
The project scientists politely refer to the rest as 'non-coding' DNA

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.260
which meant they had no idea what the Watson and Crick it was for.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.840
A third sorta lame surprise is that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.800
sequencing our genome hasn't helped us cure cancer or anything

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.660
which leads geneticists to conclude that our DNA is not the only thing that calls the shots when it comes

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.280
to how our bodies work.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.520
But the human genome project has definitely changed the way that we study genetics.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
It's given rise to functional and comparative genomics

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.460
fields that study the function of genes and how our genome compares to that of other species

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.220
and this new research has led scientists to discover that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.560
a lot of the non-coding DNA in our genome has good reasons for being there.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.900
For instance, it turns out that a lot of our DNA came

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.920
from viruses that invaded our ancestors' bodies thousands of years ago

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.020
and their genes just got stuck there.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.120
Unable to evolve and unable to re-infect their hosts.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.560
Was just like weird... virus DNA.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.020
Also, some our DNA contains instructions for making body parts that we don't even have any more.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.220
Like our genome hasn't phased out the instructions for growing a tail.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.720
During embryonic development

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.780
we no longer get the go-ahead to actually grow one

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.740
but the directions for making one are still there.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:53.020
So a lot of what we once thought was junk DNA is probably code for stuff that we just don't have any more.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.560
So we're living in an exciting time to study genetics

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.540
and I haven't even talked about epigenetics

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.920
which is crazy

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.860
and some new research into evolutionary developmental biology

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.520
which we did a whole Crash Course episode on.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.620
And it's all thanks (in part) to having sequenced the human genome.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.120
