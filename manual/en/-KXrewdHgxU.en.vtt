00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.270
Ever wonder why it was the fish that became such
an important symbol in the Christian

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.779
church and uh...

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:13.039
not something like uh...

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.880
flaming tiger head that spit swords?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.189
Well, you are in luck because we are talking about the sign of the fish on

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:21.609
this episode

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.970
of Chuck Knows Church

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:29.970
Hey, wait up buddy. [fun intro music]

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.480
Since I was a kid in church I remember
hearing so many references to fish

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
like in the Gospels when Jesus said, "I
will make you fishers of men".

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
Or when the disciples got stuck with
only five loaves and two fish to feed

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.040
thousands

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.790
Jesus made it happen.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.530
And weren't the first disciples fishermen?

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.970
Peter, Andrew, James, and John.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.250
So no surprise how the fish, or more
specifically the sign of the fish became

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.670
a way for Christians to identify each other.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.180
You see, after the tome was found empty and Jesus
was resurrected it wasn't always safe

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.720
to go around town as a follower of Christ.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.770
Believers were ridiculed and persecuted

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.240
and in the beginning

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.980
non-believers far outnumbered the Christians.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.670
So to make sure it was safe to talk about
Jesus and the Good News, the sign of the

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.270
fish became a sort of

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.360
a secret handshake for strangers.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.300
See, ghe first stranger might simply draw a
line on the ground

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.560
kinda like this.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.780
Which could then be completed with the
second line drawn by another person.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.540
Kind of like this. Indicating a fish or

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.840
"Hey, I'm a Christian too".

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.500
Not to be confused with

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.000
"Hey, wanna go to Red Lobster?"

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.820
And if they are at risk of being exposed
as Christians it could be erased just

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.100
as fast.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.120
All clear.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.949
See ya on down the road good buddy.

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.389
Just two Christians

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.670
making a connection with the sign of
the fish long before the invention of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.529
the bumper decal.

00:02:21.529 --> 00:02:22.959
Now if you want to learn more

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.409
ask your pastor

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.600
Tell 'em Chuck sent ya.
