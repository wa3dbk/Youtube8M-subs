00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.850
What makes a great slogan?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.860
Well the first question you should ask yourself
is, do I even need a slogan?

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.760
40 years ago, the slogan was the backbone
of the ad business.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.570
Advertising meant just repeating a slogan
over and over.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.940
"What a wonderful sight, when your wash is
done.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:33.860
The cleanest clean under the sun is Tide Clean,
New Tide Clean"

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.269
This "sloganeering" was the foundation of
most advertising.

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:39.269
"Nice hair.

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.530
Head and shoulders, for people who don't worry
about dandruff, but ought to."

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.920
This old clip from 70s comedy "Bewitched"
shows how advertising was done back then.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.449
"Picture this.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:01:00.180
Uh, a pretty model, wearing your reducilator,
hovering over her head is the good fairy.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:08.040
And underneath, the slogan...Fly now, reduce
alator.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.320
I like it.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.250
You know something, it just grabbed me!"

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.720
Marketing problems all solved!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.140
Unfortunately, this old strategy is still
in use today.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.330
Companies think that simply repeating a clever
slogan is the same thing as branding.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.890
"Joy, with natural citrus extracts.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.650
Put a little Joy in your life!"

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.810
A slogan is not a brand.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.600
A brand is a feeling, and the slogan's job
is to encapsulate that feeling.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.540
In this ad, Right Guard brands with the feeling
of daring &amp; adventure...

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:57.420
"Let's see how new right guard extreme cool
spray keeps you cool under the most extreme

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.420
conditions.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.420
Cool spray keeps you cool and dry, no matter
what's going down!

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
Yea, wooooo.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
Get extreme, get right guard"
"Get Extreme, get Right Guard" neatly wraps

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.390
up the feeling of what their brand is all
about.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.220
Home Depot's brand is the feeling of empowerment,
and their slogan showcases that feeling too.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.819
"Let's take a vow.

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.870
You can do it, we can help"
Now contrast those two good examples with

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.280
this slogan for an eye care center.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.939
"Horizon eye care, we share your vision"
So what exactly does that slogan mean?

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.269
It's just a pun that has nothing to do with
the feeling of their brand.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.290
So remember, it's okay to have a slogan, but
make sure that slogan isn't just a branding

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.290
cop-out.

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.939
Great slogans will showcase a deep emotional
connection with your customers.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:03:00.129
I'm Graeme Newell and that's emotional marketing.
