uh... visit short clip in the beginning
you sorry about what he did go to

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.070
vietnam which makes me laugh and laugh

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.820
like dick cheney said he and other prior
indosat uh... other prior to having it

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.470
shot up would be about

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.640
and come too late ah... said that all
the minorities to the spots or through a

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.730
lot

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.329
rush limbaugh said he'd a cyst on his
ass that's why couldn't go i'm naked

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.930
again of course as with all the right
wing cowards roger ailes didn't go to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.440
vietnam even though he's always been pro
or he walked to the nixon administration

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.850
try to get makes every elected

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.600
his part parcel

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.890
so now he's a toddler vietnam and then
go back to you see what he says about

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.130
afghanistan that's what remember

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.970
vietnam you know my best friend was
killed in that war

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.000
um...

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.730
it was too old for it i tried to fly i
couldn't get into that

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.440
life as i say even right when i was in
my early twenty then by the time i was

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.310
twenty five i was out of range of the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.450
draft and sofa soft uh... at twenty but
i know a lot of people who were and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.920
uh...

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.720
i didn't think they escalate

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.670
four hundred thousand more troops
warranted anna

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.430
jungle that i didn't know what we're
gonna win

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.500
you know it's a little bit like a yes
they are right now and i understand the

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.290
nuclear issue but

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.750
but there is a problem when you send
people into war

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.560
uh... you have to tell them what they're
trying to win

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.020
meals

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.890
the head of fox news

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.420
is against desolation afghanistan

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.020
that's news to me meant i couldn't tell
by watching his network yesterday i'm

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.280
sure

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.380
you know what the reality is he'll allow
the vietnam

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.749
he didn't have to go

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:54.969
i know a lot of people that went i'll
relatives are some of your best friends

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:55.920
black

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.370
okay so much for the vietnam a guy
killed by didn't but that's because but

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.509
that was to alos about early twenties

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.540
an itemized site issues that i felt like
flying but i couldn't quite fly and then

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.249
a twenty-five obviously michael really
twenty five

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:11.079
bodies went

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.409
okay anyway

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.959
uh...

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.129
sought excuses but then you want to
mention administration who as this the

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.719
war in vietnam

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:22.019
that's no problem

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.469
but though he was against it

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.939
then during the bush years g_m_ roger
ailes speaking out against afghanistan

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:28.769
war

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.619
or escalation around

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.279
or escalation that this is you know if i
didn't hear that effect whatever i turn

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:39.139
on the fox news which he runs and they
sent notes from the executives we have

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.250
at leaked memos of the executives

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.159
saying in their user group decided in a
cover up

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.499
there and what they have a couple things
up but since

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.499
did you have been saying about all that
we should discuss as couldn't have been

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:52.709
sent

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.809
but now after they got all bata as they
did not get to the point point was

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.439
is that all bombing of the week

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.389
or call a colossal article yet as i want
to tell you that

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.329
if you know that's what happens if he
does it

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.290
and it helped residences

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.709
helena why were escalating in
afghanistan

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.399
now as they relate that were that

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:14.769
okay we waited a couple of days the
sunday talk about afghanistan right for

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.049
the exact opposite thing that we claim
that just a couple weeks ago

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.869
let's go

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:21.279
so that's nice

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:23.389
roger ailes previewing

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:29.269
uh... what's coming up on fox news a
couple weeks couple months sir

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.859
they have no shame they don't care okay
that was exactly opposite what they said

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.069
before

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.919
video whose novels account

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.759
what other guys

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.890
what c_n_n_ up

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.049
but other resort is a sense that i told
anybody to help

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.709
they've sort of uh... you don't listen
to what we say and we say it's that bad

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.679
idea long enough to turn golf however

00:03:49.679 --> 00:03:52.499
everybody's talking about how it's a bad
idea that's good that dennis and we

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:58.099
don't know whether stores are let's talk
about that

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:02.849
uh... yet or maybe roger ailes a real
liberal and i did not

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.479
if you know you work for nixon and
george h w bush in every election

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:07.720
campaigns

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.559
and was one of the propaganda queue for
the republican party

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:15.049
and it's been a bit better foxtons this
entire time for ninety six are for when

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.009
they start

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.910
but maybe deep inside his gelatinous
heart

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.280
uh... roger ailes thinks i'm and i wish
we can go to any of these wars

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.250
uh...

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.889
you believe that
