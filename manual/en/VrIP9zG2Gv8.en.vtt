Hi, my name is Mike Sanders and I'm going
to talk to you a little about how to buy a

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.130
long board, what you're looking for, what
you want to see. The thing about long boards

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.099
is they're not really meant for thrashing
left and right like you see in the you know,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.940
the pro circuit. They're more for cruising,
more for style, more for hot dogging like

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.710
they used to be in the old days. So right
here what I got is a nine foot two inch single

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.130
fin. This is my baby, I love it. It cruises
nice, it can cut back, it can hold a rail.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.820
It's a good board overall. If you're looking
for something that can keep you cruising and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.809
keep you having fun, it'll be something like
this. What you see in this long board is there's

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.249
not too much bend in the whole thing. What
you can see in some rocker as we call it,

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:45.030
is the bend of the board in the nose and a
little bit in the tail. That helps for turning

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.230
off the tail when you're up on the nose. It
helps you hold in your whole rail to the side

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.960
of the wave. For long boards you really, depending
on the kind of long boarding you want to do,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.100
there's high performance long boarding where
they have, you know three fins, two small

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.910
ones, one big one, what we call a thruster
set up. And that will really hold you in to

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.980
the wave and if you want to, you know long
board big waves like they do in Hawaii, that's

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.630
something you're going to want to say on it.
It'll hold you in to the waves real good.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.230
But for something like this, if you want to
cruise you gotta get nice round rails or you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.040
know, half round, half down, and more what
you're really looking for is rounder rails

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.760
in the front, which keeps you smooth and it
suctions in to the wave as you're riding it,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.030
when you're up there, when you're weights
up there. And you want more down rails in

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.080
the rear right here. You can feel they're
a little more knifey. They drop down a little

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.200
bit more from the top. When your weights back
here it helps you push off of the wave and

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.250
helps your board turn around to control it
where you want it. For me, I'm about five

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.690
eleven, one sixty, nine foot two is really
good for me. Some people like longer boards

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.659
just because they're so much easier to get
in to. But you really want to look for is

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.530
does the board keep you above the water and
is it enough for you to keep in control. If

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.680
I were to go out in the surf with a twelve
foot board I'd have a hard time you know,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.210
running back to the tail and leaning the whole
thing to turn it. So you really don't want

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.850
to you know, put too much work in to it. This
is you know, this is a good length for me

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.230
but it really depends on your height and your
weight; keeps you afloat, what you feel comfortable

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.060
with surfing on. And that's pretty much how
to choose a long board.
