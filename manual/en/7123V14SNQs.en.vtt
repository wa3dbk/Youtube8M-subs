00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.468
- Will we get rid of money in the future,

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:05.218
or is that illogical?

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:09.389
(dramatic techno music)

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:13.707
It probably comes as no
surprise to you guys that

00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:16.338
Leonard Nimoy was a hero of mine.

00:00:16.338 --> 00:00:18.541
He was an intelligent, charming,

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.325
compassionate, and funny man,

00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:23.130
and his performance as Mr. Spock

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.090
created an icon in science fiction,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.006
so I thought,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:28.410
"What better way to honor his memory

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.840
than to ask a very Star Trek Question:

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.808
In the future, will we have money?"

00:00:33.808 --> 00:00:36.129
You see, when Gene
Roddenberry created Star Trek,

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.299
he envisioned a future where
money was not necessary.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:41.279
We had replicators that
could make pretty much

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:43.385
anything we wanted, when we wanted it,

00:00:43.385 --> 00:00:46.323
and a seemingly limitless
supply of energy,

00:00:46.323 --> 00:00:49.238
so in that world, money
really didn't mean anything.

00:00:49.238 --> 00:00:50.655
And let's go a step further,

00:00:50.655 --> 00:00:53.557
while we didn't really see
very much of it in Star Trek,

00:00:53.557 --> 00:00:56.911
I imagine our future is going
to be filled with robots,

00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:59.458
and these robots are going
to take over more and more

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.013
of the tasks that we humans used to do.

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:03.809
Which, leads to the question:

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.835
what are we going to do?

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:07.134
I mean, in a Star Trek future

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.600
where all of our needs can
be met instantaneously,

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.361
it's not so much of a problem,

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.938
and in fact, in Star Trek: First Contact,

00:01:13.938 --> 00:01:16.202
Picard tells a 21st century woman,

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:18.152
that in the 24th century,

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:20.401
the acquisition of wealth is no longer

00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:22.421
a driving force for humanity,

00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:24.644
so what is the driving force?

00:01:24.644 --> 00:01:26.206
Well, Roddenberry's vision said

00:01:26.206 --> 00:01:28.632
that once we free ourselves
of these obligations,

00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:30.541
we can pursue our dreams,

00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:33.543
the things that give us
satisfaction and fulfillment,

00:01:33.543 --> 00:01:36.527
like self-improvement, and
satisfying our curiosity,

00:01:36.527 --> 00:01:37.460
and exploration,

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.734
and we can still do tasks
that bring us pleasure,

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:42.117
that a robot could easily do,

00:01:42.117 --> 00:01:44.172
like gardening and cooking,

00:01:44.172 --> 00:01:47.702
and I think I want to live in that future.

00:01:47.702 --> 00:01:50.800
Now it's time for us
to think like Mr. Spock

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.336
and apply some logic to the situation.

00:01:53.336 --> 00:01:55.926
So first, let's consider the replicator.

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:58.258
In Star Trek, they could
create pretty much anything,

00:01:58.258 --> 00:02:01.370
building it atom by atom, instantaneously.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.303
In the real world, this is similar to

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:06.350
a couple of concepts
proposed by K. Eric Drexler,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.574
which included molecular assemblers

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:10.709
and molecular manufacturing,

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.943
and here's the good news, it works.

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:14.999
We could make a molecular assembler,

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:16.550
for something really specific,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.050
like building a protein chain.

00:02:20.788 --> 00:02:21.639
But here's the bad news,

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:25.314
we can't and we might
never be able to build

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:28.704
a molecular assembler that
could create anything.

00:02:28.704 --> 00:02:29.537
So in the future,

00:02:29.537 --> 00:02:31.571
you might be able to
get that protein chain,

00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:34.440
but you probably won't be
able to get that cup of tea.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.229
Secondly, that limitless
energy is a really tall order.

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.975
Now, if we ever perfect nuclear fusion,

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:43.896
that could lead to an energy surplus,

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.480
which would be great news.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.201
Third, resource scarcity
isn't always the problem.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:51.633
Sometimes the problem is logistics.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:53.683
Getting food and water and medicine to

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:56.165
people who need it sometimes is difficult,

00:02:56.165 --> 00:03:00.185
even if we have plentiful
supplies elsewhere in the world.

00:03:00.185 --> 00:03:01.433
But here's the good news,

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:05.137
the silver lining in all
this gloom I'm laying down.

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:09.305
I think most of these
problems are totally solvable.

00:03:09.305 --> 00:03:11.847
They just require willpower and energy,

00:03:11.847 --> 00:03:14.906
and for the time being, money.

00:03:14.906 --> 00:03:18.677
But as we edge closer to
that post-scarcity world,

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:20.844
as robots take on more of the labor

00:03:20.844 --> 00:03:22.563
that used to take up all our time,

00:03:22.563 --> 00:03:25.988
and frees us up to pursue our dreams,

00:03:25.988 --> 00:03:28.815
maybe we'll find ourselves
asking the question:

00:03:28.815 --> 00:03:31.532
does money mean anything anymore?

00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:34.782
(dramatic piano music)

00:03:37.958 --> 00:03:39.937
I've got a question
for you guys this week.

00:03:39.937 --> 00:03:41.654
Do you think in the far future,

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.258
money is still going to be around,

00:03:43.258 --> 00:03:44.889
or is it going to disappear?

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.873
Let me know your thoughts
in the comments below,

00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:49.028
and make sure you explain
your answer to me,

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.230
I'm really curious.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.266
