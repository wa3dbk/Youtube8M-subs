00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.370
Hi, my name is Ritu, and welcome to my channel,
Indulgent Fuel.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.810
Today we're going to be making a watermelon
and feta salad.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.309
I had this for the first time last summer,
at the Surf Lodge, in Montauk, and I was obsessed

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:14.309
with it.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.220
So obsessed that the very next day I went
back to get lunch there and got the exact

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.220
same salad!

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.199
I just couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.250
Anyway, so I had to reverse engineer the recipe
so that I could have this whenever I wanted

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.570
it without having to go far and wide.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.180
So here we go, let's get started.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.339
To make 1 generous portion of this salad,
you'll need all of these ingredients.

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.230
The exact amounts can be found in the description
box below.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.010
So, you will need:
Mint, watermelon, onion, balsamic vinegar,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.960
arugula, light feta cheese, extra virgin olive
oil, some brown sugar or turbinado sugar,

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.949
salt, and freshly ground pepper.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.299
Let me just show you how I've prepped the
various items for my salad.

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.359
So watermelon, I just cut them into medium
or big sized chunks.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.160
The onion, into these rings, just like that.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.790
And I've cut the mint into thin strips, also
known as chiffonading, for those of you that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.370
are food snobs.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.400
And then the feta cheese, that's about how
much I'm using, and I'm just going to use

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.660
my fingers and break this up into crumbles.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.750
Let's go to the stove and I'll show you how
I make my dressing.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.430
Here I have a small nonstick skillet on medium
heat.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.200
To this, I'm just going to eyeball and add
a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:49.500
And to that, I'm going to add some salt, and
some freshly ground pepper, and then the brown

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.170
sugar.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.450
And this is just going to take a couple minutes
- we just want it to thicken up a little bit.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.229
And that will be our vinaigrette.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.229
Easiest vinaigrette!

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810
And it's going to be so tasty.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.340
A little tart from the balsamic vinegar, a
little sweet from the brown sugar, a little

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:16.609
kick of freshly ground pepper - it's going
to be amazing!

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:21.900
It's perfect, let's take it out.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.340
And definitely take it out before you think
it's done, because it thickens up as it cools

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.480
down as well.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.260
So, just going to take it out now.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.489
OK, so let's put this all together.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.359
So, some arugula, right in the middle of the
plate.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:53.269
Then, the watermelon goes right on top like
that, interspersed with some onions, some

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.219
more watermelon.

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:58.129
We're not going for perfection here, we want
it to look homemade.

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.049
So, just like that.

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.290
Some more onions.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.390
Rest of the watermelon.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.670
This is a big salad - it is definitely an
entree salad, a good generous portion.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.909
And then, we're going to add the feta cheese,
just like that.

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:21.280
Look how pretty it looks, and inviting.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.409
It smells just so like summer already.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.300
The mint leaves, just like that.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.829
And then, you know what, I'll be right back,
I'll wipe my hands - they're all cheesy, bleh.

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:46.129
The balsamic vinegar - see how thick it is,
you can actually do that, it's like a ribbon.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
Wow!

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.519
Look at that salad.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.779
Then finally, I want it to shine a little
on top, so I'm just going to add a little

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:58.209
bit of extra virgin olive oil.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.849
We are done!

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.109
You know how sometimes, certain music and
fragrances have the ability to transport you

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.000
to a different place and time.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.969
This recipe does that to me - I feel like
I'm back at the Surf Lodge eating this for

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.959
the first time with my husband.

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.100
Anyway, so thumbs up if you know what I'm
talking about - you guys should!

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.480
I'm sure you do!

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.630
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you soon
with another recipe.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.470
