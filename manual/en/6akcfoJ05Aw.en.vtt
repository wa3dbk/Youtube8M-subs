00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.850
Here's an idea.

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.958
This year's hottest fashion
item is a CSS style sheet.

00:00:04.958 --> 00:00:07.298
[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.240
So we're pretty sure
you've seen websites.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.030
They're made with
all sorts of things,

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.560
like HTML, PHP, Ruby, some
Rails, a Native American tribe,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.120
and if my memory
serves me correctly,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.670
it's all served from
that box on Moss's desk.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.396
It's wireless.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:23.145
There are a lot of
things that contribute

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:24.304
to how a website looks.

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:26.720
But one of the most common and
powerful ways of suiting up

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.454
your sites is called CSS.

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:30.620
Cascading Style Sheets do
a lot of the heavy lifting

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.860
when it comes to
making websites pretty.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.110
And also ugly, I guess, if
we're going to be specific.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.820
It's that expressive
user interface-generating

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.830
layer that sits on top of
that cold hard code interior.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.420
There's a "Matrix"
reference in here somewhere.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.360
I'm just having a really
hard time figuring-- ah.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.190
We gotta move on.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.010
Oh, come on!

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.290
This makes CSS sort of like the
clothes that a website wears.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.060
Or maybe the way a
website looks, CSS or not,

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.280
is clothes, but that an
eye-catching style sheet,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.480
that's something different.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.040
That is fashion.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.880
Because that's the difference
between clothing and fashion.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.360
Clothing is functional.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.890
It covers your junk 'n stuff.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.420
That, by the way, is
the anatomically correct

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.200
terminology.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.360
But fashion is used to
purposefully express

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.882
something which is not
explicitly stated otherwise,

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:18.340
keeping in mind that even if
you choose to express nothing,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.342
you are still expressing
your expression of nothing.

00:01:21.342 --> 00:01:22.508
Basically, you can't escape.

00:01:22.508 --> 00:01:23.384
[SCREAMING]

00:01:23.384 --> 00:01:24.467
Sorry.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.050
So while sweatpants
and a hoodie might

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.060
be clothing that
expresses very little,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.090
a teal tuxedo is fashion that
expresses your love of coffee

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.500
and your need to party.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.950
Oppa Gangnam style.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.380
This is the classic
form-and-function dichotomy.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.970
Fashion in the form that gives
some glitz and some meaning

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.020
to the functional aspects
of your threads-- and maybe

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.930
everything else.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.920
Coco Chanel said that fashion
doesn't exist in dresses only.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.110
Fashion is in the
sky, in the streets.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.490
Fashion has to do with
ideas, the way we live,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.460
and what is happening.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.020
We tend to equate fashion
wholly with haute couture

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.150
and weird, unwearable
runway clothes.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.770
But fashion is also your mom's
bad wallpaper, a 1997 Honda

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.491
Civic, and that
weird sideways window

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.240
they have on a bunch
of houses in Vermont.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.656
Fashion is also
the reason that we

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:08.660
built the Silk Road,
developed Doric columns

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.910
and Bullfinchian architecture.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.410
It's the reason
for the existence

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.830
of the world's first
global corporation--

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.018
and your crazy,
blinky style sheet.

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:17.518
Oh.

00:02:17.518 --> 00:02:18.700
Oh, that is bright.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.450
Ugh.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.660
We also might think that
fashion's stakes are higher

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.000
in relationship to
clothing because, you know,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.635
showing everyone
in public your junk

00:02:25.635 --> 00:02:28.100
'n stuff is worse than having
a silly-looking website.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.600
But the stakes for
your web presence

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.944
are pretty high, aren't they?

00:02:30.944 --> 00:02:32.610
Especially depending
on your profession.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.480
I mean, there's a reason that
Fortune 500 company websites

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.700
don't look like the Myspace
of a 16-year-old girl.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.315
I mean, you will never see
cursor trails on fidelity.com.

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:47.970
But this leads us to ask, how
much can code really express?

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.110
It's just semicolons and
brackets and stuff, right?

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.216
Now, this isn't the "is code
art?" argument, because it is.

00:02:56.216 --> 00:02:57.027
End of story.

00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:59.360
It's more a consideration of
how an idea that we usually

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.240
connect with dance, instruments,
and clothing, things which

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.380
are immediate and active,
can be applied to a computer

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.340
language, something which
needs to be rendered, compiled,

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.084
and displayed.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:11.000
Well, if you've seen
"Indie Game: The Movie"--

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.050
which if you haven't, please do.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.430
Link in the
description-- you saw

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.930
one of the creators of
"Super Meat Boy" say this.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.925
A video game is the
most effective way

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:20.130
I can express myself.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.670
That's not normally how you
hear people talk about code.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.770
That's usually how
you hear people

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.270
talk about the clothes they
wear, the pictures they take,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.476
or the songs that they like.

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.600
A lot of it, I'm sure, has
to do with how far we've

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.840
come in display in
computing technology.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.570
I'm sure that it is
near-impossible to be

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.100
expressive using a
punch card computer.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.470
The fact that we compare
CSS with dynamic protocols

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.020
like PHP, HTML5,
or JavaScript means

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.660
that we can have it move, make
it respond-- two things which

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.459
are key to expression.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.250
It means that instead
of the friendly layer

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.600
over the unfriendly
technology, everything

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.910
comes together and becomes
one cohesive, expressive,

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.630
coded Gesamtkunstwerk.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.680
Which actually brings us
right back to fashion.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.555
In the same way you
might not be able to talk

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.210
about the way a person dresses
without talking about who they

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.430
are, because one informs the
other, in both directions,

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.090
you can't really
talk about websites,

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.530
or any other computer
program for that matter,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.570
without talking about
its UI, its fashion.

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.490
German sociologist
Georg Simmel said

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.824
that is almost a sign of the
increased power of fashion

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:20.240
that it has overstepped the
bounds of its original domain,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.162
which comprised only
externals of dress,

00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:24.370
and has acquired an increasing
influence over tastes,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.661
theoretical convictions, and
even the moral foundations

00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:28.310
of life in their changing forms.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.500
This is only getting more
true as mobile phones turn

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.980
from ugly bricks
to sleeks slabs,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.050
as computers turn from
refrigerators to tablets,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.030
and as the internet turns
from war games to-- well,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.780
we're not quite at
hacking the Gibson yet.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.312
But maybe someday soon.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.270
What do you guys think?

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.350
Can user interface design
be a fashion statement?

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.950
Let us know in the comments.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.220

sunglasses handy, I'm sorry.

Let's see what you guys had
to say about Justin Bieber.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.480
To Nayukuo, that's a
really easy answer.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.490
We will probably just
shut down everything.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.130
CARTONofSUKI says
that crowd psychology

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:07.850
has a lot to do
with bringing people

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.040
into the fold of fandoms.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.880
Which I think is
probably part of it,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.250
but then there's also got
to be this other thing that

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.230
brings them in.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.200
And I'm-- I think we're really
curious about what that thing

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.850
is.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.650
MaryandLydia point
out the they disagree

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.680
that there is some
sort of It or Oomph

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.727
or Zazz about a work of art
that will bring people in,

00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:26.310
in that they are
actually-- popularity

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.690
is an effect of good
marketing or renown.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.750
Which is a very valid argument.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.340
cartoondreamer brutally reduces
our thesis of our last video

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.340
to "people like
things." which is true,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.310
but there are only a
few things that have

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.016
this intense effect on people.

00:05:42.016 --> 00:05:44.140
And so I think that we're
really curious about what

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.540
it is about these
things that people like,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.235
and that it's even more
than just liking something.

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:50.860
Robert Stoll says
that there is nothing

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.620
truly impressive
about Justin Bieber,

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.100
and I have a feeling that a lot
of people will agree with him.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.479
To stjonal, I'm glad that
someone got this joke.

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.270
To anybody who hasn't
seen the "Mona Lisa,"

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.010
if you do go see it, you will
not be seeing it by yourself,

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.800
and it most certainly
will not be quiet.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.800
To Ky0breck-- and anyone
else, for that matter--

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.460
who wants to remix Idea
Channel, we would be flattered.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.930
Please, go crazy.

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.477
SollingDown made a
really good point

00:06:12.477 --> 00:06:14.060
that Motherboard
actually agreed with,

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.060
that the cult of personality
that we talked with

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.970
was largely positive, and that
it can also be really negative.

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.201
So maybe another
episode for another day.

00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.950
MrNagagon makes a
really interesting point

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.360
about how history has treated
beautiful works of art,

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.318
and I think this is really
cool to think about.

00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:31.090
Because we have yet to see what
Justin Bieber will contribute

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.640
to history, what history
will say about Justin Bieber.

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.779
Which I think is,
you know, maybe

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.570
on the level of the
Sistine Chapel 600 year

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.800
from now, maybe not.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.211
To Raven46Poland, the
answer is yes, I do.

00:06:42.211 --> 00:06:44.710
Which means that you maybe can
all look forward to November,

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.460
when I have a silly mustache.

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.300
And also, you
should know that I'm

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.508
going to shave for Halloween.

00:06:48.508 --> 00:06:51.960
So in the comments section of
the next video, maybe no bears.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:52.795
Prepare yourself.
