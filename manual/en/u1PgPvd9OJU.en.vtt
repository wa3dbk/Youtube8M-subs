THE BACK FOR PETTY THEFT?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.020
&gt;&gt;THE MORE YOU PANIC THE MORE YOU BLEED.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.680

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.740
&gt;&gt;OH, YOU GOT ME GOOD.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.950
MY BLOOD IS BRIGHT YELLOW.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.140
WHAT ORGAN DID YOU HIT?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.220

&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.080
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.220
I HAD MINE REMOVED WHEN I WAS 12.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.310
&gt;&gt;TOO MANY QUESTIONS!

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.000
&gt;&gt;AH!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.090
&gt;&gt;THAT SEEMS EXCESSIVE.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080
&gt;&gt;HOW AM I STILL ALIVE?

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.870
&gt;&gt;LISTEN, WE ARE ALL UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.210
&gt;&gt;THAT'S FOUR SHOTS TO THE BACK.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.840
I MUST HAVE SOME SORT OF QUICK HEALING POWER.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.630
&gt;&gt;DON'T MAKE ME SHOOT YOU AGAIN.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.659
&gt;&gt;LOOK!

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.090
THE WOUNDS HAVE COMPLETELY HEALED THEMSELVES.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.810
NOW THEY JUST LOOK LIKE REALLY BAD WELTS.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.799

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.499
&gt;&gt;HONEY, HONEY JUST LET HIM GO.

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:18.950
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.040
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.609
WE'RE PASSED THE POINT OF NO RETURN.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.010
&gt;&gt;I'M TAKING YOU DOWN.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.329

&gt;&gt;GO AHEAD!

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.219
I CAN TAKE IT!

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:28.579
&gt;&gt;NO!

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:29.599
NO, LISTEN TO THEM.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.780
THEIR GUNS ARE DIFFERENT.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.939
&gt;&gt;FOOLISH HUMANS.

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.329
NO BULLETS CAN DEFEAT ME.

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.049
AH!

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.829
OH, YOU THINK YOU'VE WON MORTALS?

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.329
WAIT UNTIL MY CLAWS GROW IN AND I BREAK THE PRISON WALLS

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.719
AND SEEK OUT MY REVENGE?

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.999
&gt;&gt;ALL RIGHT.

00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:44.909
STOP RIGHT THERE!

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.450
[GUN SHOT] &gt;&gt;OH NO!

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:48.090
&gt;&gt;AH!

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.549
OH, IT HURTS SO MUCH WORSE NOW!

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.159
OH MAN!

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:56.859
APPARENTLY MY LEG MUSCLE DOES NOT HAVE

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.430
THE QUICK HEALING POWER.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.279
&gt;&gt;JUST STOP SCREAMING WE'LL GET YOU TO A HOSPITAL.

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:02.840
&gt;&gt;SILVER LINING GUYS.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.360
