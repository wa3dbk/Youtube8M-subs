00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.400
[music playing]

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.960
The demand for decorative
concrete is growing.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.280
Residential and
commercial customers

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.120
want to give plain concrete
a more unique appearance,

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.400
like stone, brick, tile,
wood, metal,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.800
and faux textures.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.000
With Sherwin-Williams’ quality
products and expert advice.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.760
you can easily capitalize on
these new job opportunities.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.960
The key to our success
has been Sherwin-Williams products

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.800
and I think part of the reason
is the backup knowledge

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.040
their reps have
on their products.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.360
Whenever we bid a project

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.360
that we're not real familiar
with the product we may need,

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.000
they've always came through
with the correct product

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.360
for that application.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.680
And if for some reason,
we ran into a niche or a problem

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.480
they were always
there to back us up.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.200
H&amp;C Concrete Coatings

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.360
is Sherwin Williams’
comprehensive line

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.400
of decorative concrete products.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.680
They're formulated to achieve
a wide variety of looks,

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.080
suit a broad range
of applications

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.120
and provide lasting
protection for hospitality,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.200
commercial,
property management

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.640
and residential
concrete substrates.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.320
Our decorative concrete coatings

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.880
are divided into five
basic categories:

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.800
H&amp;C Solid Color
Stains and Sealers,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.400
H&amp;C Decorative Stains and Dyes,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.400
H&amp;C Concrete Resurfacers
and Overlays,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.280
H&amp;C Color Hardeners
and Densifiers,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.840
and H&amp;C Clear Sealers.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.840
Each serves a unique purpose
and produces specialized effects.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
H&amp;C Solid Color Sealers

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.800
are ideal
for exterior applications.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They resist oil, gasoline, water,
UV rays and hot tire pickup.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.040
That makes them ideal
for commercial floors,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.760
driveways, patios, pool decks,
garage floors, even athletic courts

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.200
and stadium supports.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.440
H&amp;C Solid Color Stains
are water-based

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.360
and can be used for interior
or exterior applications.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.680
Our stains are formulated
to achieve deep penetration

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.680
and form a tough
waterproof shield

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.440
on patios, walkways,
pool decks

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.040
and commercial floors.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.520
With H&amp;C's Decorative
Stains &amp; Dyes

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.560
layered looks, faux effects

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.840
and vibrant colors
are easy to achieve

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.760
and the results are UV-resistant
and highly durable.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.720
H&amp;C Concrete Resurfacers
&amp; Overlays

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.240
allow you to get aged
concrete a facelift

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.920
for less than the cost
of expensive replacement.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.400
These systems have
excellent adhesion

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.280
and give new life or texture

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.080
to uneven and cracked
concrete surfaces.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
H&amp;C Color Hardeners &amp; Densifiers
improve the strength and density

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.400
of new and existing concrete,
while adding rich intense color.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.520
H&amp;C Clear Sealers

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.040
are the easiest way
to protect concrete

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.640
and add durability

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000
to any of our colored
stains and sealers.
