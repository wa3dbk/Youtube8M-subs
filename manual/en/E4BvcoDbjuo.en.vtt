DR. JAY FALKER:   NIAC changes the possible because it takes
something we cannot do and it says let’s

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:12.490
figure out if we could. The purpose of NIAC
is early studies of visionary concepts. They

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.020
have to be innovative yet credible. And so
we are really looking for revolutionary ideas.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.930
Going to the moon the way we did with Apollo
in 60s was crazy and yet the whole world has

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.310
been proud of us ever since we did it. And
that’s the kind of thing that can be enabled

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.410
if you’re willing to take risks and think
boldly. Good ideas can come from anywhere.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.100
Let’s not try to guess who has them. Let’s
just say pretty much anyone who wants to can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.150
propose. Those proposers could be NASA researchers
or at universities, or businesses, or garage

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.970
inventors. It’s an open call for proposals
every time. NIAC’s job is to say what could

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.880
happen, would it be great if it could be enabled,
and then what technologies are needed to get

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.220
there so that we can invest in the next few
years. Being visionary means sometimes it’s

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.420
going to take a long time to get it to fly.
Our job is to give it a chance. NIAC funds

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.470
aerospace architecture system and mission
concepts for anything related to aerospace.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.900
And so that includes: propulsion, power, human
exploration, science, aeronautics, pretty

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.420
much anything that relates to NASA goals or
potential aerospace missions. We studied one

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.690
last year which was taking the idea from the
pages of science fiction of suspended animation.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.330
Astronauts go to sleep or get frozen, they
go some long distance away (it takes a long

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.290
time), they wake up and do some exploration.
NIAC has funded several 3D printing related

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.610
studies. One of them had to do with 3D printing
whole buildings on the moon or Mars. We send

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.180
a small robot and it converts the dirt into
cement and 3D prints buildings before astronauts

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.170
ever get there. One concept is the V2 Suit
which is to be worn inside the spacecraft.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.310
It helps you preserve your attitude and orientation
in microgravity - almost make you feel like

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.939
you’re on Earth and just sitting here working
normally. So we’ve also studied microbial

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.040
fuel cells and the question of whether we
might one day be able to send these batteries

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.869
basically with bacteria in them and then run
small robots all without any of the traditional

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.940
power sources. NIAC has studied several things:
from an entirely new structure in space people

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.170
could live in and how it could grow and it
could enable mankind in space to innovative

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.370
systems in life-support and radiation shielding.
Every year we get some cool proposals for

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.380
new ways to send robots where we cannot today.
We had a really cool one that went to Europa

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.230
(a frozen moon), slowly melted through the
kilometers of ice, and then deployed a super-efficient

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.010
sub to swim around and look for whatever is
in the ocean under the ice on Europa. Another

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.489
one actually used the tensegrity structure
to build a super ball bot so that it basically

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.360
lands stretches bounces - no parachute, no
retro rockets - just a cool way to get down

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.160
and go explore. NIAC is the most inspiring
program in anything related to aerospace - not

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.120
just NASA. To take something that is impossible
today and say: ‘wait a minute. There’s

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.989
a way we might be able to achieve it.’ Is
something you almost never get to do, and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.500
when you talk about it, other people – students,
coworkers, normal people on the street who

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.090
don’t normally think about space get excited
and they say, ‘Wow! That’s neat. I hope

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.150
somebody can make that work someday.’
