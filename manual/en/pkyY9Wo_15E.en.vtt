Brian: A lot of people will look at the dresses and the first, of course, they always compliment my partners or the girls,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and they always say, "Oh, wow, that's a really great dress. 
You look so pretty. Who made that?"

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.930
And then they'll say, "Oh, well, Brian Youngblut did."

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.500
And they're always like, "Really?" [laughs]

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.500
[music]

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.929
I got into ballroom dancing through a sister of mine.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:34.000
She signed me up for ballroom right before 
I came home from my mission.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
From there, I kind of fell in love. I fell in love with
the competition. I fell in love with the performance of it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
There was a summer where I worked in
California at a private studio,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and I had a lot of clients there that were asking about
if I knew anybody that could make costumes,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and at first, for the first few, I was like,
"Oh, no, I don't know anybody."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And then it kind of hit me, like well, I can make costumes,
why aren't I making it for all these rich people in California?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.820
So then I started to invest a little bit more time and practice

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.000
on you know making different garments and
different costumes.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I started selling to my dance clients 
and to their friends and their friends' friends.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.500
Then it all kind of sprawled from there.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.000
The dress that inspired the gown that Ashley is wearing 
was actually an Oscars dress that Zoe Saldana wore.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.740
It was black, a lot of mesh, a lot of geometric shapes.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.000
So, we took that idea, ran with it a little bit.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Ashley: We used one material. We bought a bunch of 
fabric and thought it would be perfect,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.500
and we put it on the dress and we both looked at it, 
and we were silent. It was like "Uhhhh . . ."

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.500
"Let's start over completely new, new idea." And we ended up pulling something out that Brian had in the back room and perfect. VoilÃ .

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.450
The best thing about our uniform is that
I can still be beautiful and glamorous

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.000
but still be modest and feel like I'm being covered.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
When the rest of the world, they see a lot of ballroom dancing and it's showing your body, when you can show your body and still be covered.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Brian: Right after competition, I always think, 
"I'm never doing this again. I'm never going to make another dress."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And then just out of the blue, like Ashley said, 
I have an idea. It's going to be great.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.900
Ashley: Sometimes I go, "Oh no. Oh no, what's next?"

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.000
Brian: Being a boy in design can be at times difficult.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
You have people that will look at you and think,
 "Eh, you can't make things for girls" or

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
"Eh, you don't know what a woman wants to wear,"
you know just funny things like that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And it can be discouraging, but it's never more of a proud moment

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.269
when one of your designs steps out on the floor, 
and everybody in the audience just turns and gazes.

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:09.000
