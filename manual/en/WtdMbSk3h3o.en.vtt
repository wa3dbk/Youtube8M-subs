00:00:02.637 --> 00:00:05.217
Scientific American Instant Egghead

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:09.975
Zombies don't just exist 
in science fiction movies and music videos.

00:00:09.975 --> 00:00:14.141
They're for real and we can find them 
all over the animal kingdom.

00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:17.196
It's not because animals 
have come back from the dead,

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:19.435
it's because parasites have figured out

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:22.435
how to control the behavior 
of their animal hosts.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.847
For example, a parasitic fly lays eggs 
in a honey bee's body.

00:00:26.847 --> 00:00:29.352
The beset bee leaves the hive one night,

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:33.116
then crawls in zombie-like circles 
before dying.

00:00:33.373 --> 00:00:37.803
The fly larvae hatch from the bee's body
to seek their own victims.

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:41.999
Then there's the parasitic hair worm
that lives inside crickets.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.768
Crickets can't swim but the worm forces
the cricket to jump into water

00:00:47.768 --> 00:00:51.408
when it's ready to emerge 
and start its next phase of life.

00:00:51.647 --> 00:00:55.860
And then there's the fungus 
that can infect tropical tree-dwelling ants.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:58.660
When the ants are infected by the fungus,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.926
they crawl out to a spot on the tree 
where the fungus can thrive.

00:01:01.926 --> 00:01:05.595
Then the fungus kills the ant 
and eats its body from the inside out,

00:01:05.595 --> 00:01:08.563
sprouting spores from the ant's head.

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:13.965
Other ants pick up these spores; 
now they're doomed as well.

00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:17.404
So how do these dastardly parasites do it?

00:01:17.404 --> 00:01:20.763
Scientists think these parasites 
can control or mimic

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:23.935
molecules in the animals' brains
that influence behavior.

00:01:23.935 --> 00:01:28.328
And no, humans are not immune 
to getting "zombified" by parasites.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:32.768
Researchers think the protozoan, 
Toxoplasma gondii,

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:35.682
might actually change 
people's personalities

00:01:35.682 --> 00:01:39.065
making them more sociable
but also reckless.

00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:41.935
It's thought that the parasite 
alters hormone levels

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.640
and boosts dopamine, making us feel good.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.570
More than 22% of Americans 
might be infected with Toxoplasma gondii

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.493
which we catch from house cats.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:57.036

of Instant Egghead,
