00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.410
Hey friends!

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.820
So you guys gave me great feedback on my protein
packed pancake recipe episode from the Kickstart

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.779
Series so I thought I would do another one
of my favorite breakfasts - lightened up!

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.820
Surprisingly, this dish is one of the worst
things that you can order when you go out

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.490
to eat which is really sad a) because it's
delicious and b) it is really easy to make

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.490
it healthy.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.510
Let’s get to it!

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.460
My stuffed French toast!

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.640
So we are going to start by making our fruit
filling and if you just want regular French

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.080
toast you can FF through this part.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.190
In a bowl we are going to combine our softened
low fat cream cheese or Neufchâtel cheese,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.739
a little bit of Greek yogurt, a jam of your
choice - today I am using a no-sugar-added

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.120
strawberry but a homemade is always great,
some stevia and a little bit of almond milk.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.699
Mix to combine and sweetened to taste, it
should be delicious.

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.879
Also, feel free to add in your favorite fresh
fruit.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.899
Today I went with some finely diced strawberries
and bananas.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.970
Go ahead and transfer that mixture to the
fridge to let it chill while we make the French

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.970
toast.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.520
Now we will make our dredging mixture.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.610
In a shallow plastic container you are going
to add one egg - lightly beaten - egg whites,

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.460
almond milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and stevia.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.660
Whisk it on!

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.140
We do not need any creamer or half and half
in this recipe, the almond milk will work

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140
just fine.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.920
And if you want to lighten it up even more
you could just skip out on the egg and use

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.920
extra egg-whites.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.390
I do that all the time and it works out fine.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.390
I just like to add the egg in occasionally
because it makes the toast crisp up really

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.390
nicely.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.280
Heat up your frying pan and once it is heated
and ready to go you want to spray it down

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.950
with some cooking spray.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.890
Then it is time to dredge.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.050
I am using Ezekiel bread today which is a
great choice for people like me who live an

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.350
essentially gluten free lifestyle but not
necessarily a super strict one.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.979
It's not completely gluten free bread but
there's very little gluten in it.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.259
But any bread of your choice will work just
fine.

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.670
Place your bread into the dredging mixture
making sure you submerge it completely on

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.710
both sides.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.649
You want all of that eggy goodness.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.310
And then on to the heated skillet it goes.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.050
Hear that sizzle and get excited.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.670
Gimme a thumbs’ up if you are stoked!

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.580
Repeat with the second slice and let it cook
for just a few minutes before flipping to

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.580
the other side.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.670
I like to add a little bit of that extra dredging
mixture on top because that's going to make

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.190
it really moist so that when you flip it it'll
become nice and crisp and browned.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.500
Once it's cooked you can transfer to a plate
and go grab that fruit filling you made earlier.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.170
So you know traditionally stuffed French toast
is made where you make a sandwich with the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.340
bread and the filling and then you dredge
the entire thing and cook the entire thing

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.890
on a skillet but I prefer to cook both of
the pieces of bread separately so that they

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.700
both get a really nice crispy coating and
then put the filling inside.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.430
But if you prefer to cook it the traditional
way this recipe will still work just fine.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.710
I like to lay one piece of French toast down
on the plate, liberally cover it with that

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.110
delicious filling - it's so good - and maybe
even add a few extra slices of fresh fruit

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.770
before topping it with your second toast.

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.770
And voila!

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.740
And there you have it.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.740
Stuffed French toast.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.560
Perfect for your brunch or I even eat this
for dinner throughout the week which is absolutely

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.790
acceptable because it is healthy, made with
wholesome ingredients and has about half the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.130
fat and way less calories than traditional
French toast.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.440

It's all a matter of Mind Over Munch.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.650
A bunch of dust on that

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.490
It's a dusty room

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.760
[Laugh]

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:11.030
Booyaw!

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.020
Did a booger just come out of my nose?
