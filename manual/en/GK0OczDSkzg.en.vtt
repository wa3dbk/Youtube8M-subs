Hello guys its Guido from Football Tricks Online

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.320
Today i will be showing you how to curve the ball with the inside part of your foot

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.640
Okey so we got to curve the ball with the inside of your foot

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.520
Technique 1 : Fist we got to hit the ball side ways so it will spin

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.640
and it will make the ball curve to the inside

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.720
If you want the ball to have curve and a down effect at the same time

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.020
you got to try to hit the ball with curve and slightly up

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.460
Showing it with my foot, if you want curve we got to hit it like this...

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.740
and if you want to add down effect you just got to hit it slightly up

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.820
this way we get a bit of side curve and a bit of curve from top to bottom

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.060
so the ball will come down faster as well

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.460
basically your foot has to be next to the ball

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.660
If you hit it with your instep is usually pretty close to the ball

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.680
but when you add spin to it is usually a bit further back

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.180
So when i usually curve the ball...

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.180
i usually place my foot like this, as you see is a bit further back

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.220
If you put it too far back you will strike the ball in a forced way

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.520
and you are going to kick the ball up in the sky

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.100
opposite to that, if you put your foot in front of the ball you wont be able to hit the ball correctly

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.880
and you are going to hit half ball half ground and can injure yourself

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.820
finally, keep in mind that your body has to be relaxed

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.960
For example if i am about to do a free kick i am going to strike like this

00:02:10.033 --> 00:02:13.293
and your body does not have to be rigid in any way

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.100
Because maybe you put your arms in a rigid way and your body

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.460
that will only deform your body position and your kick

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.620
that happens to most of the people so remember, always have your body relaxed when kicking

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.260
I hope you enjoyed the tutorial

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.440
try to apply it because this technique is basic for scoring great goals

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.100
