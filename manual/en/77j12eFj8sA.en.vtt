00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:04.412
(upbeat music)

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:11.515
(mellow music)

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:15.506
Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone.

00:00:15.506 --> 00:00:16.802
I'm here with Cooking Stoned.

00:00:16.802 --> 00:00:19.094
And we have Ashley Routson, who's probably

00:00:19.094 --> 00:00:21.517
best known as the beer wench on Twitter.

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:22.867
Welcome, Ashley.
- Thank you.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:23.847
- And thanks for coming and hanging out

00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:24.680
in my kitchen with me.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.892
- Dude, I'm so excited.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.227
- Ashley, so what are we making today?

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:30.272
- Oh, we are making a
Strawberry Blonde Brewjito.

00:00:30.272 --> 00:00:31.648
- Brewjito?
- Yes.

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:33.483
- So, it's obviously
inspired by the Mojito.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:34.693
- Of course!
- Of course.

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:35.952
Okay, what's in this one?

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:38.989
- Fresh muddled strawberries,
fresh whole-leaf mint.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.159
We got some citrus, a little
bit of agave sweetness,

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.411
rum, obviously, because it's a mojito,

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.329
and then I'm using a blonde ale.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.831
- Tell us about the blonde
ale that you're using.

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:49.958
- I'm using a blond ale
from Knee Deep Brewing,

00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:52.484
they're out of Sacramento,
the Beautiful Blond.

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:55.422
The blond ale is often
referred to as the gateway beer

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:59.092
to craft beer because it is
the lightest of the styles.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.470
It has virtually no hop presence in it.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.221
Um, the malts are very neutral as well,

00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:06.266
they're mostly pale malt
with a little bit of biscuit,

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.185
so you don't have a
lot of caramel flavors,

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:10.479
you don't have a lot of
dark, roast-y flavors.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.272
Across the board it's very clean,

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.399
it's very easy and approachable.

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:16.733
It's a great summertime drink,
especially by the beach,

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.195
so a lot of the lighter blonde ales

00:01:18.195 --> 00:01:21.058
are made in cans as well.

00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:24.016
I used this because we
really wanted to showcase the

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:26.369
strawberries, so we didn't
want to interfere with it.

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.673
But typical in a mojito,
is to use soda water.

00:01:29.673 --> 00:01:31.712
So anywhere you can use soda water,

00:01:31.712 --> 00:01:33.710
in my book, you can use beer.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.226
And so I needed to use one of the most

00:01:35.226 --> 00:01:38.423
neutral styles of beer,
but still give it a little

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:42.475
bit of flavor, and so I
chose the Beautiful Blonde.

00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:45.013
- Which kinda matches your locks there.

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:47.808
(laughs)

00:01:47.808 --> 00:01:49.856
Is it, now where does this
particular blonde fall

00:01:49.856 --> 00:01:51.858
as far as the spectrum of things?

00:01:51.858 --> 00:01:53.801
Is it common for them
to have fruit flavors

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:55.474
or are they pretty...

00:01:55.474 --> 00:01:57.567
- It's not characteristic to have

00:01:57.567 --> 00:01:59.319
fruit flavors in this beer.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.783
Fruit flavors, often times
in beer, come from the yeast.

00:02:02.783 --> 00:02:03.865
And the yeast used in this,

00:02:03.865 --> 00:02:05.713
'cause it's an American-style...

00:02:05.713 --> 00:02:07.494
Americans pretty much
invented the American

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:10.497
blonde ale, well, obviously.

00:02:10.497 --> 00:02:13.124
But the yeast strands used in this are

00:02:13.124 --> 00:02:14.751
American yeast strands
which typically aren't

00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:16.837
very fruity, and you wouldn't find any

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.171
fruit from any of the malts.

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.048
So, you're gonna find a
little bit of biscuit flavor,

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:22.008
which will be nice to go
with the strawberries,

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.345
maybe a little strawberry
shortcake with mint on top.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.559
- Can you talk a little
bit about when you're

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:31.956
concocting a recipe for
this, you can have either,

00:02:31.956 --> 00:02:34.145
you know, sort of, inspiration
from the culinary world

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:35.772
whether it's, like, basil or strawberry

00:02:35.772 --> 00:02:37.399
or even some other dish,

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.576
or you can start with the beer.

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.101
If someone starts with
the beer, how do you

00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.113
work towards building out a cocktail?

00:02:43.113 --> 00:02:44.947
What's your sort of process for that?

00:02:44.947 --> 00:02:46.992
- Well, I would, if you
have a favorite style,

00:02:46.992 --> 00:02:49.995
I would break down the
key flavor characteristics

00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:53.915
of that and, for example,
we'll use a stout.

00:02:53.915 --> 00:02:56.582
You know, we've got
chocolate, we've got coffee.

00:02:56.582 --> 00:02:59.504
Is it lighter in body,
or is it heavier in body?

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:01.256
All these things that
you have to think about.

00:03:01.256 --> 00:03:04.050
And then, you take those
flavors and you think about

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.262
what spirits might play well with that?

00:03:07.262 --> 00:03:09.708
I have chocolate and I have espresso,

00:03:09.708 --> 00:03:12.893
typically you go towards
barrel aged spirits,

00:03:12.893 --> 00:03:17.230
such as whiskey, bourbon, the darker rums.

00:03:17.722 --> 00:03:18.768
Then you start figuring out,

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:20.792
well I like the caramelized
flavors and the vanilla

00:03:20.792 --> 00:03:24.774
flavors in the barrel that
play very well with the

00:03:24.774 --> 00:03:27.447
chocolate and espresso and the stout.

00:03:27.447 --> 00:03:29.657
And then from there you
can just throw in other

00:03:29.657 --> 00:03:32.471
ingredients, sometimes,
orange goes really nicely

00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:34.167
with both, 'cause orange and chocolate.

00:03:34.167 --> 00:03:35.916
Fruit and chocolate and bourbon.

00:03:35.916 --> 00:03:37.208
You know, so it's just, kind of,

00:03:37.208 --> 00:03:39.107
going through in your head,

00:03:39.107 --> 00:03:41.907
wherever you start you
can build off of it.

00:03:41.907 --> 00:03:43.965
- And where can we find
more of your recipes?

00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:45.412
- Beermixology.com

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:47.244
- Great. Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:03:47.244 --> 00:03:50.723
