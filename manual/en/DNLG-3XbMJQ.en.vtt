00:00:01.834 --> 00:00:02.417
In a previous Subscriber request video …

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:06.417
I tried removing the hair on my legs using cockroach traps.

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:09.042
I had more cockroach traps than I needed.
00:00:9:01 00:00:11:01
I wanted to do something using these left-over cockroach traps …

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:13.042
I think maybe the stickiness can be used for something else.

00:00:13.083 --> 00:00:17.999
Like maybe I can use them to hang on a wall, like Spiderman.

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:21.999
If I assemble these and wrap them with tape

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:22.999
… around my hands …

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.250
… and I get a running start for a jump …

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:26.751
… like this,,,

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:30.125
I want to stick to that wall over there.

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:39.959
I can’t wrap tape around these traps by myself, so I need an assistant. 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:42.959
Well, some of you may have noticed that …

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.918
I'm at my grandfather's house. 

00:00:45.959 --> 00:00:48.417
Oh, crap! I can’t take off my shirt with these traps on my hands. 

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.834
I can do a lot with just two fingers.

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:52.751
Try touching these.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:55.542
See how sticky it is!

00:00:55.626 --> 00:00:57.542
These fingers are definitely cockroach catchers.

00:00:57.626 --> 00:00:59.959
I hope I can …

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.250
.. hang on for at least a minute.

00:01:01.334 --> 00:01:06.042
I will even try to do a pull-up while I’m up there.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:07.042
Can I reach the wall?

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:07.792
Yeah, I think I can …

00:01:07.876 --> 00:01:16.709
It's easy.

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:22.918
Cut this part out later, please.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:33.042
Instant death!!

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.292
Ow! It hurts! The back of my head hurts bad.
0:01:35.375,0:01:35.209
Let’s try something different.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.542
Maybe if I can get my hands in there ...

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:40.542
I can’t reach it.

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:47.501
I couldn’t even touch it.

00:01:47.542 --> 00:01:50.501
Oooomph!

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:52.501
Can you get a little closer?

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:56.501
Okay

00:01:56.542 --> 00:01:57.999
Aaaaaah!

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:06.751
Alright, I can reach it …

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:07.125
I did hang for a bit.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.876
0.5 second Spiderman!

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.876
Crunch!

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.876
That was exhausting.

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.042
I hope that you’ll follow my whole series of videos!

It looks like a huge success when you look at it played backwards.
