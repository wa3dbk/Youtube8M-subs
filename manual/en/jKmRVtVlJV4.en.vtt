00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.700
There are some things that are just fun, even
if you realize that they might not be of the

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.700
highest quality.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.720
I’ve never really been a HUGE fan of the
anime style, save for DragonBall Z, but I

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.220
know that it does have a humongous fan base.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.310
Now, this style has been applied to videogames
for a very long time, but the problem is that,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.220
for the most part, they just haven’t been
any good.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.150
This game doesn’t necessarily break that
trend from a technical standpoint, but it’s

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.590
still a hell of a lot of fun.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:01:00.760
This is Gotcha Force for the Nintendo Gamecube.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.080
Gotcha Force follows the story of a kid named
Kou, who discovers a robot named G-Red that

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.900
warns of an attack by an evil group of robots.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.930
Of course, like with most anime, the kid is
allowed to leave his house without parental

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.280
supervision and start fighting with the robot.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.450
Along the way, you’ll meet new people that
are willing to join your cause, and eventually

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.490
gain more robots to help you, as well.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.860
The game’s pace is extremely quick, almost
arcade-like, giving you quick bursts of gameplay

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:40.070
followed by a little bit of story-telling.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.070
At its core, Gotcha Force is a third-person
action game.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.450
The goal of each level is to defeat every
enemy, using any means necessary.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.119
You’ll have access to a gun, melee, and
a different power-ups depending on what robot

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.200
you’re using.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
Some have bombs, some have turbo boosts, and
some have missiles, and these all can be used

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.480
to help take down your opponents.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.380
You’ll usually have a few partners as well,
and these guys are swapped into your place

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.880
if and when you explode.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.719
The game is extremely quick, easy to learn,
and harder to master.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.140
The combat system is almost perfect, and if
it wasn’t for some occasional collision

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.930
detection, I wouldn’t really have anything
negative to say about this aspect of it.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.590
The developers seemed to really understand
that this is still a game, and it has to be

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.540
fun if people are going to buy it or enjoy
it.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:36.650
Now, one of the problems of Gotcha Force is
that it does tend to get a little bit repetitive.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.510
You’ll be fighting wave after wave of enemies,
and then you’ll be doing a similar task

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.510
on the next level.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.540
If you’re in love with this idea, this might
not even be an issue, but the goals don’t

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.540
really seem to change.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.820
Of course, how you have to complete each task
varies depending on what enemy you’re facing,

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.010
but the end goal doesn’t: just kill everything.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.160
Sure, other games can be a little repetitive
too, but Gotcha Force doesn’t really mask

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.340
it as well as it could.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.060
A little change in setting or style would
really go a long way with this game.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.940
Gotcha Force is a strange game to judge with
its visuals.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.730
It looks fairly primitive for a Gamecube game,
but this also comes down to its animation

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.960
style, which is just not as sophisticated
as more modern animation.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.130
However, what really can’t be excused is
the voice acting.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.690
I’m not going to sugar coat it: this is
the worst voice acting I have ever heard in

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.690
a video game.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.480
The narrator sounds like he got pulled off
the street to read a few lines.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:41.340
It’s cringe worthy.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.730
Gotcha Force is not a great game, but it is
still a quirky and fun experience.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.890
Invite a friend over and give this a rent,
because even though you’ll laugh at some

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.310
of its flaws, you’ll have a good time.
