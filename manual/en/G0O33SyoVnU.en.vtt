Welcome to howtocookthat.net.

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:02.910
I'm Ann Reardon.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:07.490
Last week we looked at beautiful chocolate
cheesecakes, this week its ugly monkey head

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.810
cakes with cheesecake brains and raspberry
sauce.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.580
I'm going to give you a quick two minute round
through on how to make these.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.200
It'll take way too long to film the whole
process so I just give you heads up on how

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.200
to do it.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.850
They were for the launch of the Indiana Jones
blue ray DVD set by paramount.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.630
So first of all we took a sweet potato and
carved it into a brain shape.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.280
Then using an edible food gel, I took a cast
of the brain shape, poured cheese cake mixture

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.079
into the cast to make four cheesecake brains.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.019
I just colored the cheesecake to make it flesh
toned.

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:46.639
Using bowls as a mould, I've made the base
of the skulls out of white chocolate.

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:51.450
And then using balloons as mould for the top
of the skulls, and then just use a knife to

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.809
trim those down.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.969
I made my own bases out of thick cupboard
and aluminum foil then used ganache and chocolate

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.110
cake to build up the shape of the face, putting
the skulls in place and building the cake

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.610
the whole way up.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.150
Next, mix up some white chocolate ganache
and color it to a flesh tone and cover the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.370
whole thing.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.130
Using the back of a tea spoon, indent with
the eyes are.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.050
Then take some fondant and build it up in
the areas where it needs to be further forward.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.240
Roll out thinly, some grey fondant and place
it over the top of the whole thing including

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.860
the top skull.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.750
Using your tools indent and make all of the
shapes and the details you need for the nose

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.520
and the face, and put some black fondant in
place for the eyes with a little strip of

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520
white.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.090
Then using black edible food color, add your
details and a little bit pink on the nose

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.390
and yellow for those rotten looking teeth.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.360
The top of these skulls didn't need to be
edible, so I used some fluffy string and put

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.550
it in place.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.560
If you needed it to be edible you could use
Pashmak or Iranian fairy floss.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.450
But next I placed a thin layer of agar-agar
over the eyes just to give them that little

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.120
bit of glossy sheen to them.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.159
Put the cheesecake brains in place in the
skulls, and then using fresh raspberries,

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:13.469
I've made up some raspberry jelly and poured
that over the top to give that gruesome blood

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.849
looking effect on top.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.159
And then fluffed up the hair, and there you
have four Indiana Jones monkey heads looking

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:27.819
very gruesome in my fridge there.
