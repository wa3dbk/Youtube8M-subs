MYA: "Full Time Kid," with Mya.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.840
Hi.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:05.570
I'm Mya.

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.675
And today, I'm gonna
teach you how to make

00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:08.960
your own glowing masterpiece.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.646
It's very easy, and you can
do it with your friends.

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:15.686
For this project, you'll need
a black light, some brushes,

00:00:15.686 --> 00:00:19.400
some spoons, one half
cup of corn starch,

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.330
some food coloring, and one
half cup of highlighter water.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.300
You're probably asking, how
do you make highlighter water?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.515
Well, we're gonna
show you right now.

00:00:28.515 --> 00:00:30.340
To make the
highlighter water, you

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.150
need to remove the ink
tube from the highlighter.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.440
Make sure an adult
helps you with this one.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.515
Then, you're gonna run the ink
tube through water into a cup

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:40.430
and squeeze all the ink through.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.940
And that's how you make
your highlighter water.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.710
Just mix it after,
and it'll be nice.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.390
Now, mix your highlighter
water into the corn starch.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.100
Be careful.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.068
This can get messy.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.060
Now, mix it all up.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.192
Now, you can add a
few drops of food

00:01:10.192 --> 00:01:11.900
coloring if you want
to change the color.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.536
All done.

00:01:37.536 --> 00:01:39.820
Now, let's see what it
looks like in the dark.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.442
Wow.

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:47.280
That's cool.

00:01:54.842 --> 00:01:55.675
Thanks for watching.

00:01:58.265 --> 00:01:59.009
Yeah!

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.133
WOMAN: Glowing masterpiece.

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.070
You got it?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.387
Masterpiece.

00:02:03.387 --> 00:02:04.720
MAN: [INAUDBLE] the ingredients.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.220
That side.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.089
Boop, boop, boop,
boop, boop, boop.

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.630
MAN: Perfect.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.610
WOMAN: And then [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.660
OK.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.340
MAN: Ready?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.189
MAN: Yep.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:14.730
Want me to start
from the beginning?

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.280
MAN: Yeah.
