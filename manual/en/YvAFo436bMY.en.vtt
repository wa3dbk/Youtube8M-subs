00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:35.993
Just as I am, without one plea,
but that Thy blood was shed for me

00:00:35.993 --> 00:00:55.532
And that Thou bidst me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:16.847
Just as I am, and waiting not
to rid my soul of one dark blot

00:01:16.847 --> 00:01:34.767
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

00:01:36.286 --> 00:02:09.369
&lt;i&gt;Instrumental&lt;/i&gt;

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:23.228
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve

00:02:23.228 --> 00:02:40.579
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.

00:02:42.381 --> 00:03:03.389
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come.
