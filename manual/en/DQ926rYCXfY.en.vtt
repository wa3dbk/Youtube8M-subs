00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.029
I'm Jeremy from F.H. Steinbart Company, and
today we'll be doing a beer brewing tutorial

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:12.010
on behalf of Expert Village. Now that we've
let our steeping grains sit in the pot for

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:24.310
about half an hour, it's time to go ahead
and remove them. So we'll go ahead and hold

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:34.329
this guy up here, place it in our funnel and
we'll just hold this here for a minute and

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:46.659
let any excess water that's in there go ahead
and drip on out. Just like so. We'll get our

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:58.719
flaked barley too.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:07.229
We can kind of squeeze our unfinished beer
or work as it's often called right on out

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:16.840
of these grains.
Now that we've got most of the goodness out

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:24.509
of these grains, we'll go ahead and toss them.
This flaked barley just goes right in the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:38.950
garbage and we'll go ahead and pour the grain
out of this bag here. Give it a little squeeze

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.340
just to get the rest of it out. And go ahead
and discard that as well. We'll save the bag,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.409
wash it and reuse it later. Now our work has
a nice deep color to it. We've got all those

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:01.890
roasted grain flavors that we want out of
a stout in there and the right color. But

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.110
we still don't have any hops in our beer.
And we still don't have the sweetness and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.870
all the sugar. And those things are going
to come from our malt extract. So we'll go

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.000
ahead and add that now.
