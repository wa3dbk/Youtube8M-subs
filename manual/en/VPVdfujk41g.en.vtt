00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.250
The Christus Spohn Heart Network offers
the most comprehensive cardiac care in

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.400
South Texas and now cardiac surgeons are
offering their patients an incredibly

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.400
precise procedure that is giving them
new options.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.449
Curtis Watters and his wife spend a lot
of their time together searching the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.369
beaches around Corpus Christi

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.210
but it was a very different kind of
search that led him to Christus Spohn.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.900
He needed a bad mitral valve in his
heart repaired.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.460
what he found was an innovative heart
surgery at Christus Spohn Heart Network

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.570
which offers the most comprehensive
cardiac surgical and diagnostic services

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.490
in South Texas.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.540
Our decision to do this wasn't because
he had 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.810
a life-threatening

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.580
condition it was maintenance basically

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.650
we've been together thirty nine years
and we want to make it another thirty nine

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.660
years so let's take care of this before it becomes a big deal.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.770
Curtis had his valve repaired through a new innovative heart surgery

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.260
new technology is allowing doctors to
perform heart surgery without having to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.860
open the chest and split the breast bone

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.760
this results in less pain and a much
quicker recovery.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.609
When you do a minimally invasive cardiac surgery it's like robotically assisted

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:29.520
you use instruments in your hand that
that allow you to get

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.180
inside close to the heart without having
your hands inside

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.290
these newly designed instruments are
combined with a different location

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.410
where doctors access the heart

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.100
through small incisions in the right
side of the chest

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.980
Instead of opening up the whole
front of the chest and the sternum

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.690
spreading the chest, exposing the whole heart

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.320
what we've trimmed that down to or
minimize that down to is a small

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.170
incision about the same incision you would get for placement of a pacemaker device.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.670
With no need to split the breast bone

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.160
patients are back to their normal lives
much quicker

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.460
within two weeks

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.040
you are fully recovered, you are able to drive, go back to work or do

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.760
whatever you have to do. So your recovery is much faster. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.790
Your immediately recovery as far as the heart

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.129
is exactly the same

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.069
but your labor recovery

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.699
as far as becoming

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:26.469
fully functional member society
within two weeks you are feeling great

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.429
and you back to work.

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:33.169
While it's not for everyone minimally
invasive cardiac surgery offers many

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.639
advantages for those who qualify.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.180
The people that are sicker

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.190
are the people the benefit than most from
this procedure so yeah cosmetically it's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.550
nice to have a small incision underneath the clavicle 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.490
that is only three inches. You can say I had heart surgery that looks exactly like a pacemaker but

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.180
ideally I think it's the sicker people that are the ones

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.629
that will actually benefit the most.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.360
Part of the new technology is high-tech
magnifying cameras

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.350
which allow the surgeons a better view
of the smaller spaces they now operate

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.389
within.

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:10.139
Doctors offer minimally invasive heart
surgery not only to repair mitral valves

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:14.869
but also for coronary bypass and aortic valve surgery.

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:19.899
This innovative procedure results in
less blood loss less pain and a lower

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:23.269
risk of infection and so hospital stays
are much shorter.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.569
Any pain I had was very
well monitored I mean very well

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.259
monitored I did not feel the pain.

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.509
I left out of intensive care a day and a half later of transferred out

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:36.029
into the main hospital

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:40.779
and I spent two and a half days in the main
hospital again well taken care of.

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:41.939
The nurses were great

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.909
and at the end of four days I went home.

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:45.930
He came through it like a champ

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.930
He had not ever had any major surgeries to speak of so this was a biggie.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:59.539
