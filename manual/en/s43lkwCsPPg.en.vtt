00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.509
about a half a million years after the big bang the cosmos began to cool as

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.180
It cooled the hot subatomic

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.488
Particles that constituted the early universe began to slow down and stop colliding with each other long [enough]

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.790
so that protons neutrons and electrons could form the

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:48.969
Universe cooled further and the hot particles slowed further still allowing these particles to stay together long enough to create atoms

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.909
The universe was nothing but a cloud [of] hydrogen and helium

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:01.959
Over eons the universe continued to cool and structure begins to present itself within this universal cloud

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.540
from small disturbances woven into space-time the galaxies begin to collect

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.759
Tiny variations in the primordial universe become the web that collected galaxies and gave the cosmos its form

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.749
These galaxies become distributed along these structures

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.769
dancing within the gravitational fields forming giant tendrils reaching out across the span [of] eternity

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.970
Just a few short decades ago astronomers thought the universe was static and unchanging

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690
We didn't even know there were other galaxies until the 20th century

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.140
The Heavens was considered a place of constancy in uniformity the stars and planets [were] always there

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.320
And they always would be steady and unchanging

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.330
What we have learned instead is that the cosmos is [a] seething cauldron of activity as alive and vibrant as any one of us

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.690
Stars are born shine and explode stellar winds blow huge storms of gas across interstellar space

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.180
Black Holes, Devour all the potential

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.479
galaxies collide with each other spraying stars into eternity

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.620
and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.889
the space-Time itself Grows larger by the minute

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.059
the universe is far from a static place, and we are intimately connected to it as

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.640
Giant Stars Explode after living out their lives they stream out the elements of life

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:53.049
Carbon Oxygen nitrogen iron all the necessary components for planets to form and for life to begin

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.709
We are more connected to the universe than we know

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.139
The stars are our ascendance and we are their progeny

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.470
