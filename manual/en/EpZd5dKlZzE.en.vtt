00:00:09.836 --> 00:00:12.333
It's a big risk, it's a huge risk.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.833
No one's been here. We don't know
where we are going.

00:00:16.343 --> 00:00:21.498
It could be a really good discovery
but it could be a complete myth.

00:00:22.113 --> 00:00:23.083
This way Tom go...

00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:38.380
Ross and Tom have been two of my
biggest heroes growing up.

00:00:38.826 --> 00:00:40.750
I think Tom's the best
ever at pipeline.

00:00:42.028 --> 00:00:44.841
Ross, there he is taking off
some massive waves.

00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:46.460
No one could take their eyes of him.

00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:49.875
Communication kind of works like this.

00:00:50.036 --> 00:00:51.625
Go go go go go!

00:00:52.236 --> 00:00:54.041
No no what?! Ah!

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:55.958
In a sense we have a good marriage.

00:00:56.933 --> 00:00:58.501
Hang on!

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.916
Our holy grail is to find these spots
that have never been surfed.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.666
We're just going out into the unknown.

00:01:06.828 --> 00:01:08.458
You alright? hahaha.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.333
Owe.

00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:14.758
I'm still looking for that wave
that's going to say

00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:16.875
that's the biggest wave you're
ever going to ride.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.375
This isn't fun and games.
It's a very serious operation.

00:01:20.803 --> 00:01:23.000
In a very dangerous environment.

00:01:23.575 --> 00:01:26.833
I think Tom's - psyche's
changed on this whole thing.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.916
He spent a lot closer time with
his 3 girls...he became a girl.

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:36.001
I'm turning 50 and I'm looking
at life a lot different.

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:41.091
It's too windy going to be
fifty knots of wind.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.876
It's certainly going to be big!

00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:46.666
It's a mutant of a wave.
-It's really really scary.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.875
If someone gets hurt?!

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.458
This one Tom! Go go go go!

00:02:01.773 --> 00:02:05.166
Where is he Helicopter? Can you see
Tom? Is he still under?

00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:11.833
With all this knowledge,
the fact is there's a gap there.

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:13.333
And that is mother nature.

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:16.716
Surfing big waves is not about
how ripped your abs are,

00:02:16.878 --> 00:02:18.250
or how much you bench press.

00:02:18.463 --> 00:02:20.125
I think it's about your nerve.

00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.226
Oh! Look at this!

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:34.925
You know, I think they've
both lived a few lives.

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:36.833
They've lost a few lives you
know, if they've got 9...

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:40.208
they're down to 1 or 2 each mate.
