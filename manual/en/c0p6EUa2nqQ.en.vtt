Hello, my name is Luis Estrada, and I'm a
software developer. In this video, I'll show

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.889
you how to register a website with search
engines. Each search engine allows the possibility

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.039
of submitting your website's URL to its index.
However, they cannot guarantee that your website

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.800
will appear in your index, and they cannot
predict when it will happen. You should submit

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:37.930
your website's address to at least the three
major search engines. Google, Yahoo, and Livesearch.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.269
All you have to do is enter your website's
URL in the appropriate field. Optionally,

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:50.650
you may also add comments or key words that
describe the content of your page. These are

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.030
used only for information purposes and do
not affect how your page is indexed or used

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:04.720
by search engines. Then press the add URL
button and you are done. It's that simple.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.720
Even if your website gets listed on the search
engine, the problem is that there are billions

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.030
of web pages and the vast majority of search
engine users will only visit a few of those

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.351
websites whenever they search for a key word
or phrase on the web. So even after your website

00:01:19.351 --> 00:01:24.350
is listed, your chances of getting to your
potential customers are still very small.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.620
However, there is something you could do to
help your web page rank much better. This

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.560
is called search engine optimization or SEO
for short. This is the process of editing

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.420
and organizing the content of your website
to increase its potential relevance to specific

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.870
key words on specific search engines. And
importantly, it's showing that external links

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.570
to the site are correctly titled and in abundance.
This is done with the aim of achieving a higher

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.690
listing, and thus increasing the volume of
targeted traffic from search engines. Optimizing

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.980
a website primarily involves editing its content
and html code to both increase its relevance

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.140
to specific key words and to remove barriers
to the indexing activities of search engines.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.450
Sometimes, a site's navigation structure must
be altered too. For a lot of SEO techniques

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.310
that you can apply to your website, in fact
it's better to define an SEO strategy before

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.090
you even start the development of your website.
Since SEO is such an important factor for

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.670
increasing traffic to your website, you could
consider paying a professional service to

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.170
help you with it. There are a lot of websites
that sell services associated with SEO, like

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:47.170
consultation, key word research, website redevelopment,
the creation of incoming links, submitting

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.099
to multiple search engines and finally and
most importantly, creating reports on the

00:02:52.099 --> 00:03:01.180
optimization results. I am Luis Estrada, and
I've just showed you how to make money with

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.130
mere websites.
