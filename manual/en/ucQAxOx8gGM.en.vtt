00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.620
I'm Nicholas Charlton at the University of
Bristol and I'm studying bumblebees.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.510
What I've got here is some bumblebees.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:24.130
We've got a live colony in a box, with a queen
and workers, and they come through a tube

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:32.550
into this box here and this we call a flight
arena, so they fly out of the colony and come

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.470
into here to actually feed.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.980
At the moment they are feeding from artificial
flowers, which are just made of coloured plastic

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.250
discs with a small well in the middle with
sugar solution.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.210
So they come in, they feed, and they go back
to the colony.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.280
So in the flight arena with the bumblebees
we can get them to feed from different things

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.210
and we get them to feed on a sugar solution
and we can put them into these artificial

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.210
flowers.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.369
I know it doesn't look much like a flower
but the coloured discs represent the petals

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.350
of the flower and in the centre is a small
well where we can put the sugar solution,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.240
which they learn to feed from quite quickly.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.530
There are also other ways to represent artificial
flowers, different flower shapes, even paper

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.450
flowers, and we can use these to ask questions
about how bees choose which flowers to visit,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.899
what are the triggers that motivate them to
visit perhaps maybe asking questions about

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:43.679
the colour of the petals, or even the textures
on the petals themselves.

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.200
And different shapes, sizes and also different
materials.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.759
So one of the things that I have been trying
to do is to setup experiments in the lab with

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:59.399
bees and artificial flowers to look at what
drives their decisions on which flowers to

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.450
visit.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.700
So in a natural environment you have different
flower species, different species will have

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.180
different amounts of nectar in them, and its
the nectar that the bees want.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.900
The more nectar they get, the more energy
they get, and the greater the success of the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.030
colony.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.620
And greater success means more bees.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.260
Interestingly, these bees can show behaviour
where they bite into flowers that they wouldn't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.230
normally be able to reach the nectar from
because their tongues are too short and the

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.629
flowers are too deep.

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.980
So I'm going to try and setup an experiment
where I put in paper tubes that represent

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.349
deep flowers and see if I can get the bees
to chew holes in them to get the nectar out.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.230
And then I can ask questions about how many
flowers do I need in a flight arena like this

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.360
for them to switch between normal feeding
to this nectar robbing behaviour where they

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.500
chew holes in the flowers.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.650
I studied bees because they are so important
as effective pollinators of wild flowers and

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.230
important crops as well.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.270
Bumblebees are in decline and if we don't
halt the decline of bumblebees, eventually,

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.120
we could have a catastrophe where we can't
produce the crops that we want, or the cost

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.480
of them becomes so high that people can't
afford to buy them.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:46.150
We also may lose important plant wild flowers,
which rely on pollination by bees.
