STAYING SAFE IN THE NORTH MAINE WOODS IS

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.669
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.228
PADDLING THE
ALLAGASH WILDERNESS WATERWAY

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:16.999
IS CHALLENGING

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.988
EVEN FOR THOSE WITH YEARS
OF PADDLING EXPERIENCE

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.568
IF YOU'RE REALLY A NOVICE

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.429
YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TRY THIS TRIP ALONE

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.031
YOU SHOULD COME WITH
SOME EXPERIENCED PEOPLE

MAYBE MIGHT BE BETTER IF YOU ARE
A TRUE NOVICE

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:35.039
I'M SAYING NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.449

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.058
HOW THEY'RE SETUP

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.199
INEXPERIENCED CONDUITS ARE STRONGLY

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.538
ADVISED TO ENGAGE A MAINE GUIDE

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.609

SECTION OF THE RIVER

THE DANGERS YOU FACE IN  THE WATERWAY

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:00.138
ARE MOST STARKLY EVIDENT
AS YOU APPROACH ALLAGASH FALLS

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.274
THE SPECTACULAR BUT TREACHEROUS

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:03.749
FINAL LEG OF A TREMENDOUS

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.629
92 MILE JOURNEY

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.752
ABOUT A MILE BEFORE THE FALLS YOU'RE

00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:09.908
GONNA COME TO A SIGN ON AN ISLAND

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.564
THAT SAYS
DANGER FALLS AHEAD

00:02:11.565 --> 00:02:13.079
KEEP RIGHT FOR PORTAGE

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.957
STAY IN THE MAIN RIVER BUT BEAR IN MIND

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:16.908
THAT YOU WILL HAVE A PORTAGE COMING UP

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:18.103
AS YOU GET CLOSER TO THE FALLS

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:19.658
YOU WILL HEAR THE FALLS

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.858
YOU WILL SEE THE RAPIDS

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:23.688
THE PORTAGE TRAIL IS RIGHT AT THE

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.268
BEGINNING OF THE RAPIDS

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.059
DO NOT GO INTO THE RAPIDS
BECAUSE THE PORTAGE

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.258
TRAIL IS ON RIVER RIGHT &amp; IT'S VERY WELL

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:31.718
MARKED WITH A VERY COLORFUL SIGN

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.988
&amp; EVERYBODY MUST TAKE OUT THERE
TO DO THE PORTAGE

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.093
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY DANGEROUS DROP

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.708
THE WATERWAY IS A LONG WAY FROM A HOSPITAL

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.118

THE WAIT MAY BE INCONVENIENT

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.049
WHAT YOUR SAFETY IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.639
