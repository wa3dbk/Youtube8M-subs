For Expert Village.com, this is Matt Friedman,
owner of the Blue Creek Candle Company. In

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.110
this clip we will be talking about today’s
candle recipe. To find out more about my candles

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:29.910
please visit my website. Today we are going
to be making a 16 ounce soy candle and what

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.750
we are going to need for that is 16 ounces
of soy wax and that is going to come in flakes.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.220
You will need to measure out the amount of
soy wax you are going to need. There we go,

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:49.650
that is 1 pound of soy wax right there. What
we are going to do is add that to our melting

00:00:49.650 --> 00:01:03.530
pot and make sure you are not spilling any
onto your stove.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.530
Once you have that all in there go ahead and
turn your stove on. All right, you want to

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:22.920
use a low medium heat that way your wax will
not melt too quickly and this will allow you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.270
time to go ahead and prep your mold to your
containers and do anything else you need to

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.289
do in order to have everything ready once
your wax is melted. Again you are never leaving

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:41.259
your melting pot unattended. You are always
close by to that. So what I tend to do once

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:49.450
I got my wax all poured and melting is grab
my container. When you first begin you might

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.759
want to use a ruler to actually measure out
your wick. A little short cut that I found

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:02.969
to that is that I just get a length of it
and really just use an estimate to the bottom

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.130
of your jar and add a little extra to that
so that you can actually maneuver the wick

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:17.500
around in the candle as it is drying so that
it always maintains its center. You are going

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.530
to go ahead and snip that off and take your
wick and you are going to thread it through

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.000
your wick tab. There are different types of
wick tabs available out there. This is a high

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.379
colored wick tab and once you have your wick
threaded through that, go ahead and pinch

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.730
that collar around your wick and that is going
to hold it in place for you so that your wick

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.790
won’t come out of the wick tab. Then what
you need to do is take a glue dot. It’s

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.239
just a little sticky dot, kind of rubbery.
You are going to attach that to the bottom

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:05.159
of your wick tab. As you can this is going
to hold everything in place on the bottom

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.629
of the jar so that the wick tab and wick don’t
float away once your hot wax is poured into

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.840
there.
