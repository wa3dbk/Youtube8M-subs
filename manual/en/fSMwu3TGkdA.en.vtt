00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.810
Hi, I'm Mike Robinson and welcome to the Pot
Kiln here in leafy, rural Berkshire. We specialise

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.710
in serving game and wild food and venison
and celebrating nature's bounty. Now, I provide

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.000
a lot of the wild food for this restaurant
myself. I'm a deer stalker, I'm a country

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.590
boy and I've had an Isuzu vehicle now for
seven years. This is my third one and this

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.260
is the one I've been waiting for. This is
the new D-Max. I've worked with Isuzu on this

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.530
and we've come up with a limited edition vehicle
that suits every single point of what I do.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.329
This is the perfect truck for me and I'm to
go around and show you why.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.739
So we've got no chrome on this vehicle to
reflect in the sunlight, that's all been taken

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.110
away. We've got non-flashy, non-chrome wheels,
that's also crucial. Good off-road tires,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.210
very, very important. You have a hard back
on this, improves performance and aerodynamics

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.250
and on the top there's a vent there, keeps
everything aired in there, it's not static,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.420
it's not gonna go stuffy. You've got the towing
bar, everything I need. Mounted nice and high

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.290
up, it's not going to smack down on the ground
when I go through a hollow. There's a reversing

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.970
camera just above the plate, very, very useful
in tight spots. We've also got reversing censors

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.130
on the back and I'm going to transfer all
my equipment now into this car, you can see

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.130
where everything goes. We've got some superb
lockable boxes here, and here. Just brilliant

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.030
to have somewhere safe and secure to put rifles,
ammunition, sighting equipment, lights, everything

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.270
away and out of sight. That locks.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.369
That means if I'm traveling and I need to
lock things up, just added security and peace

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.369
of mind. Now the law says when transporting
firearms, things like this, you have to have

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.669
them out of sight you have to have them secured
and safe. So I would already make these rifles

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:20.130
and shotguns secure by taking elements of
the weapon apart, take the bolt off them things

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.169
like that, and I would lock that probably
in the glove box in the front of the car.

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:31.910
Then ammunition can go in there, and that's
safe and again secure, and you're making those

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.880
thieves job's harder. A thing like this, the
police would be absolutely delighted by, it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.230
makes villains jobs harder to get at your
valuables. And of course the big thing is

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.850
whilst we can see these now, as soon as this
tailgate's shut, you can't see the boxes

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.250
you'd never know they were there. That's the
biggie, really.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.790
This is a great vehicle.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.070
Now looking from the front, the only change
in the normal Utah top-spec model is that

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.949
this would normally be a chrome front and
now we've changed it for one that isn't.

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:12.010
So first impressions when I get into the new
truck, really good, nice and solid, everything

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.970
we want right here which is terrific. I've
got the telephone, full bluetooth and sat-nav

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.139
and easy to use and for a thick country boy
like me that's very, very useful. Inside there's

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:28.260
all sorts of good bits, there's drink holders
in the right place, there's little compartments

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.530
and we love little compartments, I can put
all sorts in them. Drinks holder, that's invented

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.880
for drinks, fits my binoculars like a glove.
So I drop them in there, we might like to

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.139
think it was designed for them, keeping the
binoculars safe and out of the way. In here

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.790
we've got a USB connector, iPhones, excreta,
so everything can be connected up. Two-wheel

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.479
to four-wheel drive in low-ration button,
easy to find when you need it. Heated seats,

00:03:53.479 --> 00:04:00.479
that's a luxury I haven't had before, and
all in all I have say, comfy seats! They're

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.470
electric and adjustable, very nice indeed.
I think all I need to do now is take it for

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.680
a little drive.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.680
Now this is a two and half litre, twin-turbo
vehicle. Produces loads of torque, it's a

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.370
six-gear speed box. One of the things I've
always been really interested in, in a big

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.340
pickup truck like this, is fuel economy and
it's a huge issue now. I mean, petrol and

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.640
diesel cost a fortune, about Â£1.50 a litre.
So every master gallon you can get, especially

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.040
in a vehicle like this. Now the old one managed
about twenty-six on average to the gallon,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.590
maybe twenty-eight on a good day. Isuzu told
me that this will do thirty-six to the gallon

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.720
combined, which is obviously a huge leap.
On a motorway journey that probably means

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.720
that you'll go over forty and this is brand
new, it's only done a couple of hundred of

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.950
miles and accordingly we're already getting
thirty-three to the gallon combined and that

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.850
when we've been revving around country lanes
and things like that is pretty good.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.480
It's certainly lovely to drive, comfortable.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.480
It feels similar but a bit sharper than the
old one. So the engines a little bit more

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.530
responsive, the seats a little bit more comfortable.
The steering's very crisp, it's really responsive,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.480
so you really know where you're going with
it and the whole thing feels a little bit

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:29.560
lighter on it's feet, a little bit less agricultural.
Now I know having done the off-road course

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:36.210
in this that the off-road capabilities of
the D-Max are mind boggling, way ahead of

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.610
the old vehicle and that's fantastic. So I
know that it hasn't lost anything in strength

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:48.110
and ability, it does feel a little more more
refined on the road but what is all important

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:54.360
to me and frankly the most important to me
is that the whole vehicle is fit for purpose

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.120
and purpose for me means that I've got to
be able to drive to London, got a restaurant

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.860
there, I've got to be able to drive to Scotland,
to go filming, but I've also got to be able

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.080
to drive into a field, pick up deer, tow a
big trailer with a quad-bike on the back and

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.730
this will do all those things and more.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.730
Hope you enjoyed that quick introduction to
the new D-Max and particularly the Mike Robinson

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:25.610
limited edition one which is what I'm driving.
If you'd like any of the accessories or indeed

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.300
the whole pick up truck then talk to your
local dealer.
