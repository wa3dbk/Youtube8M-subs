MARK PESCE: Hello, I'm Mark Pesce from France.
I'm from France. And on behalf of Expert Village,

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:14.059
I'm going to show you how to cook a French
dessert called le poire belle Helene. So,

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:22.881
now once you have peeled all your pears, it
is time to take out the core, so with this

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:31.830
kind of knife, it's pretty easy, it should
be easy and I'm going to take this and we

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:42.390
take, the other part too. So you do this for
every pear, but you don't cut your pear. You

00:00:42.390 --> 00:01:04.339
just take out the core. So, I didn't say before,
but this meal takes 40 minutes to cook and

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:26.420
I think it's very important to know it, so
we have 40 minutes at least to cook. Okay,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.439
it's one of my favorite desserts when I go
to the restaurant because it's really, really

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:40.759
nice and like I said with ice cream, it's
refreshing. I like to-eat this kind of-it's

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.240
light, it's not very heavy. This kind of a
dessert, you know. You can have it after a

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:58.399
big meal and then it always makes you feel
light and happy about life. Okay, one more.

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:22.510
Well, last one, here we go. So now, we have
done this and we can move on to the next step,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.860
let's go for the [SPEAKS FRENCH]
