Welcome to WildStar. This is DevSpeak.

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:15.167
Do not feed the disclaimer.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.667
It's time to unleash the "People's Eyebrow" of classes...

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.533
He prefers to be known as...

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:23.533
The Warrior!

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:27.567
Our goal with the Warrior was to make 
a close range, brute force brawler

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:31.600
that uses high-tech weaponry 
and Atomic Energy to close distances,

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:32.967
generate threat,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:34.867
and bring the damages.

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:37.867
He is kind of a nuclear-powered-Swiss-army-knife...

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.200
attached to a pro wrestler.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.833
The Warrior comes fully loaded with:
a giant power sword,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.067
heavy armor,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.467
brute force,

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:50.367
and a cannon... on his arm...

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.133
a giant arm cannon.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.800
So first things first, 
the Warrior has this power sword

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.233
and he uses it to smash through 
anything that gets in his way.

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:00.833
WSSHH-BOOM!

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:03.900
Now, the Warrior's arm cannon 
can do a little bit of everything:

00:01:04.067 --> 00:01:05.533
Shoot this fool.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.700
Grapple that guy.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:08.267
Power saw this thing.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.300
Water some flowers.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.767
Then you've got my favorite part...
His 1980's wrestling moves.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:15.133
Bitch slap!

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:16.367
Body check!

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Power kick!

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:18.567
Power kick!

00:01:19.067 --> 00:01:20.533
Power kick to death.

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:23.233
I mean, what are these guys gonna do?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.267
You've got -

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.900
HEAVY ARMOR! Yeeeeah!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.067
And thanks to limited action set 
I can build my Warrior out sweet.

00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:34.000
I can roll him straight up tank,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.133
or go balls to the wall damage.

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.800
Maybe a healthy dose of both.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.567
So that's the Warrior.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.767
Get your eyeballs over to the website...
and smell what the Warrior is cookin'.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.600
And, drop us an elbow on social media.

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.000
Remember. The devs are listening.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.400
