00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.680
This is another of the works by the artist that centres on the theme of love

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.240
and which were so characteristic of his late period.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.320
 It is not known exactly when this work was painted or why.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.520
We do know that it was in the artist’s possession on his death

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.080
 and that representatives of the Spanish king purchased it from Rubens’ heirs. 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.880
 It is thus a private painting

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.040
and one undoubtedly connected with Rubens’ marriage in 1630 to Helena Fourment,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.400
 the young woman with whom he was so profoundly in love for the last ten years of his life.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.040
The three Graces constitute

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.840
a relatively minor myth within classical mythology. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.520
 These three figures are connected with the concepts of beauty and love 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.440
and are often depicted accompanying Venus to weddings, for example. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.920
They thus represent the gifts that the goddess

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.080
 could make to the couple about to be married.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.040
On occasions Rubens would refer to something that he had encountered, 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.680
such as a work of classical art or some characteristic of it, saying

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.400
 “not even the Graces could have made it more beautiful”.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.240
He thus identified them with the gift or quality of beauty and the capacity to create it.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.480
 There is a painting by the artist in a Florentine collection

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.760
 in which the god Mars is destroying all the good and positive things in life,  

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.040
including a small drawing of the Graces.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.080
Once again they can be seen as associated with the beauty of life that events such as war destroy.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.200
When Rubens painted The Three Graces he was celebrating the beautiful aspect of life, 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.120
 a beauty that he associated with love given that these figures traditionally accompany Venus.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.400
He was undoubtedly inspired to do so by the happiness that he felt at this period

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.920
 in relation to his marriage to Helena Fourment around the end of 1630.
