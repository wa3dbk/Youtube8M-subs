00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.750
This video shows you how to replace a print cartridge in your HP printer. Let's walk

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.590
through the steps together.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.320
The first thing to do is turn the printer on, so press the Power button.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:23.929
Next, open the access door.

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:28.810
Allow the carriage to stop moving. Then, find the cartridge you need to replace and lift

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.150
the lid on the cartridge to release it.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.860
Lift the cartridge out to remove it from the slot.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.860
Now, take the new cartridge out of its package.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:58.280
Pull the pink pull tab to remove the plastic tape from the new cartridge.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.900
When handling cartridges, be aware of the electrical contacts and ink nozzles.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.499
Be careful not to touch the contacts or ink nozzles because touching these can cause clogs,

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:11.890
ink failure, and poor electrical connections.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.820
Make sure you reinstall the cartridges in their correct slots.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.789
Tri-color on the left, and Black on the right.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.799
Holding the cartridge by its sides with the contacts facing the back of the printer, slide

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.929
it directly into the correct open slot. Close the cartridge lid to secure the cartridge

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.490
firmly in place.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.979
Repeat these steps to replace the other cartridge if necessary.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.380
When the cartridge installation is done, lower the cartridge access door.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.829
If you need to load paper, align the paper by tapping the stack on a flat surface. Then,

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.959
pull the paper tray straight out to extend it.

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:59.009
Load paper into the input tray until it stops. Slide the paper width guide inward until it

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.369
stops at the edge of the paper. Do not push the guide in so tightly that it starts to

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.579
bend the paper.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.719
Push the paper tray back into the printer.

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.450
After the cartridges are installed, the printer will automatically print an alignment page.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.080
Once the alignment page has completed printing, your printer will be ready for regular use.
