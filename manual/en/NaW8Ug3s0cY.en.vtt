Hey everyone, it's Tara Stiles, and welcome
to Livestrong Woman.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.740
So today, I'm going to show you how to make
a really simple granola that's really tasty,

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.840
and you can throw in all of your favorite
stuff.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.830
So we're just gonna start with a bowl, a baking
dish, and our oven preheated to 350 degrees.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.290
And all that goes in here is some rolled oats,
that's our base.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.160
And you can really put in all of your favorite
stuff.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.720
So, I have some sour cherries which I really
like there.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.890
So raisins are great too.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.220
This is a mix of dark chocolate and almonds
and some pecans, things like that.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.090
So that's gonna go in.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.270
Have some of these.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.430
And we have some sunflower seeds already a
little bit seasoned, so that's exciting.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.050
And to mix this all up, you can kinda just
start by hand a little bit, but it's going

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.750
to be some maple syrup and some coconut oil.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.120
So you're probably gonna use, depends on how
much you got in here, probably about a quarter

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.170
cup of coconut oil.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.390
So you can kinda measure it out -- the whole
less is more -- start with a little bit and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.710
then add as you go.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.810
And a little bit more of maple syrup, which
is very exciting.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.520
So, you could use your hands, or you could
use a spoon.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.789
So just kinda get in there, mix it all up,
make sure the whole situation is covered in

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:32.789
the liquid.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:34.850
And there we go.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.070
So we're gonna need more maple syrup and more
coconut oil.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.170
And this is gonna be awesome, so you'll never
have to buy cereal again.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.579
This is also great -- you can make this and
take it with you to work or wherever you're

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.539
going, and you can have a healthy, homemade
snack.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.299
And all your friends will say, "Hey, where
did you buy that granola?"

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.479
And you can say, "I made it myself."

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.869
And that's exciting.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.850
So here we go, it's looking all covered in
our nice mixture there.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.430
And going to add a little bit of cinnamon
here on top, or rather a lot of cinnamon,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.730
to get started, and then we'll give that a
good stir.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.300
So after you've gotten this all mixed pretty
thoroughly, we're just gonna spread it out

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.400
on our baking dish and throw it in the oven
for about 20 to 30 minutes.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.800
And you'll notice when it's done because it'll
get all crispy, and it'll look amazing.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.140
And you'll probably wanna eat it all warm,
which is fine too, because it'll taste really

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.200
good.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.290
So we're just spreading this out here on our
cookie sheet.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:51.220
And because its got the oil and the maple
syrup, you can use a wax paper or aluminum

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.230
foil if you want, but it works fine without
it as well.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.770
So, there we go.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.020
Looks all exciting.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.110
And get all our last little bits in here.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.110
So, don't wanna be wasteful.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.180
Alright, so, there we go.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.271
Looks pretty darn good already.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:11.390
And we're going in the oven.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.140
Alright, so we're gonna go check on our granola.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.120
Here we go.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.720
And it's looking pretty amazing.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.600
I gotta say, very excited.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.910
So, awesome, awesome, awesome.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.230
So be careful because your granola is gonna
be hot, and it should be, so that's okay.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.560
You wanna just kinda slide this into our bowl.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.380
Alright, so, pretty exciting.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.230
Again, really hot, so be careful.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.350
Don't spill it like I did, but that's okay
if you do.

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.730
Cleans up good.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.590
So I'm just gonna give it a little bit of
an airing out because I know it's really hot.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.360
But it looks so good, I have to try it.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.990
Now this is gonna make you a lot of friends.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.130
This granola is amazing.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.640
Try it out, let me know what you think.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.060
And I'll see you later.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.550
Bye.
