00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.160
Carbo circles - the most effective shreding and weight loss

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.220
We are here with a new video

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.900
Summer is here and everyone wants to show himself in the best condition

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.760
This video show you how to reduce your fat reserves really effectively

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.160
Did you try thousants various diets and no helps you? 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.400
In this video we tell you something about CARB CIRCLES

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.580
It's a special diet which certainly helps you not only to get rid of excess fat...

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.460
but also preserve your muscle muss

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.820
This method is mentally and physically very difficult

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.440
But this method is highly effective and you really achieve results which you always long for

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:12.680
The reduction of the subcutaneous fat is about 0,25 - 0,5 kg pure fat a week

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.560
You might thing it isn't dizzying speed

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.760
Let's compare it with diets like this: "I stop eating and I lose 10 kg per month"

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.420
After end of this "diet" the jojo effect will come

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.380
and you'll get back the 10 kg and sometimes with interest rate

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.780
So, this is not the right way and let's have a look at CARBO CIRCLES

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.820
It lies in alternating income of carbohydrates in a time period. Most often week. 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.480
If we want to force your body to burn fat we have to reduce energy income

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.240
At the same time we must not allow him to swich to saving mode, which would mean, that the metabolism would slow. 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:12.580
You have a lot of possibilites how to wave carbohydrates and it's just on you which one do you choose

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.500
The first principle

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.300
Keep your protein intake at a high value. 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.780
classic 2 g/kg of body weight

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.280
And carbohydrates like this: 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.580
Monday is incredibly difficult

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.080
You eat almost nothing but meat, fish and eggs

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.820
You're hungry, you'd eat even a mouse on a computer

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.880
Do you want lose weigh realy seriously? So go on..

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.020
Every other day is a bit better

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.920
On Sunday the metabolism works at full speed and burns a lot of energy

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.940
So now is the time to go back to the 50 g at the beginning

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:03.740
The body will of inertia burn fat but we supply almost no energy

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.680
Body doesn't switches to saving mode, because in the next days we raise the carbohydrates

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.580
Repeat this several times

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920
All system is very simple

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.920
Sources of carbohydrates: 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.160
Rise, pasta, potatoes, oat flakes

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.580
And you can google the others ;)

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240
Really important is: 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.160
to drink every day enough water

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.720
4-5 l of water a day. Preferably even more 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.080
If you respect this advices and if you add suitable training,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.500
 I guarantee you that you change your fat belly in a beautiful sixpack

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.100
