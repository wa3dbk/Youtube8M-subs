00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Vodka Red Bull by Drinks with Diablo

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Dîablø here, and today we're making 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the Vodka Red Bull.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What's the shortest video we've had so far?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Well, this is going to be the shortest after today.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
[ laughs ]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So anyway,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One and a half ounces of vodka,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and just top it of with Red Bull.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Red Bull has been a mixer that has been tearing it up 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
ever since the mid-90s in Europe,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the 2000s in the US.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Yeah, it's kind of here to stay.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Do you remember Zima?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
&gt;&gt; Q: Hmm?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Do you remember Zima?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
&gt;&gt; Q: Zima?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Zima. You don't remember Zima?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
&gt;&gt; Q: No, is that a drink?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Yeah, it was a drink.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It was like a clear type of drink.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
&gt;&gt; Q: Oh, THAT drink. It was off the HOOK.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
&gt;&gt; Q: Geez, you went there with drinks.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You've been around long enough.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you know that drink.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Yeah, whatever happened to that?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
&gt;&gt; Q: I don't know. That shit should still be popular.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Why is that not popular? That shit is unique.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: They don't even make it anymore.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
&gt;&gt; Q: Oh. Ugh...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: Yeah.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Another thing that's like weird, man, like this

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
- a bottle of Grey Goose

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
like if you were in a lounge in, even in Sacramento

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Like a bottle of Grey Goose, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
you and you buddies at a "VIP lounge"

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that's 200 dollars and then Red Bull is extra.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That's just TOO freaking much.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Are you kidding me?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Anyway,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So NOW

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
you know how to make one of the most popular cocktails

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
of the last fifteen years here,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
15 years here, 20 years in Europe.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
There you go, Vodka Red Bull.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
FNDC in the house.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We represent, Okay.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
