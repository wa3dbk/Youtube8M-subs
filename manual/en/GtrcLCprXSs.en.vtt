00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.240
Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village, our cake
has been baking for about 45 minutes. I'm

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.360
going to test it now and see if it's finished
cooking if not we'll put it back in the oven

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.560
and cook it for another 5 to 10 minutes. We're
going to insert a scorer or a toothpick in

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.929
the center of the cake and should come out,
not gooey but theres just still a little bit

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.790
cause its a very moist cake there might be
something on it, it's best that it will be

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:34.280
dry but it shouldn't be gooey so were going
to take a look. We'll just put the scorer

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.699
right in the center of the cake and pull that
out, that looks done, it's not gooey but still

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.079
a little bit of something on it, but it's
not a gooey. So we'll take that out and let

00:00:48.079 --> 00:01:01.160
it cool.
Let that cool on a metal rack till it's completely

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.820
cooled, as you can see right now it's very
high it will fall down a little bit and it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.600
may even fall down in the center. After 10
minutes of cooling we're going to remove the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.470
outer edge of the spring form pan and let
the cake cool down a little bit longer. The

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.200
cake has been cooling about 10 minutes I'm
going to remove the outer edge of spring form

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.990
pan let me show you how to do that. First
we'll peel down our outer tin foil, and loosen

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:42.700
the cake with a spatula all around, make sure
it's not sticking.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:54.030
And then just pull this and release it and
you see very gently remove that being careful

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.420
that not to pull the cake you go nice and
slow, there you go. Now we'll just cool until

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.900
it's completely cooled.
