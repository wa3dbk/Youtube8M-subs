00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:08.540
[cheery music plays]

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.349
Hon, hon, Marissa, are you home?

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.460
You're home early, what's up?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.260
Come on outside. I have a surprise for you.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.260
A surprise?

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.630
Yes. Cover your eyes. Cover your eyes? Can
you see?

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.630
No.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.810
Come on. Keep them covered. Keep your eyes
closed hon.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.619
[door slams shut on Marissa]

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.070
This way, hon. Right this way. Just down here.
What do you think?

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.910
[stupid audience laughs loudly]

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.809
It's ours. I bought it. I quit the law firm.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.879
You quit? You were up for partnership.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:02.809
Oh, sure, a partnership, but then what? Can't
you see what a dead end that job was? You

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.770
know, hon, I've never told this to anyone
before, but when I was a kid, I always wanted

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.770
to be a fireman.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.020
Everyone wants to be a fireman when they are
a kid.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.190
Yeah, but they never do anything about it!

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.200
Yes they do, they grow up and join the fire
department! Alright, how did you pay for it?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.280
Well, I used our savings and I mortgaged the
house.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:36.860
[picks her up before she falls on the ground]
This is a fireman's carry, hon. Pretty good,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.860
huh?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:49.929
Hon, I've been thinking. I think it would
be a great idea if I was to cut a hole in

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:52.880
the bedroom floor and I was to get a pole
and-

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.450
No, not a chance. Forget it.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.030
[alarm rings loudly]

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:15.050
[firetruck alarm and horn go off loudly]

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:39.250
Turn it off. I said turn it off! I got ballet
practice with my daughter at five in the morning.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.390
I don't need this. I want her to be a good
balerina.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.000
[speaking into firetruck's loudspeaker] It's
okay, everybody. It's just a drill.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:06.060
No, it's not okay! It's not okay! It is not
okay!

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.440
[cheery music plays]

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.360
[door opens]

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.280
[dalmation barks]

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.120
Marissa, is that you?

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.580
Uh-huh.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:30.750
Are you hungry, hon? I've got dinner on. And
I baked a cake.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.720
Slow day, huh?

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.101
Well, you know how it is with a new business.
It'll pick up.

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:38.850
[firetruck alarm comes from outside the house]

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.480
[horns begin honking outside]

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.200
What the hell?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.830
[knocks heavily on door]

00:03:48.830 --> 00:04:01.540
[real fireman laugh mockingly under their
breath at him as they exit the house]

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.930
Hey, thanks guys. Thank you. Thank you for
coming.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.670
What the hell is going on?

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:18.310
Oh, it was nothing. It was just a grease fire
that got- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I forgot.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.400
You couldn't call?

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.850
Oh, look, I'm sorry. I'm just-

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.740
It just doesn't make sense not to call.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.870
I know, but you dial them-

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.280
I mean, I'm right across the street.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.530
I know, but you dial them out of habit. Ya
know?

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.130
Yeah right!

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:44.230
I'll- I'll put you on my speed dial.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:50.580
[cheery music plays]

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:05.410
[fire truck horn and siren blares loudly]

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.340
May the best man win.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.340
Hon, are you home?

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.340
In here.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.340
Guess what?

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.340
What?

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.630
I got rid of the fire engine.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:19.240
[breathes sigh of relief before looking out
window] Oh, no. You're not a policeman now

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240
are you?

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.940
No, I'm under arrest. Apparently it's illegal
to interfere with the fire department in the

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.030
performance of their duties.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.090
[slaps hand on his left shoulder] Got to take
you in now, pop.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.503
Okay. Oh, don't worry, hon, I think I can
get me off. Ya know I'm a pretty good lawyer.

00:05:38.503 --> 00:05:40.070
Oh, honey. It's so good to hear you say that.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.070
Come on.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.680
[studio audience applauds and cheers loudly]
