00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.130
We're going to do a very traditional
eye makeup look.

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.990
And it's very quick and very simple.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.260
And it will definitely
make your eyes pop.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.510
Perfect.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.270
Let's start out with concealing around
your eyes just to get everything even.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.435
And so that when I put the eye
shadow on we really see that.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:27.940
And we don't see any type
of discoloration.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.250
So I'm using the ZuZu concealer.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.905
And I'm going to use the Mineral
Fusion concealer brush.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:44.250
And I'm just patting and pressing right
under your eyes, right up to

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.610
your lash line.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.740
And then right up here
on the inner part.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.030
Because that's the area that tends to
cast a shadow, that a lot of people

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.310
think they have under eye circle's,
but they don't.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.716
OK.

00:00:58.716 --> 00:01:05.129
And then I'm going in with a sponge
and patting and pressing.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.990
Now look straight up for me.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.560
I'm going to start from the outside.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.593
And the great thing about this sponge
is I can get it right up

00:01:10.593 --> 00:01:11.843
to your lash line.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.240
And then just blend it down.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.610
Whether you have a tinted moisturizer or
a foundation on, just blend it down

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.890
right into that.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.500
Now I'm going to set this, because
concealer will crease like crazy if

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.650
you don't set it with a powder.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.550
And what I'm going to use for that
is the pressed powder foundation.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.315
And I'm actually going to
go in with a sponge.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.590
Look straight up.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.630
And just start at the base of your
lash line and work down.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.535
And lastly, I'm just going to
blend with the powder brush.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.985
The next part we're going
to go into is highlight.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.610
So I'm going to use the
Mineral Fusion Trio.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.699
But I'm only going to use the
highlighter, or the light color.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:14.840
So again, just using the eye
shadow brush, placing it,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.590
tapping off the excess.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.290
Close your eyes.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.590
And I like to start--

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.560
like I said, where ever you place
it first is the most saturated--

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.250
so right here, right under
the arch of your eyebrow.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.000
And then work my way out.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.790
And just a little bit in.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.320
You don't need to use a lot
of highlight in there.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.382
OK.

00:02:36.382 --> 00:02:40.100
And finally I'm going to add a little
highlight to your eye lid.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.720
So I'm using the same shadow brush.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.120
Start right at the base.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.820
Press it in.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.490
OK.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.880
I'm going to do something a little
bit different this time.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.380
I'm going to use the bronzer, instead of
an eye shadow, in your crease line

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.690
for your contour.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.770
I'm going to use the mat bronzer
from Mineral Fusion.

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:04.930
And I start kind of in the center
of your crease line.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.860
And just very gently
go back and forth.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.070
And I'm starting at the center, like I
said, because that's the area that's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.180
going to be the most saturated, that
I really want to be contoured.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.006
And I just want it to lightly blend out
into the center of the eye, and

00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:24.120
then the outer eye.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.460
OK.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.510
So the next part we're going to do is,
I'm going use the bronzer that I used

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.220
in your crease.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.840
I'm going to use it underneath your
eyes just to give you a little bit

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.070
more depth, but it's still going
to look very natural.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.610
So again, I'm using the contour brush.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.450
I'm going in with the bronzer.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.820
And again, I'm going to hold this
perpendicular to your eye.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.145
And we can just press it, because
I want a very soft look.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.806
And now I'm going to sweep it.

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.740
So because we're doing a natural
look, it's another reason

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:05.020
why I chose the bronzer.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.010
Less is more, especially
with the natural look.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.250
Now I'm going to go in
with the eye pencil.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.950
And I'm going to use this right
on your top lash line.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.329
Just to enhance your lash line and give
you a little bit-- it kind of

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.880
lengthens your eyelashes.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.390
This is a really pretty taupe brown.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.770
Close your eyes.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.940
And I'm just placing it right
on your lash line.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.180
The next step is mascara.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.440
I'm going to use a spoolie.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.910
So put this on.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.130
And this is the graphite Mineral
Fusion lengthening mascara.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.044
Look straight down.

00:04:49.044 --> 00:04:53.900
OK, so the center, the base,
and kind of wiggle it.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.480
Now we'll go to the corner.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.680
Get at the base.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.006
Kind of wiggle it.

00:04:59.006 --> 00:05:03.320
Now I got a little bit of mascara
on your eyelid, which

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.565
happens all the time.

00:05:04.565 --> 00:05:07.460
I'm going to let it dry and I'll show
you real easy trick to take it off, so

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.840
that you do mess up your makeup.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.720
But I have to let it dry.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.015
So I'm going to do the other eye.

00:05:11.015 --> 00:05:12.380
Great.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.630
All right, look straight down.

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:20.590
All right.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.180
OK.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.593
Now lets clean you off.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.670
So I have a clean cotton swap.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:31.510
Look straight up.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.250
And I'm putting it right on to
where the little mascara is.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.312
And then twist this.

00:05:38.312 --> 00:05:41.770
And it just removes it.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.010
OK.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.606
So let's get the rest
of your mascara on.

00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:46.640
Look down.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.180
So I'm going to coat the top and I'm
just putting it at the base and

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.430
twirling it up.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.650
And for the bottom I just
go back and forth.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.500
I don't put it on like I do on the top,
because it gets a little bit too

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.730
thick sometimes.

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.200
All right.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.430
Last step.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.120
Eyebrows.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.036
So the same pencil that I used
on your lash line, I'm going

00:06:13.036 --> 00:06:14.020
to use on your brows.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.705
I'm just going right along
the edge of your brow.

00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:25.970
And just doing little, like
hair like motions.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:31.300
And really, wherever I see a gap,
that's where I'm filling in.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.200
Now say you didn't have this pencil,
but you have an eye shadow that's a

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.170
similar color.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.650
You can use an eye shadow.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.900
All right.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.410
Let's brush off any excess
of anything I see.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.660
All right.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.606
So that's it.

00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:53.970
That's it?

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.690
That's a natural, it's a very
basic standard makeup look.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:02.285
And again, you can take this from
daytime, natural, into a more dramatic

00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:03.260
evening look.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.740
I love it.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.560
Thank you, so much.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.160
You're welcome.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:17.104
