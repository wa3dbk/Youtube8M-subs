00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
(Use this guide for easy cathedral ceiling ideas!)

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.980
The basic tools that you'll be needing are:

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.560
blocks of wood,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.020
tape measure,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.960
painters tape,

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.000
electric screwdriver,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.440
screws,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.280
caulking gun,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.340
electric or handsaw,

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.100
wood filler,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.080
chalk line,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.740
stud finder,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.840
and drywall anchors may be necessary.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.720
Measure the dimensions of the interior opening of the faux beams.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.272
Using this measurement you will cut blocks of wood

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.380
that will then be used to mount the beams on the ceiling.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.060
We call these installation blocks.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.560
For an easier installation
we will now drill holes into the blocks for the screws.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.960
For a cathedral ceiling
we will be double layering the installation blocks.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.300
This will give us the necessary depth to attach the faux beam.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.580
You will typically want to install the blocks on the ceiling every 4-5 feet.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.000
We suggest that you mark the location
of the installation blocks with painters tape

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.220
so that you can find the blocks,
once the beams have been placed over the blocks.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.580
if you need to cut the beam to the necessary length,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.400
a handsaw or electric saw will work fine.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.740
Once you have cut the beam to the necessary length,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.860
lightly sand the edge of the beam to ensure a snug fit.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.700
Apply adhesive to the edge of the faux beam.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.900
This will ensure a secure installation.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.540
Slide the beam over the installation blocks,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.000
and send a screw through the side of the beam
securing it to the mounting block.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.940
You will want to countersink the screw.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.500
Use wood filler to cover up the screws.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.940
The faux beam should butt up against the ceiling nicely.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.899
However in some cases you may want to run a small line of walnut caulk

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.820
between the beam and the ceiling to aid in the aesthetics.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.760
By following these simple steps you will be able to change your plain room

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.220
into a room with character and warmth.
