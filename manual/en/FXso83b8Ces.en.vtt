00:00:05.327 --> 00:00:06.874
Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.787
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:23.951
Rinse the rice beforehand and place it into a rice cooker.

00:00:25.932 --> 00:00:28.942
Add the kombu and bonito dashi stock 

00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:34.328
but use slightly less liquid compared to regular steamed rice.

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.703
Distribute the rice evenly.

00:00:40.228 --> 00:00:46.833
Next, cut the chicken breast into 1cm or half inch cubes.

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.349
Place the chicken pieces into a bowl.

00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:57.555
Add the sake, 

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.163
salt, 

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:02.729
soy sauce 

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:05.528
and mirin, 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.003
and lightly stir.

00:01:10.843 --> 00:01:13.969
And now, let’s cut the vegetables.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:20.104
Cut about a 3cm or 1 inch thick piece of the carrot.

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:25.414
Slice it into 5mm or quarter inch slices 

00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:28.338
and chop it into fine strips.

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:32.357
Then, add the carrot to the bowl.

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:35.153
Make numerous shallow cuts 

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:38.811
around the gobo, burdock root lengthwise.

00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:44.670
Then, shave the gobo with a knife while gradually rotating it.

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:47.730
This cutting method, known as Sasagaki 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.165
will help to make the firm gobo root easier to eat.

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.966
Lightly rinse to keep it from discoloring, 

00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.859
squeeze out the water 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:01.165
and place it into the bowl.

00:02:02.582 --> 00:02:05.499
Detach the stem of the shiitake mushroom 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.956
and remove the bottom end.

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:14.040
Slice the cap into 6mm or quarter inch slices.

00:02:14.894 --> 00:02:18.871
Thinly slice the stem using diagonal cuts.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.309
Tear apart the maitake mushrooms 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.071
and trim into bite-size pieces with a knife.

00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:32.834
With a paper towel, 

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:38.350
remove the excess oil from the aburaage, thin deep-fried tofu.

00:02:38.417 --> 00:02:44.802
Cut it in half and slice it into 6mm or quarter inch strips.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:49.951
Add the shredded ginger root to the bowl.

00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:55.036
Toss to coat all the ingredients with the seasonings.

00:02:55.036 --> 00:02:58.829
Then, let it marinate for 10 minutes.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:03.190
Now, let’s cook the takikomi gohan.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.049
Place the ingredients and marinade into the rice cooker.

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.925
Gently distribute them on top of the rice.

00:03:12.912 --> 00:03:16.229
Cover and turn on the rice cooker.

00:03:16.398 --> 00:03:20.227
Avoid mixing the rice and the ingredients before cooking 

00:03:20.227 --> 00:03:23.619
otherwise the dish will not cook evenly.

00:03:25.392 --> 00:03:29.003
Now, the takikomi gohan is ready to serve.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.777
Lightly mix with a rice paddle.

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.570
Place the takikomi gohan into a rice bowl.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:49.377
Finally, top with the chopped mitsuba parsley.

00:03:50.996 --> 00:03:54.149
Thoroughly marinate the ingredients before cooking 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:56.674
so that the dish is more palatable.

00:03:57.202 --> 00:04:01.456
Gobo is one of the commonly eaten vegetables in Japan.

00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:05.380
You can leave it out if it’s not available in your area.

00:04:12.732 --> 00:04:17.596
Adding the sake will help to bring out the subtlties of the vegetables 

00:04:17.596 --> 00:04:21.401
and reduce the strong aroma of the chicken.

00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.992
Good luck in the kitchen.
