00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.980
So the market for computer cases is now big,
so big that sometimes, some of the features

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.340
that are made to compete with other manufacturers
are not even used for the mainstream people,

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.559
or the average joe as you might call it.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.640
But lets not forget that some, are definitely
useful for a specific type of user.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.910
But what happens when you just want a simple
case, that you can build into, thats easy

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.720
to manage, has a decent design and a very,
very affordable price.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:46.280
Well ladies and gentleman, meet, the Bitfenix
Comrade.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:52.929
I wanna emphasize that the Bitfenix Comrade
is a very affordable case, comes in at only

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:59.120
RM159, ideal price for you to build a fully
functional, even a powerful gaming or workstation

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.319
PC.

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.939
The packaging seems decent, a "just enough"
amount of cushioning to secure it when shipping

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.310
and graphical images of the case are printed
on the sides and oh, here are the tech specs

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.310
of the case.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.090
The case supports micro ATX, mini ITX and
ATX motherboards.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.640
Its made of mostly steel for the frame and
plastic for the rest.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.990
Has three 5.25" bays, three 2.5" bays and
three more 3.5" bays.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.539
Comes in black or white and 1 120mm rear fan
is included.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.689
The Comrade has a simple and compact look
to it.

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.820
Three 5.25" bays and a Bitfenix case badge
at the bottom.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.560
There are also ventilation holes at the lower
part of the front.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.600
Taking off the front panel is easy and immediately
you see a filter that is removable and mountable

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.090
with 120mm fans.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.090
Nice touch.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.920
Though, I do recommend pressure optimized
fans seeing that its a bit cramped in there.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.889
On the left side is a cutout for your side
panel and on the right is just a plain empty

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:04.889
panel.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:09.869
At the bottom there is a dust filter for your
PSU and there are 4 rubberized feet to help

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.070
with the PSU ventilation. on the top there
is no ventilation holes and you might ask,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.140
where are the front ports?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.390
If you noticed the front ports are actually
on the right side here.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.409
There is a microphone jack, a headphone jack
and a USB 2 port and USB 3 port.

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.760
A power button and a reset button.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.840
At the back we see the cutout for your motherboard
I/O ports and this is where your 120mm fan

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.840
is mounted.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.790
2 holes for your water cooling, 7 expansion
slots for that ATX motherboard support and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.010
another cutout for your bottom mounted PSU.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.240
I wanna check out the back first.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.860
The Bitfenix Comrade back has a rather tight
space for cable management and there are some

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.830
cable anchors points.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.700
Some cutouts for your cables to pass through
and a big enough cutout for your CPU backplate.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.569
Taking a look inside there are cables for
your front panel, thank god its mostly black

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.950
in color.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:13.330
This is the motherboard tray and there you
can see there is the included 120mm fan.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:22.680
The Bitfenix Comrade has 3 2.5" bays for your
SSD's and 3 3.5" bays for your Hard disks.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.410
At the bottom is where you mount your PSU,
no rubber stubs here but at least its elevated

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.129
to allow more air in.

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.040
One thing though, because the Bitfenix Comrade
is a compact mid tower case, you can use your

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.079
PSU to exhaust air out as well.

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:44.519
Again the Bitfenix Comrade comes in at RM159
or ... in the states.

00:03:44.519 --> 00:04:10.480
I have to remind you that its a truly budget
oriented case with a touch of style added

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.810
and useful features.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:15.810
Good for you Bitfenix.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:23.140
Bitfenix Comrade, I dub thee, Era of The Geeks,
Silver award!

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:30.360
The only minus is there could be better cable
management room at the back, and some rubber

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.310
grommets for the cutouts would be nice to
enhance the looks of the case, even if they

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.310
had to add a bit more cost to it.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.360
There are more pros though.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.480
So its perfect for people who are just starting
to build their own PC's.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.600
Its got the proper ventilation, great room
for storage, overall good build quality, its

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.190
cheap and best of all it still looks nice
and clean.

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.130
Again guys thats it for my video today, like
or dislike the video, comment and subscribe.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.400
I'll see you next time, and as always, era
of the geeks baby.
