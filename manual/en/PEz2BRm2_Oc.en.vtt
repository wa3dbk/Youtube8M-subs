[music starts]

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:21.733
hello, today we're going to do a short introduction of the MDX-650P

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:24.267
a great general use professional level tool

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.400
that gives you the capability of testing batteries

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:27.933
starters and alternators

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.200
all in the vehicle and with one simple hookup

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.167
here's some of the options that are here

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:33.933
the feature set available

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:36.000
in this MDX-650P

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.000
includes simply viewing or printing

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.233
the previous or last test result

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:42.400
we've got a quality control mode

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:44.467
typically used in inventory control

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.267
we can export the data

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.100
through the IR port on the side

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.167
to an accessory printer if we had one of those

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.900
we can perform a test

00:00:52.133 --> 00:00:54.233
we actually have language selection on each tool

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.233
we have English, Spanish, French, and Portugese

00:00:58.867 --> 00:01:01.100
also can go down, continue scrolling

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.133
where we can add the address, shop address

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:04.600
setting the date and time

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:06.400
those are all standard units

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.900
the counter, this tells you the number of tests that were done

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:11.567
and the decisions that were accompanying each of those tests

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:14.067
we've got the contrast for the screen

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.667
and also the temperature units, whether its Celsius or Fahrenheit

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.533
if you choose to select one of those

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:21.900
and you can simply use it as a voltmeter as well

00:01:21.933 --> 00:01:23.400
is you select that final screen

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:26.200
now that we've got all those options identified

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.200
let's go ahead, hook up the cable set

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:30.467
and then I'll get in the van and we can get a test done

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:32.033
on this particular vehicle that's in question

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:33.133
[music changes]

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:36.133
alright, we've got the MDX-650P hooked up at the battery

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.433
and I've jumped inside the vehicle

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:40.167
let's go ahead and see if we can initiate a test

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.100
yes we are in vehicle

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.933
it is a top post battery

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.100
a traditional flooded battery

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.467
it's is rated in CCAs

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.900
and 600 is the value

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.900
we're completing the battery test

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.633
and the decision comes up, good battery

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.200
12.80 volts

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.767
523 CCAs

00:02:02.233 --> 00:02:04.200
I'm going to hit the prompt that says to start the engine

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.833
[engine starts]

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.667
[seat belt fasten warning tone]

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.233
we measured 11.42 as the average starting voltage

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:13.300
during the crank process

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.267
and the crank time is 1.29 seconds

00:02:17.767 --> 00:02:18.900
going to hit enter

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.167
checking for alternator output

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.000
rev the engine with the loads off

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:27.100
this means bring the engine up to about 1,500 to 2,000 rpm

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:28.300
and hold the rpm

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:30.667
[engine reving]

00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:33.633
engine rev detected, idle engine

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:34.833
drop it back to idle

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:36.267
hit next

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:40.367
testing alternator at idle with the loads off

00:02:40.567 --> 00:02:42.500
now it's asking for turning the high beams on

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.467
want to put my left foot on the brake pedal

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.533
blower motor on high

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:48.800
and rear defroster on

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.500
now I'm going to hit enter

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.767
testing alternator with the loads on

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.467
now bring the rpm back up to 1,500 to 2,000

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500
hold it

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:00.600
[engine reving]

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:02.333
rev detected, idle engine

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:04.067
[engine reving down to idle]

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:05.733
hit enter

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.033
instructions to turn everything off

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.867
the test is already done

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.867
[seat belt fasten warning tone]

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.067
charging system reports no problem

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:22.267
no load voltage was 14.33

00:03:22.667 --> 00:03:25.233
loaded voltage was 14.28

00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:28.400
there's the good battery result

00:03:28.867 --> 00:03:31.200
there's the cranking test, the result is normal

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.333
charging system is normal

00:03:33.667 --> 00:03:35.533
this vehicle is ready to go back on the road

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.500
but lets print out a copy of this test result

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:39.233
so we can share it with our customer

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.233
complete our billing process

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.033
and go on to the next job

00:03:43.067 --> 00:03:45.100
[printer sounds]

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:49.067
[paper tearing]

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:51.800
the printed result is exactly what you saw on the screen

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.233
you can put your dealership

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.000
or site name

00:03:56.233 --> 00:03:57.367
into the top of the printout

00:03:57.533 --> 00:03:58.533
the battery test was good

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.100
there's the values

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:02.933
regular flooded battery, in vehicle, top post

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.167
cranking system normal

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.233
charging system, no problems

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.100
we've just completed doing a full system test

00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:12.200
with the MDX-650P

00:04:12.533 --> 00:04:15.567
we've been able to document that the battery, starter, and alternator

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:17.233
are all functioning as expected

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:18.933
no problems with this vehicle

00:04:19.167 --> 00:04:21.067
we've been able to print out a copy of the results

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.400
that we can share with our customer

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.900
this car is good to go

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.133
let's put it back on the street

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.900
and make room for the next job in the shop

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:30.133
