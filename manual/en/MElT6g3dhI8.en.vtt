00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.500
I have made the first move.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.000
That is all they know.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.600
Doesn't it ever wake you in the night,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.189
the feeling that someday they will pass
that foolish law, or one just like it,

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.400
and come for you?

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.800
And your children?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.460
It does indeed.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.500
No. I don't think so, Scott.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.769
While Eric is capable of organizing something like this from prison...

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:50.650
...for him it would be irrational.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.470
It would only hurt his goal of mutant prosperity.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.239
- You mean superiority.
- You're right. If Eric had his way-

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.019
Of course, you know how the government will
respond.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.460
They'll reintroduce the Registration Act.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.439
Or worse. The president could declare a state
of emergency.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:07.800
Place every mutant in the country under arrest.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.100
We're here to stay, Mr. President. The next
move is yours.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.400
We'll be watching.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800
In chess, the pawns go first.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.200
Their isolation, their hopes, their ambitions.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500
I tell you, we are at the start of something
incredible, Erik.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.500
We can help them.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.200
Can we?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.000
Identification, that's how it starts.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.470
And ends with being rounded up, experimented on, eliminated.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.390
Not this time.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.440
We have common enemies. Shaw, the Russians.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.120
They need us.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.100
For now.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.200
Cuba.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300
Russia, America.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.800
It makes no difference.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.780
Shaw has declared war on mankind, on all of us.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.200
He has to be stopped.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.200
I'm not going to stop Shaw.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.200
I'm going to kill him.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
Do you have it in you to allow that?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.970
You've known all along why I was here, Charles.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.400
Many of the humans tried to help us, it was
a slaughter.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.930
Leaving only the worst of humanity in charge.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.300
I've been in a lot of wars.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.680
I've never seen anything like this.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.820
And it all starts with her.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.840
Let's just say that for the sake of, sake
that...

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.830
I choose to believe you, that I choose to
help you...

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.000
Raven won't listen to me.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Fancy a game? It's been a while.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.520
It's been a while since I played.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.500
I'll go easy on you.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.900
Might finally get a fair fight.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.800
You have the first move.
