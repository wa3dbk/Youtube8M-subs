00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:25.300
It is easy to understand why someone, having
just watched the Lord of the Rings, would

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.029
want to experience more and relive the epic
battles that they saw.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.670
Truly climatic fights at Helm’s Deep, Minas
Tirith, Isengard and Moria.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.100
The Lord of the Rings: Conquest tries to bring
that feel from the books and movies, only

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:52.760
in an interactive way, having you being one
of the soldiers fighting for control of Middle-Earth.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.730
The game could be described as Battlefield
1942 mixed with Lord of the Rings hack and

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.730
slash.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.500
You pick your class of warrior and go into
battle from spawn points.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.430
You can either be a Warrior, a strong melee
type, the Archer, who shoots arrows from a

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.670
far, the Scout, a stealthy assassin, or the
Mage, who can cast magic to aid your side

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.020
and hurt your enemies.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.869
And sometimes you get to take control of a
hero, a memorable character who has increased

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:23.990
abilities.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.659
Each class has its own unique specials and
enhancements, making them feel different and

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:35.549
play different.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.090
There are two separate campaigns in the game.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.929
One is the War of the Ring, where you control
men, elves, and dwarves to fight against the

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.630
forces of evil and hope to destroy them.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.100
The other, “The Rise of Sauron,” is played
from the other side, with you playing as the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.770
bad guys and trying to conquer the land.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.979
It’s cool to be able to see a campaign shown
from the evil perspective.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:11.420
Who doesn’t want to control the world and
wipe out those pesky hobbits.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.040
The battles are designed to give the feel
of the epic fights from the books and movies,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.190
but just doesn't really deliver as much as
you would like.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.220
The areas appear to be large, open environments
with multiple objectives and areas to conquer,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.340
but how it plays is rather linear, with you
moving from one area to the next.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.690
The enemies will just charge at you, with
you mowing your way through them will relative

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:41.549
ease, especially if you pick the archer as
you can just sit back and blast away.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.450
It has kind of the feel of Star Wars Battlefront,
with you capturing objectives, but the linear

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.110
nature, done with the intent of making the
levels more epic, holds back the true openness

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.909
that made Battlefront so great.

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:58.060
And because of this, the combat feels like
just moving from place to place, hacking and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.409
slashing everything in the way, which don’t
get me wrong has it merits, but doesn’t

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.250
live up to the greatness the battles are based
on.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.550
The Lord of the Rings: Conquest is by no means
a bad game, it just doesn’t live up to the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.579
high standard the movies set, which is understandable
because that bar was set pretty darn high.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.440
It is close to being a great game, but instead
must settle on being alright.
