00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.170
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.250
Hi.  This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.750
In my most recent tutorial, I showed you how to create

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.830
this "Glitch Art" image from your own photo.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.210
Now, I'll show you how to create this one using different methods.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.840
I provided a PSD file for you to download, so you can follow along.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.300
Its link is located in the video description or project files.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.900
It includes this artifact and a full-screen, RGB glitch.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.659
Open a photo you'd like to use.

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:43.780
Press "v" to open your Move Tool and drag your photo on to the tab of

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.809
the glitch art document.  Without releasing,

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.059
drag it down onto the image and then, release.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.199
To re-size and position it, open yourTransform Tool

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:59.589
by pressing Ctrl or Cmd + T.  If your photo is too large to see the

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.309
entire Transform Tool,

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.910
press Ctrl or Cmd + 0.  Drag it into position

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.290
and then, go to a corner.  When you see a diagonal, double-arrow,

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.320
hold down Shift + Alt on Windows

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.610
or Shift + Option on a Mac and drag it in.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.870
Then, press Enter or Return.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.000
To see your photo at 100%, press Ctrl or Cmd + 1.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.050
Open your Rectangular Marquee Tool,

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.100
go to the top, left corner 
and drag a selection across your entire image.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.380
Then, go to Image

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.230
and Crop.  This crops your photo to the size of the glitch document.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.200
To deselect it, press Ctrl or Cmd + D

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.909
Go to Filter,

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.210
Pixelate and Pointilize. Make the Cell Size: 3

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.580
and click OK.  Go back to Filter,

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.149
Other and Offset.  For this example,

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.519
we're offsetting the photo to the right by 100 pixels.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.420
For your photo, have fun experimenting with different amounts

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.749
offsetting it horizontally and/or vertically.

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:25.480
However, make sure the Undefined Areas
are "Set to Transparent".  This allows us to

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.269
see the RGB glitch beneath it in the Layers panel.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.090
When you're happy with its Offset settings, click OK.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.529
Click the Adjustment Layer icon

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:43.000
and choose Hue/Saturation.  Slide the Saturation amount to minus 100

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.689
to completely remove the color.  
Notice it removed the color of the photo,

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.629
as well as the color of the RGB glitch. It didn't effect the artifacts.

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.739
The reason for this is because Adjustment Layers

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.239
effect all layers beneath them in the
Layers panel, but no layers above them.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.359
That's why the Glitch layer is de-saturated

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:09.430
and the artifacts layer isn't.  
To make the adjustment layer effect only the photo,

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.870
we need to clip it to that layer.  To do this,

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.100
click the "clip-to-layer" icon or you can
press Ctrl or Cmd + G on WIndows

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.800
or Cmd + Option + G on Mac.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.450
Notice the adjustment layer moved to the right.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.340
This indicates that it's now clipping or
effecting just the one layer beneath it.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.400
You can see that the photo is now the
only layer that's effected by the adjustment layer.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.930
We're ready to add some text.  Open your Horizontal Type Tool

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.469
and choose a font. I'm using,

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.819
"Arial Regular" at a size of 50 points...

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.709
Sharp... Right alignment and White for the color.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.010
Click on your document and type out your text.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.749
To reposition it, click your Move Tool

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:00.800
and move it.

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:09.239
Click this icon and choose "Convert to Smart Object".

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.930
It added this small icon to let us know that the layer is now

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.850
a Smart Object.  Doing this allows us to change the text,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.390
while retaining all the effects and filters we'll be adding to the original.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.500
Go to Filter, Blur and Motion Blur.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.100
Make the Angle: 0 degrees and the Distance: 10 pixels.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.100
Then, click OK.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.060
To make the entire image pop more, let's adjust its Levels.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.700
Make the top layer active and click the adjustment layer icon.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.800
Choose, Levels.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.500
Make the Input black: 100.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.840
Next, we'll distort the image.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.920
Go to the bottom layer and hold down Shift

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.000
as you click on it to highlight all the layers between it

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.930
and the top layer.  Open the fly-out list

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.500
and click "Convert to Smart Object".

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.460
Go to Filter, Distort and Shear.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.310
The Shear window will open.  Tick "Wrap Around"

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.500
and drag the vertical, center line to distort your image.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.600
Then, click OK.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.960
If you want to move and/or change your text

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.190
without having to redo it effects, double-click the Smart layer

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:36.200
and when you see this message, click OK.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:44.500
Make your Smart text layer active and
double-click it to open your text in its original state.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.540
 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.390
When you see this message, click OK.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:52.970
If your text is white, it'll be a little difficult to see.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.570
Double-click the large "T" to highlight it and type out your new text.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.200
Don't be concerned if it's too long to see it in the window, 
we'll take of care that in a second.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.630
 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.030
Click your Move Tool and open your Transform Tool.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.770
Re-size and position your text in the window.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.300
Then, click the small "x" on your text's tab

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.000
and when you see this message, 
click "Yes" to save any changes you made.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:26.800
Notice, your text immediately updated all
the effects and filters we applied to the original text.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.830
 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.640
To enlarge it, open your Transform Tool.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.680
This message is telling us that the Smart Filters will be applied to it

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.000
after we use the Transform Tool.  Click OK.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.810
Re-size and position your new text on your image.

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:50.000
Then, press Enter or Return.  
It instantly updated the filters and effects.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:53.820
Click on the small "x" on the tab and click

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.390
"Yes" to save the changes.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.550
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.210
Thanks for watching!
