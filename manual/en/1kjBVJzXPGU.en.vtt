[music]

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.330
Tonno Pro would like to introduce the newest
member of our product line, the hard folding

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.400
tri fold tonneau cover.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.150
TonnoPro tonneau covers are still among the
best selling and highest quality tonneau covers

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.060
on the market today.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.590
Aside from the unmistakeable quality, is how
easy the Tonno Pro hard folding cover is to

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.820
install.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.890
Like our most popular soft tri-folding cover,
the hard folding cover installs in a matter

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.370
of minutes.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.750
[music]

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.640
Tonno Pro hard folding covers are light weight
and easy to install by yourself.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.890
[music]

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.960
Just center the cover on the front end of
the bed and check the alignment on both sides

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.501
of the truck.

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:53.390
The next step is to begin to tighten the clamps
in the front until they are snug.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.840
Repeat this step on the opposite side of the
truck.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.770
Next, unclip the snap clips on the front end
of the cover, allowing the cover to unfold.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.700
[music]

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.810
The next step is to begin to adjust the rear
EZ clamps at the rear of the bed, again making

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.460
sure that they are just snug.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.460
[music]

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.370
Shut the tailgate and make sure that the cover
is centered on the perimeter of the top of

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.780
the bed of the truck.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.959
Being that the clamps are just snug, you should
be able to gently move the cover from front

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:31.259
to rear or side to side as needed to center
the cover over your bed of your truck.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.259
[music]

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.840
Once you have your cover in the desired position,
fold your cover back into the open position

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.329
in order to firmly tighten the front clamps.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.200
Before you fold to the open position, it is
important to make sure that you secure your

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.430
rear clamping handles into the lock position
to avoid damage to your cover.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.149
You will notice the warning label that reminds
you to do so every time you open your cover.

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.149
[music]

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.159
Once you have tightened the front clamps and
your Q gaskets are sealed, unfold the cover

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.840
and make the necessary adjustments to tighten
and secure the rear clamps.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
[music]

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.950
Now that your TonnoPro cover is installed,
it can be used for a variety of purposes.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.080
The tri fold cover allows its owner to have
dual access to the bed of the truck.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.630
For access to the top of your bed, just fold
your top open and use it for hauling for just

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:19.630
about anything.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.150
For access to the rear of the bed, just open
the tailgate and now you have the ability

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.250
to load or unload anything from golf clubs,
to tools and equipment to camping gear.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
[music]

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.600
One of the most important features of the
cover, what separates it from our soft tri-fold

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.810
is our patented aluminum panel construction
under the vinyl surface.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.920
This design provides additional security as
well as reinforced protection from the weight

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.590
of heavy snow, ice and debris.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.700
The Tonno Pro hard folding cover will withstand
up to 300 pounds of evenly distributed weight,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.480
preventing prolonged exposure to the harsh
winter elements from damaging your cover.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480
[music]

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.880
HardFold is not to be used as a hauling system.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.880
[music]

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.350
Tonno Pro hard folding covers comes pre-assembled
so no drilling is required.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.580
Tonno Pro is light-weight, yet durable, and
offers a limited lifetime warranty.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.690
It's quick and easy to install and along with
is sleek, stylish good looks, offers one more

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.460
lasting feature: The aerodynamics of our cover
provides its owners with gas savings between

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.570
10 and 13 percent.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.320
Over time, Tonno Pro can pay for itself.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.320
[music]

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.020
When it comes to quality, ease of installation
and price, it's no wonder why TonnoPro is

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.650
still the consumer's choice.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.230
