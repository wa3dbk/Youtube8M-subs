Hi! I am Nili Nathan. I have a TV show and
a website, Great Healing Getaways, where I

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.310
write, research and report on holistic health.
It’s been my life’s passion and I am happy

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.490
to share some tips with your today. We are
talking about homemade facials and how you

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:23.110
can make some. This next one is a relaxing
mask using oatmeal. The first thing that you

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.710
need to do is get your bowl and you going
to put six teaspoons of sweet almond oil,

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:49.910
here we go, you can almond oil in health food
store, just like these essential oils, I am

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.649
using violet leaf, we are going to using two
drops of each of the essential oils, this

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.699
is two drops of violet, make sure you are
not synthetic, check the labels, you always

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:11.710
want to get 100% pure. This is lavender. Just
put two drops in there and this is neroli

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.190
oil which you will find neroli oil in a lot
of beauty products these days; it is very

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.980
nourishing for the skin. So we have our essential
oils in the sweet almond oil. Next thing we

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:35.080
do is take enough oatmeal, just regular plain
old oatmeal from your kitchen cupboard, drop

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:48.980
enough in there to make a paste. This is going
to go on to your face, I am going to need

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:57.310
to add just a tiny bit more of the oil, so
there, you could just you know it’s child’s

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:16.209
play, here we go and this is the consistency
of it. That smells really good and what you

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:26.189
will do is put that on your face like that,
lie down for about 20-25 minutes, deep breathe,

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:34.520
relax and let the nourishing oils rejuvenate
your facial skin and then rinse off with nice

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.069
and warm water.
