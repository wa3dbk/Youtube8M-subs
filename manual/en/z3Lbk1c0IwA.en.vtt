00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.160
Hey Boris, look what I found.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.240
Hey Guys! Isn't it such a beautiful morning!

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.020

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.320
What's wrong with him?

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.580
Antonio.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.920
Hmm? Yea well that's cool. See you guys later!

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.100
What's wrong with her?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.780
Antoniooooo.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.980
Oh, what's an Antonio? Is it contagious?

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.560
He means the new... bull... on the farm.

00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.451
Oh I love new people!

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.380
Actually, I mean the new... Stud... on the farm.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.380
I'M THE STUD!

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.880
Oh, there's a new stud? Roofus, I'm so sorry.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.340
So when do we meet him?

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.960
[Crying]

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700
Moo Hoo Hoo!

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.580
Oh no! What's wrong?

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.700
Antonio is sooo mean!

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.840
I went over to say, 'Hi' and he told me I was flaming.

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.120
I mean, I'm not flaming, I'm rose. What is he color blind?

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.340
Oh brother!

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.540
Hey hey now! Antonio has insulted and hurt our dear friends feelings.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.240
Who me?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.080
Of course you silly.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.240
We're friends?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.020
Yeah, last week you called him a steer and wanted to castrate him.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.600
Hold on now! We're all friends here.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.680
And it hurts me that you guys have doubts.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.680
We can't just let this, bull, come to our farm and...

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.520
...insult our friends...

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.940
...and...   ...and...

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.000
Screw your cows?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.760
Exactly!   Wait... what?

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.760
The point is we gotta do something about this.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.940
Oh we do? Like what? Everything seems just fine from where I'm standing.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.380
This is an emergency! Possibly catastrophic!

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.320
Maybe there was a misunderstanding. Why don't I go talk to him?

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.000
Yeah, and while you're over there...

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.680
...sting him in the eye!

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.400
Oh Roofus! Come on Honey, I'll go with.

Aye ya yey ya yey.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.960
Ughhhh.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.320
Hi! My name is Honey and I want to officially welcome you to the farm!

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.240
[Laughing]

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.580
Are you serious? You're name is Honey?

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.620
Well, yeah.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.120
Honey, the bee?

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.800
Yes?

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.200
So, what does that make you? Hamburger the cow?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.280
Uhh, no. Actually, my name is Mitt.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.340
[Laughing]

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.701
That's almost as good.

00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.501
Do you mind if I call you baseball glove?

00:03:51.501 --> 00:03:52.981
It is more direct.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.400
And you, senorita, it just won't work out...

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.680
...because you are a bee and I am a bull, so, you know.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.760
I don't like you.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.080
Yeah, we're in!

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.640
Let's kick his ass!

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:15.901
Ok here he comes, get ready.

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:17.921
I don't think it will work.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.920
Man! You got your hair on backwards!

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.960
Are you sure?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.580
What do you mean am I sure?

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.580
You look like a monkey's armpit!

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.020
And here they are! See told ya.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.700
Ummm... mooo ooo.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.620
Aww, you caught me.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.360
I thought I could take my job back but I guess you're just too smart for that.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.880
What is this?

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.840
They told me you were attempting to service one of MY heifers.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.400
Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.280
It is, after all, your job.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.260
I'm sorry for all the animosity.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.340
Let me step aside.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.180
Here you go pal.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.020
Nooo, that's ok.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.480
You, please, go ahead.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.466
What?

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:09.366
You want to take care of her. So, go ahead.

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:16.286
Now hold on. Since you claim to be the stud, it's YOUR job and YOU need to service her.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.920
But, I AM the stud. And this heifer is...

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.760
...ugly. So, you-

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.800
Now wait just a minute!

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.360
Wait a minute! What she means to say is-

00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.441
He called me ugly!

00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:30.461
God damnit! You broke character!

00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:33.161
Guys, I do not know what the idea is here.

00:05:33.161 --> 00:05:37.881
But, a real stud can tell the difference between a real heifer and a fake heifer.

00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:40.881
And besides, I do not make the rules.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.740
I simply- What The Fuck!

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.160
Excuse me? What the hell is going on here?

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.620
Who the hell are you? And what are you doing in my mating field?

My name is Hans Von Stefan.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.740
I am supposed to be in this field.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.080
I am the stud.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.600
I AM THE STUD!

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.160
I'M THE STUD!
