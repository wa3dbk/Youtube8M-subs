"Min Pop" (combina a mint dress) subscribe to my channel =) 

00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:10.874
Hi guys! this is the second video of Gdl Streets, this 
 time we will talk about the "Mint pop" outfit

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:16.412
This outfit its based on the mint color, 
 because is the color of the season

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:24.587
With this color you can mix  pastel and 
 crear colors. You can create very feminine styles...

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:32.229
Now we'll see the dress that I chose to this outfit

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:37.133
I bough it at "Vangee couture" is not a known 
 store but when I saw I love it!

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:41.304
and you will see that we make a really cute photoshoot with this dress

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:48.144
Other detail really important is the heels... as you 
 can see this shoes have an aqua tone

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.984
I bought these heels in the same store that I bought the dress, and you 
 will see how perfect it is the session with these shoes extremely high

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:04.093
The hairstyle: ironing hair, side fringe. If you dont have fringe take 
 a lock of hair and hold it with a brooch

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.368
The hairstyle has an oldies touch and its completely ironing, to have feeling 
 and hold it a lock of hair to create the fringe..

00:01:20.347 --> 00:01:24.347
I have a wavy hair so I always used 
 the hair iron  minutes before the photoshoot

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:34.123
The makeup: pink shades, red blush to give a pink effect 
 in the dark skin, pink gloss, and black eyeliner

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:46.540
I used pink shades and a white shade touch under the eyebrow and 
 under the tabs, this give me some light to the look

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:03.590
also applies black pencil eyeliner

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:08.090
red blush to give a pink effect in the dark skin is perfect, please 
 do not abuse 'cause you will look like Heidi and that's not cool

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.810
Then comes the pink gloss, I don't like wear much makeup 
 so I always prefer the gloss in all the colors

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.990
The result of the makeup and hairstyle

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:45.660
in the accessories I went to TODO MODA 
 and I bought a mint ring 

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:52.550
I also bought a cute bracelets that reminds me the old  yellow  bracelet of the 
 Armstrong cyclist, when I was in high school it was fashionable have one of these

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:05.950
Now you will see the location..and the other part 
 of the outfit ...see you there ;)

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:09.990
The accessories

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.360
Hi there now we are in the location, 
 its a beautiful roundabout that we found..

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.130
 I chose this place because the flowers and grass grew up  
 and I think this is a perfect stage to this spring/summer

00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:35.000
another important detail of the outfit is the bag, belongs to the Fashion 
 desginer Paco Tostado 'cause its pastel pink its perfect to the oufit

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:43.940
also my sunglasses DKNY, I bought these in the last season 
 but you will see it in this season too...

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.830
