Bouldering and traveling is really an ideal combination. It's not always just about bouldering, or finding the most difficult routes,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.500
but through traveling I also have the possibility to get to know other countries, cultures and people.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Traveling in India is a very special experience. As a young guy growing up in a small Tyrolean village, suddenly finding yourself in the middle of Delhi is suffocating in the beginning.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.500
The air is just so thick, muggy and hot, it stinks, it's just horrible. But on the other hand,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.500
it's actually beautiful, and very interesting to experience it for awhile, just to see how life actually works here.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The Himalayas are well known from books and all the legends and stories of mountaineering.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.300
I always wanted to go to the Himalayas to boulder. Most likely there is no bigger playground on the planet.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.500
The goal for every trip or when you climb in a new area is to search and find the best and most spectacular lines.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:15.000
Extra long Extra strong is surely one of the most beautiful problems I've climbed in the last years. Actually, this boulder is gigantic. 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:25.500
14 hard moves. It's very different, dynamic, powerful, and really technical to climb. It's precisely this last move that can drive me to despair.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:05.000
Amazing, 20m of crack climbing, and in the beginning a really difficult boulder, and towards the top just a fight, and slowly you are completely exhausted.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.800
Alex battled his way through.
