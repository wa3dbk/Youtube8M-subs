Acoustic Collabo
A girl and streetlamp

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.049
It was a quiet night

00:00:29.131 --> 00:00:33.554
So quiet

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:40.596
By the window

00:00:43.468 --> 00:00:47.771
A girl stood alone

00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:55.459
Looking up at the night sky

00:00:58.237 --> 00:01:02.437
Without a single star

00:01:05.517 --> 00:01:09.612
Then she cried

00:01:12.565 --> 00:01:17.038
Letting no one know

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:24.156
The streetlamp outside the window

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:31.317
Maybe it knows how I feel

00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:39.445
A saddening night, only the pale streetlamp

00:01:50.893 --> 00:01:55.149
Soothes the girl

00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:02.197
This silent night

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:09.476
The girl drowned in sorrow

00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:17.286
Only the light soothes her gently

00:02:51.613 --> 00:02:56.772
The streetlamp outside the window

00:02:58.837 --> 00:03:04.053
Maybe it knows how I feel

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.069
A saddening night, only the pale streetlamp

00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:27.916
Soothes the girl

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:35.204
This silent night

00:03:38.213 --> 00:03:42.389
The girl drowned in sorrow

00:03:45.132 --> 00:03:50.316
Only the light soothes her gently

00:03:53.158 --> 00:03:57.741
The girl drowned in sorrow

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:08.262
Only the light soothes her gently
