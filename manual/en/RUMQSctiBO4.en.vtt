00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.300
Meta Knight in the sky! 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.200
The community kept him why?

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.660
He was broke.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.300
The rules were a joke.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.220
This banning stuff yo...

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.780
There's like two stages left.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.080
Players don't

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.556
know how to grow,

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.620
with this banning crap yo. 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.860
Now they want diddy banned!

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.680
Take a look!

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.340
These rules are cooked!

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.340
This banning stuff though...

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.860
This banning stuff though...

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.600
Hi everyone!

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.000
Welcome to Smash on Blast!

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.294
The word of the day is...

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.960
is called "banning". *Screams*

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.420
You know what!? Ban this mess!

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.920
 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.380
I can't get it and I can't understand this. So you know what? I wanna to ban it!

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.120
What's a matter TJ?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.460
I can't pronounce this word.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.832
What's the word?

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:13.314
This one!

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.300
Ade..adee...

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.600
Adeept..

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.800
Oh! You're talking about that word. It's pronounced adapt.

00:01:20.295 --> 00:01:22.695
Wha... why are they two A's in it!?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.340
Well TJ, you need vowels.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.260
Vowels are important for all words.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.040
Well you know what? I don't understand them and I don't get em' so we should just ban all vowels!

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:33.694
TJ!

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.160
Banning things are for stinky poo heads!

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.200
Learn to be a leader like--

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.640
Martin Luther Wes Jr.--

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.800
and Malcom Wes!

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.280
Those guys--

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.060
they wanted to end segregation and make a community free of premature banning.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.940
Well why can't we?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.300
The Smash community, they ban things all the time when they don't understand them...

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.560
or they don't wanna ade..adept to them!

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.160
So we should be able to too!

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.800
Well TJ...

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.608
banning things prematurely, isn't the smart thing.

00:02:02.608 --> 00:02:06.714
So the "Smash community" you speak of should really reconsider banning things.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.660
*scribbles*

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.580
Now you see why banning things, isn't a good thing?

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.800
Yeah...I really do!

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.260
Thanks Teacher!

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.274
Thanks Lucas!

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.740
From now on, I'm gonna learn to "adapt" to things

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.048
and try to figure out the problem before banning them.

00:02:31.374 --> 00:02:31.934
Well...

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.300
That's all the time we have for today kids!

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.800
Goodbye now!

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.040
Kids: Bye!! Goodbye!!

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.660
These guys are banning things again!

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.580
This mess goes on and on my friends.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.580
Some people started banning things not knowing what it does...

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.000
and they continue banning things forever just because--

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.500
These guys are banning things again!

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.480
This mess goes on and on my friends.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.860
Some people started banning things not knowing what it does...

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.220
and they continue banning things forever just because--

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.560
These guys are banning things again!

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.220
This mess goes on and on my friends.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.560
Some people started banning things not knowing what it does...

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.040
and they continue banning things forever just because--
