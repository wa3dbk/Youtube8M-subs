00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.479
Hey guys! Today I am in Asakusa

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.228
and I'm getting ready for the Sanja Festival

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:15.872
and I've got my festival wear here

00:00:15.872 --> 00:00:19.130
These guys are gonna help me out because I'm not sure exactly how to put it on

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.961
So I thought I would show that to you guys

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:23.632
Because it's pretty cool, you don't get to wear this kinda stuff everyday

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:26.792
So yeahhh! We're gonna start with the tabi

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.520
My feet are really big so it's always hard for me to get these on

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.930
So this is one that they already tied

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:52.486
So it starts out with just 2 strings like this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.730
and you weave them through the holes

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280
and when you're done, it'll look like this!

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.680
So this will go between your big toe

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.280
Take these 2 strings

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.560
and put them through these loops

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.060
Then you bring this string through here

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.940
Then tighten it here

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.620
Tie it off here for a sec

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.400
Now align it with your foot

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.160
Like this

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.660
Bring these over top here

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.320
and around back

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.860
make sure it matches up here

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.840
with your heel

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.100
Let's gets yours on over there

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:48.454
Mine are a little different than yours

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.560
Mine are made of plastic, yours are straw

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.820
This is plastic?

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760
So get your foot into the back part here

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.920
Bring the strings through here

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.560
and then here

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.520
Then they will stay closed like this!

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.740
Then you can cut the extra string with scissors

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.480
Leave a little bit

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.500
You can take them off like this

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.900
All finished!

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.860
These are neat

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.889
They look awesome!

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.280
I'm so excited!

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.882
It was just raining until about half an hour ago

00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:37.967
We're so lucky it stopped! I think it's gonna be awesome weather

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.068
This is my 2nd time coming to the Sanja Festival

00:03:41.068 --> 00:03:42.876
Last year I didn't participate

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:46.348
So it's really exciting to be able to be a part of it this year

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.400
Excuse me

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.460
Thank you!

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.740
Alright guys, it's time for the hanten (jacket)

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.140
and the obi (belt)

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.760
So they are going to tie those for me

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.200
Left goes on top

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.720
A little bit lower

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.480
Too tight?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.560
Nope it's fine!

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.920
Here is where you find the name of all the different stores

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:51.580
We have a kamameshi store, so it says "Asadori"

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.540
Alright, here we are all decked out in our festival gear!

00:05:58.209 --> 00:06:00.969
I would like to give a super big thank you to Yummy Japan

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.908
for inviting me to participate in the festival with them this year

00:06:03.908 --> 00:06:05.588
because I had a blast!

00:06:05.588 --> 00:06:08.314
Make sure you guys stay tuned for my next video

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:11.673
where I will show you how cool this festival is

00:06:11.673 --> 00:06:14.100
It's pretty intense, but it's lots of fun

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.422
and I'm super excited to share it with you guys!

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.680
Thanks for watching, and I'll see you soon! Bye!
