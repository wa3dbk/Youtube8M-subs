00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.360
At the end of the day warfare is always about choosing sides

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.780
but you know, if you don't you get to fight everyone.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.920
Hey guys my name is Diana and today I will show you the basic gameplay of our newest game Rising Generals

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.620
If you first start the game you will see this huge world map. 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.840
In the finished game, up to 25.000 players can battle each other on every single continent. 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.240
The closer I zoom in the more can you see all the different sectors and cells.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.680
Grey cells are neutral; red are enemies and the blue ones are mine. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.280
On this test server I already managed to get the control over three outposts.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.560
Together with my headquarters I now have to manage four districts in total.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.040
My headquarters here is the center of the game.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.360
From here I can produce fuel and components, build units, research new technologies and many more.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.980
At this point Rising Generals differs from most other online strategy games. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.600
Usually you have to wait some time after you have produced troops or supplies to use them.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.420
But not in Rising Generals!

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.020
One click is enough and you get your produced fuel and troops instantly 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.160
and you can directly start a new attack with them.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.720
This new cool down-system allows you to take direct action and be efficient on the battlefield

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.140
So let’s see if we can produce an army, get some fuel and attack our neighbor 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.880
First let’s go to our barracks and get some fresh troops.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.860
As you can see here I can choose from different tanks, helicopters or jets.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.720
One other thing you can see here is our stone-paper-scissor system.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.000
Every unit has it strengths and weaknesses against another.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.500
For example the paladin tank is very strong against aircrafts but weak against light and heavy tanks.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.100
To actually build the troops I just need to select the amount of tanks I want to produce 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.600
and after only one click the troops are instantly available. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.820
Only now the cool down starts and I have to wait some time before I can produce the next wave of tanks. 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.200
Producing fuel works the same way as the troop production.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.960
Just select the amount of fuel you want, click on this button and we are ready to raid our poor neighbor.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.560
Attacking is very simple in Rising Generals.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.220
Just select the outpost where you troops are stationed and then click on “army actions”.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.380
After selecting an enemy’s outpost you can choose between raid and capturing it.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.320
In the next screen we can choose the troops we want to use for the attack. 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.960
There are limited to the amount of fuel we have. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.400
The more troops we want to throw into battle the more fuel we need.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.460
This time I prepared our attack pretty badly so we can only use half of our army 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.560
but I think it's still enough.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.020
Ok enough words let's begin the battle!

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.420
At the top of the screen you can see the power of my army and the strength of my opponent.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.780
this time I'm pretty lucky because my army is clearly superior.

00:02:56.097 --> 00:02:59.737
The whole fight is divided into three rounds:

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.120
At first the airforce starts with an bombardment

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.980
after that the artillery and mine layers start their work

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.480
and in the third round all other troops enter the battlefield

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.000
So that looks pretty good for me I would say

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.500
the enemy's troops are almost destroyed and I havent had that much casualties. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.360
If you do not have the time to watch the whole fight, 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.360
you can of course skip it and just see the results.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.820
In this case we were successful and we captured a new outpost 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.580
which we now can use to produce supplies and troops.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.320
Ok guys, I showed you now our new cool down system and how to capture new provinces.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.160
I hope you liked the video and stay tuned for more information from Rising Generals!
