Hi there. I'll be getting to the news in just
a second. But first, last month I had mentioned

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:11.350
that hopefully 2010 would be filled with news
stories that would allow me to keep on making

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.529
fun of the news. And it already looks like
it's gearing up to be a winner. However, I

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.740
do want to mention that after several newscasts,
you all seem to love what I'm doing, but there

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.050
has been a select few of you that have been
complaining about my making fun of your idols

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.020
like Sarah Palin , Oozy, and believe it or
not even Gilligan. Well, my wife says she's

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.930
thought of a great way to appease these fans
and I trust her, so let's see what she's come

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:52.110
up with....... I hope you're happy, now let's
get on with the news.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.140
Word is out that Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt
are heading for a divorce. Yes, I knew she

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.009
couldn't resist my charm. Now I've just got
to see if she'll drop that restraining orderagainst

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.909
me.
Pitt reportedly has purchased a new home complete

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.890
with a cave. He says he's got his work cut
out cleaning up the mess left by this previous

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.810
tenant.
Conan O'Brien's final episode on the Tonight

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.850
Show last week turned out to be a ratings
bonanza after a whopping 7 million viewers

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.600
tuned in to watch the comic's final farewell.
David Lettermen said "I'm not worried about

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.380
the numbers, it's sort of like when there's
a car wreck and everyone stops to stare."

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.520
It's been confirmed that Tiger Woods has been
undergoing therapy at a sex rehab clinic in

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.719
Mississippi this month. Woods has reportedly
spent $100,000. to refurbish his living quarters

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:58.450
and we've got exclusive video showing just
how well that money has been spent.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.280
Entertainment Tonight's Cojo was on the red
carpet at all the awards ceremonies this month

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.431
with his criticism of what the stars were
wearing. Said Tina Faye, "It's hard to take

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:16.430
seriously the rants of a lunatic who's dressed
like a giant strawberry ice cream cone".

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.900
In accepting a life time achievement at the
Screen Actor's Guild awards, Betty White joked

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.040
about having probably slept with most of the
men in the room. Having reportedly slept with

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.269
more than 12,000 women, according to a new
book, all actor Warren Beatty could say was

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.760
"damn, how did I miss that one?"
Osama Bin Laden released and audio tape this

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.230
week taking credit for the attempted bombing
of a flight bound for Detroit on Christmas

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.700
Day. Later on in the tape he also takes credit
for the failed Health Care Bill , the NBC

00:02:48.700 --> 00:03:00.909
late night show debacle and also for writing
this song.

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.170
You may remember that over Christmas, Charlie
Sheen reportedly attacked his wife Brooke

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.190
Mueller and spent the holiday in jail. Two
weeks later, Brooke spent several days in

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:16.319
intensive care and then traveled cross country
to enter a rehab facility. Denise Richards,

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.390
Charlie's ex, went on the Oprah Winfrey show
to talk about how violent Sheen had been while

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.310
they were married. You know, I for one, would
love to see how Charlie makes out if we could

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.579
just get him a date with the hair pulling
soccer girl.

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:35.909
President Obama just gave his yearly State
of the Union address where he spoke about

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.140
creating jobs, the war on terrorism, and then
he finished up by introducing us to the highly

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:48.030
anticipated Ipad.
Although I appreciate the importance of Obama's

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.890
State of the Union speech, I have to confess,
I did fall asleep half way through it. But

00:03:52.890 --> 00:04:10.299
luckily I did TiVo it. But when I played it
back, here's what I discovered.

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.109
And finally, Sarah Palin along with daughter
Bristol, went on the Oprah Winfrey show this

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.900
week where Bristol vowed to live a life of
celibacy until she was married. Isn't that

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.400
sort of like patting down the passengers after
they've already gotten off the plane, may

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.040
many times.
And that's the news. We'll be back with you

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.040
again week.
