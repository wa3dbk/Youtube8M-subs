00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:05.230
Most modern touchscreens are made using OGS
technology.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.059
Without going into deep detail, such touchscreens
have one glass layer removed, making them

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.240
much thinner.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.969
The glass is replaced by some insulation substance,
in most cases - air.

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.230
And this air between the touch panel glass
and the display matrix itself may cause you

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:26.089
some trouble, especially if your are lucky
enough to get a huge, 5" or more device while

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:31.130
being unlucky enough to life in a shitty and
cold climate, like Russia, where we have snow

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.670
or rain like 8 months out of 12.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:39.329
Well, in this case your device is prone to
this kind of trouble - a wet spot inside the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.329
screen.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.950
If you press hard in the middle of such big,
over 5" screen, when carrying it inside your

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.239
tight jeans pocket for example full of warm
moisture generated by your body, and then

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.899
pull it out into cooler air to answer a call,
the moisturized air between the glass and

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.320
the display will condensate causing this water
spot right in the middle of the screen.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.449
The poodle moves when you touch it with your
finger.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.720
The picture behind this moisture appears brighter
than in the corners of the screen.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.860
The poodle is formed under the same principle
thermo fabric is made.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.570
Such fabric often found in sports apparel,
is made of very thin membrane.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.299
The pores of the membrane are big enough for
water steam molecules to come through, but

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.430
too narrow for bigger water molecules to pass
it.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.240
So the sweat steam generated by your body
easily goes away through these pores onto

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.600
the outside of the fabric, where it quickly
condensates to water sweat, and cannot get

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.579
back through the membrane, keeping your body
dry.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.670
The sweat then quickly evaporates from the
surface.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.079
You may be like - well professor what should
we do?

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.210
Take a small suction cup.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.149
The one used in bathrooms are normally too
big, but those used in ladies razor holder

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.210
should do.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.759
I'll be using a suction cup phone stand which
I already reviewed.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.460
Go see the review, by the way.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.350
So press the suction cup right above the wet
spot and now start to firmly push it upwards.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.540
Do not be a chicken, but also do not apply
too much force as you may disassemble the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.540
screen.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.750
You'll hear a small pop.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.690
How use a toothpick to decompress the suction
cup.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.160
As you may see, the display is as good as
new.
