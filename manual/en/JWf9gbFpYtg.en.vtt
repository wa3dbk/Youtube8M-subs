Hi.

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.336
I'm Scott Steinberg, and
I'm going to walk you

00:00:02.336 --> 00:00:06.590
through how to make sure you download a
safe app instead of malicious software

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.980
onto your Android smartphone or tablet.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:11.630
Android's huge market
share and open marketplace

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.645
make it a prime target for
cybercrime, so it's possible

00:00:14.645 --> 00:00:18.050
that you'll encounter dangerous
programs if you aren't careful.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.030
With so many great apps
to choose from, you

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.071
want to make sure you've
done your due diligence.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.160
Many Android smartphone and
tablet users run into problems

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.650
when downloading apps.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.660
It's tempting to take
advantage of the freedom

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.770
that Android offers to
download apps for many sources,

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.390
but many sites are
selling or giving away

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.780
malicious software that
will infect your device

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110
and potentially steal your identity.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.960
A simple online search can reveal
the issues the plague Android OS.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.580
If you buy apps from Google Play,
the official Android app store,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.400
and of course other reputable
sites like Amazon's app store,

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.100
you'll be safer because they put their
apps through a screening process,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.040
but even then, there's no
guarantee of getting a clean file.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.210
Exercise good judgment and pay attention
to the details when downloading apps.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.850
By learning what to look out for,
you're less likely to get scammed.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.080
Here's some useful tips on
identifying suspect apps.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.890
Avoid apps that come out before
their scheduled release day.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.890
This tactic is commonly used by cyber
criminals for eagerly awaited apps,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.740
and in many cases used to
deliver useless apps filled

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.170
with malicious code.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.290
Don't be duped by bargain sites offering
popular paid apps for free either.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.780
If it seems too good to
be true, probably is.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.570
Some websites pose as
databases for reviews,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.595
but their content is just copied
and pasted from Google Play

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:36.500
and their apps are fraudulent.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.830
Also be careful of in-app purchases.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.680
Some clean apps will lead you to unsafe
sites to download upgrades or add-ons,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.250
leaving you infected
with malicious programs.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.070
And be certain where you're buying from
and consider using Android antivirus

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.650
protection with app scanning technology.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.280
Here are some additional tips to
help you avoid downloading bad apps.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.600
Update your operating system if
it's available for your device,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.550
and if updates are not available
for your smartphone or tablet,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.620
it's even more important to
have software protection.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.900
Also read the app permission
screen before you download.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.169
Malicious programs will
often request access

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.690
to your personal information, such
as text messages and contacts.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.250
To help verify an app, consider
a mobile antivirus solution

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.820
that provides an overview of your
installed apps and their permissions.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.270
And don't assume a five star
rating means an app is OK either.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.730
Some dirty apps force users to leave
a high score before downloading,

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.610
so double check that it's legitimate
by reading through the reviews.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.440
Mobile antivirus software
delivers app scanning

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.770
technology that does the work for you.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.680
Despite the number of
threats, the good news

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.840
is that it is possible to
avoid bad Android apps.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.710
By knowing the threats, you can
keep your Android device secure

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.750
and your personal information private.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.350
This has been Scott Steinberg.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.085
Good luck.
