00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:20.600
Geez, now itís spreading.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.380
THIS IS NOT SHINING FORCE.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.680
The tactical RPG that I fell in love with
when I was 10?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.449
THIS ISNíT THAT.

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.030
Camelot was not involved, thereís no grid,
no twangy Genesis bass, no anthropomorphic

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.300
armadillo in a steam-powered battlesuit.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.350
Hereís the thing thoughÖ if you cover up
the name, just call it EXA or something, and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.179
stick your fingers in your ears every time
the cast thinks that the Shining Force is

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.231
a sword instead of a coalition of fighters
aiming to take down Dark DragonÖ the game

00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:50.519
itself is pretty darn good.

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.230
Itís one of those weird situations where
the name gives you a false expectation, kinda

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.710
like how Final Fantasy XIII wouldíve been
better had it not been called Final Fantasy.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.390
Itís a decent action RPG and can stand on
its ownÖ just donít come in expecting Domingo

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.900
to be Freeziní squid tentacles left and right.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.830
Toma, a young swordsman whoís just plucky
enough to be a protagonist in a JRPG, has

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.300
teamed up with a centaur knight and an archer
from a dying race of elvesÖ oh, and a rather

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.350
misanthropic sorceress - to search for the
ShinÖ no, I canít even say it.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.020
To search for a sword embedded in a stone
which will grant the title of ìkingî to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.340
whomever draws it.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.720
So, &lt;include arthurianlegend.h&gt;, really.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.940
Elven archer wishes for the protection of
the last of her people, no dice.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.840
Knight-face wishes to fight for the principles
of truth and justice, no go.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.030
Toma, who canít stand this indecision (married
with a lack of vision), just wants to rule

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.030
the world.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.350
Guess who gets it?

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.000
Of course.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.951
That gives Toma not only the swordÖ which
turns into a bracelet all .hack//STYLE, but

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:07.490
dominion over the Geo-Fortress, a high-tech
potentially-mobile base of operations which

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.429
gets upgraded over the course of the game.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.390
To power these upgrades, though, youíll need
to search the land for materials, which you

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.390
can do as either Toma or Book-and-crossbow-wielding
Cyrille, with additional party members should

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.390
you wish.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.629
And on that front, the high-intensity hacking
and slashing shines, with combo attacks, charged

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.910
shots, and quick-swappable magic and items
available at all times.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.250
The art style also looks great, with just
a bit of cell-shading without being too over-the-top

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.599
and cartoony, and the vocal cast really did
a great job.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.510
Yíknow, despite not recognizing a single
name in the credits.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:57.000
I was all set to rumble in here and be all
ìBLUH BLUH ITíS NOT REAL SHINING FORCEî

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.099
butÖ yíknow, I canít even hate on Shining
Force EXA.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.579
All I can do is sayÖ Itís not Shining Force.

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.120
Thereís a robot named Adam.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.139
Thatís about all itís got to tie it to its
predecessor.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.099
It doesnít have the tactical considerations,
but it certainly has action and quality gameplay.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.560
It doesnít have a twangy Genesis soundtrack,
but it certainly has an awesome musical score.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.790
It doesnít have an anthropomorphic armadillo
in a steam-powered battlesuit, butÖ well,

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.090
there isnít really much you can do about
that.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.109
Sorry, Guntz.

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:28.189
But Shining Force EXA made me reconsider my
instinctive aversion to the vast world of

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:32.779
ìShining Force Games that arenít made by
Camelot,î because thereís plenty to enjoy

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:37.330
hereÖ so long as you can go into it knowing
that you arenít going to be enjoying anything

00:03:37.330 --> 00:04:03.529
approximating Tao in an awesome swimsuit or
Zylo beingÖ well, Zylo.
