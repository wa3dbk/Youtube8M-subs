00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.300
Lead the attack of the forces of Paraiso.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800
You can count on us, Crisval.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.374
Little did we know...

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.913
...if they are friends or they are foes.

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.844
Not long afterwards, we already knew the answer.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.589
Here in Paraiso, we called them "Balangs"...

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.828
...because they were like pests when they
came here.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:06.466
Denz, it's time.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.504
Robots...

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.340
...made...

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:14.975
...out of recycled things?!

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:18.111
I can't believe that you kept this
from the council.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.549
Now I know their sole purpose of invading
our planet.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.688
Is it too late?

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.632
We need to blow up their nest.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:42.202
This is now our chance to be the ones
to invade.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.213
Here they come!

00:01:54.381 --> 00:01:55.882
For freedom,

00:01:55.882 --> 00:01:57.551
...for the whole world!

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.122
- WE WILL FIGHT!!
- FIGHT!!!

00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:04.758
Hurry!

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.909
"RECYCLE"
