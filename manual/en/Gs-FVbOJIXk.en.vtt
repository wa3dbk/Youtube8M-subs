I will teach you how to cook Sizzling Chicken

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.939
Sisig. We will need the following ingredients:
grilled and chopped boneless chicken breast,

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.820
minced onion, garlic powder, chicken liver,
green chili, soy sauce, butter, mayonnaise,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.380
and egg. We will also use cooking oil, salt,
and ground black pepper. Let's start! Heat

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:53.380
the cooking oil in a pan. Once the oil becomes
hot, saute the onion. Feel free to add more

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:01.220
onions. We will cook this 
until the onions becomes soft. Now that the
onions are soft, we can add the chicken liver.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.740
What I did was to chop the chicken liver into
small pieces. This is an important ingredient

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:37.539
because it gives flavor to this dish. However,
I understand that not all of you eat liver.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.920
Its ok if you do not add liver to this dish.
You'll notice that the liver will turn brown

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:57.409
after a few minutes, this means that we can
now add the chicken breast. We cooked the

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:05.599
liver ahead because it is still raw, while
the chicken breasts were already grilled and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.300
requires lesser cooking time. We'll continue
to cook this for a few minutes and then we

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.310
will add the other ingredients. We can now
add the garlic powder, and soy sauce. Make

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.130
sure to stir it right away. Sisig should not
have a dry texture, we will use mayonnaise

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:21.320
later on to bind all the ingredients.Now we
will add salt and pepper. Do this 
according to your preference. Taste the dish

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.590
first before doing this step. Here comes the
mayonnaise! Once you add it in, make sure to stir it right away.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.630
Mayonnaise is an alternative
ingredient to sisig; the original ingredient is pig's brain (yup).

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.740
I am using mayo because
it is more convenient.

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:44.749
This won't be complete without the sizzling plate. Here is our cast
iron pan (also known as sizzling plate).

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.090
We'll heat the pan then we will place the butter in there to melt. Once the butter melts, we

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:15.319
can transfer the chcken sisig that we cooked
earlier here in the sizzling plate. We'll

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.580
now transfer the chicken sisig in the plate.
Afterwards we'll top this with the raw egg

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:38.819
and arrange the chili on top. This is ready
to serve!

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.110
