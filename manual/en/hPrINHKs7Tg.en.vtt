00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.900
What’s up Insiders?

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.010
Pokemon Insider here with another Pokemon
theory video.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.660
Today’s theory is discussing the best Pokeball.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.309
Thanks for watching, make sure to leave a
like, and let’s get started.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.830
So, it’s probably obvious that the master
ball is the best Pokeball right?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.950
It can catch any wild Pokemon without fail,
which makes it the most powerful Pokeball

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.920
the player can access throughout the games.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.010
But let’s hold up for a minute.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.090
The master ball may not be the best Pokeball.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.500
You’ve gotta have some big balls to make
that claim, big Pokeballs that is.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.301
Oh man, that was bad.The master ball actually
can fail if the Pokemon has full HP and no

00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:43.399
status ailment.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.000
It is only a 1 in 65536 chance, but it still
can fail.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.280
Also, if we look past the games, we may be
able to find several Pokeballs that would

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.950
outclass the master ball.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.320
Let’s start by taking a look at some of
the anime exclusive Pokeballs that I think

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.820
easily outclass the master ball.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.240
The first example is from Pokemon the First
Movie and it is the PokeBall named by the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.539
fans as the Mewtwo ball.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.299
This Pokeball not only is able to catch Pokemon
without fail, but it is also able to capture

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.749
Pokemon already under the possession of a
trainer.

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.249
This easily beats out the master ball, but
that doesn’t necessarily mean it is the

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:22.090
best Pokeball either.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.399
There is another anime exclusive Pokeball
that even outclasses the Mewtwo Ball.

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.890
In the Pokemon movie, Celebi: Voice of the
Forest, there is a Pokeball called the Dark

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.890
Ball.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.549
The Iron Masked Marauder is the main user
of the dark ball and uses it to steal other

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.299
trainers’ Pokemon along with something else
that pushes it above the Mewtwo ball.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.020
The Dark ball has the ability to steal Pokemon
and instantly raise them to their maximum

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.020
potential.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.950
If a trainer could get their hands on a dark
ball in the games, it would pretty much be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.960
game breaking because it would likely raise
your Pokemon to level 100, max out its IVs,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.149
and probably more optimization on the competitive
level.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.059
Now what could be better than that?

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:06.040
Honestly, it doesn’t seem like anything
could, but there is one Pokeball that we don’t

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.229
know anything about.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.929
That’s right, I’m talking about the GS
ball.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.879
Since we know literally nothing about the
GS ball’s mechanics, we can’t know how

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.610
powerful of a Pokeball it really is.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.159
However, since we don’t know anything, we
can’t assume.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:25.060
So, to conclude this theory, we know that
the master ball is not in fact the most powerful

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.510
Pokeball, and there are a few that outclass
the not so master ball.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.830
I think the dark ball is the best Pokeball,
but that’s just my opinion.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.010
