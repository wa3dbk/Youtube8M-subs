00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.340
We're asked to identify
the percent, amount,

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.240
and base in this problem.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.110
And they ask us 150
is 25% of what number?

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:17.520
So another way to think about
it is 25% times some number.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.970
So I'll do 25% in yellow.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:35.130
And 25% times some
number is equal to 150.

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.360
So the percent is
pretty easy to spot.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.287
We have a 25% right over here.

00:00:39.287 --> 00:00:40.745
So this is going
to be the percent.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
And we're multiplying the
percent times some base number.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.800
So this right over
here is the base.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.640
So we have the percent
times the base.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.345
We have the percent times the
base is equal to some amount.

00:01:03.455 --> 00:01:05.330
And you could try to
solve this in your head.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.950
This is essentially
saying 25% of some number,

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.400
25% times some number
is equal to 150.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.990
If it helps, we
could rewrite this

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.510
as 0.25, which is the
same thing as 25%.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:25.739
0.25 times some number
is equal to 150.

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:27.780
And one interesting thing
is just to think about,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.700
should that number be
larger or smaller than 150?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.140
Well, if we only take
25% of that number,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.390
if we only take 25
hundredths of that number,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.129
if we only take
1/4 of that number,

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:39.670
because that's what
25 hundredths is,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.310
or that's what 25%
is, we get 150.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.490
So this number needs
to be larger than 150.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.000
In fact, it has to be
larger than 150 by 4.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.590
And to actually figure
out what the number is,

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.530
we can actually multiply.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.500
Since this, what's
on the left-hand side

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.100
is equal to the right-hand
side, if we want to solve this,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.550
we can multiply both sides by 4.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.240
If we say, look, we have
some value over here,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.630
we're going to multiply it by 4.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.190
In order for it
to still be equal,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.930
we have to multiply 150 times 4.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.946
4 times 0.25, or 4 times
25%, or 4 times 1/4,

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:15.070
this is just going to be 1.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.720
And we're going to get our
number is equal to 150 times 4

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.300
or it is equal to 600.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.530
And that makes sense,
25% of 600 is 150.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.460
1/4 of 600 is 150.
