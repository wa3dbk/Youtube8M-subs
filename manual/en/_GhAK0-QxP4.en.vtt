00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.259
Hey there Assassins, 
it's time for another VideoDex!

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.001
I'm your ComDev, UbiGabe

00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:15.005
Let's first talk about the upcoming DLC,
which will contain both multiplayer

00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:18.001
and single-player content...
finally, right?

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.340
We're offering brand new single-player
called The Da Vinci Disappearance

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.009
in which Ezio must solve the mystery
surrounding the kidnapping of his

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.190
good friend and personal gadgeteer
Leonardo Da Vinci.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.230
In order to solve the mystery
and find Leo...

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.280
Ezio will have to work with 
Leo's assistant, Salai.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.730
And visit Lucrzia Borgia in
all-new locations, including...

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.809
Belriguardo, a castle in Ferrara
and the Pythagorean Temple.

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.510
Being an Acheivement/Trophy hound myself,
I am delighted to announce that...

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.460
The Da Vinci Disappearance will come
packed with 10 new ones,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.369
specifically for single-player.

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:54.409
So you'll have more opportunities to
pad your gamer-cred with this DLC release.

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:57.110
But wait, there's more! hehehe

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.870
We're putting a new gameplay feature
into the Thieves' Hideout.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.290
It's a dice game called Hazard that is
actually from the 16th century.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.290
We also have some good news for the
completionists among you, because...

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.609
The Da Vinci Disappearance come packed
with the Harlequin and Officer multiplayer personas.

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.480
As well as the Helmschmied Drachen armor.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.150
We're even going to unlock content
that was previously only available

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
in the Collector's Edition:
Trajan Market and the Aqueduct.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.360
And before you pre-orderers and CE
buyers get all cranky...

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.729
Be fair, you've had that content for months!
Let's let everyone have access to it.

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:34.840
You think we're done?
Far from it Assassins!

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.159
Because I haven't even gotten to the 
multiplayer updates,
0:01:37.159,0:0:39.820
which is our largest update yet!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.190
First, Animus Project Update 3.0 will
introduce a new map: Alhambra.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.090
Alhambra is located in an especially
lush portion of Spain,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.279
and the map balances multi-leveled
outdoor and indoor areas.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.980
If you thought Pienza had a lot of
nooks and crannies, well... hehe

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.340
you haven't seen Alhambra yet.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.819
Second, we're packing 4 new multiplayer
characters into APU 3.0...

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.690
The Dama Rossa is a lethal beauty,
a deadly Black Widow spider who kills

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.810
quickly and quietly...

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.810
The Knight is an armored brute wielding a
titanic greatsword to fell his enemies.

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.519
The Marquis takes his costume advice from
The Mercenary, and his murderous methods as well.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.150
Finally, we have The Pariah, who hides
his disfigured face behind noble finery...

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150
and a porcelain mask.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.189
Third, we are pleased to offer two new
modes with Animus Project Update 3.0...

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.989
Escort and Assassinate.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.479
Think of Escort as a kind of mobile
Chest Capture where one team attempts...

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:42.629
to protect a VIP target from another
team, hunting that target.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:48.129
Points are awarded for killing the VIP,
with additional points for extra style,

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.730
and for getting a VIP to their
assigned destination.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.689
Meanwhile, Assassinate charges 6-8 players
to identify and execute other Templars,

00:02:57.689 --> 00:02:59.600
who are marked on your compass
as potential targets.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.730
The twist is that you must lock your
target in order to secure your contract

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.390
in this free-for-all mode.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.729
Of course, all of this great DLC does
not come without cost,

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:15.840
so The Da Vinci Disappearance will run
you 800 Microsoft Points or 9.99â‚¬ on PS3.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.289
The Da Vinci Disappearance is slated for
release on PSN on March 9th,

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:22.219
and for Xbox Live on March 8th.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.539
See you soon Assassins!
