00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.420
Today we&amp;#39;re going to be taking a look
at the Thule Sonic XL Rooftop Cargo Box with

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.110
seventeen cubic feet of space in glossy black,
part number TH635B.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.019
This is an ultra aerodynamic and low profile
roof mounted cargo box which frees up space

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:23.410
on the interior of your vehicle allowing you
to carry extra cargo and wet and muddy gear

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.990
on top of your vehicle.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.600
It has a patented rear angled base which helps
to prevent the box from interfering with your

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.700
trunk or rear hatch.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.390
The Thule Sonic is equipped with two Thule
one key system lock cores which can be made

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.690
to make all of your Thule accessories keyed
alike.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.410
It is equipped with pre-installed Accutite
mounting clamps which provide an easy hassle

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.650
free five minute installation onto your cross
bars.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.120
The Accutite hardware is equipped with built-in
anchor points to secure your gear with the

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.400
two included load straps.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.340
Another great feature of the Thule Sonic XL
which makes this box stand above the rest

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.930
is its dual sided opening lid.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:02:03.780
This feature allows you to easily load and
unload your cargo from 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:03:31.700
either 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:49.030
side of 
the vehicle.
