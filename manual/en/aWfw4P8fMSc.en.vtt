Yellow Productions Presents!

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.090
A travel guide for the hot springs of
Beitou in Taipei

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.420
Taiwan. The hot spring town of Beitou was
originally developed during the Japanese

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.799
colonial period

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.230
in the Fifties it was a big red light
district. But in the Eighties it was

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.900
cleaned up by the Taiwanese government

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.869
and is now a great place to come enjoy
nature and enjoy the beauty

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.349
of the natural hot springs. To get
to Beitou take the MRT red line to the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.189
Beitou station and then transfer to Shin
Beitou.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.309
You'll know you're near the hot springs
at this station cause you can already

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.380
smell the sulfur smell.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.590
The MRT has a special train on the red
line that goes back and forth between

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.200
Beitou and Shin Beitou.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.820
You'll know it's the right train
because it's got hot spring characters

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.210
on the outside

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.839
this is the only hot springs subway car I know of in Taipei.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.409
The inside of the train is special too.
Featuring historical videos,

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.390
tables that look like bathtubs, and a
nature car. Once you arrive at Xin Beitou station

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.019
you'll be greeted by some hot spring
art of some little white characters

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.519
enjoying the hot springs. The main
tourist attractions are all within an easy

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.460
walking distance

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.860
of Xin Beitou station. And there are plenty of signs along the way to guide you on.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.940
To the Hot Springs - This Way!

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.730
In addition to signs there are also plenty of maps.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.050
Seems like one every block or so,

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.720
There's even signs to tell you where all the
hotels are. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.600
About a 10 minute walk past the station
is the entrance to the Beitou Thermal Valley

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.990
The source of that smelly hot
spring water.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.350
You'll know you'll be heading the right way cause the smell will get stronger.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.870
come on here we go here we go Saito
derives its name from the Aboriginal

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.760
word for witches cauldron

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.490
company you can see here the hot spring
looks a little bit like

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.000
a witch's cauldron with the steam coming
off the witch's brew

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
this is the hot spring water and the
temperature about water

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.110
is between eighty to a hundred degrees
Celsius

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.080
and between us k love 8 the 10 on the
smelly scale

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.120
the specialty when that steam blows up
on you

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.990
and hot temperatures that water make
this area even hotter

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.679
particularly when the steamboat this way
so pick a cool day or a windy day to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.070
come

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.350
the only thing to know if the water
looks a little bit green and that's

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.740
because this is a green us all for hot
spring

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.230
it's wonderful way to in the world it

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.610
the face up the hot spring underneath
the water

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.700
has these little craters in valleys
almost looks a little bit like

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.320
the face of the moon spring water flows
through the streams the Middletown

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.000
it turns everything green that it
touches including the rocks below

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.530
the water that flows out of the hospital
in closing this stream downhill

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.830
almost to the MRT station the town is
roughly divided on either half up this

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.140
spring running downhill

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.810
but if you call this a long you know
you'll be headed either towards the hot

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.209
spring

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.950
or toward the MRT there's a number of
other cool attractions along the stream

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.500
