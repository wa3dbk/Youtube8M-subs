00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:09.792
In this clip we will continue the introduction of the new User Interface in ARCHICAD 19.

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:15.665
The next feature we will talk about is the Tab bar, which will greatly speed-up your daily work.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:24.407
From now on, every representation of the Project: Floor plan views, the 3D window, Sections and Elevations, Schedule lists etc.

00:00:24.407 --> 00:00:29.625
will be displayed by default as a Tab window, instead of a regular individual window.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:33.490
Tabs can be put into order according to your preferences.

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:38.893
The number of visible Tabs depends on the resolution of your screen.

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:45.565
When ARCHICAD runs out of space, it starts to shorten the names of Tabs,

00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:50.040
and finally a double arrow will be displayed on the rightmost Tab.

00:00:52.188 --> 00:00:57.705
By clicking on this, ARCHICAD will display the remaining Tabs available.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.900
Tabs can be closed by pressing the command + W keys on the keyboard or by clicking on 'x' sign of the Tab.

00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:16.832
Alternatively you can close any Tab by right-clicking on its title and choosing the Close command from the contextual menu.

00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:21.762
To release a TAB, click the Undock Tab command in context menu.

00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:29.238
The content of the Tab will be displayed in an individual window like in Legacy Mode.

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:35.501
To redock back the window, click on the Window menu... Dock command.

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:42.855
Right-clicking on Tabs will display a context menu with further options:

00:01:42.855 --> 00:01:48.368
in cases of Floor Plan views you get a list of available stories

00:01:48.368 --> 00:01:53.960
the Story Settings dialog is also at your fingertips.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:02.004
Another frequently used command related to stories is the Show as Trace Reference command, which is also available from this menu.

00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:10.883
If the Tabs content is an Elevation, then you will have access to the Elevation settings from within this contextual menu.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:24.367
In cases of Interior Elevations, you get quick access to other connected Interior Elevations, because they are part of the same group.

00:02:30.103 --> 00:02:39.226
When you switch to another Interior Elevation, it's displayed in the same TAB - this reduces the number of Tabs being opened at the same time.

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:48.774
If we start a rendering from 3D window, a new Tab will be opened for the rendered image.

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:55.116
We can continue working on project in other Tabs while the project is being rendered.

00:02:55.116 --> 00:03:04.100
The TAB displaying the render has a progress bar for visual feedback on the rendering stage.

00:03:07.378 --> 00:03:14.142
When the progress bar disappears, the rendering process has been finished and a green checkmark appears.

00:03:14.142 --> 00:03:19.232
This checkmark will disappear once we click the Tab or the rendered image.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:30.936
Now back to the 3D window Tab: in the context menu we have direct access to switch between the Perspective and Axonometry Views;

00:03:35.176 --> 00:03:45.405
to 3D Cutaway... Filter and Cut Elements in 3D commands; to 3D Projection ... and 3D Window Settings.

00:03:45.405 --> 00:03:51.615
To cycle trough Tabs press the CTRL + TAB keys on the keyboard.

00:03:56.123 --> 00:04:01.691
The last feature of the new User Interface is the integration of the Mini-Navigator.

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:11.075
It can serve as a replacement of the Navigator, thus creating more space.

00:04:11.075 --> 00:04:18.037
If you need the extra features of the Navigator, you can open it from the Mini-Navigator at any time.

00:04:22.064 --> 00:04:27.604
If for any reason you wish to switch back to Legacy mode and work like in previous versions of ARCHICAD,

00:04:27.604 --> 00:04:36.561
you can do this by clicking on the Options menu... Work Environment... and Application Frame option.
