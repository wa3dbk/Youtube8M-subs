LOVE BELONGS TO DESIRE, 
AND DESIRE IS ALWAYS CRUEL.

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.547
- Oops!

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:15.882
- Ramiro...

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.752
... were you thinking about dinosaurs 
while traveling?

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.588
- Yeah, well... maybe. Yes.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.125
- I was thinking about the court of Philip I, 
and obviously, this is not the place.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:29.062
- Philip I?
- Yeah, Philip the Handsome! I wanted to...

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.499
... meet him. So where are we, then?

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:35.301
- It's not about "where", but "when".

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.638
We're still at home. I mean, 
where our house will be. 

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.940
The badge is to travel in time, not space. 

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:43.643
And this must be around...

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:47.814
... the Cretaceous.

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:50.817
- That sounds like an alien to me.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.919
Any aliens in the Cretaceous period?

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.489
- No, the Cretaceous is more about 
velociraptors, tyrannosaurus...

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.891
- Excuse me, but that's the Jurasic. 

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.093
- No, that's a very common mistake 
because of the movies.

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.562
People think dinosaurs lived 
during the Jurasic period

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.398
-... but it was actually the Cretaceous where...
- Pedro... sum it up. 

00:01:05.865 --> 00:01:07.634
- It should have been "Cretaceous Park".

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:13.606
According to many studies, 
dinosaurs never ate human flesh. 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.242
- Right. Do you think they are aware 
of those studies? 

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:19.145
- In fact, I believe it was only 
because they never coexisted.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:20.980
- I don't think I taste that good, raw as I am.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.650
- Perfect. It can eat you first, 
then it won't want anymore. 

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.821
- Oh, very important! Don't step on any butterfly. 

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.429
- What about giant beetles?

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:39.833
- Nevermind about the beetles. According to "The Butterfly Effect" 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.302
a tiny change in the flapping 
of a buttlerfly of the past

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.871
might trigger enormous changes in our present.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.308
 I have no idea why only butterfflies can do that to the flow of time. 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.211
Watch out!
- Oh, no! Who's that?

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:57.584
- Bloody hell! A caveman clichÃ©! 
Captain Caveman! Ouch!

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:01.287
- Well, this will end up not being the Cretaceous but the Stone Age. 

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:04.424
The badge must have sorted out the mean, 
or something. 

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:10.096
- What do those studies say about 
Cro-magnons eating human flesh?

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:13.867
- It was a usual practice among some tribes. 

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.903
- Awesome! So, what do we do?

00:02:17.504 --> 00:02:21.207
- Slowly, no sudden movements... 
put the badge on.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.944
- Well, now that we're doing some time tourism,

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.746
we could stay a bit longer, couldn't we?

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.649
- Holy shit!  You're not infatuated 
with Captain Caveman, are you?

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.586
- Well, there was no Cro-magnon in my list, 
but I can always add one as I go.

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:38.625
- AAAH!!

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:42.462
- AAAH!!

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.666
- Laura, let's leave. 
He's probably gone find the rest of his tribe, 

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:48.401
and by this time 
they must have invented spares already.  

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.036
- No, he's certainly gone find his son 
so they can be... 

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:52.372
Captain Caveman... and son! 

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.542
- Come on! Let's stay for a while!

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.479
- All right, but we keep the coveralls 
in case we have to skedaddle. 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.980
And give me the badge, I want it ready.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:06.686
- Oh, look at that, 
I seem to work just as good here. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.088
- I think it's more like an offering to deities.

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:12.692
- Excuse me, but this is flirting, not an offering. 

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.695
- Well, what do we do?
- Apparently, we have a date. 

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:31.477
- We are giving paleontologists 
such a big headache! 

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.873
- Laura, I think it's about the time 
for us to leave, isn't it?

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.276
- Oh, but look how cute Crog-me is!

00:04:03.376 --> 00:04:06.646
- His name is not Crog-me, 
it's Captain Caveman!

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.982
- Can't we stay a little bit longer? 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.317
- I advise you not to. I think that's his cave. 

00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:14.320
- How cute is that! 
He wants to show us his place!

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:18.391
- Laura, a guy that takes you to his place 
after a date is not longing to show you 

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:21.494
... his flints collection.
- No. And not his Dragon Ball figures either.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.564
As Mr. Satan would say: It's a trick!

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:29.202
- No, Crog-me is not one of those. 
Look at him, he just wants to take us!

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.771
- Yeah, let me tell you what 
he wants you to take...

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:38.678
- He wants to rape us!

00:04:38.811 --> 00:04:40.546
- No, no! He's too big to fit in here!

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:43.950
- Why would he need a stick if he has THAT!

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.551
- Let's go, let's go! Let's go!

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.153
- We must think about something! 
Where's the badge?

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:48.755
- Home, home! Think about home!

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:50.723
- Will you please not fall? I have no hands!

00:04:51.024 --> 00:04:51.958
- Think about home! About the future!

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:53.726
- Not the future! The present time!

00:04:54.027 --> 00:04:55.261
- The present time! 
Which is future time from now!

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:06.839
- 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:13.012
0,5... 0,25... Hey guys, 
are you sure they're coming today?

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:16.316
- Yes, they will arrive any moment.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:24.290
- Head up, Ramiro, don't stain the carpet!  

00:05:28.928 --> 00:05:31.731
- Ok, listen. I have this bet with Pedro.

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:35.234
If i get 200 people to add this episode 
to their "favorites" list on youtube,

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:40.340
the guy has to work with me in a video 
like "The fellowship is made of nine"

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:48.481
So, here's the deal. You help me out with that,
 and I share a sneak peak of what I plan to do.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:54.520
If by now you can see a button right here, 
we already passed the 200 people.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:57.890
If not, you better add it immediately.
You are on Youtube, right?

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:01.761
See that button below saying "add to"? 
Look, just click  it. 

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:06.132
A box will pop out saying "Favorites". 
That's it, just click there.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.168
Not that hard, is it?

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:21.547
Not yet? Come on, then!

00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:31.057
