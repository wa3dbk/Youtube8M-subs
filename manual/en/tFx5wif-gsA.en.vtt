How to Adopt a Pet from a Shelter.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.740
You can't wait to adopt a rescued animal.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.140
But there's a lot to do before you bring your
pet home from the shelter.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.590
You will need Landlord approval Money A good
shelter Completed paperwork and references

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.870
Patience and a pet carrier.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.870
Step 1.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.150
Pets need love, but they also need attentive
owners who are patient, available, and able

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.730
to afford the expenses and effort to take
care of them.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.640
Since many animals—like dogs, cats, and
birds—can live for more than a decade, determine

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.760
whether your schedule, lifestyle, and finances
will allow you to be a good long-term pet

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.760
owner.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.760
Step 2.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.770
If you rent your home, check in with your
landlord to make sure you&amp;#8217;re living

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.140
in a building that&amp;#8217;s pet-friendly.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.920
Otherwise, bringing home a furry friend may
violate the terms of your lease.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.309
To prevent future hassles, get a signed, dated
document from your landlord stating that pet

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.800
ownership is permitted on the property.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.800
Step 3.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.740
Search online for a local shelter.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.280
Many sites offer reviews of shelters; find
one in your area that rates well, gets good

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.829
feedback, and has the kind of pet you&amp;#8217;re
looking for.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.860
If you can, visit in person to get a feel
for the place and its staff.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.860
Step 4.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.130
Each shelter has its own adoption process,
so find out what&amp;#8217;s required in advance.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.990
You may be asked to provide documentation
and personal references to verify your income,

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.020
home address, and travel and work habits.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.110
Consider assembling &amp;amp; filling out paperwork
you might need before you get there.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.579
Also, make sure you&amp;#8217;ve got the funds
to pay for adoption fees.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.640
Find out whether your adoption fee covers
services like spaying or neutering, disease

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.360
testing, and microchipping.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.310
Also, ask about the shelter&amp;#8217;s return
policy.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.500
Step 5.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.229
Visit the shelter, and meet the pets.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.299
It&amp;#8217;s great to find the fuzzball of your
dreams right away, but don&amp;#8217;t feel pressured

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.630
to adopt the same day or leave with a pet
that you&amp;#8217;re not totally sure of.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.369
You want the one that&amp;#8217;s right for you,
so take your time.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.369
Step 6.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.280
If you decide you&amp;#8217;d like to adopt a
pet, let a shelter worker know.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.120
They&amp;#8217;ll be happy to start walking you
through the process.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.070
They may also be able to provide some background
about your prospective pet: where it came

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.820
from, if it has any issues you should be aware
of, how long it&amp;#8217;s been at the shelter,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.140
and other information.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.180
Step 7.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.480
Once you&amp;#8217;ve finished the adoption process,
congratulations!

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.020
You&amp;#8217;re a proud pet owner.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.460
Take your pet home, and introduce it to its
new family.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.660

of animals found in shelters are purebreds.
