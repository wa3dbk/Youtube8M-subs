00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.920
- We're shooting a commercial
today created by Joel Ackerman of

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.120
Ackermania Creative. They create
viral-style commercials that are highly

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.470
entertaining, but still focus on selling
the product. We're shooting our talent in

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.950
a mummy-infested cave with a dirty toilet.
We're going to shoot at the old L. A.zoo

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.470
in Los Angeles. It's a very cool place to
shoot. A little bit pricey, but a great

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.830
location. We're going to show you how to
use two reflectors, and double-bounce the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.280
light to be able to light our talent
inside a cave. Here are the obstacles. The

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.240
openings of the cave are all in the shade,
and we're lighting with reflectors. There

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.200
are three openings. The two in the
background have reasonable reflector

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.040
access from the outside, but the one at
the mouth of the cave is in a corner and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.930
it's very dark. Of course, that's the
opening where our talent needs to be.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.040
That's the obstacle. We've got to reflect
our light around a corner, and light her

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.940
inside the cave. We'll be shooting both
video and stills in the setup. Let's look

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.180
at our camera settings. We're shooting at
200 ISO, and 50th of a second shutter

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.440
speed for our video, and wide open at 2.8.
I'm on the Tamron 24-70 millimeter lens,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.430
shooting at about 40 millimeters. Here is
our image with only the ambient light from

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.330
outside. We're bouncing ambient light
through the cave windows with a 12 foot by

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.920
12 foot silk. It will bounce a nice, soft
ambient light into the cave. I've set my

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.880
color balance to Tungsten to allow the
daylight reflecting into the cave to be

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.240
very blue. It's something I do a lot, I
know. We'll use a NorthStar light as a

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.060
fill light inside the cave. It's not
strong enough to bounce with the ambient

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.850
light from outside, or I would use it as
the key. We will bounce it into a 6 foot

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.610
by 6 foot photo flex reflector. That
reflector's laying against the side of the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.860
cave wall. Here's our image with just that
fill light. We added a 39 by 72 inch

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.130
PhotoFlex LitePanel in the background to
bounce light through that first opening

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.710
onto the back wall. Wiggling the light
back there will give us the illusion that

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.410
the light's bouncing off from a pool of
water. Here's our image with the reflector

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.550
on that back wall. For our key light we're
going to use a double reflector technique

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.180
to get light around the corner, and onto
our talent. We'll set a reflector out in

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.520
the sun, and use the Hard Side. That will
be reflected into a second reflector,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.900
standing in the shade, which will be aimed
around the corner and onto the talent.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.700
Here's our image with a bounce light
reflected off the second reflector onto

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.152
our talent. Let's look at this lighting in
a piece of video.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.190
[female screams]

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.810
Here's some of the still imagines. Using
the double bounce is really not as hard as

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.480
it looks. Any small reflector's going to
work. I always start with a hard reflector

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.480
that bounces into a softer reflector. This
will work with light panels or round

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.690
reflectors, or a combination thereof.
Simple technique, but very effective. Keep

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.825
those cameras rolling, and keep on
clicking.
