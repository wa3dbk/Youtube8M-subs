LIZZIE: Hey guys, Lizzie here.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.300
Every day at YouTube
Nation, we're

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.100
finding you the best
videos that are out there.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.248
And now we are also bringing
you the best creators.

00:00:06.248 --> 00:00:08.039
By partnering with
Verizon for this series,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.860
we're able to explore the
choices these creators have

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.443
made, including their technology
choices, that have taken them

00:00:12.443 --> 00:00:15.114
from their first videos all the
way up to where they are today.

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:17.217
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.217 --> 00:00:18.550
ANNA AKANA: Hey, YouTube Nation.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.730
My name is Anna Akana.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.260
You may have seen me on
my channel, AnnaAkana,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.520
where I do semi autobiographical
sketches, where I act out

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.260
all the parts.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.500
The first time that I
ever heard about YouTube,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.660
was actually several years ago.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.900
My brother introduced
me to Ryan Higa,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.394
and I watched a
couple of videos.

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:35.810
And I was like,
oh, this is funny.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.600
And then I never went
on it ever again.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.642
Until I moved to Los
Angeles, to become an actor.

00:00:39.642 --> 00:00:41.224
A bunch of friends
and I got together,

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:42.430
and we made a sketch group.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.400
But when they broke off, and
went their own separate ways,

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.460
I still wanted to
keep creating content.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.100
So I decided to
make my own channel.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.790
And this is actually one of the
first things I put up there,

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.400
much to my embarrassment.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.490
(SINGING) Take my mark on
set at six in the morning,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.940
never find 15 hour days boring.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.580
Don't care.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.790
It's cold, it's pouring, my
passion is moving, sorry.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.420
I actually did about 30 things,
where I just vlogged my day.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.587
Because I had no idea
what I wanted to make.

00:01:09.587 --> 00:01:11.420
With "Stoner Anna Versus
Anna: The Musical,"

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.470
I actually used an old camera.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.639
I don't even remember its
name, because it's so old.

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:17.930
And after that, I decided,
you know what-- I hate this.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.700
I just don't want to go
around showing my day.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.270
So I'm going to actually
start doing scripted content,

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.165
thinking about it,
writing ahead of time.

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:29.060
I eventually bought a Canon 60D,
which I chose over the 5D Mark

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.300
II, because it has a
flip viewfinder, which

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.160
was imperative to
a one man crew.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.777
So now I'm choosing to go in
the direction of short films.

00:01:35.777 --> 00:01:38.110
And I'm taking the money that
I've learned from YouTube,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.810
and I'm starting to invest it
into higher production valued

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.650
content.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.980
(SOBBING) I heard her
screaming, so I went in

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.970
and there were all these girls.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.420
All these dead girls.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.670
I made it a goal for this
year to do 12 short films,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.585
before tackling a feature, so
that I'd have some kind of idea

00:01:56.585 --> 00:01:58.660
of what I was
getting myself into.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.590
YouTube offers the ultimate
creative control, and a space

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.170
to play, and to just
put whatever out there.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.169
LIZZIE: That's it, guys.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.360
Many thanks to Anna for
imparting all of her wisdom.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.860
And thanks to Verizon
for helping us

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.420
take a look at what
makes a great choice.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.430
If you have a creator you're
dying to see on the show,

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.980
post a link in the
comments, with the hashtag

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.720
#MYFIRSTUPLOAD.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:18.990
Keep an eye out, and
maybe next time we'll

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.590
get to pick the brain of
your favorite YouTuber.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.190
ANNA AKANA: (SINGING) But things
move so slowly in Hollywood,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.481
so I sit and waited, paid my
dues, baby, like I should.

00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:28.222
The hardest thing is waiting
day to day, to day, to day.

00:02:28.222 --> 00:02:29.180
I just want to act now.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.630
I don't want to have to wait.
