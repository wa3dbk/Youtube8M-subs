00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.660
How to Make a Spectroscope.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.290
If you're itching to discover the wonders
of the world around you, this guide will have

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.620
you gazing at the unique spectrum fingerprint
of each element right at home.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:22.540
You will need CD or DVD disc Cardboard box
Ruler Black marker Toilet paper tube Utility

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:32.091
knife Cellophane tape Protractor Aluminum
tape or foil and glue 2 razor blades and black

00:00:32.091 --> 00:00:33.680
paint (optional).

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.820
Always use caution when using a utility knife
and have an adult help if needed.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.820
Step 1.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.329
Place the CD or DVD outside the box against
one side about 1/2 inch from the bottom.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.850
Trace the small spindle hole in the middle
with a black marker -- this is the height

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.800
of the viewing port.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.100
A tall shoe box will work as long as it is
taller than the disc.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.310
Step 2.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.101
Trace the toilet paper tube circle over the
CD spindle hole, move the tube over 1/2 inch

00:01:01.101 --> 00:01:02.829
and trace another circle.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.610
Connect both circles to make an oval and cut
out the shape using a utility knife.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.860
Step 3.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.600
Tape the toilet paper tube halfway through
the port at a 60 degree angle using plain

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.210
cellophane tape and a protractor.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.670
Seal around the tube with aluminum tape or
tin foil and glue to block out all light.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.930
Paint the inside of the box black for better
viewing.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:24.930
Step 4.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.060
Turn the box a quarter turn counterclockwise
and use the CD to measure another hole.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.510
Cut out a small slit through the circle 1/2
inch wide and 2 inches tall.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.780
Step 5.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.280
Tape both razor blades together on the box
so their sharp edges almost touch.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.630
Make a very small sliver of light through
the slit cut in the box.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.520
If the light is too dim, your blades are too
close; if the spectra is blurry, your blades

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.440
are too far apart.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.840
Step 6.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.650
Tape the CD or DVD inside the box opposite
the razor blade slit with the rainbow or prism

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.880
side out.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.479
Try to offset the CD from the box wall the
same distance as your razor blades.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.740
Step 7.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.509
Seal the box completely using aluminum tape,
or foil and glue.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.730
Peer through the toilet paper tube, point
the razor blades at a light source, and gaze

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.140
at the color spectrum of the world around
you.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.170
Did you know Astronomers use powerful spectroscopes
and computers to study the composition of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.870
stars and planets millions of light years
away from Earth.
