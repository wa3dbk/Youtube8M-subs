00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.500
My name is Catherine and this is one of the training weekends

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.749
for the GB Junior Rifle Squad.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.880
The people that have said to me "Why do you do it?"

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.880
"You've given up twenty years of your life."

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.580
The most,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.340
best thing you can see is that smile when they walk off the range.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.080
I think everyone here wants to go to the Olympics and win a medal, that's why we're all here.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.690
We come to these events

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.140
once a month, we have two days once month through Saturday and Sunday.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.300
We start around about 9 o'clock in the morning

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.580
and we go through until 5 or 6 o'clock at night.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.600
Each person

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.260
signs themselves in,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.460
then we have a general meeting for everybody.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.119
Then they disappear into small groups with a coach.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.620
I'm Abby Warren and we're The Great British Junior Rifle Squad

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.180
and we're training as part of the team.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.160
We've got two different disciplines, sporter and then the precision.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.680
We have people of all ages from about 12, right up to the ones who are turning 21.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.700
Between that they are split into three levels,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.160
we don't split them by age, we actually split them by how far they've got.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.220
Actually, a lot of our shooters here have actually started

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.400
with the Air Arms air rifles and they've actually shot through positional with them.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.580
Actually when they come out, when they shoot with the first 2.2's

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.120
they're actually about the same shape as the Air Arms rifles.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.600
So what we say to them, they come out they've a bit worried about it being 2.2

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.680
and we say pretend it's your Air Arms rifle, just set it up the same.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.320
We start with that and move on.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.680
The GGB weekends are so helpful

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.850
because all the coaches, they just know

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.030
everything and they can help you with any little adjustments

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.830
that you need to make.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.840
From other competitions I'm working on the fact that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.000
nerves,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.220
I've got a technique where just stare into space and it look a 180 degrees and just drop

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.780
your mouth and it really helps to relax and your

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.380
nerves just disappear.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.980
First of all if you want to get into this squad,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:19.080
you,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.120
basically you need to first

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.920
ring the NCRA.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.120
To get my email address.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.140
Then we will put you on a system,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.380
on a database.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.500
Then anytime you do any shooting

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.200
you put the scores into the database,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.000
2 or 3 times a year we look at the database,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.960
call up those who we think have ability

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.900
and we will invite you to a weekend where we'll see

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.470
and we'll take the best and move them on from there.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.800
Our coaches usually set kind of a guideline

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.260
what the timings are and things.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.760
Sometimes, like this morning I know some of the other guys have been doing a masterclass

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.820
on a approach to the target, so they'll kind of set up things like that.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.859
Or if you've got stuff you know you need to work on

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.439
they're happy for you to go off and do that

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.440
in the time slots available.

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.860
What I've just been working on today is

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.660
standing 2.2 and just my approach coming down onto the target.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.079
I'll then tomorrow I will be looking at my

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.919
3 position changeovers.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.780
Like I said no big changes

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.780
because it's before competition and we have a few more big ones coming up.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.360
We have

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.640
various things that go on here at the same time

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.760
and various disciplines

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.940
where they shoot three positions

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.520
standing, kneeling and lying down which we call prone.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.640
I think I benefit from

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.400
having everyone else here

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.340
not to compete against as such, but you always see

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.100
who's above you and who you're aiming for

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.720
and also who's aiming for you.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.040
So it keeps a sense of competitiveness that you want to keep training

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.080
and keep going and keep getting better.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.400
Yeah I'd like to get the Olympics

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.120
I definitely,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.320
my goal was to go to World University Games this year.

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.600
But now they're slightly full.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.280
So I think from there

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:19.820
I'd like to be in the top 10.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.260
These people up to be absolutely dedicated,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.730
they are as dedicated as your sportsman you see on the television during you running,

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.430
jumping and shooting whatever. Shooters have to be

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.630
exactly the same.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.240
They have to be absolutely dedicated to get to the top.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.380
