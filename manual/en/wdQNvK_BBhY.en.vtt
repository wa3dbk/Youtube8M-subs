00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.080
My name is Elena Kostina 
and I’m from Russia.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.550
I’m Jonathan and I’m from Colombia 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.790
I like Oxford city itself, 
it’s something unique and I like it!

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.160
Everything is fun here! 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.080
There are interesting places to know, 
there are many universities, 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.220
this is a very cultural city. 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.280
The college is very close 
to the city centre, 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.330
there are many transport services, 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.250
its just 5 or 10 minutes from 
city centre to school.  

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.340
Here in the college we can find 
many facilities for the students. 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.840
There’s a student room with computers 
and internet access 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.330
and there is the multi media room 
that help you improve your English. 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.240
What I like about the teachers 
is that they are really friendly, 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.040
they help you. 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.850
They share the knowledge not only 
from the academic language 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.990
but if not their life experience.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.750
All our staff are graduates 
and quite a few of them have 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.650
master degrees as well. 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.230
A lot of our staff have worked 
at Kaplan for a number of years 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.650
and students like to feel there’s 
continuity here in staffing.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.040
After classes we go down 
to the cafeteria 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.060
and we can take lunch 
in the garden or inside the cafeteria. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.730
We can get pasta, pizza, 
fish and chips, 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870
that is the traditional food 
here in England. 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.930
There are plenty of activities. 
We can do punting together.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.950
We can go shopping together 
in the city centre 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.350
or we can go to Bicester Village. 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.940
There are good brands 
and discounted labels. 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.330
You can get good quality clothes.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.020
Bowling is really good 
because you challenge your friends 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.910
and look if you can win. 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370
I like to make strikes there. 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.100
I think it’s a very good place 
where you can go and have fun.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.720
Hi Kitty, how has your day been?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.200
At Kaplan Oxford we have got 
two choices of accommodation. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.380
One is staying with an 
English host family 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.640
so basically you’re part of the family, 
you’re living in their home, 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.470
you’re interacting with English 
people all the time. 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.490
The other option we have 
is staying in a residence, 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.490
you’ve got your own 
individual bedroom, 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.650
but you’re also sharing the 
apartment with other students. 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.250
You have your own kitchen 
you can cook whatever you want. 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.430
You have your bedroom in a way, 
you live with your friends 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.750
and you can talk with them 
anytime you want.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.180
Not only does Kaplan Oxford 
have a fantastically qualified 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.080
experienced teachers 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.690
on top of that you are learning 
in a beautiful historic destination 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.960
and so it makes the ideal place for 
any student to come and learn English. 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.230
I would recommend Kaplan Oxford 
because it’s a university city, 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.870
it’s very famous and traditional city.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.400
The environment here is very lovely 
and I’m enjoying it here!
