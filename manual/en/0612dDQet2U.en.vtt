Hello. My name is Louis Estrada and I'm a
software developer. In this video, I'll show

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.280
you how to view and delete browsing history
on Safari. Safari is a registered trademark

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.850
of Apple Incorporated, a company to which
I have no affiliation. To view your browsing

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.050
history, click on the History tab. You can
see the pages that you have visited by day

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.670
or choose the Show All History option. Now,
you can get a full page of information about

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.290
sites you have visited every day. You can
delete history one element at a time. For

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.390
example, select any of the visited sites and
press Delete on your keyboard. You can also

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.800
delete the entire browsing history for a full
day by doing the same. If you want to delete

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.410
the entire history, select Delete History
under the History tab. When you view the history

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.539
again, notice everything is gone. Keep in
mind that this hasn't deleted your cookies

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:11.229
or user name and passwords. To clear this,
click on the Edit tab, Preferences, AutoFill

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.329
and press on the Edit button for the user
names and passwords. There's a list of all

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:25.319
websites that Safari holds passwords for.
Delete one by one or delete them all, then

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:33.579
press Accept. Now go to the Security tab and
press the Show Cookies button. Again, you

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:40.630
can delete cookie by cookie, which can take
a lot of time, or simply delete all. Finally,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.829
click on Done. Since we are already in the
Preferences menu, click on the General tab.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:54.499
Here, you can choose how often Safari should
delete elements from your history. For example,

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:03.250
every day, week, month or year. If you select
Manually, then Safari will never delete your

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.009
history elements and you will have to do it
yourself every once in a while. If in case

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.450
you decide that you do not want to store any
kind of history on your Safari browser, go

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.989
to the Edit tab and select Private Browsing.
This way, visited web pages are not added

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.439
to the history. There's no track of downloaded
fills, AutoFill for forms is disabled and

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:36.430
your search terms are deleted as well. I'm
Luis Estrada and I've just shown you how to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.629
use your web browser.
