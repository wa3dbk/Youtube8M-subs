Ok, today we have a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.190
1996 Kawasaki

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.910
ZX-6R Ninja; this is just an awesome
machine here.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.070
It's one of the early super sport bikes.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.550
It's definitely got a lot of performance.
It's very clean

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.320
and it runs, rides, and shifts very smoothly through all of the gears..

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.700
..no transmission trouble

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.260
it's been upgraded to this

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.430
D&amp;D performance exhaust system.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.780
It's received a fender eliminator kit with the shorty turn signals

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.220
it's also been upgraded to a Second-Look seat

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.910
The front master cylinder has been replaced with a carbon-topped there

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.489
also with the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.369
adjustable levers on both sides - 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.649
It's just an amazing machine.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.400
all of the electrical is working 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.430
the lights, horn, etc. It doesn't smoke out
of the exhaust or drip any fluids

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.610
the tires on it are definitely nice

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.920
and a very recent battery as well.
Presently the motor is just over

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.930
36,600 miles.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.360
let's go ahead and fire it up and see how it sounds.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.130
We've got the low beam

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.650
high beam

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.580
It's such an amazing bike.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.519
Don't hesitate to ask any questions or provide a few comments.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.670
Thanks for watching!
