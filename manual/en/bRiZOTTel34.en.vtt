00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.419
What i've been fighting with recently on
this Saturn project is the carbon buildup

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:14.759
on these pistons.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.319
I've been trying to clean the carbon off,

00:00:17.319 --> 00:00:21.810
I tried using the old piston rings to
scrape out the grooves.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.220
I tried using

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.500
break cleaner, carburetor cleaner.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.360
I bought this Berryman B-12 because
it says it removes carbon so I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.030
thought maybe if I soaked it in there it
would soften it.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.400
It didn't,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.090
I soaked a piston and there for upwards of a week
week and it

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.470
didn't seem to make any difference. The
carbon was still hard and I couldn't get

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.710
it off.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.080
So I got this,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.830
it cost about $30.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.039
It says,

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.550
"the good stuff"

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.680
so maybe that means that it's going to do
the job.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.270
On the can here

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.030
it says...

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.220
carbon residue on valves pistons and other
engine parts may require longer

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.760
cleaning times.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.510
So, to me that means it's made to do this
job.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.880
It's even got a picture of a piston and a valve

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.140
and all that good stuff.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.440
So I'm going to give this a shot and hopefully

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.440
It will work out make a move on with
this project.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.370
Everything I've read says this is some
pretty nasty stuff.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.370
A friend of mine who used some said to do it outside.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.770
I've got my goggles on.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.060
Well, it has a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.009
basket in it...

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.440
for dipping small parts.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.519
I guess what I'm going to do is that this

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.249
piston which I already did quite a bit of
manual cleaning on

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.839
and see if it can get the residual carbon out of the

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:23.839
piston ring grooves I wasn't able to get.

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:30.180
Ok, it's been in here for a roughly half an
hour

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.180
right now.

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:46.670
So i can see

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.269
it did remove the carbon that was around there.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.310
I can see inside ring grooves, they do

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.949
cleaner.

00:02:54.949 --> 00:03:01.949
I still see some carbon deposits but lets rinse it and dip it.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:09.259
This is just water.

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:16.259
Auto Repair

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.179
Well,

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:25.479
the middle groove which is the one i was
having trouble with is looking better.

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.329
It's still got some junk in it.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.699
Let me see

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:32.829
if the carbon is softer now.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.419
I'm going

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:40.189
to get a piston ring and see if
I can scrap that carbon any easier than before.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.639
I've rinsed this thoroughly with water

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.299
so now i'm taking a

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.129
piece of a piston ring and I'm trying to

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:55.129
scrape in this groove.

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:03.869
You can see the carbon has turned soft
and its peeling up out of there.

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:06.549
So it's actually coming out.

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.089
It I soak it longer I bet it

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.599
would all dissolve.

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.359
I just did some more scraping and

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.530
I got some more of it to peel out of there.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.319
I'm almost down to the bottom

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.380
so it seems like this stuff is working.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.520
It softens up the top layer

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.189
to where I can scrap it off down to harness again

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.389
and put it back in to soak longer and it will

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.909
soften the next layer.

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:41.919
I'm going to put it back in.

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.060
Probably if I just let it soak for hours

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.419
it would probably clean the whole thing

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.350
off without scraping.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.350
Well I put it back in there and forgot it
for about an hour and a half.

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:02.870
It looks pretty good, I can see a few
small spots in

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.900
some of the grooves that need to

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.669
be scraped out but i'm willing to bet
they're pretty darn soft and they'll probably come

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:10.340
out really easy.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.680
So all in all this product seems to work
really good.  I had tried

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.880
quite a few different products before it

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.830
and didn't get any results at all.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.669
This one, it obviously dissolves carbon

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:29.669
and it does a pretty good job it.
