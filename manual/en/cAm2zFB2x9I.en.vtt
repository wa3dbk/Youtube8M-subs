00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.510
I'm Ron Patterson with Utah State University
Extension in Carbon County.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.339
Today we're going to cover how to plant beets.

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.540
They're pretty easy to handle, and they do
well in our high elevation climates in Utah.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.840
You can usually plant beets early May, maybe
late April, and they'll do fairly well in...in

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.000
the higher elevations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.019
You get down around the Wasatch Front, and
you'll probably want to maybe plant them middle

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.810
April, or maybe even early April.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.199
But they do quite well; they're fairly hardy
plants and they'll pop up pretty good - they're

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.670
not nearly as tender as the carrots are - but
they do well.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.760
You can plant beets in a wide row or you can
plant them in a single row and I'll show you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.230
a couple of ways of doing each one.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:47.469
When you do beets in a row, it's really simple,
you just take a hoe, and make a furrow.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:55.720
Now if you wanted, you could plant beets several
rows very close together, making a wide row

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.980
system in rows, and that's one way you can
do beets.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.400
This year has been a very dry year, throughout
the winter and the spring, and it's important

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.230
to have that moisture in your furrow so that
the seeds will have that activation to get

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.240
them germinating.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.570
You can that my furrows are very...very dry
here, so we're going to trickle some water

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.740
in there and get a good wetting down in my
furrows.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.351
If you have a really wet spring you may not
need to do this, but in our country we never

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:33.770
have what's call a wet spring, so I always
make sure I got plenty of moisture to begin

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:34.770
with.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.530
Then I don't have to worry about watering
the seeds up; they should pop up pretty good

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.110
with just having this water here in the furrow.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.671
The seeds should germinate - if your soil
temperature's up at a good soil temperature

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:51.710
- your seeds should germinate within ten days,
two weeks at the most, so hopefully you won't

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.370
have to water them again before they pop up
out.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.370
If you do, you want to be kinda careful you
don't wash things away but beets are pretty

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.460
tough - they can pop through a little bit
of a crust like we get formed here in our...in

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.890
our clay-y type soils.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.040
We can still have those beets pop up through,
but if you can avoid have to water after you've

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.090
planted until the seedlings have popped up,
then you're going to be better off.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.080
Now beets are also a very good root and a
leaf crop; the leaves are a delicious treat

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.750
as well as the root, so that you can bottle
the root, you can eat them fresh, you can

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.300
eat them pickled, and the leaves are also
very good and very nutritious.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.090
The seeds are kind of a...a conglomerate of
seeds actually - that's more than one seed

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.990
- so even though you think you've spread them
out, they will kind of come up in a cluster.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:47.300
So we'll kind of plant these fairly loose,
thin across here - not real heavy - and just

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.090
kind of plant them in there.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.320
Scatter them down each row.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.220
One more row to do.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.180
Finish off this package.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:17.100
All right, so we've got our seed in the furrow
and just cover them over...about a quarter

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.730
of an inch is all you need; maybe a little
bit more, they're a little hardier than the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.920
carrots are.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:30.040
About a quarter of an inch on top of your
seed, and then you want to kind of pat the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.750
ground down; get a good contact between the
soil and the seed.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.709
And hopefully we won't have to water this
again until we've got some seedlings popping

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.709
up.

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.530
So there we've got them planted in furrows,
and I'll show you how we can do it in another...in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.900
a wider bed.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.099
Now for making a...just a wide row, we can
use a rake - the backside of a rake - and

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.209
rake that right out and get us a wide bed.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:12.870
I try to keep mine within about a foot wide
or so, depending on how long I want my bed.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.690
I'm going to make this...try to make it level
so my water will pool and soak down into the

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.090
soil.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.360
All right now you'll notice that this bed
is still pretty dry, so I need to make sure

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:41.640
I've got water in it; try to make it fairly
level so the water will evenly in soak in

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:49.840
to the whole area.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.130
Because it's so dry, if I can get a half inch
of water or so sitting in that puddle, it'll

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:07.000
soak down at least six inches into the soil.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.630
So now we'll let that water soak down and
we'll plant some more beet seeds.

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:19.280
Okay the water's soaked down in here pretty
good, so all we need to do is grab a few beet

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.381
seeds and scatter them out over the area.

00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:29.760
It doesn't take a lot; one package of beet
seeds will last a normal family several years.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.901
So kinda scatter those out; if you think your
seeds are a little bit old or something you

00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:38.490
might put a little bit extra in there.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.970
You can always thin them out if you plant
too heavy, and then we'll cover them up.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.880
Okay, so now I've got it scattered out; cover
it up -again about a quarter inch over the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880
seed.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:06:00.250
Pat it down so you've got good seed soil contact,
with that seed in contact with that moist

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:01.250
soil.

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:07.400
That's really all it takes, so now you're
ready to go have some fun in your garden.
