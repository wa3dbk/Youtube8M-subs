00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:05.439
I'm here with Mandi to talk to you a little bit

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.260
about drains. Why we use them, what they are

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:14.497
through the end of an incision or through a separate incision

00:00:12.497 --> 00:00:14.497
and how to manage them. First of all drains are placed

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.870
underneath the skin whre I have been operating

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.070
because fluid will accumulate there in many procedures such as a tummy tuck

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:26.441
and we want to get that fluid out 
 so that the healing will be successful

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.046
the drain is composed of two parts: There is 
 a tube and there is a bulb

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.150
This is a reservoir that the fludi will go into 
 and we commonly refer to it as a grenade

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:43.624
becuase it looks like a grenade. The drain 
 tubing has two parts. This white part

00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:48.898
is inside your body underneath your skin.

00:00:50.906 --> 00:00:52.906
and the plastic more transparent part is outside the skin.

00:00:56.384 --> 00:00:58.384
and connects what's underneath the skin to the reservoir.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.359
we want to show you three separate things to know how to do.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.679
the first is how to strip the drain in 
 case there is something clogging the drain

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:10.886
the second is how to empty and measure what is coming into the reservoir,

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.659
and the third Mandi will show you how to secure the drain to your 
 clothing so you don't have to carry it around all the time.

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:24.684
so Let's start by stripping the drain.

00:01:29.156 --> 00:01:31.156
the drain is coming out of the skin and 
 this is where Mandi's fingers are holding it.

00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:36.543
sometimes you'll get some small blood clot or 
 a little bit of debris in here

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.580
which clogs the tube and doesn't allow the suction 
 in the bulb to pull the fluid out

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:48.090
the way you can clear that is by something known as "stripping the drain".

00:01:50.087 --> 00:01:52.090
you pinch it close to where it comes out from 
 the skin and then draw it towards the bulb.

00:01:57.404 --> 00:01:59.400
and then you release that which creates a vacuum bring this towards the bulb.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.420
and you do this all the way out to the bulb.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280
so basically you are just squeezing this between your fingers 
 and moving it away from where the skin is.

00:02:16.024 --> 00:02:18.020
and letting go close to the skin which helps

00:02:20.102 --> 00:02:22.100
move any debris or blood clots towards the reservoir.

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.580
Now we're going to show you how to empty and record the fluid

00:02:33.372 --> 00:02:35.370
that's coming out of the reservoir.

00:02:41.274 --> 00:02:43.270
ok during your pre-op we will discuss drain care.

00:02:41.274 --> 00:02:43.270
you will see that the fluid is in the bulb. 
 Basically what you are going to do is

00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:48.330
empty this a couple of times a day.

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:50.720
for the first 48 hours you can expect more drainage.

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.970
and then over the course of a week it will start to taper off.

00:02:55.793 --> 00:02:57.790
This will always have a suction. What to do is

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.140
pop the lid. We'll give you a Dixie cup to empty the fluid into.

00:03:05.132 --> 00:03:07.130
empty the fluid into the cup.

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.370
Measure the fluid in milliliters.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.380
Record the amount of drainage that is coming out.

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.820
to close the bulb, hold and keep the suction

00:03:24.627 --> 00:03:26.630
And replace the lid.

00:03:28.363 --> 00:03:30.360
How to secure your drains

00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:36.060
We're going to give you two of these clips.

00:03:36.903 --> 00:03:38.900
included in your surgery kit. What you're going to do is

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:43.200
wrap the clip around the plastic part of the drain,

00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:47.110
clip that together

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.250
and you use the clip to hold the drain

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.950
in place by clipping it onto your binder.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.260
when you are showering, here is a tip.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:03.030
get a shoe string and run the shoe string through the drain.

00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:08.630
keep the drain elevated when showering.

00:04:06.631 --> 00:04:08.630
and make a little necklace to kind of

00:04:08.911 --> 00:04:10.910
these tips should help you manage your drains a little more easily.

00:04:13.605 --> 00:04:15.600
rains are sortof a nuisance but they serve an important purpose.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.330
and we won't keep the drains any longer 
 than we need them to be there.

00:04:22.237 --> 00:04:24.240
But they'll stay there as long as they are do their work.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.980
of course if you have a question when 
 you are at home about your drains.

00:04:29.291 --> 00:04:31.290
always give us a call.
