we'll give you whatever you want

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.670
the national mcdonnell should give a
huge gray so that local McDonald's

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.270
franchisee yeah absolutely they should
do whatever they can form right because

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.729
he's

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.990
absolutely the best advertising for
McDowell's number one

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.200
number two that hold this whole thing's
been a giant head for McDonald's cuz you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.689

number one Toby stupid

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.969
no big okay green light I go over girls
do whatever the hell I want

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.170
know he ate I think about 2,000 calories
a day

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.759
and he walked for 45 minutes each day so
he was on a strict regimen

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.619
okay I can't believe the he lost that
much weight in three months yeah

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.940
its I'm not a lot of time yes oh the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.420
picture alright is the before picture
before McDonalds the one on the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.230
left is that after big arts this guide
is the greatest sat in the history of

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.849
mankind

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.440
rebels right story about this and %ah
now here in a misinterpret 90 don't

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.120
misinterpret it now loaded

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.310
I think the much more important point
here doesn't mean new mcdonnell's

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.160
at everybody's got a different type my
house come to South Beach seige only

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.379
pigs and not so you're only brought
million pairs

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:41.110
racketeer the ID leaves in you know
horse to do whatever it is right

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.110
greene et this steel oatmeal I don't
even know what's the long as I don't

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.010
I don't know that it's OK okay okay

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.890
so everything a different idea oh no you
only meter every game

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.709
bring it down okay so apparently he just
didn't make I'll still be fine

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.890
calories in calories up for K yeah
really simplistic approach right and and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.239
people I know right people are probably
gonna wonder right now well okay

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.360
what about the quality of food what I
found really interesting was his

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.080
cholesterol went down as well

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.340
yeah %uh but from $2.49 a 170 but it
undeniable

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.769
it's not good for you to rely on
processed food like mcdonald's all time

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.340
you gotta eat clean like that's the best
way to do it

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.720
and you have to find a diet plan that
you can live by for the rest of your

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.799
life it's not really a diet it's a
lifestyle change

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.140
all those things are true and of course
natural foods are better

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.560
%uh would like come on you know that
right you know that in a and you gotta

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.650
get your basic food groups which he did
write don't lose track about

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.549
right all that stuff is true but don't
get obsessed with what particular kinda

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:44.370
diet

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.640
the you have to do for X amount of time
rate so if u'd glass

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.780
in you exercise more that's the
hard-headed

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.709
a you'll be a thousand times better off
because I think what's stopping a lot of

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:56.810
people is like our

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.319
arm and I know I don't have the right
kinda prunes

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.890
and the reich I know stanza broccoli

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.379
they need to show up in my ears trade so
i cant no I can't I can't do it right

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.739
no I don't believe the hype don't
believe any the nonsense okay

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.079
eat less exercise more try to eat as
much natural as you can

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.680
and try to get your ghetto around it
think in by the way yes less carbs

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.000
dolgo mentally can cut carbs forever a
gay but he couldn't do a little less

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.840
carbs

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.820
bless your heart right little and
portion control I think that's another

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.750
thing and the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.320
the main issue that we have in the
united states right now what we're

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.800
eating as we just eat too much of it
there people that eat very healthy but

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.979
you can get fat by eating really healthy
because you might

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.740
eat too much whatever it is right too
much brown rice or whatever

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.150
so it's just a good idea who you have to
worry we aren't you

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.050
well brown from having calories so it's
not me

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.460
I mean you can about buying raw nuts as
well didn't

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.740
the reason I bring up because runners
are very hot

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.639
it cool you know and baby are doing them
sometimes they do get brought up

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.600
a but paapa

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.110
get by the way I'm back to my third eye

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.130
what women but where I take

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.289
author the whatever they give me and
donated

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.410
oh you do yeah silos 65 pounds

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.639
i right that's a good idea but it's a
good diet

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.930
already did a few since and how tobacco
0

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.030
went great you know why so I had this
with

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.030
do you see a creeper so Bakken good

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.789
okay I think I might do it too ok and
yeah

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.000
but and they have great friends try
super salty

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.550
love again good sauce is a center you
know I did a psych

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.740
cut author the burger put it aside and
two-thirds the price

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.949
okay and so I just had a third of rise
into those a burger

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:01.880
and like a two-out and I n there's one
other quick wrinkle to it

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.020
at everybody eat every bite lose your
last but

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.580
rate so now I'm not the first guy to
come up with that but like so when I did

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.590
that I was like no enjoy that by

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.970
and that went to in that one too right
and he goes on and on

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:17.419
so you're like man I really enjoy that
really does a lot made

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:20.509
because you always I don't own but you
guys with me like at the animal alright

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.850
remember focus with all sick you know
that's good I should come out

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:27.449
right be so you sir billion you're much
better off

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.669
and then afterwards I went to movie does
like I'll did I miss that last year the

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.130
burger the rest the price

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.819
absolutely mutton it was a perfectly
filling

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.169
good meal I got just as much I let me
know as if I'd even the whole thing

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.960
too weird because and I'm gonna be
unknowingly Jr first like it but like

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.949
whenever I go out to eat I

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.919
usually the portion is too big anyway
and I just eat in 2014

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.310
and then I saw being and we got a lot of
people have issues with that

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:59.720
pro-death I'll I i no but I also read
more than once a day

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.750
I like I like having three males at Lia

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.770
so the certs you know just common sense
that you would as we all know

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:07.550
it's not a cop
