00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.320
What is Adaptil?

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.750
Adaptil is a copy of the natural pheromone produced by mother dog

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.290
a few days after giving birth.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.580
it gives her puppies the feeling of safety and comfort.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.570
By providing a constant source of reassurance

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.570
What is a pheromone?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.900
Pheromones are messages leaves for itself or for others to communication.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.510
You can not see or smell a pheromone

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.690
and only another animal in the same species can detect it.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.340
Ceva was the first company to develop the use of pheromones

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.600
as away improving behavior in animals.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.280
For example not only can Adaptil to be used to offer comfort to puppies.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.140
as their mothers natural pheromone would.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.200
It can also be used offer support and
comfort adult dogs in new or stressful situations.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.129
Such as traveling in the car, being exposed to loud and fightening noises

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.460
Adaptil has been proven to reduce or completely remove

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.970
unwanted behaviors demonstrated during
this time.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.710
Based on research into Adaptil, Ceva
has developed several effective ways

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.830
administering it to adult dogs and puppies.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.830
These are the Adaptil spray,

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.040
the Adaptil Diffuser, Adaptil Collar and Adaptil wipes.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.740
Each presentation of Adaptil products has it's own benefits

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.780
to meet your dog's specific needs.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.120
For example Adaptil Collar is great for dogs that are rarely in home

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.760
and who are out and about with their owner.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.730
As the collar last for 4 weeks

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.630
it ensure that your dog has the support of the Adaptil pheromone continuously.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.490
throughout the day for that period.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.390
The Adaptil Diffuser is perfect for use in the home.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.100
and it's particularly useful for your dog
if he needs to feel more secure here.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800
Or if you have more than one dog.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.490
It is easy to use,

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.830
just plug it into an electrical socket
and leave it working 24 hours a day

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.230
seven days a week.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.730
The vial provides a
month of pheromone support

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.149
and can be replaced after this time.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.749
The whole Adaptil Diffuser needs to be changed after 6 months of use

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.360
or after you have used five refills.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.060
Adaptil Spray is very useful when you need

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350
support of Adaptil for a short period
time.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.370
You can use a spray in the car if you're
going on a trip

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.080
or on your dogs bed or blanket

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.549
As the Adaptil spray is alcohol based it
is vital that you leave the areas

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.390
that you have treated

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.539
for 15 minutes before you let you dog
have access to them

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.920
Dogs don't like the smell of alcohol.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.370
So it is also really important and not spray your dog with the Adaptil spray.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.069
Adaptil is also available in some
countries as the wipe

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.370
You just wipe the area you want to treat.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.080
All of these preparations can be used
at the same time for additional support

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.000
Should you wish.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.600
As it is impossible to overdose with pheromones.
