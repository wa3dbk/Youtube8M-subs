00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.150
[Pilot:] Commander, this is Falconbird.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.750
The new ship is handling fine.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:13.940
[Commander:] Good to hear it, Falconbird.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.400
That baby should fly smoother than my oiled satin sheets.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.390
[Pilot:] ... Yes, commander.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.110
I'm approaching enemy territory.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.430
[Commander:] You have permission to engage.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.600
Go with god, Falconbird.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.890
[Pilot:] Um... I'm still waiting on the rest of the squadron, sir.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.410
[Commander:] This is a solo mission, Falconbird.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.130
Go with god.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.330
[Pilot:] What? I'm doing this alone?

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.670
[Commander:] You're the best pilot we have.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.200
You have all the expert skills,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.570
like left, right,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.960
and slowly moving up.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.440
[Pilot:] I'm positive the 
other pilots could do that too.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.050
[Commander:] All of our resourses 
have been allocated to your single ship.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.860
Do you know how much 
that state-of-the-art craft of yours cost?

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.430
[Pilot:] No, sir.
[Commander:] A shit-ton.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.800
Like, all the money.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.030
[Pilot:] How was this worth that? 
There's nothing here but joystick and two buttons.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.830
[Commander:] The joystick 
is your main control panel.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.150
The red one is your primary gun,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.000
and the blue is a little 
something special we cooked up.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.840
I call it,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.200
"God's jizz."

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.300
[Pilot:] So I just press it like this?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.100
Whoa-ho-ho-ho! That's amazing, holy shit!

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.200
[Commander:] Hold your fire, 
Falconbird. We only have -

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.430
[Pilot:] I am death, destroyer of worlds!!!

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.200
Bwaaaaaaaaaaaa -

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.720
[Commander:] Hold your god-damn fire!

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.490
We only put three of those shells on board!

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.490
[Pilot:] Wait, do what?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
[Commander:] Each shell contains twenty years worth of harvested plutonium!

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.760
[Pilot:] Commander, I don't like what you're saying to me right now.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.650
[Commander:] Fine. It's fine.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.950
If you can just line up their entire army

00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:25.770
into a straight line, we still have a chance.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.240
[Pilot:] Oh god! Enemy contact!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.430
[Commander:] Falconbird! You've doomed us all!

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.300
[Pilot:] What about me?

00:01:32.301 --> 00:01:34.130
How am I supposed to defend myself?

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.570
[Commander:] You'll have 
to use the primary cannons.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.600
The red button.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.570
*pew pew*

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.100
[Pilot:] Did you just duct tape pistols to the plane?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.320
Oh god.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.520
Oh jesus shit oh god no.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.560
Oh. Okay.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.660
[Commander:] Excellent.
Great work, Falconbird.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.500
Now, just do that two thousand more times.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.110
[Pilot:] WHAT?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.110
[Commander:] You have no choice.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.840
Civilization as we know it is at stake!

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.900
[Pilot:] Incoming? Incoming!

00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:55.830
I've got incoming!

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.600
[Commander:] You can do this, Falconbird!

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.330
[Pilot:] Commander!

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.550
[Commander:] Don't let them past you, son!

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.970
The colony -

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.680
[Pilot:] I'm sorry, sir, I'm so sorry!

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.630
[Commander:] Oh god. Sound the alarms!

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.510
Get the women and children to safety!

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.120
[Pilot:] There's so many and my guns are so small...

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.850
I can't do this.
I can't do this!

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.240
[Commander:] They're bombing the capital!

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.460
They have lazers. That's our technology!

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.120
[Pilot:] Oh my god.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.250
That's not fair!
