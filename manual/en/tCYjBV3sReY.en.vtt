00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.300
Deciding what to do with 
your life is no easy task.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:04.590
It's never been!

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.449
But today it seems that there are even
more options and paths to choose from.

00:00:08.449 --> 00:00:13.009
The world is changing at a very 
fast pace and we renew

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.829
the way we interact with people and 
the job market all the time.

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:18.160
To the new generation,

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.250
the so-called Digital Natives, social network
relationships proved to be a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.689
powerful tool to share
information and knowledge.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.029
Knowing how to inspire and 
empower others became an

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.610
increasing desired behavior
for this generation.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.200
Furthermore, nowadays we experience
a great need to solidify

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
and materialize our ideas.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.550
In others words,
actually make things happen.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.970
We have more tools handy,
and based on the power of the collective

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.950
and with just one click, we
are able to actively intervene in the reality.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.090
Gradually, effective changes, 
however small they may be, become

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.520
more relevant than grand utopian
ideas that are never enforced.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.900
Expanding possibilities and interests
is another typical behavior

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.670
of young adults who are used to transiting
through several realities at once.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.090
With a more hybrid, plural and flexible
profile, they are able to diversify

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.280
experiences and work on a project-based
system, with high power of adaptation.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.390
It's the new generation's ability to
relate to different subjects, disciplines

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.700
and market segments.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.300
Finally, the digital reality also taught us
that everything is in transformation.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.000
The desire to innovate is product
of a mindset that work processes and

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.650
structures need to be
adapted with greater speed.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.120
It's about a world that is in
constant evolution to achieve

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.070
better results at every
challenge that is overcome.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.310
All these movements represent
the necessary core values to shape

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.140
a Young Consultant in
the current job market.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.600
Someone who has the power
to turn dreams and plans into feats,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.860
leading the next steps of
the country's greatest organizations.
