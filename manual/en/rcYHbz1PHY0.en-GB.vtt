00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.050
Unsolved Mysteries of Space

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.509
10. Where are the White Holes?

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.559
Einstein's equations suggest space should
be home to white, as well as black holes which

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.000
spew out matter.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.430
Though mathematical logic supports this, we
are still looking for evidence of their existence.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.730
One suggestion claims they have the same radiation
levels as Black Holes, meaning we may have

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.570
mistakenly recorded them as a black, rather
than White Holes.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.300
9. Why does Titan Have an Atmosphere?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.930
Though Titan may not be the biggest moon in
our Solar system, it is the only one to have

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.120
an atmosphere.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.610
Extending 600 kilometres above the moon, the
atmosphere is composed primarily of nitrogen,

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.510
making it similar to Earth's. As such it is
seen as a key place to search for signs of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.829
life.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.940
Some believe the atmosphere could have formed
due to the planet's distance from the sun.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.239
This follows that during formation volatile
gases became trapped in ice on the cold moon,

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.430
and later created an atmosphere.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.690
8. What are the Fermi Bubbles?

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.630
Two huge bubbles of gamma ray emissions were
discovered floating above and below the Milky

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.950
Way in 2010.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.400
Stretching over 50-000 light-years the bubbles,
the incredibly bright bubbles span over half

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.780
the visible sky, however their cause is unknown.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.760
Previously hidden by a fog of gamma-rays,one
theory states that the bubbles could be expanding

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.960
jets of matter sprayed from Black Holes

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.470
7. Where Are the Missing Baryons?

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.080
While 95% of the universe is composed of Dark
Matter and Dark Energy, the remaining 5% is

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.220
made up of Baryonic Matter- the term for particles
such as proton and neutrons.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.540
However scientists have only ever been able
to record half of this matter, meaning 2.5%

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.090
of the universe is seemingly missing.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.659
In 2012 scientists discovered a gas cloud
surrounding the Milky Way. With a temperature

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.900
equivalent to 400 times the surface of the
sun, they suggested the missing particles

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.420
could be hiding similar dense clouds across
the universe.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.860
6. Where do High-energy Cosmic Rays come from?

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:22.290
High-energy cosmic rays end life by colliding
with Earth's atmosphere. Each carrying tens

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:29.349
of millions the amount of energy created by
the Hadron Collider, if understood they could

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.159
provide us with an entirely new branch of
physics.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.950
Yet we don't know where they come from.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.819
In 2007 scientists believed these rays, like
their low-energy counterparts, were made from

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.719
protons, which were accelerated by super-massive
black holes.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.319
Alternatively,they may have began life in
the Milky-Way as atomic nuclei expelled by

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.139
ancient starbursts.

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.629
5. Where Did Saturn's Rings Come From?

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:00.059
Stretching over 73,000 kilometres the rings
around Saturn have been the source of disagreement

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.260
for decades.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.590
One theory states the matter circling the
planet is the debris of a moon which could

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.499
have collided with an object or been torn
apart by the planet's tidal stresses.

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.680
However others believe that the rings are
constantly being replenished. This is supported

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.169
by the discovery that one of the rings, known
as the E-Ring is frequently refreshed by material

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.129
spewed out by cryovolcanoes on a nearby moon.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.079
4.Where did galaxies come from?

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.299
There are two theories as to how the galaxies
began.

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.059
One suggests that stars and planets formed
individually, before gravitating into groups

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:36.269
to form galaxiesâ€¦.

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.709
And the other states that huge areas of gas
and dust condensed into galaxies, before fragmenting

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.799
into smaller groups which eventually became
separate galaxies, including our Milky Way.

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.689
Though telescopes show us the early days of
the universe, in order to answer this mystery

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.109
we would need an instrument able to capture
the universe just 1 hundred million years

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.349
into being.

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.049
3. What are the Mysterious Noises from Space?

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:09.099
In 1977 a radio signal from space was detected.
Lasting at least 72 seconds, the Wow! signal

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.189
came from near the Sagittarius constellation.
However the brief burst of radio waves has

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.260
yet to be repeated on record.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.790
In 2014 NASA sent a balloon covered in microphones
into space. When it returned it had recorded

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.700
hissing, crackling and whirling noises.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.950
While these could simply be gravity waves
or vibrations from the balloon itself, it's

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.760
not surprising that many have taken the noises
to be alien.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.700
2.What is Dark Energy?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.450
Dark Energy accounts for a huge part of the
universe's composition. Yet we know very little

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.450
about it.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.230
In the late 90s scientists hoping to examine
the slowing rate of universal expansion found

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.090
the opposite was actually true- expansion
was accelerating, seemingly thanks to undetectable

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.090
Dark Energy.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.900
One theory to explain this is Quintessence,
which hypothesises that there is a negative

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.810
energy field made of Dark Matter which overpowers
gravity, causing matter to repel away from

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.230
each other.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.150
1. Are we alone in the Universe?

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.650
In 1996 US President Bill Clinton publicly
announced that fossilised microbes had been

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.810
found in a fallen Martian meteorite. The case
the claims was widely dismissed as unfounded,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.500
with scientists claiming the marks taken to
be fossils could be the result of nonbiological

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.500
processes.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.270
In spite of this NASA claimed in 2015 that
we are likely to have proof within 30 years.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.910
In 1961 the astronomer Frank Drake created
an equation to estimate the number of civilisations

00:05:35.910 --> 00:06:08.060
in our galaxy. Following this there could
be anywhere between 2 and 50,000 civilisations.
