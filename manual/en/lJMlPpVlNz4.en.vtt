00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.399
Pride of creation flashes across her face.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.300
The Queen of the Dead stands before her latest work: a warped aberration wrought by her own hand.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.100
Turning to her lord, Death himself, she appears to seek his approval.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.040
With a mere nod, he gives it. Satisfied, she turns to seek her next creation.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.480
What she does not know is that behind Death's grim visage are pangs of doubt and mistrust.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.400
Perhaps the freedom he bestowed was premature. Perhaps...

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.520
But, he cannot deny the thrill of creation. Death's first born, he named her Gethsemane.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:10.460
He crowned her as Queen of the Dead, to rise, to conquer and to rule.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.720
Now, she takes the souls that Death values most, twists and shapes them

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.960
to assemble his court and build his army.

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:28.369
Fueled with deep devotion and soaring ambition, she is the creator of new abominations,

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:35.529
each more wretched than the last. Another pour soul lay on the floor at her feet.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:40.309
The Queen descends upon it, like a carrion to a carcass.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:47.129
With an eerily melodious voice she starts to sing her chant to sin.

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:52.120
Death looms over her as she gleefully sets to task.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:00.229
Conceiving yet another servitor for the court. Once more, Death ponders the power he has given her.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:08.549
Does she realize the potential that she wields? Could she upset the balance that he strives for in the afterlife?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:17.400
If she does, it's hard to tell. Although, perhaps there is something in the glance that she flashes him.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.880
Perhaps...
