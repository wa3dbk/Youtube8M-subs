00:00:13.302 --> 00:00:18.890
The Laboratory of Plant Ecology and Evolution of University of vigo
presents:

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.815
Biological invasions. How did they originate?
The zebra mussel.

00:00:20.816 --> 00:00:24.782
The transport and introduction of biological species outside their native area has,

00:00:24.782 --> 00:00:30.227
in recent decades, become one of the major
biological problems for humanity.
(Causas, mecanismos y consecuencias).

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:34.506
This is destroying the uniqueness of many ecosystems.

00:00:34.506 --> 00:00:36.709
Therefore, the study of the causes,

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:40.121
mechanisms and consequences of biological invasions

00:00:40.121 --> 00:00:46.163
is now a fundamental aspect in the performance of governments
and international organizations.

00:00:46.163 --> 00:00:51.549
The zebra mussel could be an example of the mechanism
involved in these biological invasions.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.678
This species is native to the Caspian and Black seas.

00:00:55.678 --> 00:01:00.794
There, its natural enemies keep its populations
in balance with the environment.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:05.940
However, the larvae of this species can easily adhere to the hulls

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.719
of the boats crossing the world's oceans.

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.744
These larvae are displaced from their natural habitat

00:01:13.744 --> 00:01:17.399
and are introduced into other environments
which are not always favourable.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.399
In fact, many of these larvae never reach adulthood...

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.320
But some zebra mussel larvae are deposited in environments

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.196
with more conducive growth conditions.

00:01:28.196 --> 00:01:31.242
There, they settle and begin their life cycle,

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:34.432
reproducing and originating new broods.

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:37.651
If, besides reproducing without any problems,

00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:40.597
zebra mussels settle in an ecosystem free from their enemies,

00:01:40.597 --> 00:01:42.516
they become a plague.

00:01:42.516 --> 00:01:45.789
Thus, they can cause a number of serious problems.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.583
They can alter the environment,

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:55.582
compete with native species for food
and invade water pipe infrastructures,

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:59.310
resulting in both an environmental and economic disaster.

00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:04.045
For example, the safety of the Nuclear Power Plant of Asco,

00:02:04.045 --> 00:02:09.349
in Spain, has been jeopardized by the large number of zebra mussels

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.290
that accumulate in its cooling tanks.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.785
This video is a production of the Laboratory of Plant Ecology and Evolution
of the University of Vigo and Divulgare group.

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:19.400
Is part of a series of videos that, from a proven scientific perspective,
seeks to highlight the causes of biological invasions,

00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.404
the mechanisms by which species can become invasive
and the consequences that certain invasions of alien species

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:24.544
can have on dynamics of native ecosystems.
