00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.030
Life today is busy.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.839
Work, exercise, family daily nonstop.

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.440
It leaves me little time for the thing which
is most important to raise a healthy family,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.490
making healthy and fresh food at home.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.320
And after a long and tiring day quick and
easy options can be so tempting but I don't

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.770
want to comprise on what my family eats I
want my little girl to enjoy the taste of

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.000
freshly prepared food and know exactly what
goes in her body just like how my mom raised

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.680
me.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.750
That's why I love Rotimatic a robot that makes
fresh rotis for us.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.980
It makes our life real easy and all it takes
is just a touch.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.530
It's built in artificial technology learns
the flour we use and figures out how much

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560
water and flour to mix.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.790
And to save time it's computer runs things
inside and parallel.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.809
So you get one fresh puff roti a minute, when
it puffs you know itâ€™s well cooked.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.110
Rotis are whole wheat flat breads they're
super healthy that they were the food choice

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.950
for the inventors of Yoga back in ancient
India.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.139
Rotimatic gives a convenience of sliced bread
with the goodness of a freshly baked loaf

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:16.799
within minutes.

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.090
You can use any kind of whole-wheat flour.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.619
I use it to make natural wraps.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.039
Without Rotimatic well it's impossible to
get wraps without harmful preservatives.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:49.690
We can make our rotis the way we like them.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.450
Cleaning it is too easy.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.860
But here is the best bid, it costs five cents
to make a roti and for eaters like it'll pay

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.159
for itself in no time.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.560
A great buy all around.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.139
You will love your life with Rotimatic.
