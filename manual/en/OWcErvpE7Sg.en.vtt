00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.059
When we think of turn based RPG combat, our
minds turn to the genres of fantasy and science-fiction.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.560
I mean every now and then, you get something
like Earthbound, but for the most part, the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
RPG genre is locked into preconceived notions
of what to expect.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.679
Then along comes Devil's Attorney, which takes
turn based combat, and puts it into a courtroom,

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.429
where you control the scumbag lawyer Max McMann,
using every dirty trick in his arsenal to

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.830
free your clients from the prosecution, and
all their annoying witnesses and evidence.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.010
The game is broken up into two sections, cases,
and furnishing your home.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.800
The money you earn by freeing clients can
be used to upgrade your pad, which in turn

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.440
levels up either your materialism, decadence,
or vanity.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.820
When you hit certain levels in each of these
skills, you gain new abilities to help you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.890
in the courtroom.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.589
Upon choosing a case, you are treated to a
bit of jokey banter between Max and the prosecutor,

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.510
and then the fighting begins.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.860
Your task is to remove all credibility from
the prosecution, their witnesses, and their

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.540
evidence (credibility stands in for hit points,
and you also have to prevent yours from reaching

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.640
zero).

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.970
The rest plays out like any other turn based
RPG battle.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.170
Your array of skills (that can also boost
attack and defense, as well as target certain

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.460
enemies), is used to destroy the opposition
before they destroy you.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.320
If you fulfill the requirements of the bonus
in each case (usually defeating it in a certain

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.480
number of turns), you gain extra money, to
help you upgrade and go through the whole

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.690
thing again.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.330
While the whole experience is fun enough,
boiling the RPG genre down to battles and

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.360
an upgrade screen removes the opportunity
for exploration and fleshing out the world.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.450
The before case banter does a good job in
introducing us to Max's personality along

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.850
with that of the prosecutors he goes up against,
but perhaps the ability to talk to a lot of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.340
these people out of the courtroom would have
rounded things out.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.430
As it is, the voice acting is great, and the
game oozes an 80s vibe (especially through

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.370
the intro), with its great cartoon aesthetic.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.080
Devil's Attorney is certainly different.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.380
It brings a lot of personality and a neat
spin on an old game mechanic, but after a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.259
few cases, the sheen kind of wears off, and
you begin to wish this was a full fledged

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.690
RPG instead of just a battle and upgrade simulator.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.900
Still, it's easy to play, and provides laughs
and amusement which should be more than enough

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:26.799
to justify the purchase if you like what you've
seen.
