00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.420
Washing is a vital step in keeping your car
looking its absolute best, and

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.360
by using the wrong product or technique, you
can easily remove your wax

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.700
protection or possibly create swirls.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.330
Before washing, make sure your car is in the
shade, and the surface is cool

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.510
to the touch.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.680
When washing your car, never use household
detergents, as

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.850
they can strip wax protection and promote
oxidation.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.329
Always use a premium
car wash like Meguiar's Ultimate Wash and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.630
Wax.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.280
Begin by mixing your wash solution in a clean
bucket using the proper

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.719
dilution.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:57.539
Now, fill a second clean bucket with plain
water.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.769
Before washing,
rinse the entire vehicle to remove any loose

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.010
debris.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.570
Using our microfiber
wash mitt, begin washing and rinsing one section

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:18.050
at a time, working from
the top down.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.190
Keep your wash mitt clean by rinsing it often
in the bucket

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:32.400
of plain water, then retrieve fresh suds.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.130
Once you've washed and rinsed the entire car,
it's time for a final rinse.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.400
This is done by removing the nozzle and allowing
the water to flow across

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:49.430
all surfaces, causing the water to run off,
leaving you less water to dry.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.760
Dry any remaining water using Meguiar's Water
Magnet Mircofiber Drying

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.030
Towel, and don't forget the door jams.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.750
Remember, washing weekly using the right products
and technique will

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.600
ensure your car is free of contaminants and
look its best all the time.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.810
