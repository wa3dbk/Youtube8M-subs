00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.609
Today we're going to continue learning about
airbrush textures

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:21.400
-hair texture and wrinkles.. or micro-shapes.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.669
Now i've made up a little helpful guide for
you kiddies out there.

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:29.300
Stuff waiting.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.790
If you can see that, i've added little crosses
in all of the areas that are going to be black.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.800
So i'm just looking at these darkest parts
of the hair and i'm going to fill them in

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.570
where i've done the crosses.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.320
Now i'm going to go in and add a little bit
of dimension.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.100
Two lines at a large height..
..coming in at this angle down from the top

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.370
of the hair
and one coming from the bottom up.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.470
They're only very light, but this adds dimension
to it.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.860
So how's the texture actually created?

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.110
Well.. let's have a quick look!

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.509
Just grab another piece of paper here for
you.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.930
Hair texture is most easily created by doing
very fast dagger strokes and lines back and

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.000
forth.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.290
We're actually going to offset every couple
of hairs.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.640
So that it's flowing in the same direction,
but not completely perfect.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.250
Dagger strokes back this way, dagger strokes
back that way.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.850
It may be easier to hold your airbrush on
an angle because I find that you can get sharper

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.100
dagger strokes this way.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.090
So let's finish the exercise sheet.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.979
You always get a better result when you blend
your effects out from the darkest areas.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.330
And to finish off hair texture I always like
to go over it with a series of extremely fine

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.330
lines.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.460
So go really fast and pull back around half
way on the trigger.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.880
And that's hair texture complete!

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.960
And now for wrinkles!

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740
Why do we call them 'micro-shapes'?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.810
Because really all wrinkles are is a series
of small blends and effects margin together.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.560
It's not created with any special figure 8
texture, any special movement, it's not created

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.440
by whizzing back and forth with dagger strokes,
it's created by painting what you see.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.820
Focus more on your shadows and highlights
as well.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.810
At the edge of every shadow, is a highlight.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.330
So for example, this line here blends out
in that direction..

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.010
.. so there's a highlight directly on this
side as you can see in the reference.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.510
So to finish off the wrinkles all i've done
is i've gone over with a little bit of figure

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.640
8 texture..
.. and see how light it is (or not see how

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.140
light it is.. so light)?

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.560
So let's take a look at a good example of
where hair texture might be used?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.440
Here's a little something i've prepared earlier!

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.950
So you can see I've just done the basic shapes
of the hair, the darkest areas..

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.050
.. not so much here, you'll see me do that,
however i really just have to go in and add

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.720
the detail to the hair.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:27.370
In the next tutorial, I'm going to show you
how to create some very interesting textures

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.870
- we're going to cover stone texture and then
i'll even show you how to do some wood!

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.569
&amp; hey I've got to say thank you for the first
100 Facebook likes!

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.569
Hey?

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.360
Round of applause everybody!

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.400
Thank you very much for watching and supporting!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.720
Keep spreading the love!

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.319
Bye bye!
