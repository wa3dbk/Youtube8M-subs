00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.240
Today on Bears in the Kitchen, we'll make a Cajun rib, these are the ingredients,

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:38.280
laurel leaves, oregano, chili flakes, thyme, paprika, garlic and a rib.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.400
To season the rib, we will make our own mix from scratch,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:56.160
I'll start with the herbs, oregano and I will use the same amount of thyme.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
After that comes the laurel leaves,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.360
I won't use much but i'll need to grind it well.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.000
Chill flakes, this flakes come from a certain tree.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.240
You can place as much as you want,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.500
this one will be quite spicy.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.140
The paprika is both for the color and the smoky taste,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.600
garlic the main ingredient of many things,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.280
and lastly, salt and pepper.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.900
Mix it well,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.720
Know we can place the mix on the backside of the rib,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:02:00.140
remember to take of the membrane, like we've seen on other videos, add some olive oil so it sticks.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.940
Place some, although I won't add as much on the bottom as I will on the top,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.660
just add a little.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.380
And I will place the rest on the top.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.860
We'll add olive oil as well.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.820
And now that our rib is seasoned,  we can move it over to the grill.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:52.780
Our rib is ready and so is our grill at 275 degrees fahrenheit, we're gonna place it for around 2 and a half hours,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.220
but at hour thirty we will wrap it up and place it back in the grill.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:05.420
We will also place a vase full of water as close as the fire as we can so we can have a humid environment.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.300
We close it up, and won't open it until an hour and a half passes by.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:31.120
An hour and thirty has passed by, thats how the ribs look, they start to turn red,

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.400
try not to touch it from the top,

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.160
and we'll rap it in aluminum paper.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.080
The paper has to be tight.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.780
This will prevent the ribs getting dry.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.560
If you want to add any sauce you can do it now,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.380
but it's not necessary.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.020
We will wait for one more hour.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:31.080
2 and a half hours have passed by, so the ribs should be ready, now we can leave them for around 10 minutes.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.840
After this we will cut it and serve it.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.060
After letting them for 10 minutes they are ready to be sliced.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.080
Teamwork.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.300
If you can see the bones, then it means they are ready.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.940
Also if you grab them from the bottom and they bend by themselves, they that also means they are ready.

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.580
So we will cut them.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.460
To cut them we will use this line as a guide, meaning that no bone runs through there.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.420
I like standing them so it makes it easier.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.540
The red you see on the top and bottom is the smoke that reached the meat.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.120
Because of the aluminum paper.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.700
If you leave it for more time, this texture won't be accomplished,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.980
and the ribs will dry out.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.540
So don't do it.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.940
