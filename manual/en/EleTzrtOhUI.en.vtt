00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.509
King Cake is best known as bright,
ring shaped bread from New Orleans.

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.859
Traditionally, it's baked with
a small trinket hidden inside,

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.269
bringing luck for the finder.

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.470
Its festive sprinkles are the
colors of Mardi Gras.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.279
First, in a large bowl,
you'll need to dissolve the yeast

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:25.580
and white sugar in warm milk.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.019
Let the mixture stand until creamy,
about 10 minutes.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.280
Next, stir the egg yolks and melted
butter into the milk mixture,

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.190
and then set it aside.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.450
In a separate bowl,
combine a flour, salt,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.760
nutmeg,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.180
and lemon zest.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.080
Pour your flour mixture into the
milk, egg mixture; one cup at a time.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.560
Beat with wooden spoon,
until it forms into dough.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.860
On a lightly floured surface,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.309
knead the dough for about
8 minutes, or until it's smooth.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.210
Lightly oil a large bowl.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.370
Place the dough inside, and turn it,
so it gets a coating of oil.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.590
Cover the ball with a damp cloth,
and let it rise in a warm place

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.260
until it doubles in volume.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.860
That should take about 2 hours.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.910
Meanwhile mix the cream cheese,
and half a cup confectioners sugar

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.840
for your filling.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.000
In another small bowl,
for your glaze,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.160
combine the remaining 2 cups of
confectioners sugar,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.840
lemon juice,

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.840
and 2 tablespoons of milk.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.660
Make sure you mix well,
and set aside.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.950
Once the dough rises for 2 hours,
roll it out onto a 6 by 30 inch rectangle.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.500
Spread the cream cheese
filling across the center.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.350
Next, you'll need to bring the
2 long .edges together,

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.530
and seal completely.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.520
Shape the dough into a long
cylinder,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.710
and place it on a greased baking
sheet, seam side down.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.399
Bend the dough into a ring.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.799
Press the lucky charm into the
dough from the bottom,

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:15.859
that way it's completely hidden.

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:20.189
Place a well greased, 2 pound, metal
coffee can in the center of the ring.

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.829
So it maintains its shape during baking.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.369
Cover the ring with a towel,
and set in a warm place to rise again.

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:32.379
After 45 minutes, it should double in size.

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.819
Make sure your oven is preheated
to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.019
Bake in preheated oven until golden
brown.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.169
About 30 minutes.

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.889
Remove the coffee can,
and allow the bread to cool.

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.359
Once the cake has cooled,
drizzle a lemon and sugar glaze,

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:51.049
and decorate with candy sprinkles.

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.179
Yellow, green, and purple are
Mardi Gras colors.

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.789
Bring a little bit of New Orleans to your
home within sweet King Cake!
