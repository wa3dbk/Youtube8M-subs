00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.870
Hi my name is Lisa.
Welcome to HomeMade Healthy.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.600
Today we're going to make banana bread
with almond flour.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.200
So this is really great for those gluten free diets, low carb diets.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.100
It's a good way to get something sweet without the carbs.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.609
So what we're going to do is we're gonna break

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.700
3 cage-free eggs into the mixer.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.700
I gotta tell you, I love my stand mixer. It's the
best. It makes whipping really easy.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.370
Well, you don't want to do that.
No harm no foul.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.320
Okay, now we put our whipping attachment on

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.320
and you're just gonna beat these for a
couple minutes to get them frothy.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.970
Okay next, turn off the mixer Lisa.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.700
Next we're going to add in are mashed
bananas.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.000
So what I like to do is,
as bananas get brown and we don't eat them all,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.080
I take the skin off and put
them in the freezer.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.600
Then whenever I'm ready to make a recipe,
I just take about and let them thaw.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.400
You just want to mash them up
until they're kind of soupy.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.100
They'll get mixed in really well.
You poor that right in.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.500
Now bananas are naturally sweet.
We won't need to add a whole lot sweetener

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.600
with this recipe.
So we're gonna add the rest of the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.660
wet ingredients.
Now coconut oil,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.700
as it gets cold hardens. So you wanna make 
sure your eggs are at room temperature or

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.200
you can warm up your coconut oil.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.500
My eggs are at room temperature.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.300
So we're gonna add our 2 tablespoons of coconut oil.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.400
1 tablespoon of vanilla.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.300
1/8 of a teaspoon of Kal stevia.
This is the stevia I use.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.390
It's really good.
It's not bitter.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.380
People who aren't on a low carb diet or

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.180
aren't on a Paleolithic diet don't
even know that it doesn't real sugar.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.900
Okay so we're gonna put all that in and
we're just gonna,

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.940
oh, but don't forget or sour cream.
1/3 of a cup of sour cream.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.900
We're just gonna mix this until its mixed well.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.610
Then we'll just add in the other ingredients.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.800
Nothing too fancy with this. 
Just make sure it gets nice and incorporated

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.600
before we start adding in the dry ingredients.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.040
That's pretty good.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.610
Okay next we're going to add

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.600
a half a teaspoon of  Himalayan salt and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.360
1 tablespoon of baking powder.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.310
2 cups of almond flour.
I use Honeyville Farms.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.300
So yummy!

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.390
This 5 pound bag is like thirty five dollars.
Which is much cheaper than if you try to

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.100
buy at the grocery store or one
of the specialty stores.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.100
So we're just gonna put in
our 2 cups of almond flour.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.600
We're just gonna mix it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.200
slow it first to get it all incorporated.
Then we will speed up a little bit.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.100
Now I like to scrape down the sides.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.760
When you work with a mixer you know you 
just don't have to do that sometimes.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.100
Then I'm gonna add in, you can use walnuts,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.630
I really like I roasted salted pecans.
So I've chopped up some of those.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.890
About a half a cup. I'm gonna add those and in.
Then mix it one last time.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.140
Then we'll be ready to go in the oven.
I have an 8 by 4 loaf pan.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.770
I find in the smaller size loaf pans 
it doesn't rise as much as traditional bread.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:43.380
So it makes it feel a little bit taller
when it's a smaller pan.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.360
Alright it is ready to go in the oven.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.690
Those banana bits wanna stick.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.650
They're pesky.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.790
Alright.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.400
Here's what it looks like.
Yum! Smells good! (sing songy)

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.300
Okay. just gonna pour it in the pan.
This is going to take about 45 minutes

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.200
to an hour in the oven.
Depending on how fast your oven cooks.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.500
Just check on it. When you enter
a toothpick or a knife

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.780
in the middle of it and it comes
out clean then it's ready.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
You wanna preheat the oven to 350 degrees.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.410
Alright let's get the last bit.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:29.490
This stuff is so good you
don't wanna waste any of it.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.600
And the nice thing with
these recipes is that with

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.900
this one you could use to make
pancakes.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.510
Instead of putting it in loaf pan right now you
could could just heat up the griddle.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.050
Or heat up a cast iron skillet and
make some pancakes with these.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.170
They would be good. 
But this is my favorite banana bread recipe.

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.610
Okay so once you have it in the pan,
you got your oven preheated, you're gonna

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.940
put it in for 45 minutes.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.140
It's been about 45 minutes since we
put the banana bread in

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.900
and it looks beautiful.
I can't believe that doesn't have any grain.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.480
Awesome. Okay you're supposed to let it
cool but

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:23.480
by now you guys know I'm not very patient.
I can't wait.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Look at that.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.360
Oh.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.589
I love banana bread.

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:33.160
Alright we're gonna take a

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.750
little piece off the edge here and blow on it.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.750
So I don't burn my tounge.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.870
Mmmm. It's just like mom made.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.870
Slather some butter on that.
Happy camper.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.500
Thanks for watching HomeMade Healthy.
