Hey whats up guys, I’m Joey Guila.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.010
And I’m Keiko Alingas. As you guys can see,
we’re not in the studio because we wanted

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.980
to do something a little different today.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.869
We’re gonna pay our rent today?

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.630
Oh hell no. But every so often we get requests
to do product reviews from our viewers out

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.339
there. So per the request of Twitter user
@Rad Reyes, we’ll be talking about this

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.339
little guy.

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:33.570
You are probably wondering what is this? Is
it for a rotisserie chicken, a dual fly swatter......no

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.930
and no. This unique invention called the Slingshot
is a mobile phone stabilizer, tripod and universal

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:41.940
camera mount.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.760
Lets start of with the cradle, it has an open
design which allows you to charge your phone

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.579
and have access to your headphone jack. While
securing your phone with this rubber overmold,

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.620
it will not scratch your phone but will hold
it like a Kung Fu Grip. The slingshot can

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.800
hold all smartphones with or without its cases
as well as the huge Galaxy note.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.309
The cradle, however, can be detached from
the handle and screwed directly on any tripod

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.487
with a standard ¼ inch mount , so you can
have the best of both worlds. Like how I like

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:08.487
it.

00:01:08.487 --> 00:01:11.400
Just hold the handle for one handed control
or pull out its little legs which instantly

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.550
turns this into a tripod. Now this is perfect
if you want to watch a video or shoot a video

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.660
and the ball joint allows you to get the right
angle you are looking for. Because of the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.280
strong grip you have the freedom of flipping
it upside down if you want to film some ashy

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.240
feet or ants making love.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.860
It’s light, it’s small, its durable....you
can just throw it in your bag. Or your murse.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.610
Alright, that’s it for now, but we do have
more information on the slingshot on our blog.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:13.700
So be sure to check it out at GearAddix.com.
Till next time, I’m Joey Guila

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.099
And I’m Keiko Alingas, we’ll see you guys
later.
