00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.850
You have to love games that take a risk, both
with gameplay and in general concept.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.300
So often in gaming do you feel like you have
played something before, with so many developers

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.500
too afraid to actually bring any sort of innovation
to an entertainment medium that requires innovation.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.579
So it is up to games like Patchwork Heroes
to be the risk takers and bring some new ideas

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:56.980
to the industry.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.850
Patchwork Heroes is so unlike anything else
I have ever played and probably will play,

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.379
and that it is difficult to really grasp.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.220
It is a puzzle game in many ways, but it is
also an action game and strategy game mildly.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.430
The game does come with a story that is fittingly
simple and bizarre, which goes right in line

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.479
with the gameplay.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.050
A large army of airships are on their way
to attack a small town, so members of the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.360
town fly up into the air with their own airship
and set out to destroy the attack ships.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.340
How they do this is not what you would expect.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.060
With that kind of backstory, you would think
it would be a space shooter or something to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.810
that effect, and you would be wrong.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.050
The way you destroy these airships is much
more interesting.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.320
You just jump aboard, and together as a group
systematically trim away sections of the ship.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.030
Everything takes place on a 2D plane, with
your group hanging onto the side of the ship.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.750
You have several team members and ways of
cutting away the paper-like ships.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.790
You can simply cut away, removing sections
from the larger haul.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.590
Or you can place bombs, that while they cause
a lot of damage, you lose one of your team

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.590
members.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.360
Great weapons cause great sacrifice.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.530
But the game is not as simple as just cutting
away.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.630
The airships themselves have plenty of defenses
that will hamper your plans.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.650
You have to avoid missiles, guards, and even
more complications.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.950
When you lose all your team members, you have
to retry.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.340
Also on the airships are prisoners that are
locked-up that you can rescue and have join

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.569
your team.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.510
The game has 30 levels, that while being short,
can become quite challenging and require time

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.510
and patience to figure out.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.750
There are also challenges and time attacks,
making the whole game a really great pick-up

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.000
and play type game.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.180
You can play just a level here and there,
or settle in and beat all the times in the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.959
multiple difficulties.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.420
The game is not perfect and becomes repetitive,
but doesn't overstay its welcome.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.120
Itâ€™s fun and innovative, you know, a good
videogame.
