00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.440
Okay.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.760
So, how do you use the finger picks?

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.140
Well, first of all, you should use
finger picks.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.600
There are a few cases of people playing with
their fingers

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.160
and whatever suits you is fine really, but
finger picks, they produce a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.620
louder sound and overwhelming majority of
steel players use them.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.119
The great
majority of people use three picks.

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.119
One thumb pick.

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.119
Two finger picks.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.730
Some
use three finger picks.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.960
It's not really necessary.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.560
Again, the majority of
people just use three.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.269
You want to use finger picks that are on the
harder side.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:42.179
You do not want
finger picks that are going to bend easily.

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:43.569
You want a good, firm gauge.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:49.539
The 25 gauge, 025 gauge are the ones I use.

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.109
Dunlop makes a pretty good
version.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.699
Older picks by National are prized.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.139
They are sort of, the granddaddies.

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:00.429
Again, you want something solid.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.810
Now, because of the angle of your
hand, you're gonna want to probably bend the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.760
picks a little bit, especially
the middle finger here because your hand is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.200
gonna be sort of, crooked like
this.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.210
The ideal attack for the pick is as much straight-on
as possible.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.910
So since
your hand is not actually coming at a straight-on

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.850
angle, probably want to
bend this slightly over toward this way to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.800
accommodate, so as to have the pick
be aligned as straight as possible, as you

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.800
can.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.830
This applies really to
everything you're gonna do with a thumb.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.500
Again, as straight an attack as
possible is gonna produce a better sound.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.530
Clean, even strike.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.000
Thumb picks very subjective.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.930
I prefer a lighter one.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.890
You can get all sorts
of different kinds.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.020
Some are much heavier.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.820
They sort of, clasp your thumb
with more grip and there's just more plastic.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.080
Maybe that's what you like.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.180
I
found that, after awhile, it was a little

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.190
unwielding and that a lighter
pick just made things a little more nimble.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.209
Again, picking technique is a
very subjective thing, but these general guidelines

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.990
will stand you in good
stead.
