Hi I'm Jason, former Mac genius here to go
over some Apple OS X tips and tricks with

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.690
you and today we are going to look at how
to change system colors and fonts on your

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:20.220
Mac. So let's get to it.
The system fonts and colors are found in your

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.890
system preferences which can be accessed under
system preferences here or in the doc down

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.340
there and what we are going to do is this
divide it into four panes, your preferences,

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.480
personal, hardware, internet, network system
and other. For this we are going to be accessing

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.180
our appearance settings and our appearance
are you have got two different options you

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.990
have blue and graphite. That is basically
kind of the look and feel of the Apple Macintosh

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.300
operating system and your highlight colors
for when you highlight stuff are here so if

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.309
you were to go into let's open a window and
so see you have gold there and if we were

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.920
to switch this to green, our highlight color
would now be green and this also happens when

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.750
you go to name something it will highlight
that color as well in green. Minimize when

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.539
double clicking your window or title bar,
that is if you click the title bar up top

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.990
it will minimize down into your doc and the
button up in the corner, the middle one here

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:39.530
with the minus sign also does the same thing.
As far as recent items this panel here controls

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.369
how many items you have up in your Apple menu
recent items. So under applications and documents

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.600
and servers we can see a number of items here
and what this panel does is it tells us how

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.039
may items to store in that. So if we were
to say 5 and we go up here to our recent items

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.520
it is only going to show us our last five
applications that we have accessed. For this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.300
area turn off text smoothing for fonts sizes.
This present is pretty much 8 and that is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.770
fine to leave it at that. That is kind of
consistent with the graphics card and your

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.640
monitor settings which are up here. Hi I'm
Jason and thank you for joining me for how

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.379
to change your fonts and colors in Mac OS
X.
