Ron Totorica, Aircraft Patrol Observer, BPA:
I’m sitting in one of our new Bell 407 helicopters.

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.259
We got three of these last year and we’ve
been using them to patrol power lines. We

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.090
go from town to town looking for any kind
of damage; anywhere from vandalism to weather

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.340
damage, and look for vegetation and brush
issues.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.649
These 407s are a lot faster too. If we’re
going cross country from point A to point

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.280
B we can get there a lot quicker. They cruise
at about 130 mph. They have a lot of horsepower

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.100
and they give us a good platform to be able
to hover right over a structure and look at

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.460
things that we need to look at very close.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.829
Eric Rairdon, Helicopter Pilot, BPA: The 407
is a big improvement over the [Bell] 206 aircraft

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.970
that Bonneville has operated since 1967. It’s
a turbine-powered, single engine light helicopter

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.330
designed for six passengers and the pilot.
So when we bought the 407 we leaped forward

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.220
about forty years in technology. So what that
does for us is on our patrol speeds when we’re

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.870
at 50 to 60 mph we have a very, very smooth
aircraft.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.780
[Natural Sound: Engine starting]

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.850
Our ability to get out there resolves serious
issues rather quickly.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.850

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:54.290
Part of the historical use of the aircraft
has been the eyes and ears of the central

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.690
dispatch, to see what’s wrong out there
in the event of an outage. Of course, they

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.790
know they have a line outage but they don’t
know how serious the problem is. They don’t

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.830
know if a conductor has just dropped to the
ground or if a tower has fallen over. And

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.670
we travel with a lineman aboard. He can make
the decisions as to what equipment needs to

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.190
be brought out and radio that back immediately
to the line maintenance people involved so

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.890
they can plan their work a lot faster.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.580
For routine work it gives us a snapshot of
any particular line at that moment in time.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:29.510
Well, the line is in service but is it 100
percent. It also allows us to locate and catalog

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.120
the small items that do need to be repaired
but don’t need to be repaired on an emergency

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.990
basis. Not to downplay the importance of the
routine patrol, it is important just to know

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.620
that there’s nothing wrong with line A or
line B, but really the emergency response

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.340
and storm response is what keeps the helicopters
around. If we can get out there, find the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.310
problem, get it figured out for the line crews
and the Dittmer dispatch folks, that’s what

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.560
we’re here for. It’s a time-saving tool
that allows us to do a lot of things in a

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.010
short period of time.
