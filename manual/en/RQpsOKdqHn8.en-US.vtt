Hi! Today we'll paint an up-to-date cherry with oils

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:08.377
stay with me and subscribe to my channel

00:00:10.206 --> 00:00:17.267
for starting draw a circle on your canvas using a pencil

00:00:17.346 --> 00:00:18.306
then

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:25.167
draw a half moon on top and another
one on the bottom but bigger

00:00:25.216 --> 00:00:29.676
for today's work we'll use MIR oils that I like

00:00:29.676 --> 00:00:34.487
a lot because of the brightness of their colors... so mix

00:00:34.487 --> 00:00:37.597
with the paint knife some black and umber oil

00:00:37.597 --> 00:00:44.477
to make the background color

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:48.317
add some linseed oil drops

00:00:48.317 --> 00:00:49.367
mix it

00:00:49.367 --> 00:00:56.367
and paint the whole background

00:00:56.387 --> 00:00:58.947
MIR oils cover very  well the canvas

00:00:58.947 --> 00:01:05.947
so you only need to apply one layer

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:11.807
using dark cadmuim yellow

00:01:11.807 --> 00:01:17.497
draw some lines for dividing the cherry in 4 areas

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:20.407
put on your palette the dark cadmium yellow,

00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:23.017
orange cadmium yellow,

00:01:23.017 --> 00:01:25.727
cadmium red and and rose lake

00:01:25.727 --> 00:01:32.727
and paint each area with each color

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:56.137
paint as well the cherry reflection starting with

00:01:56.137 --> 00:01:56.977
orange cadmium yellow

00:01:56.977 --> 00:01:59.427
then cadmium red and finishing

00:01:59.427 --> 00:02:06.427
with rose lake

00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:11.367
mix the colors

00:02:11.466 --> 00:02:14.276
with a clean brush

00:02:14.276 --> 00:02:17.676
and making criss cross strokes

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:20.016
Mir oils are so creamy that

00:02:20.016 --> 00:02:23.767
we can blur colors easily

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:27.076
now pass your brush in long strokes

00:02:27.076 --> 00:02:34.076
for even colors

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:38.886
realizan al dÃ­a

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:43.746
also make some criss cross strokes on the reflection

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:50.746
then smooth the colors

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.856
also make criss cross strokes

00:02:56.856 --> 00:02:58.976
between the reflection and the background

00:02:58.976 --> 00:03:05.976
and then smooth the colors

00:03:08.946 --> 00:03:12.796
illuminate the cherry right side using cadmium yellow

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:15.426
and then make the upper area

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:22.367
with a yellow stroke

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:30.666
MIR oils brightness enhance and enliven your creations

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:34.016
using cadmium yellow and some of the background color

00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:41.016
paint the stem's cherry

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:45.896
use cobalt blue and white to a light blue

00:03:45.896 --> 00:03:52.896
to paint a stroke on the cherry's right side

00:03:57.166 --> 00:04:04.166
then blur the colors

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:06.076
using white

00:04:06.076 --> 00:04:15.867
illuminate the stem and create light areas on the cherry

00:04:48.416 --> 00:04:50.386
also create

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:55.786
light areas on the reflection

00:04:55.786 --> 00:04:59.446
for finishing paint a leaf with cadmium yellow

00:04:59.446 --> 00:05:06.446
and your picture will be ready to sign and dry

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:10.796
I hope you liked this project!
