Welcome to TV Repair Made Easy, brought to

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.260
Visit www.shopjimmy.com to search the hundreds
of thousands of TV parts in our inventory.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.260
WARNING!

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.470
Please make sure that your TV is unplugged,
and that you are protected from static electricity.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:21.470
There are various ways to eliminate static
electricity,

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.470
but the most common way is to use a grounding
wrist strap.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.470
Take photos and notes often to help remember
the location and orientation of the parts

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.470
and wires.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.470
And feel free to pause and backtrack through
this tutorial as much as needed.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.470
To be best prepared to replace the T-Con Board
inside of your TV, you will need the following

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.470
materials:
A pair of latex gloves.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:28.470
Your ShopJimmy.com replacement T-Con Board.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.470
A pair of needle-nose pliers.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.470
Both a flat-head and phillips screwdriver.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.470
And a cup to hold all screws, clips, and any
other small items.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.470
So let's get to it shall we?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.500
Locate your TVs identification label and take
note of the brand name model number, serial

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.840
number and model code if present.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.750
Unscrew and remove the back cover.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.190
The Timing Control Board, or T-Con Board is
a part of your TV's LCD Panel Assembly.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.490
It is connected to the Main Board via the
LVDS Cable, and to the LCD Panel via flat

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.280
ribbon cables.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
The T-Con Board is centered on the top edge
of the back of the Panel and can be hidden

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.910
under a metal or plastic cover.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:11.190
Carefully unplug the LVDS cables and ribbon
cables by hand.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.530
Using your finger flip up the tab on the ribbon
connector and gently remove the ribbon.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.149
Please do not use a screw driver to open ribbon
connectors as it can cause damage to the pins.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.220
Please note that the LVDS cable is quite fragile.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.100
Two hands may be required to release and remove
the connector.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.730
Unscrew and remove your bad T-Con Board from
the chassis.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.780
A partial part number for this item can be
found stamped on the board.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.679
Search your partial number on http://www.shopjimmy.com
to find a compatible replacement.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.939
Filter your search results by the appropriate
part type.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:55.609
Click on the search results to view important
product specifications.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.869
Verify that your original board matches all
requirements noted in the product description

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.749
prior to purchase.

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:10.750
Insert all screws to secure your ShopJimmy
New T-Con Board to the chassis.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.069
Reconnect the LVDS cables and ribbon connections.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.489
Gently guide the ribbon back into the connector,
match the line printed on the ribbon cable

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:28.590
with the edge of the connector, and close
the tab on the top.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.340
Return the back cover to its original position
and secure all screws.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.019
This ShopJimmy replacement T-Con Board does
not require any manual configurations in order

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.050
to function.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.780
