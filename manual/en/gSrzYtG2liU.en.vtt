00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.800
Welcome to Séura's 2-minute installation
video for Hydra, Séura's waterproof television.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.270
Hydra is designed for wet environments like
the bathroom or kitchen.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.890
It is recessed into an opening in the wall
and sealed into place.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.340
Let's get started.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.000
Prepare the rough opening according to Hydra's
specifications.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.730
Feed all necessary cables through the opening
including Séura's low-voltage, 20-foot power

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.730
cord.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.980
We're using HDMI for this applicaiton.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.980
Verify the dimensions and ensure the rough
opening is square.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.880
Hydra comes in two parts: The television assembly,
and the back-box.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.010
Put the television assembly aside for now.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:57.100
Insert cables through the access opening in
the back-box and fit into place.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.699
Using the included hardware, screw the back-box
into the rough opening, but be careful not

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.890
to over-tighten as this may warp the back-box.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.970
Next, make the connections to the television
assembly and fit into place.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.280
The gravity locks will engage, ensuring a
tight, secure fit.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.200
At this point, verify your connections are
functional.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.410
Turn the television on using the included
waterproof remote and check all feeds.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.229
Now we're ready to seal.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.950
Remove the television assembly from the back-box,
maintaining all connections.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.520
Using the included silicone sealant, line
all four edges of the back of the glass face

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.009
with a generous bead.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:02:05.330
Finally, push the television assembly into
place and wipe excess sealant from the wall.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.070
Allow 24 hours for the sealant to cure before
exposing to moisture.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.690
Enjoy your new Hydra waterproof television
from Séura.
