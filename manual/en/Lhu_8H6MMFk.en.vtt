Hi, welcome to Play Drum Devon Lanes, my name
is Glenn Soanes with Expert Village. Tonight

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.340
we're going to work and walk you through some
advance bowling techniques so you can improve

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.750
your game. What I like to talk to you now
is about release from a stand point. Release

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.090
is one of the most important thing that you
have to do the same every time you roll the

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.890
ball. You want to set your hand for those
of us who are a little challenged. The best

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.780
way to get a good release is to set your hand
in a position you want to finish in. To do

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.910
that you have to have some amount of wrist
strength you'll see bowlers using things like

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.590
wrist support, like this small one to help
get their wrist in a position to where they're

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.750
relaxed and repetitive. You'll see small wrist
braces help keep the wrist in the same position

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.360
a little more sophisticated, and then some
that will allow you to set your wrist in any

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.770
position. Again the object with release is
to make it simple enough so that you can do

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.210
the same thing every time all the bowling
is about doing the same thing over and over

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.439
again. If you can do that at that point of
being very easy to score, the guys you'll

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:24.909
see in the bowling alley who decide that they're
going to start a ball down here and the ball

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.090
is going to go out and there hands are going
to go open, and then they're going to turn

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.159
and screw it into the ground. Every place
that the ball goes here it has to go to the

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.530
same place it has to open as the same place,
it has to close at the same place. If you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:46.000
can get the release to start, go through the
swing and bottom of the swing on this same

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.920
place at that point you don't have to worry.
Your muscle memory doesn't have to do all

00:01:50.920 --> 00:02:00.119
the work to get from here open to close, so
what it should like is you get the ball you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:08.030
get set, get comfortable straight wrist, elbow
leads. (bowling)
