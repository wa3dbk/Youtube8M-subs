[MUSIC]

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:19.020
[PEACEFUL MUSIC]

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.660
On a clear night, away from city lights, the
sky is full of stars, more than we could possibly

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.369
dream of counting, right?

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.070
Well, if there were a grain of sand for every
star that we can see with the naked eye...

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.540
9,096. That’s it. Every star bright
enough to be seen from Earth without the aid

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.749
of a telescope. Antares is one. Plus 1 to
be exact, on the astronomical scale of brightness.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.850
The sun checks in at minus 27. The full moon,
minus 13.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.589
Even in the darkest places on Earth, like
Chile’s Atacama desert, our eyes can only

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.420
detect objects magnitude 6.5 or brighter.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.900
But with bigger eyes? We can see a lot more.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.020
[MUSIC]

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.810
This is the Andromeda galaxy, the nearest
major galaxy to the Milky Way. And it’s

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.370
full of stars.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:32.390
[MUSIC]

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:39.439
Earth is surrounded by 360 degrees of space in
every direction. Take an arc of one degree,

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.810
divide it into sixty, and that’s an arcminute.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.579
This 1.5 billion pixel image from the Hubble
telescope covers about a thousand square arcminutes,

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.119
and contains more than 100 million stars.

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.039
Let’s put that in perspective.
If it was brighter, this is what Andromeda

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:00.450
would look like next to our moon.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.380
But we don’t have to look at an area of
sky that big to find 100 million stars.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.500
Let’s take a closer look at this little
piece of sky.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.790
The Hubble telescope was aimed at this sliver
of sky, its shutter opened for 2 million seconds,

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.420
and from a seemingly empty corner of space
emerged not stars, but thousands of galaxies.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.520
Some of these are as old 13.2 billion years,
photons emitted near the beginning of the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.920
universe itself. The faintest objects in this
image are ten billion times dimmer than we

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.560
can see with our own eyes.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.030
It would take 30 million squares the size
of the Hubble Extreme Deep Field to cover

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.130
the entire sky.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.510
Scientists estimate that the observable universe
contains about 200 billion galaxies. If, instead

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.510
of stars, we made every grain of sand a galaxy,
it would fill 27 cubic meters.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.360
So how many stars are there? Maybe 1 septillion,
That’s a number that’s so big, that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.720
 it doesn’t make sense. But one thing
we can be sure of, there’s not enough beaches

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.950
on Earth to hold them all.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.900
Carl Sagan said that “Earth is the shore
of the cosmic ocean”… &nbsp;so remember, each

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.500
night when we look up at a sky seemingly filled
with stars, we’re only dragging a finger

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.520
through the sand.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.120
Stay curious
