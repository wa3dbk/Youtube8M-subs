Hey there and welcome to another crafting
video brought to you by KeepsakeCrafts.net

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.970
and AllFreeBeadedJewelry.com. On today's video
I'm going to show you how quick and easy it

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.340
is to make this really cute pair of dangle
earrings.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.230
So to get started, here's what you'll need
to make a pair of earrings. First you'll need

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:48.550
two rings. These are about an inch in diameter.
You'll need two head pins. You can use plain

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.770
ones. I just happened to have some decorative
head pins. You'll need four jump rings and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:02.789
two ear wires and also an assortment of small
chips or beads to string onto your head pins

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:11.080
for your dangle. For tools, you'll need a
pair of chain nose pliers. I like to have

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.570
two pair for opening and closing jump rings.
You'll also need a pair of round nose pliers

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.840
and a pair of wire cutters. I like to use
these. These are flush cut. They get me a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.900
much nicer closer cut than regular wire
cutters that leave a bit more of a gap.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:42.689
So to go ahead and get started. You're
going to thread onto your head pin an assortment

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:53.770
of beads, whatever it is you like. Like I
said I picked these chips and try to make

00:01:53.770 --> 00:02:07.280
a nice assortment, maybe a larger one and
then a medium sized one and then a smaller

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:24.959
one on top. Really anything goes here. You
can make your dangle any length that you want

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.840
and any assortment, but it should be just
a bit smaller than the inside diameter, about

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.410
1/4" smaller than the inside diameter of your
ring.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.360
The next thing you want to do is grasp your
head pin right at the top of the last bead

00:02:47.360 --> 00:03:01.400
that you strung on and bend your head pin
to a 90 degree angle. Just like that. Then

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:10.430
switch to round nose pliers and hold on to
it. I like to use just the tips so I get the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:24.610
smallest possible loop and wrap the wire,
you've got to hold on to that nice and tight,

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.690
wrap the wire around the loop as far as it
will go. It will only go so far and once you've

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.349
gone as far as you can, shift the position
of the round nose pliers so it's in the middle

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:46.590
and on top and then grab the rest of your
head pin wire and finish the wrap.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:04:00.750
Once you've done that, take your flush cutters
and cut right where that wire that you wrapped

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:11.010
is starting to cross over the first part of
the wire. Next take your round nose pliers

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:22.960
again . Use the flat part in here and flatten
that out, then grab your loop and give a little

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.460
bit of a bend up and that will give it a nice
shape.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.330
Next you want to take a jump ring and use
two pairs of pliers to open it. Position the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:46.050
split in the ring at 12 o'clock and then grasp
it on either side with a pair of pliers. Push

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.540
one away from you and pull one towards you.
That's the proper way to open a jump ring.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:05.639
Next onto that jump ring you're going to add
the dangle that we just made, your hoop and

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:11.460
another closed jump ring. Notice I'm holding
onto the jump ring with one of the pair of

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.340
pliers so I don't have to try to reposition
it and then I'll just use the other pair to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:27.490
reverse the process and close it back up again.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:37.009
The last step is to open the ear wire the
same way, by twisting one side towards me

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:43.810
instead of pulling the loop apart. Then you
need to take that last jump ring that you

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:56.509
put on, the one that didn't ever get opened.
Pop your ear wire through that. Use your pliers

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:03.050
to close that up and your earring is done.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:10.020
Here's a close up for you of the finished
earrings. They're kind of cute. Very easy

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:15.130
to make and quick. Here's another pair that
I made with some slightly different hoops.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:20.030
Instead of hammered, these are just plain
rings. The dangles are a little bit longer

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:27.319
than the hoops, but they still hang nicely.
You can also do this with oval hoops. You

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.710
could try different kinds of materials. So
look around. See what you can find and experiment.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.559
I hope you've enjoyed this project. Thanks
for watching. Bye bye.
