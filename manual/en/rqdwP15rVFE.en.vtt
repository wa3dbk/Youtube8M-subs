00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.140
Once you got your gage, you're ready to begin
your hat. We're going to do the long tail

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.019
cast on so for starters you're going to need
to estimate the tail you need. One rule of

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.650
thumb is to use approximately 3 times the
length of what you're knitting. So if this

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.430
hat has a circumference of 15 inches, we're
going to use approximately 45 inches I'm guessing.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.590
And that's were your slip knot is going to
be and that's why this is a long tail cast

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.470
on. So you're going to make your slip knot
the way we did earlier, bring that through.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.010
That's your first stitch. You take your circular
needle and you do your long tail cast one.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.820
And I'm going to do it really quick because
we have about 49 stitches. But just as a reminder,

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.690
you would take the yarn, make a fist on it,
part it like curtains, bring it down, we got

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.150
your upside down A, and then you're going
to make your stitch. So we're going to cast

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.970
on about 49 stitches for starters. And some
times people put in markers every 25 stitches

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.329
to know where they are or sometimes they just
keep going till their tail is almost done.

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:11.799
I usually go until my tail is almost done
unless it's a lot of stitches. So lets see,

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:27.100
we have 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 25. So we're almost
half way there. Alright, so then once you

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.340
got your stitches on your needle, you're going
to need to join it in the round. And what

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.439
happens there is you're going to bring your
needles together. Actually, I should have

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.069
put on a few more extra stitches because I'm
almost there. We'll just slide a few more

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:53.139
on. Alright, so your going to bring your needles
and your yarn from one end to the other so

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:58.130
they are together and all your stitches are
facing the same way. A lot of times when your

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.209
knitting it's going to say be careful not
to twist. If your stitches were facing like

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:05.359
this, you might have a twisty brim and then
you're going to have to start again. So with

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.750
it being straight, you're going to place a
marker so you know where you begun. Your yarn

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.640
with the tail is in your right hand and you're
going to insert the needle in to the other

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.299
stitch and then you'll be joined in the round.
