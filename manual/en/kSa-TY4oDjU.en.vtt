00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.120
NARRATOR: is a crazy picture.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.340
That is a gigantic
great white shark.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.690
And as we can clearly
see, the picture

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.770
was taken at really,
really close range.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.320
Maybe too close.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.710
My question is,
who took this photo

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.820
and how much danger
were they in?

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.539
The person on the other end
of the camera was this guy.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.080
JOE BUTLER: Hi, my
name is Joe Butler

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.220
and I'm a recent graduate
of marine biology

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.520
and coastal ecology at
Plymouth University.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.200
Originally from
Swindon, England,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.350
I'm currently situated on
the west coast of Ireland

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.120
studying marine mammals.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.230
This particular photo
was taken off of hand

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.850
by South Africa in the
late September of 2012.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.410
We were in the area for
a university field course

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.187
looking at the
local biodiversity

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:47.770
and took the opportunity
to experience

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.182
some more charismatic sea
life we rarely get to see.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:52.390
On the this particular day,
me and two of my friends,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.389
Sam and Lizzie, went out
on the cage diving boat

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.391
into Shark Alley in hopes
of seeing some great whites.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.640
NARRATOR: Great white sharks
are the biggest predatory

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.070
fish in the world.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.550
And despite their mass, they
can travel at ridiculous speeds,

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.530
over 35 miles an hour,
to track their prey.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.980
And then there's this trick.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.949
This is what happened the
moment Joe took his photo.

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:19.490
JOE BUTLER: In order to bring
them in closer to give everyone

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.575
a good look, the crew
would employee a tuna head

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:23.840
on the end of a long rope
and drag it out of the way

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.900
before the shark had
the chance to grab it.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.317
The photo itself, taking
from inside the cage,

00:01:28.317 --> 00:01:30.900
shows the shark, having managed
to grab the bait before anyone

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.029
had a chance to react.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:34.320
The end result is this powerful
image of it leaping out

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960
of the water with it's prize.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.650
If you look closely, you can
see the eyes have actually

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530
rolled back into the
head, as they tend to do

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.087
when it exerts this behavior.

00:01:41.087 --> 00:01:42.920
The feeling at the time,
you wouldn't really

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.586
describe it as being
nervous because you

00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:46.980
were too busy being in awe
of what was in front of you.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.970
It's one thing to see them on
say, like TV or photographs,

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.850
but to actually be with them
and see them in front of you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.610
is an entirely
different experience.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.320
It was actually quite
a sobering moment

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.500
when you realize that
proverbially, you're

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.040
the fish out of water here.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.730
This is their home and
you're not actually

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:04.970
supposed to be there.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.470
I think a lot of people have
this image in the heads of them

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.169
being sort of
idealistic predator,

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.439
but in reality, these animals
are still quite vulnerable.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.480
However, seeing them in
their natural environment

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.349
is something I recommend
to anyone in a heart beat.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.140
NARRATOR: Hey everyone,
Thanks for watching

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.370

it's like to dive

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.330
into the middle of a
humpback whale fight.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.810
SPEAKER 1: This is
an image moments

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.020
after this juvenile humpback
whale took a sharp turn

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.780
to avoid smashing into me.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.680

forget to subscribe.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.720
