00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.920
Haka groups were welcomed
in Gisborne today for the beginning

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.680
of the National Secondary Schools
Kapa Haka Competition -

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.680
Te Kura Wiwini, Te Kura Wawana.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.880
Schools practice for up
to six months in preparation.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.840
Our reporter Rapaera Tawhai
is in Gisborne at the moment,

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.520
so over to you, Rapaera.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:30.800
40 kapa haka will take to the stage
here in Houhoupiko, Gisborne.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.760
However, for one group
from the Manawatu region

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.080
they've had to overcome
a serious setback just to be here

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.880
with their bus crashing
on their way to Gisborne.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.280
A prayer to their Saviour.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.680
That is our Lord,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.200
He is looking out for our girls,

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.440
as He looks out for all of us.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.360
That's the good
that comes from praying.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.440
This is the aftermath of a crash

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.160
involving Turakina Maori Girls'
College's bus yesterday afternoon

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.320
as it was traveling
to the kapa haka competitions.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.560
The girls are OK,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.640
they're good at taking care
of each other

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.680
and ensuring each other's
well-being.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.440
And all the adults,
the teachers and parents,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.560
are helping to lift their spirits.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.840
Their bus crashed here

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.080
on the Wharerata Hills.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.560
The principal says it was lucky
it crashed on this side of the road

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.800
rather than the other side

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.280
where it could have driven
over the edge.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.360
Nine students and three staff

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.120
were taken to Gisborne Hospital
for observation.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:02.320
Just one student remains in hospital
with a fractured leg.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.320
Doctors are monitoring her

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.520
and she's expected
to be discharged today.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.640
Inspectors suggested
faulty bus brakes

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.240
could have caused the crash.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.440
Despite the setback

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.160
the school vows
to continue on tomorrow.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.360
The important thing is to pray,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.880
and continue to focus on the event.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.640
We're of one mind
to stand and perform tomorrow.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.840
That's what our teachers
and students worked hard for.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.360
Aside from that,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.360
last minute preparations
are being made for the venue

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.400
to be ready for the competition.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.720
Whangarei's Te Kapa Rau Aroha
take to the stage tomorrow morning

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.240
to kick off the competition at 8am.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.760
Turakina Nga Hara
are scheduled to perform at 3pm.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.760
Rapaera Tawhai from Gisborne.
