00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:06.670
Now, we're going to work on your isolations
for your dance. We're going to concentrate

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.870
at this moment in your hip movements. Isolating
the down part of your body. The position is

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.480
very important. Be sure to keep your feet
slightly apart and straight, tuck in your

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.569
behind, bend your knees slightly and focus
in your hips. So we go, working your right,

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:31.439
hips to your right, center, working you left,
hips to you left, center. And again, right,

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.070
center, left, center, right, center, left,
center. Now we're going to go away from the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.400
center. We go right and left. Out to your
right, out to your left. And again, one and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.550
two and three and four. We're going to create
now a hip circle with your right, back, left

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.190
and front. When you go to your right, your
weight is moving you right, back, even weighting

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.660
your heels left, weighting your left, forward,
even weight in the ball of your feet. So you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:19.960
go right, back, left, front, right, back,
left, reverse, back, right, front, left, back,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:29.630
right, front, left, center, go to your right,
left, right, center. We're going to create

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:38.560
now a figure eight. We're going to go to back,
that would be one, two, forward, back, three,

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.480
four, forward. So you go one corner to the
back, one, two corner to the front, two, three,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:57.960
back, forward four. One, two, three, four.
So this is your figure eight, isolating for

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:07.320
your dance. One more time. And you go back
to your center and you go right, left, right,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.350
center.
