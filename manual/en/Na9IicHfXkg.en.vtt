00:00:18.726 --> 00:00:20.781
Welcome in this new Toyota!

00:00:20.782 --> 00:00:25.406
I say this because this a driver's car,
and that is exactly how Toyota wanted this car to be.

00:00:25.407 --> 00:00:32.357
That was quite a shock actually, because we know Toyota
from hybrids, hybrids and more things like that.

00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:37.679
Toyota has a tradition with driver's cars,
but ignored that for some time.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.966
10 years ago Toyota had the Supra,
which is completely off the radar.

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:43.459
And the Celica is also nowhere to be found.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.820
But, now they're back with the GT86,
a very fun car to drive!

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:57.933
But this is a car for which
I have to educate you first.

00:00:58.234 --> 00:01:05.105
Because we are spoiled with front wheel drive
and downsized turbo engines.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:09.398
I'm now driving 100 km/h (60 mph)
with 2800 rpm in its 6th gear.

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.734
I now completely floor it,
resulting in almost nothing.

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:14.478
Now you may think, that's weak...

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.052
...because with a TDI or downsized turbo engine
the car reacts immediately and with power.

00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:23.328
You may even have a dual-clutch automatic transmission,
so it automatically shifts back in a fraction of a second.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.678
Nothing of all that in this version of the GT86,
because we're driving one with a manual transmission.

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.022
An automatic transmission is available,
but you don't want that, you want the manual one.

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:37.322
This is a car that you have to grab in its scruff
and firmly lug to where you want it.

00:01:37.323 --> 00:01:40.504
If you think: I should take this corner in its 3rd gear,
wrong! 2nd gear!

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:42.241
Should you take it in its 4th gear,
no! 3rd gear!

00:01:42.242 --> 00:01:45.219
On the highway,
continuous everything in the 4th gear!

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.970
Just push it!

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:53.604
This block is at its best above 5000 rpm...

00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:59.118
...and the maximum torque of a little over 200 Nm
is reached at 6200 rpm.

00:02:03.164 --> 00:02:07.531
There's also a shift light installed,
to tell you: shift up now!

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:12.166
The rpm limiter is pretty subtile...

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:22.167
...so there's less danger of losing all the power
during a drift when you're close to the rpm limit.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:31.596
There's a boxer engine in the GT86, which shows the link
that this car has with Subaru, which produces a similar car.

00:02:31.597 --> 00:02:33.761
And both cars are developed by Toyota and Subaru together.

00:02:33.762 --> 00:02:37.142
The engine has a volume of 2 liters,
no turbos but it does have direct fuel injection...

00:02:37.143 --> 00:02:39.320
...which is unique for a boxer engine.

00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:40.886
200 hp.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.372
In normal (line) engines,
the cylinders are placed vertical.

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:50.680
While in a boxer engine,
they are placed horizontal.

00:02:51.362 --> 00:02:54.074
Lower, thus a lower center of gravity.

00:02:54.075 --> 00:02:57.816
This is not a very heavy car to start with,
a little over 1200 kg (2646 pounds).

00:02:57.817 --> 00:03:02.172
All the things mentioned before
are the basic ingredients for a true driver's car.

00:03:03.343 --> 00:03:05.755
Very direct steering
and very precise brakes.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.236
This is really useful when
you're in the mountains going downhill...

00:03:09.237 --> 00:03:14.854
...and drive over a little bump,
then you immediately feel your grip changing.

00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:17.174
And of course: rear wheel drive!

00:03:17.175 --> 00:03:21.790
Because that is the holy Grail
for a motorist.

00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:24.726
At least, if you like sportive driving of course.

00:03:24.727 --> 00:03:27.501
But, as I already mentioned,
you really have to drive it firmly.

00:03:27.502 --> 00:03:31.344
But think about it as your girlfriend:
sometimes it's good to hold her firmly...

00:03:31.345 --> 00:03:34.087
...that's what she likes
and makes her perform better.

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:39.910
There're disadvantages though:
200 hp is not a lot.

00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:44.846
You especially notice that when you want to start a drift,
you really have to get it out of balance.

00:03:44.847 --> 00:03:49.779
Or maybe give the clutch a small tap,
to get it into oversteer.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.547
But the balance is amazing!

00:03:52.582 --> 00:04:01.767
When you're driving a curved mountain road,
it almost feels like this car is dancing together with you.

00:04:01.768 --> 00:04:05.305
But, this amazing driver's car
has some more disadvantages.

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:08.169
Firstly, you have to educate yourself, this means:

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.252
No 60 km/h (38 mph) in the 5th gear
as the government wants you to...

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:18.358
...because it's good for the environment.
No! Keep the rpm above 5000.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.989
Secondly, the maximum power,
this car simply wants more.

00:04:25.372 --> 00:04:29.251
You want this car to have 270 or maybe even 300 hp.

00:04:29.252 --> 00:04:35.318
But maybe this is something for the future,
because a boxer engine with turbos is an excellent combination.

00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:40.894
Lastly, especially for the Netherlands:
the price.

00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:42.836
40 grand.

00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:47.961
For that money there are not
a lot of other options with rear wheel drive.

00:04:47.962 --> 00:04:54.190
Let alone, rear wheel drive with 200 hp
and such a focus on the true driving experience.

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:59.340
You can buy a lot of other things
with that kind of money though.

00:05:00.041 --> 00:05:05.957
But, they are so much duller,
for example the Golf GTI or Seat Leon Cupra or MÃ©gane RS.

00:05:05.958 --> 00:05:10.770
They are all fantastic, and maybe even faster,
but oh so much duller!

00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:15.776
This is driving in its purest way,
so this should be your second or third car.
