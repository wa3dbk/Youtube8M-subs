00:00:03.516 --> 00:00:06.596
here very overnighted approval filemaker
you know after looking over some of my

00:00:06.596 --> 00:00:10.396
older videos to see how it could improve
previous projects they came across my d

00:00:10.396 --> 00:00:15.576
i y boom full video interest area for
awhile i wonder how i can prove it

00:00:15.576 --> 00:00:19.085
well i thought wouldn't it be great if i
could come up with a portable microphone

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:22.946
out of small enough to fit in your
pocket the retake anywhere you could use

00:00:22.946 --> 00:00:25.886
on any peers for broom handle

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:32.886
yes i think it would

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.656
and use your basic parts list of her
friends pacific's in the description

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:42.116
below

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:46.516
uh... first step is to take your pain
roller driven by the handle and chris

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:51.996
offer or portion of this isn't easy
usually seaweed in a hot car or put it

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:55.436
but in the other than a hundred creases
soccer for plastic

00:00:55.436 --> 00:00:59.286
and that will twist right out the hot
carson worked for me

00:00:59.286 --> 00:01:03.186
heeded his words still easily
hillbillies rule out the whole its

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:04.216
remaining

00:01:04.216 --> 00:01:05.686
actually freezing

00:01:05.686 --> 00:01:09.116
yes which agar drill bit forty five
sixteenths

00:01:09.116 --> 00:01:10.956
is she controlled it

00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:12.976
and you know right now whole out

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:16.876
piaget safely home only cash in on time

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:18.716
killer

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:22.576
when you're done with that for a while

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:25.866
next undertake your microphone clipping
go ahead and add that adapter

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:29.096
three-eighths to five eighths inch
adapter

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:31.126
because the holes five eighths inch

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:33.186
and your three sensual

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:36.646
tear into a lead up to the one in the
description below the link them to use

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:37.636
metal

00:01:37.636 --> 00:01:40.846
have a plastic one here because that's
what came with the microphone clip

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:44.026
plastic is the best but that's what i've
got so it's been using i recommend the

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:45.196
madeleine

00:01:45.196 --> 00:01:49.406
growing is a large with through driver
according to train in the day after an

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:51.116
easy and i'm here

00:01:51.116 --> 00:01:54.206
actually worked pretty well

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:56.216
from uh... that's done

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:57.756
particular

00:01:57.756 --> 00:02:00.816
threaded rod or three-eighths inch
running on him screwed right in the

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:03.526
microphone adapter you don't need six
inches

00:02:03.526 --> 00:02:08.416
uh... that's just a short so i get the
horse or a three six inches should work

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:12.785
processed over and take your hand dole
again and get your pbc cutters and chop

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:14.035
off the head

00:02:14.035 --> 00:02:18.665
though why section you know any tips cut
off the narrowest point

00:02:18.665 --> 00:02:21.945
uh... so you got a flat piece of plastic
with a hole in it

00:02:21.945 --> 00:02:26.285
at the top of your handle

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:30.065
then you take your uh... michael clip
with the rod sticking out of it and go

00:02:30.065 --> 00:02:32.135
ahead and force it into the hole

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:36.675
rise a little bit bigger than the whole
school self thread that's what you want

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.845
going it started about an inch or so

00:02:39.845 --> 00:02:42.275
uh... into the hole

00:02:42.275 --> 00:02:45.175
and which feeling they are going a
little bit you know one of a tourist

00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:50.125
work on your uh... microphone clips of
avoidance truett's

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:54.325
this in my case what's a plastic adapter
i was worried the threaded rod was going

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:55.135
to

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:57.525
be too much for the doctors so i took

00:02:57.525 --> 00:03:00.535
the microphone clip off

00:03:00.535 --> 00:03:05.625
went to the tune of submission and to
listen to threes inch nuts

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:09.756
and then attach them through the end of
the threaded rod

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.125
when the time

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.985
at the very end so that they were
together

00:03:14.985 --> 00:03:18.166
unanswered uh... both pairs of players

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.425
grips both nuts

00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:22.395
and went ahead and turn them

00:03:22.395 --> 00:03:25.515
against each other to entertain them up

00:03:25.515 --> 00:03:29.045
so they would not move

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:31.785
after did they are not affirm place a
grip

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:36.045
threaded rod without damaging it and i
turned the handle

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:39.145
uh... until the threaded rod collapsed
into the handle

00:03:39.145 --> 00:03:43.086
tooling that's actually touch the top of
the handle

00:03:43.086 --> 00:03:45.445
yes that was done in one header removed

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:47.645
the uh... two nights

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:49.825
separated them returning them

00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:52.255
opposite lawyer and tighten them

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:56.155
so they're both lose then i went into
the both off

00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:58.925
and putting that person because

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:01.615
their job here was done

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:05.155
so that we are hamels uh...
three-eighths inch rod sticking out of

00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:06.155
the top

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:08.655
i could now take my microphone clip

00:04:08.655 --> 00:04:11.045
and go ahead and put it back

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:14.995
onto the thread and tighten it down to
the plastic

00:04:14.995 --> 00:04:16.875
that plastic

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.385
uh... microphone clip

00:04:18.385 --> 00:04:19.896
is now firmly

00:04:19.896 --> 00:04:21.625
connected to

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:25.925
you can just pull handle

00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:29.585
okay so he got the same built when we do
that well as mentioned earlier because

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:32.905
it's based on a paint roller handle
it'll fit inside

00:04:32.905 --> 00:04:36.965
a federal covering uh... pairs polo or
extension poles this kind of basic

00:04:36.965 --> 00:04:39.956
course thread here the probably seen
before

00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:41.736
uh... you can use any new

00:04:41.736 --> 00:04:43.486
different ways of extensions

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:47.036
this'll screw rate down onto this
internet pinch you can always and

00:04:47.036 --> 00:04:49.566
through a broom handle any broom handle

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:52.775
uh... will fit into this as well so that
can be pretty handy

00:04:52.775 --> 00:04:56.685
now and of course if you put your
microphone in this year ago up whole

00:04:56.685 --> 00:04:58.855
noise are operator nor is because

00:04:58.855 --> 00:05:03.715
all that sound of has a real love for
whatever the transmit rachel microphone

00:05:03.715 --> 00:05:05.695
so we are going to put

00:05:05.695 --> 00:05:06.885
the uh...

00:05:06.885 --> 00:05:09.755
fruit shock mount here we built a long
time ago

00:05:09.755 --> 00:05:11.565
parade into this device

00:05:11.565 --> 00:05:14.645
and now we have the shock not that was
later microphone

00:05:14.645 --> 00:05:18.115
any kind of palm or is there any kind of
most most lawyers will be insulated

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:19.625
lover careful

00:05:19.625 --> 00:05:21.315
because this is the microphone

00:05:21.315 --> 00:05:23.046
is now suspended

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:25.306
now you might also notice that uh...

00:05:25.306 --> 00:05:29.516
uh... when this is not on the poll which
is not accession pull it now becomes a

00:05:29.516 --> 00:05:32.805
nice little pistol grip so if you are
collecting the audio

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:36.925
uh... hand-held ambient noise sound
effects whatever this little device is

00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:41.235
now a pistol grip something i didn't
have a format but now i do also i want

00:05:41.235 --> 00:05:43.855
to point out that if you're not using a
shotgun

00:05:43.855 --> 00:05:44.616
mike

00:05:44.616 --> 00:05:48.986
uh... clip like i'm using this half-inch
p_v_c_ pipe from the shock will not fit

00:05:48.986 --> 00:05:49.796
in here

00:05:49.796 --> 00:05:51.586
so you'll need to make an adapter

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:54.915
uh... i should do that a man other video
d a y

00:05:54.915 --> 00:05:58.736
uh... boom for video so useful
annotation a pop up here and i'll show

00:05:58.736 --> 00:05:59.826
you how to make

00:05:59.826 --> 00:06:02.516
an inexpensive adapter that'll work for
a larger

00:06:02.516 --> 00:06:06.225
more common might quit these are these
are less common scheme with my shut

00:06:06.225 --> 00:06:08.396
microphones that's why i have it

00:06:08.396 --> 00:06:10.276
something else you can do with this

00:06:10.276 --> 00:06:12.706
is you can unscrew

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:14.236
the microphone clip

00:06:14.236 --> 00:06:18.706
hello expose the three-eighths inch
thread on your handle here and you can

00:06:18.706 --> 00:06:20.936
also add and many ball head

00:06:20.936 --> 00:06:24.476
he's evolved as a felony they threw up
five six dollars and they have a three

00:06:24.476 --> 00:06:26.516
eighths inch threat on the bottom

00:06:26.516 --> 00:06:29.146
uh... which you can now

00:06:29.146 --> 00:06:33.936
through handle and she was willing to
put on the ball head on the top of paul

00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:37.546
and this is a porter twenty militia
lauren any camera

00:06:37.546 --> 00:06:41.226
secret message the other is busy crane
particularly in the poll

00:06:41.226 --> 00:06:43.056
chris will be able to see the monitor

00:06:43.056 --> 00:06:45.755
to figure out some way monitoring like
ukraine

00:06:45.755 --> 00:06:47.466
uh... but you can also add

00:06:47.466 --> 00:06:51.186
any any digital audio recorder a lot of
people are using to draw your records at

00:06:51.186 --> 00:06:53.375
the zoom h one h foreign

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.175
tascam models

00:06:55.175 --> 00:06:58.625
as microphones and so it is a microphone
easing recorder

00:06:58.625 --> 00:06:59.826
and you can attach

00:06:59.826 --> 00:07:02.385
that on the end of this thread later of
course

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:05.516
you probably won't do that because of
the same probably do a microphone which

00:07:05.516 --> 00:07:08.505
is operator annoys transparent
microphones

00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:12.095
so i recommend the add something like
this is the solar film moves

00:07:12.095 --> 00:07:13.275
shock mount

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:17.455
made for digital recorders that his
image what escambia oh five

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:19.676
picking up at the recorder reading here

00:07:19.676 --> 00:07:22.326
uh... and uh...

00:07:22.326 --> 00:07:23.865
so some of your ah...

00:07:23.865 --> 00:07:26.176
noise transmission problems will be
solved

00:07:26.176 --> 00:07:29.775
that's a great solution casio even
things you do with this this all sorts

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:32.035
of pistol grip circular court audio

00:07:32.035 --> 00:07:35.015
hand-held using a they work or you can
do that

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:37.535
so lots of things though its offer here

00:07:37.535 --> 00:07:41.305
uh... if you have any questions of
losing their comments in the email and

00:07:41.305 --> 00:07:43.955
they're talking about this episode i
will link to the in the description

00:07:43.955 --> 00:07:44.956
below

00:07:44.956 --> 00:07:51.956
so uh... goodluck and we'll see you next
time for me

00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:02.695
have a small compact grow version of a
microphone mailto throughout already

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:03.816
appears below

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:07.526
courtroom it all

00:08:07.526 --> 00:08:09.365
quote i believe here is for

00:08:09.365 --> 00:08:12.725
or

00:08:12.725 --> 00:08:14.045
previews participated
