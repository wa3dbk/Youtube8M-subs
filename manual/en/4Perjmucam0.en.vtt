THIS AMBULANCE, STAFFED BY 2 PARAMEDICS, IS WHAT THE PUBIC RECOGNIZES AS NIAGARA EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.600
WHEN SECONDS COUNT, PEOPLE IN NIAGARA DEPEND ON THIS CRUCIAL SERVICE TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY, EMERGENCY MEDICAL CARE.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.240
HOWEVER MAKING THIS HAPPEN REQUIRES MORE THAN JUST A FAST VEHICLE.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.000
AND THE SKILLED PARAMEDICS YOU SEE PROVIDING THE CARE IN NIAGARA'S COMMUNICITES EVERYDAY.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:35.624
A NUMBER OF ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS WORK COLLECTIVELY, DAY TO DAY TO SUPPORT THE MISSION OF EMS AS A MOBILE HEALTH CARE SERVICE.

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:41.364
RIGHT NOW, THIS IS JUST A VEHICLE, AND IT NEEDS TO BE AN AMBULANCE, A TOOL OF THE TRADE.

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:52.988
NIAGARA’S AMBULANCES TRAVEL OVER 1 MILLION KILOMETERS PER YEAR AND MUST BE MAINTAINED AT A HIGH LEVEL OF RELIANCE, UNDERGOING A FULL INSPECTION BY STAFF EVERY 30 DAYS.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:57.560

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:06.500
IT ALSO CONTAINS SOPHISTICATED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT, MEDICATIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ESSENTIAL FOR PARAMEDICS TO DO THEIR WORK.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:15.856

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.988

00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:56.600
STAFF INSTALL AND PROGRAM ALL THE I.T. DEVICES FUNDAMENTAL TO KEEPING VITAL COMMUNICATIONS OPEN.

ALL WHILE  MAINTAINING MAXIMUM COVERAGE AT ALL TIMES.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.340
THE RESPONDING PARAMEDICS NEED TO BE EQUIPPED WITH PROPER TRAINING AND FITTED WITH THE RIGHT GEAR –

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.716
EVERYTHING FROM HIGH VISIBILITY UNIFORMS TO THE SPECIFIC PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO ADDRESS THE GROWING ISSUES OF INFECTION CONTROL.

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:08.328
