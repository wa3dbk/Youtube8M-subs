00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
Miguel AcuÃ±a and his dog, Connie

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.280
So, she is Connie

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.310
How old is she?

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.310
8 years old

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.700
Some years ago

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.260
I was looking for my animals in the mountain in the countryside

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.330
with my two dogs

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.230
and my horse

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.900
Suddenly a dazzling light appears up on the top of the mountain

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
and we were enveloped in that light

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.340
We were 4 days there

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.370
When we came back

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.750
We both realized that we can communicate

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.345
What specific exercices will we see tonight?

00:00:31.345 --> 00:00:34.100
So the judges can bet

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.960
Basic mathematics

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.960
such as addition, subtraction, multiplication...

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.250
We'll also see that she can differentiate between

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.560
genres, colors, objects

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.590
I have never seen a dog with those skills

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:48.820
So I bet for you

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.180
760 USD

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.000
That's a good bet!

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.950
Tusam: I bet for you

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.960
600 USD

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.850
I bet for you

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.480
500 USD

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.390
With a total of 1860 USD tonight

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.100
In 3, 2 ,1

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.250
I bet for you!

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.460
Connie, sit

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.000
Very good!

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.840
Javiera, could you tell a number, please?

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.300
Just with your fingers!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.070
Connie, what number is this?

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.080
It's right the first answer!

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.380
Now, let's subtract something

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.660
minus 4

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.870
7 minus 4 is...

00:01:32.498 --> 00:01:33.627
3

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.430
Amazing

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.000
let's add up something

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.100
3 plus 5

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.020
2 more

00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:50.698
8

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.790
let's divide it

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.520
ok

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.690
8 divided by 4 is

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.507
2

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.010
Show me a number with your hand

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.969
ok

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.149
You will see...

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.029
Conny, sit down

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.209
What's the number here?

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.975
How much is it?

00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:21.997
Wow, really amazing

00:02:21.997 --> 00:02:22.868
Let's add up!

00:02:22.868 --> 00:02:24.090
ok

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.330
To this addition

00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:26.631
we will add up this

00:02:26.698 --> 00:02:27.829
Connie, sit down!

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:28.818
Good

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:29.909
the result of this is...?

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.409
Conny?

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.589
Here we have a certain amount of people

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:43.870
You will see, first, how Connie can tell

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.690
that amount

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.669
Second, she will differentiate between amount of men and women

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:50.250
and finally, she will differentiate an object

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.180
from the others they wear

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.199
come closer, please

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.459
Connie

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.379
sit down

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.287
I will ask you to tell me the amount of people here

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:08.909
there are 5 people

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.735
how much of them are men?

00:03:11.804 --> 00:03:12.619
2

00:03:13.477 --> 00:03:15.243
2 men

00:03:15.243 --> 00:03:16.449
Women?

00:03:20.203 --> 00:03:21.708
I love her

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.139
How much of those women

00:03:24.052 --> 00:03:25.562
no, no, no

00:03:25.562 --> 00:03:27.832
how much women are wearing...

00:03:27.832 --> 00:03:28.593
Connie

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:29.086
no, no, no

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:30.424
Later, later

00:03:33.243 --> 00:03:34.189
Later, daughter

00:03:37.927 --> 00:03:40.666
- how much of them...
- what is she asking for?

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:41.570
She wants to go home

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.172
She wanna leave...

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.745
Ok, how much of them are wearing sunglasses?

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.651
hey, how much people are wearing sunglasses?

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:49.429
1

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.177
what is the position of that person from here to there?

00:03:52.177 --> 00:03:53.699
Connie, from here to there

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:54.879
what position?

00:03:56.464 --> 00:03:57.170
Position 4

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.170
and from there to here?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.324
Position 2

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:01.285
Oh! Amazing!

00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:02.656
Perfect! Ladies and gentlemen

00:04:02.656 --> 00:04:05.929
The test was passed, Miguel!

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.363
I felt a little nervous

00:04:07.363 --> 00:04:08.561
Connie, no, no, no

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.207
later, later...

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:12.768
I think the judges don't treat me as we deserve

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:14.626
This is unique in the world
