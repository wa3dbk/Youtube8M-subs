Hello leather crafters as well as knife sheath makers

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.029
Makers I'd like to continue this leathercraft tutorial

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.730
Sheath making and share a few things about leathercraft with you

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.900
I have got a brand new blade in my
leathercraft knife

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.300
Leather knife here and now continuing to cut out

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.449
Knife sheath I like to share with you a
picture of what the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.500
Here is a picture of the leather tools I use to make my knife sheaths

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.269
Here is a picture of the finished knife sheath and this is the back side

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.980
I have my leathercraft knife here

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.000
Cutting out this knife sheath

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.469
Describe what I'm doing here

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.680
In just a couple minutes you can have
your knife sheath cut out by hand

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.070
Cut out
and then....

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.399
And then wet the leather

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.420
To shape it as well as maybe case it and put a leather design on it

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.960
And put a design on it like I have put on these handmade knife sheaths

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.410
I've got a tap off design and that I can
tap

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.350
The basic design and there

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.439
And then come in there and hand tool and carve the design into the leather

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.250
Probably 30 minutes to an hour to put a design on the knife sheath

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.090
30 minutes I can do a design like this...
somewhere between 30 minutes and an hour

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.270
You can put your own unique design on your knife sheaths
Like names, Initials, or Brands ect...

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.270
You can dream up

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.870
Kind of dog ear that right there 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.870
Fold that over

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.300
This knife sheath is for the left side 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.340
All you have to do with your pattern is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.960
Fold it

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.030
With this pattern you can make either a right or left side sheath by reversing the sheath pattern

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.070
Fold that like that
See that is a left side sheath

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.240
And then if you fold that like that

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.940
The pocket knife sheath is for the right side

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.030
So it is a universal pattern

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.600
Simple design and you can toy a little
bit with your angle there if you would like to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.760
That at an angle

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.560
Or you can actually cut that off and
put a Loop here so you

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.870
Wear it side ways 
But at that time you might

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.840
Well you could actually leave this on
there and use that as a flap to hold pocket

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.610
knife in

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.830
It's just an idea I am throwing out there to give you some ideas about pocket knife sheath designs

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.420
Designs
