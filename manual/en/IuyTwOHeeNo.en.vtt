00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340
 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.000
Here we are in Stirling which is the finish of Stage Two of the Tour Down Under. 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.530
We caught up with Mike Turtur earlier in the week to talk to him about the Stage.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.340
 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.370
Today I am here with Tour Down Under race director, Mike Tutur

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.130
and we are going to have a look at Stage Two of the Santos Tour Down Under, Prospect to Stirling.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.840
Mike what are your thoughts? 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.810
We are going back to Prospect for the start. In previous years they have had a great successful street party 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.970
so it is a really great way to start the race off there in Prospect

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.770
and heading off up through Elizabeth to One Tree Hill which is always very popular.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.010
The Skoda King of the Mountain at Checker Hill is of course 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.110
a very popular location that comes early in this stage so would be significant 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.710
in terms of the overall final result and down through Gumeracha 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.980
through to Woodside but then coming onto the circuit of Stirling.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.530
The difference this year from previous years is that we are only doing two laps

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.680
of the circuit when we come to the finish line in Stirling where as previously we have done 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.210
up to four or five laps. So it still going to be a day maybe for the all rounders

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.710
but we have seen in previous editions Greipel finish second on one occasion

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.370
so depending on how hard they tackle those final two laps will determine 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.500
whether the sprinters can be there at the finish and it is going to be really interesting

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.910
to see if the big group's there or if there is going to be a break up.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.410
The big day in Stirling is always popular and a big stage for us

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.880
on Stage Two The Bike Exchange dot com.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.610
Challenging day today we have got Seaview Road, King of the Mountain at Checkers Hill.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.570
 We know that Stirling is very undulating

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.310
It's been a mixed circuit. We have had riders like Andre Griepel 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.310
finish second up here. We had our own Will Clarke win the Stage solo

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.210
and was one of Team UniSA's greatest victories.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.940
I think it is a day for the aggessors, a day for the adventurers

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:10.640
I think a small group will stay away today

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.040
Don't forget we have seen bunch sprints, not quite a bunch sprint but large groups

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.410
finish up here in Stirling. So despite the challenges 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.170
of all the climbs along the way it can go two ways 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.210
but I believe a small group will dominate the Stage.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.070
So for spectators today it is quite an interesting course

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.240
The two loops through here at Stirling people will really want to get here to see that

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.650
but for those that are really agile I think what they will be able to do is actually

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.910
see the mountain stages. There are two King of the Mountains. One at Seaview Road

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.900
and one at Checker Hill and I think if people really want to see that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.610
they should set themselves up there, see the riders come through and then make

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.180
their way round here to Stirling and see the fantastic finish that will almost certainly 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.000
occur just as in previous years. So from us here in Stirling

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.180
we will see you trackside.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:10.710
