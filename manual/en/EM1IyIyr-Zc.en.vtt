00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.410
Hi! I'm Stan Muller, this is Crash Course World History,
and today we're going to talk about energy..

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.929
I don't mean crystal energy or pyramid power
or even Red Bull. I mean the energy that humans

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.759
use to build pyramids or synthesize crystals
or to manufacture energy drinks.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.169
Hey, hey! Where's Mr. Green?

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.500
Mr. Green is out today and I am the substitute.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
A sub? Can we watch a video?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.500
This is a video.

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.279
So today we're going to talk about Children
of the Sun by Alfred Crosby who you might

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.140
remember from our episode on the Columbian
Exchange. This is Crosby's book about energy

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.309
and in it he says:

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.539
"Modern civilization is the product of an
energy binge... but humankind's unappeasable

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:45.680
appetite for energy makes the solutions ephemeral
and the challenge permanent."

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.719
which is not that hopeful.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.180
But before we start looking at the history
of human energy use, let's talk about what

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.660
we mean by energy. For our purposes here,
energy is the power to do work.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.190
For more than 99% of human history, the main
source of energy to do work was muscle, either

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.250
human or animal. And the fuel for that muscle
was food, usually plants, and plants ultimately

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.740
get their energy from the sun.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.100
So, almost all the energy that humans use
comes from the sun in one way or another.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.310
Hence the book's title, Children of the Sun.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.560
Humans are a lot of things, but efficient
energy converters isn't one of them. That's

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.369
why you need a lot of humans to do a lot of
work. It took a lot of power to build the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.200
pyramids, for example, and it couldn't have happened
without some technological advances using energy.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.540
The first great energy technology was fire.
It enabled us to cook which gave us a greater

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.600
variety of available food and thus more fuel
for our muscles.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.610
Fire also led to metal work and improvements in tools.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.479
Another notable advance in energy was the
domestication of plants and animals. By domesticating

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.189
plants, humans redirected the sun's energy
to create more nutritious and energy-producing

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.719
food. The sun also indirectly fueled domesticated
animals like horses and oxen, which were harnessed

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.130
to do even more useful work.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.719
After the invention of agriculture, developments
in human energy kind of plateaued for a while.

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.930
The only energy that we had that didn't derive
from the sun was water power, since wind technically

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.289
comes from the sun's heating the air so sailing
ships and wind mills are kind of solar power.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.360
There were some minor advances, like concentrating
the energy density of wood by converting it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.830
to charcoal, and adding oxygen to fires using
bellows, but for the most part, power was

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.250
still generated by muscle.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.400
The next big change in energy use came with
industrialization. Let's go to The Thought Bubble

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.430
So industrialization utilized new forms of
fuel in coal, and later oil and natural gas.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.870
These fuels are just really, really old forms
of fossilized plant and animal matter, so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.500
again, they're originally from the sun, but
we don't think of it this way. Nobody calls

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.750
coal "solar power."

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.750
While the Chinese were using coal during the
Song Dynasty to work iron, for example, England

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.400
was where coal use really took off, thanks
to the steam engine. Newcomen's Steam Engine

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.680
was, according to Crosby, "The first machine
to provide significantly large amounts of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.470
power not derived from muscle, water, or wind."

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.090
Coal powered industrialization was a pretty
big deal. It allowed Britain to dominate the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.830
textile industry, and industrially produced
weapons, and steam powered ships enabled Europeans

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.610
to penetrate and dominate Africa, and parts
of Asia. According to Crosby, fossil fuels

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.030
"created the political and economic landscape
we recognize today."

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.640
After steam powered manufacturing, it was
a short chronological leap to electricity,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.290
which was used to power machines, and for
illumination. Electric light was a really

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.100
big deal because it provided a clean and efficient
way to allow people to work after dark.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.810
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Although we might
think of coal as the fuel of the 19th century,

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.870
we still use a lot of it today. Especially
for generating electricity, but coal is much

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.130
less efficient than oil. Oil was revolutionary
because it could power not only electricity

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.650
plants, and ships, and trains, but also the
internal combustion engine, which makes cars

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.590
and trucks possible. Crosby maintains that
"the internal combustion engine powering the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.300
automobile, truck, and tractor has for a century
been the most influential contrivance on the planet."

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.980
By the end of the 20th century, there were
half a billion cars in the world, and humans

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.540
were using 70 million barrels of oil each
day. Manufacturing and driving all those cars

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.540
has had a huge impact on the environment.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.390
From an energy use perspective, the world
since 1900 is a totally new era in human history.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.400
We use electricity for everything in the West.
It powers our gadgets, it lights our homes,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.260
it gets us around on trains, or buses, or
cars. Crosby puts it like this: "Humanity's

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.000
primary energy use has increased twenty times
over since 1850 and nearly five times over since 1950."

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.540
In the U.S., each individual consumed 2000
kilowatt hours of electricity in 1950, and

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.850
32,700 in 2000. Oil and natural gas are the
most important fuels for this electricity

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.290
boom, although as of 2006, 40%-50% of humans,
most of them living in the tropics, still

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.760
rely on wood for fuel. So, when the world
will run out of oil is a topic of heated debate,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.760
but scientists have been looking for other
forms of fuel for decades.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.450
One alternative is nuclear power, which has
not been a total success. The first nuclear

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.030
plant providing power for homes opened in
the Soviet Union in 1954, and some countries,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.870
notably France, still rely heavily on nuclear
energy.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.730
Despite initial enthusiasm from scientists,
and science fiction writers, nuclear power

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.940
never caught on in the U.S. partly because
it's really expensive. Another problem is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.590
that no one can figure out what to do with
the radioactive waste that nuclear energy

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.030
produces. But the biggest reason nuclear power
fails to catch on is because people think

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.090
nuclear power is dangerous, believing that
nuclear plants can easily turn into huge bombs,

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.720
or that malfunctioning reactor cores will
melt all the way through the earth to China,

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.120
or something. Actually, it would probably
melt all the way through to Australia or something,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.400
but you know what I mean.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.030
Nuclear accidents have happened, though, notably
and Windscale in England in 1957, and at San

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.850
Loren in France in 1969, but neither of these
was catastrophic. The U.S. had a nuclear scare

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.920
in 1979 with and accident at Three Mile Island
in Pennsylvania. Although there were no immediate

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.500
casualties, thousands of people in the vicinity
were forced to evacuate, and the cleanup took

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.060
years, and cost millions.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:35.400
The disaster at the Soviet nuclear plant at
Chernobyl in 1986 was much worse, with a release

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.570
of radiation that was hundreds of times greater
than that given off at Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.300
and fallout that will be lethal for 24,000 years.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.090
A few countries still use nuclear power, but
it never really caught on. Overall, nuclear

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.570
power has never accounted for more than 5%
of the world's energy supply.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.850
In recent years, rising concerns over climate
change have led to increased calls for humanity

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.630
to find cleaner, more renewable forms of energy.
The alternative, that we significantly reduce

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.400
our energy consumption, seems unlikely, especially
since it would seem like a historical step backward.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.320
History is often presented as a story of progress
and growth and increasing complexity and a

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.380
future in which we use is kind of hard to
imagine. But historically speaking, the world

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.590
we live in is new, it's unsustainable, and
it's not normal.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.389
Crosby offers us this reminder "Most of us
in the richer societies can only recall times

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:27.170
of immediate access to abundant energy. That
abundance tempts us, successfully, to believe

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.210
that having energy flow down lines from far
away and illuminate our rooms when we flip

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.800
the switch is normal rather than miraculous."

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.870
In the end, how we reconcile our desire to
continue our history of growth and rising

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:42.050
complexity with the fact that such growth
is unsustainable with current technology is

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.550
one of the biggest challenges facing humanity
today.

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.860
Whether and how we rise to that challenge
will determine what kind of world we live

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.200
in tomorrow.
