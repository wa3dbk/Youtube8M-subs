00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.590
Hi everybody, joey here again and welcome
back.

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.700
Today, I'm going to show you how to build
a dosing system.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.599
A dosing system allows you to dose trace elements,
fertilizers, supplements and any other liquid

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.599
to your

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:14.599
aquarium.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.720
It does so in small set amounts at set times
of the day.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.700
Many planted aquarium and reef owners dose
their aquariums on a daily basis.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.190
Some rely on a dosing

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.950
system to do it for them, while others manually
dose daily.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.950
Manually dosing does not offer a lot of consistency
though.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:28.950
There are times you might miss a dose, or

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.950
simply not be able to dose at the same time
every day.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.950
This is where a dosing system comes in handy

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.950
while offering consistency.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.579
A dosing system consists of two main components:
A dosing container and a dosing pump

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:36.079
Both are typically sold separately.

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.329
Purchased, this will run you are $200.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:44.159
The one I will show you how to build will
only cost you less than $30.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.159
So let's get started.

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.159
For the dosing container

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.399
You will need a small plastic container that
has a sealable lid.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.359
Preferably spill proof and around 2 liters

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.410
in size.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.960
This one, I paid $2.50 for.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.719
Size will depend entirely on what you want
to use it for.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.420
You do not

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.980
need anything fancy or expensive though.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.050
Even a simple water bottle will work.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.110
(If it has a flat bottom)

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.330
You will also need Airline ball valves: You
need two of these.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.110
These are pretty common to find online

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.690
with an aquarium supply store.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.830
They fit perfectly inside an airline hose
and are barbed at the end so the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.490
line does not come off.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.070
They will cost you around $0.50 each.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.210
Common airline hose will also be needed.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.880
A small amount of silicone will also be used.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.610
Start by drilling a hole as close to the bottom
of the container as possible.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.700
The hole should be the same

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.890
size as the airline hose.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.700
Take a small piece of airline hose and attach
it to one of the ball valves.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.630
Insert the ball valve with the airline end,
into the hole in the bottle.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.310
The ball valve slightly makes the

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.590
airline wider than normal and this helps to
create a seal on the bottle.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.660
The seal will prevent leaks and

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.660
movement.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.500
The purpose of this valve will be discussed
later.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.840
Add a dab of silicone around the ball valve
to help seal it.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.980
This completes the dosing container.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.000
Now we need a pump.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I recommend using the "Tom Aquatics Aqua-Lifter
Dosing Pump".

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If you search it

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.130
online, you will come to find it will average
around $15.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.420
This is similar to an air pump, but instead
of

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.510
air, it can pump liquid.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.660
It pumps small amounts of liquid though, which
is perfect for this project.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.080
This pump is a must.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.730
Connect the lift pump to the valve on the
container.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.030
This valve should be connected to the suction
input

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.390
of the pump.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.610
Connect a small piece of airline to the output
of the pump.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.410
Then the second ball valve.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.410
Then more

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.410
airline.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.130
This will serve as the return to your aquarium.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.130
That's it.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.920
So how does this work?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.640
Fluid is sucked in from the container and
pumped to the aquarium.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.810
The ball valve connected to the container
serves as a shut off and a place to disconnect

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.810
the pump from

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.810
the container.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.860
The valve insures nothing leaks out when you
do so.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.210
The ball valve on the output controls the
flow of liquid.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.459
Now let's talk about how to set this up and
how to get the right amount of flow out of

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.459
it.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.560
We need to know one thing: How much water
is in a drop.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.200
It takes 20 drops of water to make 1 milliliter
of water.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.330
So for example, if you drip this at a rate
of 1 drop per second, you will have dripped

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.220
3 milliliters of

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.780
water in 1 minute.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.459
This measurement is how you will calculate
the flow.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.810
When you turn this pump on, you will notice
that the water flows out and doesn't actually

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.810
drip.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.810
You will

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.940
need to use the ball valve on the output of
the pump to control the flow and bring it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.610
down to a drip.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.650
NEVER restrict the flow going in.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.140
Only restrict the flow going out.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.160
Restricting the flow going into a

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.660
pump will ruin any water pump in no time.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.680
So now that we know how to calculate the dosing
amount.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.460
We can't have this dripping all day.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:51.460
so we

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.460
need to put it on a timer.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.319
A cheap timer is all that is needed here.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.989
One that will allow you to switch it on and
off by the minute.

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.569
Typically, these will run you around $5

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.450
Set the timer to turn the pump on once a day,
for a set time period.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.450
I like to use a 5 minute setting.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.450
In

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.450
most cases, this is enough.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.530
So let's take a look at an example now that
we understand drip rates...

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.360
Say we need to dose 20 milliliters of fertilizer
to the aquarium once a day.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.360
That means we need to make

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.600
sure there are 400 drips to make up those
20 milliliters.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.260
If you drip 2 drips per second, you will reach
those 400 drips in a matter of 2 minutes.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.840
So we would set

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.290
the timer to come on for 2 minutes and then
shut back off, once a day.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.870
Now I suggest Practicing with water first.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.530
Get your drip right before adding in the real
thing.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:37.530
This can

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.910
take a few attempts and maybe even a few days
to make sure the drip is consistently correct.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.380
Placing the output hose near a power head
or return of a filter will make sure it is

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.380
getting evenly

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.470
distributed in the aquarium and not just dosing
one area in the aquarium.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.660
So that is how to build a dosing system.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.449
If anything else, I hope this got you thinking
and possibly

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.419
inspired more ideas.

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:06.340
Anyways, I hope you guys enjoyed the video,
I also want to thank you for watching, and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.340
we'll see you

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.342
next time.
