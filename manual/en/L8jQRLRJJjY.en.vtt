00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.419
A FIFTEEN-YEAR-OLD FARM BOY HAS
ENTERED THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE,

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:08.510
AND ACCORDING TO PUBLIC POLICY
POLLING, HE HAS NINE PERCENT

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.480
OF THE VOTE IN NORTH CAROLINA.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.480
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.240
IT'S DEEZ NUTS.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.940
THAT'S REALLY IT, THAT'S THE
STORY, IT'S JUST FUN.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.230
&gt;&gt; FIRST OF ALL, I LOVE THE KID.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.860
HEíS FIFTEEN, HE CAN'T RUN FOR

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.860
PRESIDENT, HIS REAL NAME IS

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.949
OBVIOUSLY NOT DEEZ NUTS.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.130
HE'S
GOT THE AMERICAN SPIRIT THOUGH,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.829
HE'S ENTREPRENEURIAL, HE'S
HAVING FUN, HE'S MAKING LIFE

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.989
INTERESTING FOR EVERYONE ELSE,

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.550
AND I LIKE ñ I THINK, I HOPE ñ
THAT AT LEAST NINE PERCENT OF

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.379
THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS FROM NORTH
CAROLINA HAD ENOUGH HUMOR TO

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.860
WRITE IN, YEAH DEEZ NUTS.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799
I HOPE
TO GOD THAT NONE OF THOSE NINE

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.620
PERCENT ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT IT

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.460
WAS MISTER NUTS, AND THAT THEY
WERE ON HIS SIDE, BUT WITH

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.949
WITH REPUBLICANS YOU
ARE NEVER QUITE SURE.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.949
&gt;&gt; IN THIS POLLING PHASE OF THE ELECTION
CYCLE, THE ONLY THING THAT

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.820
MATTERS IS NAME RECOGNITION.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.119
IT IS ALL BASED ON NAME

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.590
RECOGNITION, WHICH NAME HAVE YOU
HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.590
MEDIA?

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.651
IT IS DONALD TRUMP, WHICH
IS WHY THEY KEEP SAYING, YEAH, I

00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:23.760
GUESS I WILL VOTE FOR DONALD

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.439
TRUMP.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.009
WITH DEEZ NUTS, WHO
KNOWS?

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.009
IF YOU TALK ABOUT HIM

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.050
ENOUGH, HE MIGHT BEAT DONALD TRUMP
IN THE POLLS.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.810
&gt;&gt; HE MIGHT RISE IN THE POLLS.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.780
SPEAKING OF RISING IN THE POLLS,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.899
DONALD TRUMP USED TO BE AT
SIXTEEN PERCENT IN NORTH

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:41.899
CAROLINA.

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.619
HE IS SURGING, AND
HAS GONE ALL THE WAY UP TO

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:45.979
TWENTY-FOUR PERCENT.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.290
HE IS
WINNING AMONG MODERATE, SOMEWHAT

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.010
CONSERVATIVE, CONSERVATIVE,
WOMEN, HE IS WAITING AMONG ALL

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.820
OF THOSE CATEGORIES.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.260
SPEAKING
OF DEEZ NUTS, HIS RUNNING MATE

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.499
IS ANYA CHIN.

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:09.550
&gt;&gt; I DIDN'T GET IT UNTIL YOU
SAID IT JUST NOW.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.610
THAT IS

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.340
CLEVER.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.300
THE NAME ANYA.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.070
&gt;&gt; JUST BE CAREFUL
WHAT IT COMES WITH.
