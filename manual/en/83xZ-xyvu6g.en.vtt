00:01:08.706 --> 00:01:11.087
Film this beauty over here!

00:01:12.402 --> 00:01:13.860
Film this little playboy!

00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:16.803
This little playboy from Brasília!

00:01:16.804 --> 00:01:19.023
- Turn sideways!
- Take a look at his haircut!

00:01:21.787 --> 00:01:23.117
I'm going to turn sideways!

00:01:23.505 --> 00:01:25.942
Let's turn sideways,
the three of us!

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.585
Smile to the camera!

00:01:36.135 --> 00:01:36.860
Smile!

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:39.629
We'll compare you and Zé Love
to see who's the most handsome!

00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:00.123
He's excited!

00:02:19.027 --> 00:02:20.805
Urgent!

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.530
Urgent! He really need it!

00:02:29.693 --> 00:02:31.125
It makes no difference,
I won't get a haircut,

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:34.478
I'll get an afro hairstyle,
you'll see!

00:03:12.666 --> 00:03:14.786
Today is the day, guys!

00:03:16.625 --> 00:03:18.543
Let's go, let's go!

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:21.929
"Pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen."

00:03:44.446 --> 00:03:45.471
It was a tough match,

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:47.911
our performance during the first half
was not that good,

00:03:48.322 --> 00:03:50.675
we improved a lot
during the second half,

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:54.792
the rain was a huge problem for us,

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:57.867
but that's fine,
we scored an important point,

00:03:57.868 --> 00:04:00.582
and I have to highlight that
this is just the beginning,

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:01.894
and it's, indeed,
a positive beginning.

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:03.258
We need everybody,

00:04:03.958 --> 00:04:06.431
we are counting on you
once again,

00:04:06.432 --> 00:04:08.137
there's more to come on Sunday.
See you!

00:04:08.284 --> 00:04:09.267
Congratulations on the commitment,

00:04:09.268 --> 00:04:10.990
we did a good job
during the second half,

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.066
the pitch was in bad conditions,
very irregular,

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.672
but we managed to impose
our own pace,

00:04:17.395 --> 00:04:19.272
and I believe the draw wasn't
such a bad result.

00:04:19.273 --> 00:04:21.270
We scored one point, we wanted
to win, we played to do so,

00:04:21.877 --> 00:04:22.661
even playing away from home,

00:04:22.662 --> 00:04:23.866
but I believe the draw
was a good result.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:25.530
It was a tough match,

00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:28.776
we wanted to win the match,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.414
but we scored an important point,

00:04:32.798 --> 00:04:35.538
their team knows
how to play at home,

00:04:37.771 --> 00:04:39.576
they made things difficult for us,

00:04:39.577 --> 00:04:42.117
but I think that scoring one point
was a good result.
