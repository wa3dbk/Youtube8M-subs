00:00:00.642 --> 00:00:02.700
- Hey, everyone, it's Wednesday.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.620
And that means that I'm on my website,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.041
katimorton.com, under Community Forums.

00:00:07.041 --> 00:00:10.529
Tune in for videos, and
I'm also on YouTube, hello.

00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:12.103
So, today I have four questions,

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:13.583
as well as a journal topic.

00:00:13.583 --> 00:00:16.216
So, without further adieu,
let's get into them.

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:18.557
Now, the first question
is, "What is the difference

00:00:18.557 --> 00:00:21.474
between PTSD dissociation and DID?"

00:00:22.662 --> 00:00:25.601
DID being Dissociative Identity Disorder,

00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:28.601
otherwise known as Multiple
Personality Disorder.

00:00:28.601 --> 00:00:29.434
Just FYI.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:35.242
"If you dissociate because of
your PTSD, do you have DID?

00:00:35.242 --> 00:00:36.075
"Thanks."

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:36.987
Now, that's a great question.

00:00:36.987 --> 00:00:40.320
And the truth of it is that in order to,

00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:44.852
a lot of people with PTSD will dissociate,

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:48.178
and they do not necessarily have DID,

00:00:48.178 --> 00:00:50.291
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:53.749
Dissociative Identity
Disorder is when you create

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:55.978
a complete alternate universe that you

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:59.266
kind of daydream slash live in.

00:00:59.266 --> 00:01:01.855
And people, that's why they
call Multiple Personality,

00:01:01.855 --> 00:01:03.791
because you actually can
create, like, an alter ego

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:06.438
to some extent and you can
kind of live in that land.

00:01:06.438 --> 00:01:08.876
So, imagine if you're,
you know, day dreaming

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:11.485
and you're like, you
know, I'm going to live in

00:01:11.485 --> 00:01:13.402
this beautiful house on a hill, and I'll

00:01:13.402 --> 00:01:15.735
have all these dogs or whatever.

00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:18.011
You can create a happier place.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.008
And this is something that
we do, kind of, as a way

00:01:20.008 --> 00:01:23.642
to cope, which is why it's
linked so much to PTSD.

00:01:23.642 --> 00:01:24.808
The difference being, you can have

00:01:24.808 --> 00:01:29.001
PTSD and dissociate sometimes,
but if it's taking up

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:33.056
a significant portion of your
time, then it would be DID.

00:01:33.056 --> 00:01:35.439
And you can have PTSD and DID,

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.910
but they don't always happen that way.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.934
Okay, does that make sense?

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:41.088
So, sometimes you'll have one with,

00:01:41.088 --> 00:01:43.080
you'll have dissociation with PTSD,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.484
but only if it's taking up a significant

00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:49.075
portion of time is it actually DID, okay?

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:50.521
Question number two.

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.293
"Is it normal to just start crying?"

00:01:52.293 --> 00:01:53.790
I've gotten this question,
I think it's from

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.623
the same person that have been

00:01:54.623 --> 00:01:57.116
following me around all week.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.199
No, it's not.

00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:03.021
Most of the time, if you're
crying for what we would,

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:04.745
you know, when my clients will say, Kati,

00:02:04.745 --> 00:02:06.738
I'm just crying for no reason,

00:02:06.738 --> 00:02:09.383
there's no real reason, I'm just crying.

00:02:09.383 --> 00:02:11.532
It's usually because
we're really overwhelmed,

00:02:11.532 --> 00:02:13.769
and our anxiety is really
high, or our depression

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.001
is really bad, and the
smallest things or nothing

00:02:17.001 --> 00:02:18.573
really can just set us off, right?

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:21.756
And then we instantly start crying.

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:25.755
Because, another thing to think about is

00:02:25.755 --> 00:02:29.574
what we hypothesize as
being the reason for our

00:02:29.574 --> 00:02:32.342
depression and anxiety and stuff like that

00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:36.064
is kind of a, the
neurotransmitters in our brain

00:02:36.064 --> 00:02:38.647
aren't keeping our dopamine and

00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:41.306
serotonin at the right levels.

00:02:41.306 --> 00:02:43.758
That's what they hypothesize, right?

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:46.826
So, those are very
clearly linked to hormones

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:49.527
and affects our mood and so things,

00:02:49.527 --> 00:02:51.293
if we're depressed, or if we're anxious,

00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:54.178
or kind of mood and our
hormones and all that stuff

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:55.537
is going all out of wack, so we might

00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:56.558
just cry for no reason.

00:02:56.558 --> 00:02:59.759
We might want to yell
at someone and then cry,

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:01.174
or you know, we just kind of feel like

00:03:01.174 --> 00:03:03.405
our emotions aren't under our own control.

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:05.894
So, if you're feeling like
you're crying all the time

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.918
in places where you don't want to cry,

00:03:07.918 --> 00:03:09.480
and times where you don't want to cry,

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.980
I would encourage you to seek some

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.414
professional help and see a therapist

00:03:12.414 --> 00:03:15.253
because talking it out
can honestly really help.

00:03:15.253 --> 00:03:16.813
Okay, question number three.

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:18.315
"As a therapist, do you ever forget about

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:20.645
"your clients, or what their names are?

00:03:20.645 --> 00:03:24.486
"I was just seeing a
therapist in the spring,

00:03:24.486 --> 00:03:26.226
"I would like to see her
again, but I'm afraid

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:28.229
"if I call and say hi this is blank,

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.365
"she will have forgotten who I am."

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:32.010
I hadn't even, and
that's a great question,

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.989
I hadn't even thought about this.

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.563
People gave this a lot of thumbs-up.

00:03:34.563 --> 00:03:36.730
So, um, no, I would never.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.735
Also know that if you leave a message,

00:03:40.735 --> 00:03:42.688
if you call and say, like,
let's say I call and say

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:45.844
hi, I'm Kati Morton,
she can, if she's like,

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:48.038
is it the Kati that did this or the Kati?

00:03:48.038 --> 00:03:49.591
Because I am much better if they're like,

00:03:49.591 --> 00:03:53.046
my name is Kati and I'm
the one who had the,

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:54.231
you know, they tell me
like a little bit about

00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:57.658
their story, and then I'm
like, oh I remember everything.

00:03:57.658 --> 00:04:00.596
So, if your therapist happens to forget

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:04.291
which person you are, if you
have a very common first name,

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.496
she can pull out your file and look up

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.511
and be like, oh yeah, I remember.

00:04:08.511 --> 00:04:10.479
So, no, we don't forget.

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.220
And even if we forget some
of the little specifics,

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.316
we have some notes to back up,

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:15.764
you know, back up our memory.

00:04:15.764 --> 00:04:19.702
It's like our hard drive, or something.

00:04:19.702 --> 00:04:22.011
So yeah, we never forget.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:22.965
And I don't even forget you guys.

00:04:22.965 --> 00:04:25.043
Like, a lot of you will be following me

00:04:25.043 --> 00:04:26.512
and tweeting to me and then
you'll go away for a while,

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:27.623
and you're like I just
got out of in-patient.

00:04:27.623 --> 00:04:28.841
I'm like, I remember you.

00:04:28.841 --> 00:04:31.478
Especially if your little
picture or whatever,

00:04:31.478 --> 00:04:34.293
your, I don't even know what
the word I'm looking for,

00:04:34.293 --> 00:04:36.445
whatever you've selected
is the same, and it

00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:39.864
stays the same to represent
you on Twitter or Instagram

00:04:39.864 --> 00:04:41.433
or whatever, then I always remember,

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:42.424
because I'm like, oh yeah.

00:04:42.424 --> 00:04:45.439
Because I look at that
while I'm typing my answer.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.207
Okay, question number four.

00:04:47.207 --> 00:04:49.049
"Hey, Katie, my question is how can you

00:04:49.049 --> 00:04:51.402
"get out of the binge cycle?

00:04:51.402 --> 00:04:52.699
"I don't know if you have a video on this,

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.085
"but I have an eating
disorder, and I had almost

00:04:55.085 --> 00:04:56.663
"recovered, but then I relapsed.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.705
"I don't eat all day, and then
it comes towards nighttime,

00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:00.023
"and I end up eating everything in sight.

00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:00.893
"Any advice?

00:05:00.893 --> 00:05:02.334
"Thanks for reading."

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.141
I don't have a video on
this, and it's actually

00:05:04.141 --> 00:05:05.232
a really good question, which is

00:05:05.232 --> 00:05:08.523
why I've decided to answer it.

00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:10.538
To be honest, you kind of
answered your own question.

00:05:10.538 --> 00:05:14.487
You didn't realize it, but you
don't eat anything all day.

00:05:14.487 --> 00:05:17.781
And that's what keeps us in the cycle, is

00:05:17.781 --> 00:05:21.403
don't eat, binge, guilt,
whatever we do to make up

00:05:21.403 --> 00:05:23.486
for the binging, if it's
purging or if it's just

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:25.554
the guilt followed by not eating again to

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:29.025
make up for the binge, or whatever.

00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:30.883
We have to eat.

00:05:30.883 --> 00:05:32.636
And if you're really
struggling and this is how

00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:34.964
you're relapsing, this
is like what gets you,

00:05:34.964 --> 00:05:36.640
I would encourage you,
please please please,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.457
work with a dietitian, create a meal plan,

00:05:38.457 --> 00:05:40.386
so you're eating three
meals and three snacks

00:05:40.386 --> 00:05:42.557
throughout your day,
so you don't have that

00:05:42.557 --> 00:05:46.554
extreme hunger, extreme
fullness, extreme hunger,

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.821
extreme fullness, that
we just keep ourselves

00:05:48.821 --> 00:05:51.321
in this healthy, happy medium.

00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:55.525
So yeah, I would just
set up an appointment.

00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:56.559
You know, work with a dietitian.

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:58.414
Also work with a therapist,
because it really helps

00:05:58.414 --> 00:06:01.630
to have someone to help,
someone to help you

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.699
and be there with you while
you're really struggling

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.496
with, you know, the
anxiety that comes along

00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:07.716
with trying this and eating more maybe

00:06:07.716 --> 00:06:09.364
when we don't want to, or eating disorder

00:06:09.364 --> 00:06:10.805
tells us we shouldn't.

00:06:10.805 --> 00:06:12.971
So yeah, I know it's a
lot of work, and I know

00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:15.623
it's really hard, but it's
good to eat during the day,

00:06:15.623 --> 00:06:19.543
and it's good to have a
consistent schedule that we eat.

00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:21.407
I even have a pretty
consistent schedule when I eat,

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:22.576
and I'm not even on a meal plan.

00:06:22.576 --> 00:06:24.541
I just, I know when
I'm going to be hungry,

00:06:24.541 --> 00:06:26.010
and I always eat breakfast
around the same time

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.264
because I get up around the same time,

00:06:27.264 --> 00:06:28.994
eat lunch around the same time, you know.

00:06:28.994 --> 00:06:30.564
And that's good for your body.

00:06:30.564 --> 00:06:33.998
And it'll be good to get
you out of that cycle, okay?

00:06:33.998 --> 00:06:35.582
Now, the journal topic of today, because

00:06:35.582 --> 00:06:38.148
I've been really stressed, I'll admit it.

00:06:38.148 --> 00:06:39.568
Christmas is coming,
and Sean and I are going

00:06:39.568 --> 00:06:41.129
to Montreal and there's
been a lot going on.

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:42.447
I'm like, running around going crazy.

00:06:42.447 --> 00:06:44.298
I was at Makers Studio today, filming

00:06:44.298 --> 00:06:48.118
a video with someone, very exciting.

00:06:48.118 --> 00:06:49.840
So, I've just been running around,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.020
like a chicken with my head cut off.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.921
And so, the quote of the day is

00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:57.822
"My body needs laughter
as much as needs tears.

00:06:57.822 --> 00:07:00.057
"Both are cleansers of stress."

00:07:00.057 --> 00:07:01.974
So I want you to take some time,

00:07:01.974 --> 00:07:04.175
and think about the last
time you really laughed.

00:07:04.175 --> 00:07:07.413
Like full body laugh,
like throw your head back,

00:07:07.413 --> 00:07:09.897
can't even deal with
yourself it's so funny.

00:07:09.897 --> 00:07:11.748
And when's the last time
you had a really good cry?

00:07:11.748 --> 00:07:12.748
You know, like, ugly cry.

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:15.331
Like you're making that face,
and your nose is running,

00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:16.834
and you almost can't catch your breath

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:18.298
you're crying so hard.

00:07:18.298 --> 00:07:19.701
And I want you to write
a little bit about those,

00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:21.282
and are you giving
yourself enough time to be

00:07:21.282 --> 00:07:23.957
happy as well as sad, and not doing one

00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:26.219
significantly more than doing another?

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:27.447
And if you find you are, then what

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.880
can we do to turn it around?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.131
If I'm spending all this time laughing,

00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:32.781
and kind of like, pretending I'm okay,

00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:35.584
and I really just need to
alone with myself for a bit,

00:07:35.584 --> 00:07:37.569
then maybe we can create some alone time.

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:39.072
And if I'm crying all the time, and

00:07:39.072 --> 00:07:40.970
I'm not getting out of bed
and I'm not seeing my friends,

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:43.362
I'm not doing anything I used to love,

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.275
how can we do that more?

00:07:45.275 --> 00:07:48.017
Think about it, write
about it, and share, okay?

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:48.850
I love you all.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.179
Tomorrow is Thursday,
and I'll be on Twitter.

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:52.200
So ask your questions there,
and I'll see you then.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.033
Bye.
