00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.189
a morgan stanley wealth manager and his name
is martin earth singer out was charged with

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.559
a hit and run back in november

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:23.539
apparently he hates a bicycle is few rear-ended
the bicycle is

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.579
while he was driving his brand new month old
mercedes-benz

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:30.670
here and it is

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.129
unit

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:32.980
planet

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.960
agree okay so of course this this whole trial
is going on there trying to figure out what

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.309
the charge election to be charged with two
misdemeanors she beat right at the felony

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.840
nadi ideology alone i love it but not as relevant
as what investigators are trying to look at

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.960
okay they're trying to make a case

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.690
that the new cars smell of his on-scene mercedes-benz
homes

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.490
constant to fall asleep behind the wheel that's

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.450
caused him to reread the bicycle

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.220
that that's a little more specific reason
there was that uh... discussion about felony

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.320
or misdemeanors before through the prosecutor
said about this guy makes so much money yet

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.900
we try to a family he might lose his job in
which case you won't make as much money

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.900
which i say

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.679
who gives up

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:20.049
well high now is inhaled or not

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:25.110
that part of the story is incredible because
if you have the money you can do no wrong

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.429
but i think that's all it really

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.509
for apprentices wealthy individual who is
from working simply not allowed

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.590
yet and by the way the kitty all kidding aside
he got really hurt rather k

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.319
now so then you go to the second part and
they have been

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:43.640
never to make that argument but as i guess
the first argument work

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.669
and also which that i shouldn't be

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:51.419
punished more severely they said well you
know my numbers better news others over and

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:55.560
at the new cause my doctors attorney admits
that he did

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.560
and so that caused the postman given options
you but id rather enjoyed if nicaragua

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.029
decradius sleep apnea and it did and the new
carswell a tribute to sleep apnea

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:14.079
but get a little while laura craft this help
because because he's been a bit

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.140
use with it

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.749
so even if he was asleep when he hit the kid
which happens it happens a new course for

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:25.279
or otherwise people falsely to tragedies that
are

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:29.480
after you had uh... you woke up and venue
ran away

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.400
right that's the real crime

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.239
birthday

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.939
and so they have not know the new congress
now they have nothing to with your fancy morgan

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.449
stanley job

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:44.430
now that would you be the son of a bitch who
really hurt this kid very badly

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.150
and instead of calling people to get a pal

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.170
so he and i on the side of the road

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.019
you're right away

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.489
