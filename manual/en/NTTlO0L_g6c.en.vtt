00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:11.670
As someone who had to slog his way through
the 80s and 90s and the gaming obsession with

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.869
platformers, coming across one of these genre
classics these days is met with trepidation.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.650
I say this because we have a rich history
of what does and doesn't work, including other

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.660
less tangible aspects like how the should
'feel'.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.800
Commander Pixman gets the first part right
as it smooshes Super Meat Boy with the visual

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.660
stylings of the free game Star Guard, but
something about this game by One Minute Games

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.730
doesn't quite fulfill the second part.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.579
As to be expected the game features a basic
virtual button setup to move left and right,

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:42.399
jump, and fire your weapon.

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.410
Unfortunately though, the game plays with
your expectations by modifying how jumping

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.140
feels by incorporating a 'jetpack' feel of
floatiness.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.770
This results in a sort of acceleration curve
while jumping, that tapers off to a smooth

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.620
arc; as such the start of your jumps have
an inverted fidelity, giving you fine control

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.840
over relatively low jumps, but instability
nearer the top of the curve.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.270
Thankfully the game is consistent and once
you start reaching the seriously challenging

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.139
levels you'll start to adjust, but it's hard
to entirely shake off that awkward feeling.

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:15.159
At least the challenge of mastering what should
be basic controls falls in line with the style

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.049
of the game as players attempt to conquer
up to 80 levels by finessing their way through

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.470
multiple traps and hordes of enemies that
are likely to stop you in your tracks.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.439
Much like Super Meat Boy the game tracks your
progress, showing you all the deaths you incurred

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:28.939
before passing the level.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:33.609
In the case of the 15 bonus levels, this could
be several dozen instances of 'Pixman' racing

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.840
off to their doom, making for an entertaining
way to celebrate your victory.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.409
These super-hard stages are unlocked by completing
various challenges, which are not always easy

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.829
in and of themselves, so at least you know
what you're in for.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.779
Packaging the whole thing with retro pixel
art and chiptune music only helps to solidify

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:54.079
its links with the often brutally difficult
platformers of the past, so consider this

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.219
a warning of sorts - you will die and you
will die often, but perseverance and skill

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.559
will win through.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:13.360
A solid pick for gamers after something to
beat their skull against for a while.
