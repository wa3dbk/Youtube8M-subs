Czajnikowy.pl - a good cup of tea!

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
Hello and welcome, my name is Dreg.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.990
I'm here as RafaÅ‚ is gonna be a bit late today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Today we have an episode about water, pefect water for brewing tea. Stay with us.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.990
Tips

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.990
Tests

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.990
Brewing tea

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.990
Hi! Sorry for being late. Just like Mr. Dreg told you, today we're going to deal with water.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.990
To make water suitable for brewing tea, at first we need to boil it, of course.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.990
We need to start boiling from the beginning, because it's going to take a while.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.990
What's important, we need to bring the water to so called 'white boiling'.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.990
It's the best boiling stage for steeping tea, 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.990
we shouldn't overboil the water or what's worse, reboil the same water again.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's all about the amount of oxygen in it. Water needs to be well-oxygenated to draw appropriate essence from the tea

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.990
as well as suitable flavour so the water that's once been boiled and heated up again 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is reaired and isn't appropriate for brewing good quality tea.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.990
The air or oxyen gets lost during the last boiling stage.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There are three stages of boiling. The first one is when small bubblets of steam start to go up from the bottom and walls of the jug.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.990
Then we can recognize it and it's the first boiling. The next boiling stage lasts a very short time 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.990
and that's what is called white boiling. It's a moment when the water almost starts to get white.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.990
There are so many of those fine bubbles that the water becomes opaque.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.990
Then we should stop boiling. It's almost boiling water, the temperature is definitely too high to brew green tea

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.990
and in that case we need to cool it down a bit to use it 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.990
The last is very strong boiling stage where large bubbles are appearing and bubbling

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and this is the water that loses lots of air, isn't properly airated,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.990
and then it's poor quality for brewing tea.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.990
The water for steeping tea should also have a few qualities.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.990
What I mean here is the water hardness, it should be low or no-carbonated water

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.990
so in other words it should be soft. What's in our pipes is rather poor quality water,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.990
and you can see it by looking how quickly our kettle get scale.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000
That's why we should have some water filters, either big filter jugs or stationery filters.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.990
It's important for them to provide ionic filtration and activated with carbon

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.990
so that's what I'd recommend. But a simple filtering jug will do.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.990
It really works great and the results are much better.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.990
Now, what is also important, at least for the Chinese?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.990
It's the surface tension of the water. It's worth to check it in a very typical way.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Generally the ritual of brewing tea in China, which is Kung Fu Cha, or Gong Fu Cha, you name it,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.990
begins with the presentation of teaware and presentation of the water.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.990
The water is presented by pouring it down into a cup

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.990
full to the brim, 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.990
and next you take a coin. A coin or another flat object. There are some special jadeite circles

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to check the quality of the water. We're using here a Chinese coin to make it more original

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.990
the way that the Chinese pictured it. You need to place it on the surface of the water.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
If it sinks, it means the surface tension of the water is too weak to steep the tea with it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.990
Here we go. The coin is floating on the surface.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.990
And that's the appropriate water to steep our tea.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.990
That's all that we've prepared for you today about water. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.990
