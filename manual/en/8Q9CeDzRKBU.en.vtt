00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:04.600
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:
This is Against the Grain, a series where

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.689
I play strategies and tactics I normally avoid
in Battlefield 4.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.120
Today's challenge is getting knife kills.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.749
Knifing is something I usually avoid.

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:17.300
And with good reason.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.530
For the most part, knifing is an exercise
in frustration.

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:24.240
As I work against the grain today, I'll talk
about my ideas and the ways in which I try

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.130
to overcome this particular challenge.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.000
Let's look at the particularly challenging
aspects of the knife:

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.840
While a knife takedown can be performed from
any direction, if the attacker attempts to

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.760
knife a target from the front 90 degrees,
the counter-knife option appears for the defender.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.469
This usually results in a free kill for the
defender.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.510
Closing the range to any target can be very
dangerous; most every player of any skill

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.250
level is going to kill you if you charge straight
at them.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.670
There's always a chance that the target will
turn around just before an attack, leading

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.399
to some very vexing situations.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.719
So, even if an attacker can close the distance
to the target, it can be a coin flip as to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.250
whether the attacker will succeed.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.159
Because I don't like coin flips, in most situations,
I opt to shoot the target.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:05.159
But not today!

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.619
For my first few attempts, I simply ran with
any loadout I felt like, and tried to get

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.079
in close for those knife kills.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:14.520
Ultimately, I had a few successes, but any
time an enemy spotted me on my way to them,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.780
they would either put me down, or I'd have
to resort to a different weapon.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.940
Obviously frontal attacks are going to be
challenging, so I needed to figure out a way

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.579
to either safely close the distance, or work
my way around.

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:28.570
Since I was doing most of my knifing on the
CTE, I decided to give one of the new gadgets

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.570
a go.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.149
I tried out the Riot Shield for the first
time, and I had mixed results.

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.811
For the most part, the Riot Shield simply
made me an even more obvious target, though

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:40.320
I did have some success with the Riot Shield.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.000
Ultimately I think I would have been better
served by simply bashing my opponents with

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.850
the riot shield rather than trying to get
into a position where I could knife them.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.990
The fact that the Riot Shield made me an even
slower target made this a no-go.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.570
So in addition to safety, in order to close
the distance, I needed speed.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.670
I figured my next best step would be to pick
recon.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.850
I switched to the offensive perk in order
to get the faster sprint.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.740
Additionally, I needed to know where my enemies
were, so I equipped sensors in order to better

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.870
spot my enemies on the minimap.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.460
I started having a little better luck finding
targets, but the problem I would continually

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.560
run into is that: there were simply too many
enemies to overcome more than a single target.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.040
Any time that there was an enemy that could
see me, I might get my kill, but I would be

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.790
immediately taken down by any nearby enemy.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.550
This happened very, very frequently.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.010
A lot of times being near to an enemy during
a takedown lead to me even being killed in

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.470
the middle of the animation.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.760
And on at least one occasion, I was knifed
myself during my takedown.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.290
But I was making some progress.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.700
With sensors, I was at least able to detect
enemies before they saw me, and outplay them.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.870
That is really the key with the knife; you
have to always outplay your enemy.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.160
There really is no room for error.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.319
Finally, with a bit of speed and good tactical
choices, I was able to get a sense of the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.760
best time to knife.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.709
This worked even when an enemy had detected
me at the last moment.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.200
I figured out that if I could get into that
sweet spot on the side of an enemy, taking

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.239
them down is relatively simple.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.040
Since I play aggressively, most of my knife
kills came from me simply outmaneuvering an

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.920
enemy in a frontal assault.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.189
Then I would juke to the side, and grab their
dogtags from a last-second side attack.

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.680
But there is an alternate strategy I noticed
as well.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.260
If you're very patient, and you find corners
and doorways that enemies frequent, you can

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.480
easily grab dogtag after dogtag from enemies
that pass by.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.550
Keep in mind though, that if you stay in one
spot for too long, they'll come looking for

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.550
you.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.410
So what's the takeaway advice from this Against
the Grain episode?

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.540
If I could tell you one thing, it would be
not to knife in Battlefield 4.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.250
There are just too many ways in which you
can still fail even if you close the distance

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.519
to your target.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.510
But as a last resort, here are some useful
tips:

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.970
Try to be aware of your enemies at all times,
and where their allies are.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.930
If you knife somebody in plain sight of their
ally, you're going to die.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.920
If you find yourself heads-up with an enemy,
juke to the side and knife them.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.940
You stand a much better chance of taking them
down than trying to get behind them, and you're

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.209
almost certainly doomed if you trigger a counter-attack.

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.659
If you can, only ever knife a target that
is relatively stationary, and unaware.

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:08.500
These are easy pickings, but just as satisfying.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.969
Remember YouTube, knifing in Battlefield 4
is like sex.

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.410
Sometimes it can take a while to find the
right partner, but once you get it into somebody,

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.720
it feels great.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.799
Thanks for watching.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.120
