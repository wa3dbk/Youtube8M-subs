00:00:01.064 --> 00:00:03.297
Gwenyth: We're inspired by
women who have restarted

00:00:03.297 --> 00:00:06.043
their lives using health and fitness.

00:00:06.043 --> 00:00:07.221
We hope you are, too.

00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:14.023
(lively music)

00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:14.990
I'm Gwenyth Paltrow.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.356
Tracy: And I'm Tracy Anderson.

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:19.824
Gwenyth: This is The Restart Project.

00:00:19.824 --> 00:00:21.478
(calm music)

00:00:21.478 --> 00:00:22.014
Kitty: Hi.

00:00:22.014 --> 00:00:24.870
Katie: Hi, I'm Katie.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.558
Kitty: Hi, I'm Kitty, nice to meet you.

00:00:26.558 --> 00:00:27.615
Katie: Nice to meet you.

00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.370
Gwenyth: Katie's story is about
finding the internal strength

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.191
at a very young age to overcome a disease

00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:35.790
that cripples many of
the people who have it.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.470
Kitty: So, I'm going to set
a little contemporary piece

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.983
I think will really showcase
you and challenge you.

00:00:40.983 --> 00:00:41.646
Katie: All right.

00:00:41.646 --> 00:00:43.649
Kitty: Okay.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.862
Katie: As a kid, all I wanted
to do was be a ballerina.

00:00:47.862 --> 00:00:49.893
I was always in dance
recitals right in the front,

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:53.274
because I just loved it so much.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:57.178
It was just my whole life.

00:00:58.366 --> 00:01:01.509
Then, when I was 14, I had an episode

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:07.114
where my elbow swelled up and
I couldn't bend my joints.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.547
I wasn't even dancing, I
just reached for something.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:14.278
Gwenyth: What did that mean for you,

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:17.054
as a woman who was active and a dancer?

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:19.173
What were your feelings?

00:01:19.173 --> 00:01:22.621
Katie: It was scary, because
it just started in my elbow,

00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:24.903
just like, "Ow, I can't move my elbow,"

00:01:24.903 --> 00:01:26.223
and then it moved to the other elbow

00:01:26.223 --> 00:01:28.173
and then it moved to my fingers
and then it started moving

00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:32.277
all over my whole body and it
progressively just got worse and worse

00:01:32.277 --> 00:01:36.573
until it was at the point
where I couldn't do anything.

00:01:36.573 --> 00:01:37.950
(calm music)

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.159
Of course, my mom's like,
"Okay, we're on this."

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.654
We went from doctor to doctor to doctor.

00:01:45.654 --> 00:01:49.407
Acupuncture, detoxes, I tried everything.

00:01:49.407 --> 00:01:50.783
Nobody could figure out what's going on.

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:53.505
I went undiagnosed for two years.

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:57.412
Over those two years, I was
just getting worse and worse.

00:01:57.412 --> 00:02:00.410
My hands were like claws,
I couldn't turn my head,

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.286
I couldn't drive, I
couldn't brush my hair,

00:02:02.286 --> 00:02:06.574
I couldn't do anything
because my body was immobile.

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:09.477
I would go to dance class
and I would just watch.

00:02:09.477 --> 00:02:12.006
You want something so
bad and it's literally

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:16.131
right in front of your
face and you can't have it.

00:02:16.607 --> 00:02:19.207
I was just a teenager,
so I couldn't understand

00:02:19.207 --> 00:02:22.360
why this was happening to me.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.931
Kitty: Up!

00:02:24.263 --> 00:02:26.991
Longer, longer, longer, like a star.

00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:27.729
There you go.

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:30.713
That's much better, much better, Katie.

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:34.388
Going on from there, five, six, seven -

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:38.987
Katie: Finally, this last
rheumatologist that I went to,

00:02:38.987 --> 00:02:40.532
he was like, "I don't
know why people haven't

00:02:40.532 --> 00:02:41.652
"been able to diagnose you.

00:02:41.652 --> 00:02:43.435
"You have rheumatoid arthritis."

00:02:43.435 --> 00:02:44.901
Kitty: That's better, nice.

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:47.908
Katie: To finally have a
diagnosis was good to know,

00:02:47.908 --> 00:02:50.222
but it was also like a death sentence,

00:02:50.222 --> 00:02:53.553
because he said, "It's chronic,
it's never going to go away.

00:02:53.553 --> 00:02:55.888
"There is no cure."

00:02:56.323 --> 00:02:57.427
Gwenyth: What was that like for you

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:01.238
to have that talent and
know that you were meant

00:03:01.238 --> 00:03:03.108
to be a dancer and a choreographer

00:03:03.108 --> 00:03:06.670
and be physically unable
to execute those things.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.163
Katie: One of the worst
things was they were like,

00:03:08.163 --> 00:03:10.043
"You're going to have to stop dancing

00:03:10.043 --> 00:03:11.716
"and we're going to
give you this wheelchair

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:13.135
"because you're probably going to end - ,"

00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:16.875
and that's when I was like,
"No, no, no, not happening."

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:18.900
If I accept sitting in this
wheelchair, I'm accepting

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.406
that this disease is in
control of me and it's not.

00:03:22.406 --> 00:03:23.948
I'm in control of it.

00:03:23.948 --> 00:03:25.787
(upbeat music)

00:03:25.787 --> 00:03:27.956
The medicine was allowing me to dance,

00:03:27.956 --> 00:03:29.563
but it was artificial.

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:30.971
I knew that even though I was dancing,

00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:36.211
I had to figure out a way to sustain
this for the rest of my life.

00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:39.236
I thought if I use my
mind to control my body

00:03:39.236 --> 00:03:42.227
and say, "You're okay,"
I'm going to make it

00:03:42.227 --> 00:03:45.596
and I'm going to make
myself better that way.

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:48.766
From there, I started
going to the gym a lot

00:03:48.766 --> 00:03:51.212
and changed my diet a
little bit to not eat foods

00:03:51.212 --> 00:03:54.768
that are inflammatory.

00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:58.093
After a while, I got off the steroids

00:03:58.093 --> 00:04:02.591
and by watching what I eat,
by keeping my body moving,

00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.287
keeping my body strong and dancing,

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:08.838
I reversed all damage
in my joints that I had.

00:04:08.838 --> 00:04:10.097
(upbeat music)

00:04:10.097 --> 00:04:12.480
Kitty: Now, what I need
to see is a little more

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.225
pulling something out of the earth.

00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:16.702
Pull it out, shoulder, shoulder, right?

00:04:16.702 --> 00:04:20.032
Not just a dance move, it's about
what you're pulling out of yourself.

00:04:20.032 --> 00:04:23.091
The strength you're pulling out.

00:04:23.712 --> 00:04:24.792
Gwenyth: You're dancing now.

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.093
Katie: I am, I am.

00:04:26.093 --> 00:04:27.038
I'm dancing now.

00:04:27.038 --> 00:04:30.622
I actually had the
opportunity to audition for

00:04:30.622 --> 00:04:33.390
one of the biggest dance companies in LA.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.093
Gwenyth: That's wonderful.

00:04:34.093 --> 00:04:36.341
Katie: Yeah, it's really awesome.

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.752
Gwenyth: And it's incredibly
powerful to move out

00:04:38.752 --> 00:04:42.581
of a victim mentality into
a place of empowerment

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:46.709
and being able to share your
triumph with other people.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:49.677
It's very healing to be able to move

00:04:49.677 --> 00:04:52.877
from that consciousness to the other.

00:04:52.877 --> 00:04:55.521
Katie: Thank you. (laughs)

00:04:55.736 --> 00:04:58.005
I never went in the wheelchair.

00:04:58.005 --> 00:05:01.541
I never used it, because
I knew that this was

00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:02.861
how I was going to live my life.

00:05:02.861 --> 00:05:08.146
I was going to show everyone you
don't have to accept a death sentence.

00:05:08.293 --> 00:05:12.125
I think, in a crazy way,
dancing saved my life.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:17.332
(music continues)

00:05:17.332 --> 23:59:59.999
(electric sound)
