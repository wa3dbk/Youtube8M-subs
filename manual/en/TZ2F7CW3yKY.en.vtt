00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.980
GOOD EVENING, I AM FLETCHER

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.190
MACKEL.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.390
MICKEY LOOMIS AND SEAN

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.390
PAYTON

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.590
ARE ALL ABOUT BIG MOVES, AND

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.590
THEY JUST MADE OUR GOOD PLAY THE

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.460
BIGGEST MOVE IN THEIR CAREERS.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.400
AFTER SLUMPING IN 2014, THEY

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.400
HAVE TRADED JIMMY GRAHAM TO

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.740
SEATTLE AND AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.070
-- IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THEIR

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.440
ROSTER.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.280
SEAN PAYTON WAS ASKED WHAT THE

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.480
TEAM NEEDED, HERE WAS HIS

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.620
ANSWER, --

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.020
AND INSIDE PLAYER,

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.690
OFFENSIVELY.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:48.090
AND NOW HE HAS THAT, AT A

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.660
HEFTY PRICE.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.390
HE HAS TRADED JIMMY GRAHAM TO

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.770
SEATTLE FOR MAX UNGER.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.530
WHEN YOU GET RID OF AN ICON,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.300
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT IT FOR WHAT

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.740
IT IS.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.440
THEY GOT A PRO BOWL CENTER.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.440
A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS I THINK

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.140
THAT DREW HAS HAD WITH HIS

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.550
PASSING GAME HAS BEEN LACK OF

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.650
PROTECTION.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.420
DEUCE MCALLISTER SAYS THAT

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
THE DEAL PROVES TO HIM THAT SEAN

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.560
PAYTON IS OVERHAULING THE ROSTER

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.460
IN A WAY THAT WAS SIMILAR TO

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.530
WHEN HE ARRIVED IN 2006.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.760
WHEN THEY TRADED DANTE

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.700
STALLWORTH, A GUY WHO WAS A

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.470
STARTER, HE HAD IT MADE THE PRO

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.610
BOWL, BUT HE HAD CAUGHT 50 OR

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.510
MORE BALLS THE YEAR BEFORE, WHEN

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.750
HE DID THAT HE MADE -- HE GOT

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.650
THE ATTENTION OF EVERYBODY.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.780
THIS IS A MOVE LIKE THAT.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.780
I THINK MORE SO, THIS IS A

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.680
SHOCK, BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.950
OF WHAT JIMMY MEANS TO THE TEAM.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.550
BUT HE HAS THE ATTENTION OF ANY

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.890
PLAYER.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.770
MIKE MCKENZIE BELIEVES THE

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.500
MOVE TO SEND IT GRAHAM LET

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.670
S

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730
EVERYONE KNOW THAT THE SAINTS

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.700
ARE READY TO PLAY SMASH MOUTH

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.970
FOOTBALL WITH ANY TEAM IN THE

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.910
NFL.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.640
I THINK THE THING IS, THEY

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.340
WANT TO BE A BALANCED TEAM IT IS

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.480
GOOD TO HAVE A BLOCKING TIGHT

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.480
END.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.220
IT IS A STRENGTH AND I THINK,

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.920
UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE INJURIES,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.790
THAT WAS NOT THE CASE OR JIMMY

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.670
BROWN -- JIMMY GRAHAM.
