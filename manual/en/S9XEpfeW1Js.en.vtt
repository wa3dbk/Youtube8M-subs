00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.990
We're at a moment right now when homegrown
energy, like wind energy, is creating new

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.179
jobs all across Iowa and all across the country.
And guess what? Governor Romney said, let's

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.179
end the tax credits for wind energy production.
Let's get rid of them. He said that new sources

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:28.460
of energy, like wind, are imaginary. His running
mate calls them "a fad," but if he wants to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.519
learn something about wind, all he's got to
do is pay attention to what you've been doing

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:44.519
here in Iowa. If he saw what you've been doing,
he'd see that there's places like Newton,

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:51.839
where a few years ago the Maytag plant closed
down, jobs dried up. Folks are now back to

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:57.629
work manufacturing these enormous new towers
and blades for some of the most sophisticated,

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.239
high-tech wind turbines on the planet. The
wind industry now supports 7,000 jobs here

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.239
in Iowa--75,000 jobs across the country. These
jobs aren't a fad, these are good jobs, and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.640
a source of pride that we need to fight for.
And if Governor Romney understood what you've

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.679
been doing he'd know that we'd used to have
to import most of the parts that were used

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.409
for wind turbines. They're now being made
here in America, by American workers, in American

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.560
factories. That's not imaginary, that's real.
That's part of what we're fighting for in

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.439
this election. If he knew what you'd been
doing, he'd know that 20 percent of Iowa's

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.880
electricity now comes from wind, powering
our homes and our factories and our businesses

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:51.159
in a way that is clean and renewable. In fact,
over the past four years we doubled the amount

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.569
of electricity America generates for wind.
Across America we built the equivalent of

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.569
12 new Hoover dams worth of wind energy. Think
about that. Think about that. America now

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:10.539
has enough wind turbines installed to generate
enough electricity, from wind, to power nearly

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.900
13 million homes with clean energy. That's
how we leave something better for the next

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.560
generation. That's worth fighting for. That's
what's at stake right now. So I want to stop

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.400
giving $4 billion in taxpayer subsidies that
are going to oil companies that are making

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.599
huge profits and have been subsidized for
100 years, and let's keep on investing in

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.230
the new homegrown energy that's creating jobs
right here in Iowa. That's a difference in

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.930
this election, that's why I'm running for
president of the United States of America.
