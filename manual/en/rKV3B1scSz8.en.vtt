Now we're moving onto eyeliner on top of the
lid. This is where I'm going to use the powder

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:16.200
wet. I'm just going to dampen my brush with
a little water. Then I'm going to go dip right

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.620
into my powder. I'm going to use the corner
of the powder because you still want to use

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.720
it dry, so you don't want to ruin the whole
powder. Just dip it in the corner and make

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.970
a wet eyeliner. It goes on so much smoother
when it's a little wet and when it's on the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:46.300
brush. We're going to do a definite cat's
eye look. You want to wing it up to a point.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.620
I always like starting at the end of the eye
and working my way in. It's going to be thicker

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:02.749
toward the end and it's going to get thinner
as we go into the eye. You want to make sure

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:10.600
it's a pretty straight line and that it's
nice and blended. This brush works great.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:22.510
It blends so nicely. You want to get as close
to the eyelash as you can. Open. Close. You

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:29.520
can use this dry to. It just won't go on as
nice and it also may dust on the eye too much.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.390
That's real annoying for clean up. Just keep
adding and adding. You can make it bigger.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.170
Open for me. Or smaller. It just all depends
on what you like. Close for me. Then if some

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:57.810
drops, you just take a brush and just swipe
it away. There we go. Now we have the eyeliner.
