00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.400
hi online friends

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:03.790
You're on Toonmilk TV

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.690
I will now present the
new version of manga studio 5

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.139
an update was made lately on the Wacom Cintiq

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.749
Companion with the Windows environment

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:24.330
I'll do a quick overview of the new features
that have been added

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.900
in this update that was missing in the old
version

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.170
certain features of Manga Studio 4 missing

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.930
and they were finally
added

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.960
So when the environment is
different

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.490
Since now the icons are large enough to click
on the finger

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.160
As you can see , it's Manga Studio 5.0.3

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.610
The Touch features Windows enabled. You must
implement this option

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.700
in preferences in this particular location.
Choice : size standard or wide interface.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.200
As you can see, to touch the icons are sufficiently
wide

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.420
They also added the ability to zoom in or
zoom out with fingers

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.600
rotation and displacement of the workspace

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.900
Here is obviously configurable Express Keys

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.049
For me, CTRL , ALT and SHIFT

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200
which will make some even faster manipulation

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.529
They added the Ruler

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.260
this option was in Manga Studio 4 but

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.480
not included in either version 5

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.870
Option (tool) quite handy since it decline
with this

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.349
symmetry tool

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.400
Which for my part I missed in comparison with
other programs

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.969
* SketchUp is a 3D
forgiveness , the two names are close enough

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:11.260
As SketchBook Pro

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.749
Quickly here's another pretty handy tool

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.639
This is another kind of ruler.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.279
This time you can draw a shape with a drawing
tool

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.949
you will follow the predefined shape

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:11.079
As you can see the workspace is large enough
.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.480
especially as the Wacom Cintiq Companion has a screen of 13 " 3

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.560
the last thing that was added

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.060
and lacking in my opinion

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.539
it was the ability to manage the shadow on
3D objects

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:49.789
I will show you that this single character

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.759
As you can see you can rotate the camera

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.300
Touch with the Windows function

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:14.330
and by this new option : " Light Source " that
allows you

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.770
to shift its orientation.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:45.400
Again you can see the
fluidity

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:47.770
the Wacom Companion

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.879
That this brief presentation is complete

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.169
Thank you for having followed . Feel free
to " liker " .

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:03.379
I say to you very soon for a new video. goodbye
