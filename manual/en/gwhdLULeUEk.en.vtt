00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:12.350
The next painting from Gustav Klimt is Amalie
Zuckerkandl, it's a portrait of her, and this

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:24.960
is an unfinished portrait by him, because
of his death. Amalie Zuckerkandl was the friend

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:35.640
of Teresa Bloch-Bauer, and it's important
because the family, Bloch-Bauer was one of

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:48.170
the patrons of Klimt, and this painting was
paid by Mr. Bloch-Bauer, so to say he invited

00:00:48.170 --> 00:01:00.640
the friend of his wife for this portrait which
was never finished. The interesting thing

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:11.610
about the painting is that the woman facing
to the viewer exactly and so she's sitting

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:26.229
in the middle of the painting, so it's a frontal
portrait which was very popular in that time.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:36.479
And we know a lot painting, lots of portraits
from Klimt as well in this composition. What

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:48.090
we can see that the light colors which he
used, it's really, it's characteristic for

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:01.270
his past years, and it was made in 1917, began
in 1917, and the sharp outline is what he

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:13.319
used to isolate the woman from the background.
But it's, how to say, unfortunately, he didn't

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:24.430
finish it, so we could see from this painting
that he used light colors as well, not only

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.880
deep golden or dark colors.
