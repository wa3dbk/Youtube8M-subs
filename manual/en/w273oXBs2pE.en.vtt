00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:08.580
[Music]

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.120
The Garden Planner makes it simple to
remember when to sow and plant

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.300
each vegetable in your garden.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.260
The planting dates are all calculated for your particular area.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.780
On the Garden Planner tab you can click
this button to set your location

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.620
(the map will be different depending on
the country you live in)

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:31.380
and search for your garden.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.660
You can drag the marker, or search again if you need to locate your garden more accurately.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.519
Click the Find My Frost Dates button and
the system looks up your frost dates

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.339
from our database of thousands of weather
stations,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.940
which you can then adjust if necessary, or you can set them manually

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.980
if our database doesn't yet have the weather station data for your area.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.219
These dates are then used by the
software to calculate the recommended

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.919
planting times for all your vegetables.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.940
In places that get so hot that some
crops can't be grown through the summer,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.280
you will need to select the Split Season
option.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.940
This divides the growing season into separate spring and fall planting times for plants that need it.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.280
Once you've set your frost dates and your plan is complete,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.900
you just click the Plant List button and it calculates how many of each plant you need,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.260
how to space them, and recommended dates.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.900
Note that if you live in the Southern
hemisphere,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.010
then the growing year will start in July,
rather than January.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.620
The blue bars show when you can start seeds indoors or undercover, for example in a greenhouse.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.700
The green bars show when you should transfer these plants into the ground,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.040
or sow seed directly into the soil.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.380
You'll notice that some plants don't have
blue lines,

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.720
because they're usually sown outside rather than being started in pots.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.800
The orange bars show the expected range of harvest dates.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.440
If on your Plant List you only see a harvest bar, but no green planting bar,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.540
it means that you probably don't have a long
enough growing season to grow that plant,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.140
unless you extend it with something like
a greenhouse.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.260
If you want to define your own dates, then you can do this by adding your own custom varieties

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.560
as shown on our Adding Plants &amp; Varieties video.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.320
Not only do you get a full planting chart for each garden plan,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.380
but you will also
receive email reminders twice a month

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.370
listing what you need to sow and plant in
the next 2 weeks

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.440
from all your plans for the current year.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.760
Like the Plant List, these are customized
to your area

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.260
so they contain a very useful summary to
keep your garden on track.
