("Dio e Zingaro" by Municipale Balcanica)

00:00:07.083 --> 00:00:08.104
- Hi, I'm Jerry James Stone.

00:00:08.104 --> 00:00:09.839
I'm here at the Alexander Valley Bar

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:11.499
at the Medlock Ames Tasting Room,

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:13.402
and I'm with Hannah and Kirsty,

00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:14.324
and today we're going to be making

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:16.765
some great cocktails
with fresh ingredients

00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.588
that they grow right here.

00:00:18.588 --> 00:00:20.225
The first drink I think
we're going to make

00:00:20.225 --> 00:00:21.878
is actually a margarita, correct?

00:00:21.878 --> 00:00:24.281
- Correct. It's a spicy margarita.

00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:25.142
- What are some of the ingredients

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:26.544
that we have in this margarita?

00:00:26.544 --> 00:00:28.574
- So, we first have our cilantro,

00:00:28.574 --> 00:00:30.820
some serrano peppers, jalapenos,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.634
and a fresh squeezed lime,
agave nectar, and tequila.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.077
- Sounds great.

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:38.347
This is also your most popular drink

00:00:38.347 --> 00:00:39.815
here at the Tasting Room.

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:40.654
- It is.

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:42.129
We've tried to take it
off the list a few times,

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:43.968
and it keeps coming back.

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:44.895
(laughter)

00:00:44.895 --> 00:00:46.565
- Great. Well, let's get started.

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:47.784
- Okay.

00:00:47.784 --> 00:00:50.677
So, first we're going to put in

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:55.228
about four or five freshly cut peppers.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.233
And a big bunch of cilantro.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.552
Next we're going to add a half ounce

00:01:04.552 --> 00:01:06.891
of fresh squeezed lime juice.

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:12.751
And a nice, big dash of agave nectar.

00:01:14.448 --> 00:01:17.764
And about 1.5 ounces of tequila.

00:01:18.947 --> 00:01:19.788
- Or more if you like.

00:01:19.788 --> 00:01:21.549
- Or more, would you like more?

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.113
- Sure.
(laughter)

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:24.989
- Two ounces.
(laughter)

00:01:27.989 --> 00:01:31.355
Then we're going to
shake it nice and hard.

00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:33.163
So it's all herbed up.

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:39.986
We're gonna put it in a
salted highball glass.

00:01:41.566 --> 00:01:42.729
- If someone asks, we're just taking

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.244
a half of the lime wedge.

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:48.999
And makes the salt stick.

00:01:58.761 --> 00:02:01.387
- We're going to top it
with just a dash to fill it.

00:02:02.317 --> 00:02:05.083
And this is where we garnish
it with our jalapeno.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.203
We got a jalapeno for some color.

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:13.950
And there you go.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.968
Thank you, guys.
