How to Knit Fingerless Gloves.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.260
Let's be frank—knitted fingerless gloves
aren't really about keeping your palms warm

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.790
and your fingers free...

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.200
They're about looking rad.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.509
You will need Size 9 knitting needles A ball
or skein of bulky, worsted weight yarn A yarn

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.500
needle And a pair of scissors and a row counter
(optional).

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.500
Step 1.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.920
Tie a slipknot, leaving an 8-inch tail of
yarn after it, and cast on 24 stitches.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.920
Step 2.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.260
Knit 15 rows of two-by-two rib stitch – knitting
two stitches, purling two stitches, etc.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.079
Using a row counter makes it easier to keep
track of how many rows you've finished.

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.320
Step 3.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.739
Knit 12 rows in stockinette stitch – alternating
between a knit row, then a purl row, etc.

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.960
You should be ending on a purl row.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.960
Step 4.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.560
Knit 4 rows in rib stitch again.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.430
Step 5.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.090
Cast off and cut the yarn, again leaving an
8-inch tail.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.210
Tie a knot in the tail.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.090
To keep the wrist opening stretchy enough
to get your hand through, be sure to cast

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.540
off in rib stitch.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.570
Step 6.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.580
Fold the piece in half so that the knitted
side—the side covered in little V's—is

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.560
on the inside and the edges are lined up.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.560
Step 7.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.010
Starting at the top, finger-end of the glove
(where there are 4 rows of rib stitching),

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.950
use a yarn needle and the knotted tail of
yarn to sew about 2 inches of the edges together.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.500
Cut off the yarn, leaving a shorter tail of
about 2 inches—but don't knot it.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Step 8.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.020
Starting at the bottom, wrist-end of the glove
(where there are 15 rows of rib stitching),

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.320
use the yarn needle and the other knotted
tail of yarn to sew about 3 inches of the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.810
edges together.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.730
You should be left with a hole—for the thumb
opening—in the middle your sewn edge.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.050
Step 9.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.340
Put your hand in the glove with your thumb
sticking out of the hole.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.810
If it needs to be bigger, take out a stitch
or two until it fits.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.290
If it needs to be smaller, make another stitch
or two.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.500
Now finish off the two sewn ends—knot the
yarn, cut off the excess, and weave in your

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.030
loose ends.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.030
Step 10.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.550
Turn the glove inside out and—tah-dah!—you've
just finished half your pair.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.270
Repeat the entire process for a second glove,
or just rock one for that vintage '80s look.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.170
Did you know Although Madonna "single-handedly"
re-popularized them in the early 1980s, lace

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.850
fingerless gloves were originally a fashion
trend in the early 1860s.
