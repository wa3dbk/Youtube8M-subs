00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.930
Director Peter Hyams brought us this thrilling
sci-fi action film in September of 1994, based

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.769
on a story from Dark Horse Comics by Mike
Richardson and Mark Verheiden.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.890
This is one of those rare, and wonderful movies
where the entire concept is laid out right

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.890
in the title...

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.890
"TimeCop".

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.940
Indeed, Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as a time
traveling police officer in the futuristic

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.360
year of 2004, who is sent back a decade to
prevent his wife's death, and to stop Ron

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.050
Silver from meddling with the timeline for
his own personal gain.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.960
Van Damme remarks on this aggravating predicament,
"If I can't go back to save her; this scumbag

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.540
is not going back to steal money."

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.870
Despite it's rather ambitious premise, this
98-minute remains JCVD's highest grossing

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.329
film as a lead-actor, earning over $100 million
against its $27 million dollar budget.

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.330
Eventually, it spawned a nine-episode TV series,
a Super Nintendo video game, and a direct-to-DVD

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.330
sequel.

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.490
Keeping with tradition, the Belgian-born actor
once again strips completely nude to show

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.980
off that chiseled body of his, and isn't afraid
to poke fun at his strong French accent - and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.300
on the acting side of things, he's expectedly
less than impressive.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.549
Silver however is perfectly evil and conniving
as the time-tempering politician who wants

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.780
to rule the world, and familiar character
actor Bruce McGill is also great as a trusty

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.700
temporal police chief - a role very similar
to his guest appearance on Star Trek: Voyager

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.909
a few years later.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.429
Mia Sara is featured as the wife, but spends
more of her time wearing shoulder pads and

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:22.030
looking confused than really contributing
to the plot.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.479
On the plus side, Ferris Bueller old girlfriend
does go topless in one scene.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.889
Showing off his split-kicks, and martial arts
skills, the title character attempts to 'put

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:33.009
right' which others made wrong, as the R-rated
story remains interesting and entertaining

00:01:33.009 --> 00:02:10.700
throughout.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.650
While the visual effects used to create time-travel
look like a hokey web-cam effect, the rest

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.550
of the production design, costumes, and art
direction is pretty solid: bringing to life

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.659
a well-imagined, if overly optimistic version
of the future.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.459
Plus, scenes where characters interact with
older versions of themselves are decently

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.459
convincing.

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.689
The score from Mark Isham is typical 90's
action fare, with bombastic overtones emphasizing

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:32.159
the high-octane fist-fights and gun-play.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.379
Side-stepping some plot holes and inconsistencies,
the movie exits with a truly explosive bang,

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.219
and should leave most audiences smiling.

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:42.510
A familiar and flawed adventure that doesn't
really have any morals or themes to impart,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.390
this picture is still very enjoyable on multiple
viewings.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.319
"Timecop", "Intriguing premise around exciting
action."

00:02:48.319 --> 00:03:03.260
Let's check out the comments now to read some
of your reviews.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.090
Our ratings for "Timecop"... a SIX and a SEVEN.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.100
Despite its sci-fi premise, you were critical
of this film, and rated it an ALRIGHT.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.430
As far as time travel films go, this isn't
one of the better ones... it is however a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.150
high-water mark for JCVD, and I actually think
it's COOL.
