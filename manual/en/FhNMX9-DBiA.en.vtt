00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.279
Hi, I’m Lucy Ellis, HP’s WW ProLiant on Windows Marketing Manager.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.900
Today in this session of Coffee Coaching I’m going to review

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.460
“What’s New with Microsoft Windows Server 2012” editions and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.529
licensing.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.199
First of all – let’s look at the new editions that are available with

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.560
Windows Server 2012.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
we have -  foundation, essentials, standard and datacenter

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.120
Replacing Windows Server 2008 R2 Foundation edition is the new

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.300
Windows Server 2012

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.610
Foundation Edition.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.600
Foundation is the Entry Level, Cost Effective edition for a small business

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
that is looking for secure networking, file/Print sharing,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.280
or a  platform for database and business applications -  all at an affordable price.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.520
It has a limitation of 15 user access rights.  No additional CALS are required.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.980
Windows Server 2012 Essentials edition is the replacement edition for Microsoft Small

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.299
Business Server 2011

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:04.770
Essentials edition.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.400
Essentials edition is an ideal first server for a small business.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.740
It offers the same capabilities as Foundation

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.850
for up to 25 users,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.380
and it also includes simplified management

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.330
plus the ability to seamlessly connect to cloud services.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.090
Like Foundation, no additional CALs are required for Essentials.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.780
Windows Server 2012 Standard edition replaces

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.040
Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard edition;

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.180
however, you’ll see shortly how the features and licensing model have changed compared

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.159
to the 2008 R2 version.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.170
Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise edition does not have a replacement

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.750
product in the Windows Server 2012 family.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.800
Completing the Windows Server 2012 family is the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.040
Datacenter edition,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.640
which replaces Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.140
Unlike the Standard and Datacenter editions of Windows Server 2008 R2,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.150
with Windows Server 2012 the Standard and Datacenter

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.049
editions’ features are identical,

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.890
and both are

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.409
licensed the same: per-processor plus CALs.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.819
The Difference between Windows Server 2012 Standard and Datacenter is

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.649
based on virtualization,

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:24.329
for example:
• Standard Edition, 2 CPU offering has 2 VM’s per license

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.979
•Datacenter Edition, 2 CPU offering has Unlimited Virtual Management

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.719
With regards to Virtualization, let’s review the virtualization rights by

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.209
edition in the Windows Server 2012 Product family:

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.629
Foundation has No Virtualization – It  Cannot be virtualized as a guest OS and cannot

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.069
be used as a virtualization host OS

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.180
Essentials has LIMITED Virtualization.  It can be virtualized as a guest OS

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.239
but cannot be used as a virtualization host OS

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.249
Standard – has Virtual User Rights: Each 2-proc license includes the

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.349
license for up to two VM Instances,

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.250
and you can “stack” more than one Standard license on a server to gain additional

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.469
-VM rights.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.930
Datacenter 2012 includes Unlimited Virtualization rights, just like

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.109
the current Datacenter edition of Windows Server 2008 R2.

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.120
Next let’s cover the Windows Server 2012 hardware restrictions by edition

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.829
and licensing changes:

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.249
Windows Server 2012 Foundation edition is limited to one

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.629
processor.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.509
Foundation edition licensing model has not changed.  It is a

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.759
per server model.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.079
Essentials edition is up to two processors ONLY; Essentials edition

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.759
licensing model has not changed.  It is also a per server model.

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:53.159
As I mentioned, Windows Server 2012 Standard is now licensed per-

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.749
processor like Datacenter. The base license provides support for

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.949
up to 2 processors , and you can “stack” additional licenses

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.019
to run Standard on servers with more than 2 processors.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.889
Datacenter licensing for Windows Server 2012 is still by processer –

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.510
there are up to 2 processors

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.939
per license.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.319
I’ve mentioned a couple of times how you might “stack” more than one license for Standard

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.769
on a server.

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.190
To enable this, there is now a new standard edition license called the

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.940
“additive license” that

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.740
allows you to add additional licenses when your server has a need for

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.720
more CPU’s or more Virtual Instances.  As with any HP OEM license

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.440
for Windows Server, an HP OEM “additive license” for

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440
Windows Server 2012

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.050
may also only be sold to an end user on a new HP ProLiant server. This means you need to know

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.310
the customer requirements

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.660
for CPU and Virtual Instances.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.340
For example, if you know your customer is buying a 4 CPU solution – OR – if you

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.030
know your customer needs 4 VMS, you will need to sell the base license

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.990
and the additive license.  HP OEM product naming will have “additive”

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.870
or “add” in the name of the product

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.700
to help you identify this for Preinstall and

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.809
NPI editions.

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.610
For ROK sales,

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.849
double up on the base offerings to cover your additive licensing requirements.

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.619
If growth in capacity and virtualization occurs after the purchase of your

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.240
customers’ new ProLiant

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.520
and HP OEM license purchase,

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.020
the additive licenses will be available from Microsoft.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.199
Another change with Standard edition OEM licensing for Windows Server 2012 is that

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.249
CAL’s

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.649
are no longer part of the packaged offering.

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:47.469
With Windows Server 2008 R2, Standard edition came

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.060
with 5 CALs.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.790
The Windows Server 2012 Standard edition has no CALs; therefore,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.839
you will need to purchase your HP OEM device or user CALs separately.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:03.059
Datacenter edition is the virtualization optimized edition and

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:06.430
offers Unlimited virtual Instances.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.389
Like the Standard edition offering, there is an additive license for each

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.879
additional 2 CPUs.

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.430
And CALS are sold separately as well.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.770
And some final comments on licensing – there is a Single Product Key per edition

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.169
for activation.

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.389
And Microsoft will now offer a consistent Downgrade Product offerings

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.289
across Volume and OEM offerings.

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.210
HP offers a wide variety

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:41.169
of ProLiant Platforms from the MicroServer ,Tower (ML), Rack (DL), Blade (BL) and

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.060
Scale out (SL)

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.960
that are certified for the Windows Server 2012 family.

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.460
Certification of HP ProLiant Generation 7 and 8 platforms can be

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.159
found

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.509
on the Microsoft Windows Server Catalog

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:59.129
or listing of ProLiant Server by edition at HP’s website:  www.hp.com/go/wincert

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:03.869
