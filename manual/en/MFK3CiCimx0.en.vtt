The President: You know
what, Zach, it's no fun.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.734
I mean I have to say
when I heard that people

actually watch this show,

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.734
I was actually pretty surprised.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:52.467
Zach Galifianakis: Hi.

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:54.533
So do you go to any

Is this what they
mean by drones?

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.200
The President: The point
is that a lot of young

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.433
people, they think
they're invincible.

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:16.700

not only good for them and
their families,

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:23.800
