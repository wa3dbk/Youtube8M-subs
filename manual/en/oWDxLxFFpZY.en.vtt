00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.790
How to combine Irish Step Dancing moves into
a beginner routine.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.990
Once you have mastered a certain number of
Irish Dance movements, you'll have acquired

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.830
a vocabulary.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.430
Now it is time to take that vocabulary and
put it into a sequence.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.930
You can think of this, your vocabulary, as
being letters and your sequence as being words.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.220
So we are writing or choreographing a beginner
Irish Dance routine.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:40.000
In this example we'll use three of our basic
Irish Dance moves, the first being skips,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.780
which we'll demonstrate for you here.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.710
A series of three skips.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.440
And one-two-three, two-two-three, three-two-three.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.820
We will also use point hop backs a series
of two which we'll demonstrate for you here:

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.530
and point hop back, point hop back.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.600
We will also use the side seven.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.360
In this instance traveling to the right side.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.890
We'll demonstrate that for you here.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.259
And hop two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:22.990
Taking those three basic Irish Dance vocabulary
moves, the skips, point hop backs, and the

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.710
side sevens we'll now create them in a routine.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.780
We'll begin by doing four skips in a circle
around oneself.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.649
And hop one-two-three, hop two-two-three,
hop three-two-three, hop four-two-three.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.149
We'll add on two hop backs on the right foot
first.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.680
And point hop back, point hop back.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.119
We'll finish with a side sevens traveling
to the right.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.079
Cut two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.850
This completes our sequence and gives us eight
bars or eight counts of music.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.560
We'll demonstrate that sequence more fluidly
for you now and I will count us in for eight.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.430
Ready and it's one-two-three, two-two-three,
three-two-three, four-two-three, five-two-three,

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.480
six-two-three, seven-two-three, and eight-two-three.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.700
That completes a beginner routine on the right
side.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.450
In Irish Dance to choreograph a step we always
do eight bars on the right side and flip it

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.060
to match it symmetrically with eight bars
on the left side.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.150
We'll now demonstrate that same sequence of
moves on the left side beginning with the

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.590
left foot for the skips in a circle around
oneself.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.950
And hop one-two-three, hop two-two-three,
hop three-two-three, hop four-two-three.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.120
Two point hop backs, starting with the left
side sevens, traveling left.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.810
We'll now count that on the left side.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:11.019
Ready and hop one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:19.870
Finally we'll demonstrate the beginner routine
on both right and left with no interruption.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:33.290
Counting in total and one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight to the left hop one,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:41.840
and two, and three, four, five, six, seven,
eight.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.209
That is one example of how to do a beginner
routine in Irish Dance.
