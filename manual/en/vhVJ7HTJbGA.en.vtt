00:00:01.252 --> 00:00:04.005
(Tywin) On the far western coast
of the continent,

00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:07.967
high atop a rocky promontory
overlooking the Sunset Sea,

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.969
sits Casterly Rock -

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:13.180
ancestral seat of House Lannister.

00:00:13.264 --> 00:00:17.184
Below it lies Lannisport -
one of the great cities of Westeros -

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:22.773
a center for trade, culture,
and the great Lannister fleet.

00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:26.694
There are a number of gold
and silver mines in the Westerlands,

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:30.614
making it the richest region
in all of Westeros.

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:34.827
One of the most productive mines
lies beneath Casterly Rock itself,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.540
making House Lannister
the wealthiest of all the noble houses.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:42.626
This allows House Lannister
to finance many endeavors

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.545
of other noble houses.

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:49.675
Even the king himself has sought credit
from Casterly Rock from time to time.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:54.055
We Lannisters claim our descent
from the Andal invaders

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:58.142
and through the female bloodline
Lann the Clever.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:00:59.769
According to the legend,

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:01.729
Lann, using only his wits,

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:05.232
won Casterly Rock
from the noble house of Casterly

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:07.902
during the Age of Heroes.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.071
The Lannisters reigned
as Kings of the Rock

00:01:10.154 --> 00:01:11.739
for thousands of years,

00:01:11.822 --> 00:01:16.619
and worked to make it the envy
of the rest of the Seven Kingdoms.

00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:19.080
Our time as kings ended, however,

00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:20.915
when Aegon Targaryen -

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:23.584
otherwise known
as Aegon the Conqueror -

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.462
arrived in Westeros with his army.

00:01:26.545 --> 00:01:29.882
The last King of the Rock,
King Loren Lannister,

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:34.220
joined forces with King Mern Gardener,
the King of the Reach.

00:01:34.303 --> 00:01:36.597
Together, with 60,000 men,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.226
they met the Targaryen host
in open battle.

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:45.439
History tells us that Aegon
unleashed all three of his dragons,

00:01:45.523 --> 00:01:47.858
slaughtering 4,000 men,

00:01:47.942 --> 00:01:52.113
at what came to be known
as the Field of Fire.

00:01:52.196 --> 00:01:55.324
King Mern himself
was burned alive that day,

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:59.286
and House Gardener
turned to ash with him.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.668
Seeing both the threat and opportunity
the Targaryens represented,

00:02:05.751 --> 00:02:07.962
Loren wisely surrendered,

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:12.675
and aided Aegon
in his further conquest of Westeros.

00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:17.805
The Lannisters were thus appointed
Lords Paramount of the Westerlands

00:02:17.888 --> 00:02:20.182
and Wardens of the West -

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.852
titles we hold to this day.

00:02:24.186 --> 00:02:25.980
Let us be clear, though -

00:02:26.063 --> 00:02:28.566
it is neither luck, nor royal favor,

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:31.068
that makes our house prosperous.

00:02:31.944 --> 00:02:33.988
There have been times in our history

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:39.076
where some have thought us weak,
lazy or opulent.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.495
My father, Tytos Lannister,

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.999
nearly bankrupted our house
with his poor investments,

00:02:45.082 --> 00:02:49.211
and allowed himself
to be mocked openly at court.

00:02:49.295 --> 00:02:51.922
When our vassal,
the Reynes of Castamere,

00:02:52.006 --> 00:02:54.633
dared to rise up against the Lannisters,

00:02:54.717 --> 00:02:58.846
they learned how dangerous it can be
to taunt a lion.

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:02.641
I, Tywin Lannister,
led the assault on Castamere

00:03:02.725 --> 00:03:05.019
to put down this rebellion.

00:03:05.102 --> 00:03:07.271
I made an example of them,

00:03:07.354 --> 00:03:10.524
to anyone who doubts our might.

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:14.862
They even made a quaint song about
the fates of the Reynes of Castamere.

00:03:14.945 --> 00:03:18.991
Sadly, there are no Reynes left
to hear it.

00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:21.368
Today, the Golden Lion of Lannister

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:26.290
is rightly admired and feared
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

00:03:26.373 --> 00:03:28.709
Our words are...

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:31.712
"Hear me roar."

00:03:31.795 --> 00:03:34.256
But there are other words
that should be remembered

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.551
when crossing a Lion of Casterly Rock -

00:03:37.635 --> 00:03:41.138
"A Lannister always pays his debts."
