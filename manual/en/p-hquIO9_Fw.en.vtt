Hey guys, welcome to Nyonya Cooking!

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.020
Today's recipe is an omelette recipe

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.300
It is also a popular 'nyonya' dish

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.600
This is fried egg with 'cincalok'

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.100
Now, what is 'cincalok'?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.000
'Cincalok' is basically little shrimps which are then fermented in salt

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.820
So, I am going to tell you more about 'cincalok' later

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.800
For now, let's see the ingredients to prepare this dish

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.700
So, of course, we'll need eggs

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.800
I have here 4 eggs and then, one brown onion which I'd already sliced

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.300
and just 1 tablespoon of oil

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.300
Not to forget, just to add some taste,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.600
we'll just use a bit of white pepper

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.800
The star of this dish is these little, tiny shrimps

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.600
Now, I tried to get 'cincalok' all over... in Germany, London, Amsterdam

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.000
but...no, I couldn't find any

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.100
I came to this thing called 'bagoong alamang'

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.800
It is very similar to 'cincalok' but it comes from the Philipines

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.200
So, it is slightly saltier

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.600
I'd tried this

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.400
It gives a taste like 'cincalok'

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.800
If you can find 'cincalok', of course that's the best for this dish

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.400
Since I can't find it, I'm going to just use 'bagoong alamang'

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.000
I will start with the eggs first

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.060
We have to separate the egg yolks and the egg whites

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.700
So, the first step is to beat the whites of the eggs

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.800
Just beat it until it's slightly bubbly

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.800
Then, beat the egg yolks

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.400
After beating the egg yolks, you can then add it to the egg whites

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.200
Just give everything a good mix

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.900
This is when we add oil and of course, the onions

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.700
Do not forget to add a dash of pepper

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.500
and of course, the 'cincalok' or in this case, it's 'bagoong alamang'

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.300
So, if you're using 'cincalok', you may use 2 tablespoons of 'cincalok'

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.400
In this case, because i have 'bagoong alamang'

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.600
I will need to cut down to 1 tablespoon because it's very much saltier

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.000
Now that I have the pan heated up,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.600
you can cook this in a non-stick pan

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.000
If not, you'll need some more oil because you wouldn't want the fried egg to stick to the pan

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.000
Therefore, you need to use more oil

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.100
So, make sure everything is here...evenly spread it out now

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.700
Now that you see that the sides are cooked, it's time to just flip the egg

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.600
So, carefully...from the edge...

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.600
You're going to bring this up

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.000
When that's done, so...that's all

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.400
It's time to transfer the fried egg to the plate

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.300
and we are done

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.800
This is our fried egg with 'cincalok'

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.700
It really looks like just another omelette but trust me

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.600
Just from the smell... the taste...you'll be surprised

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.900
So, try this recipe and let me know what you think

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.600
