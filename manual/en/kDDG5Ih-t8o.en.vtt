00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.450
Okay, so a new country, a new taste test.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.840
We are in South Africa right now and you can't
come to this country and not try Biltong.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.640
So that is what I have right here in this
brown paper bag.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:21.040
So Biltong is a dried cured meat similar to
beef jerky and this is what it looks like.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.119
So we got ourselves some beef biltong but
apparently you can get different kinds of

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.119
meats.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.280
Like game meat or ostrich.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.790
This is cow.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:39.850
And it is quite hard and chewy but it makes
a really nice snack, so let's say you're riding

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.329
the bus or going on a really long trip it
is kind of nice to just have a bag full and

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.640
be munching away.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.079
That's what we have been doing for the past
few days.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.170
So for me Biltong is kind of like premium
jerky.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.260
And there is three key differences.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.780
First off, it is sliced a lot thicker.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.700
Secondly, they use vinegar in the curing process
along with salt and pepper.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.290
Which is a little bit different from regular
jerky which doesn't have any vinegar whatsoever.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.569
And the third key difference is Biltong is
not smoked whereas jerky is.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.599
Okay, so the purchasing process?

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:24.429
What was awesome is that we went into a kind
of like what would be considered a deli that

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:25.990
specialized in Biltong.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.979
And when we went in there was all of these
different kinds of dried meat hanging up in

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:31.979
different sections.

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.450
There was one that was game meat, there was
one that was regular, there was a premium

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.450
kind.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.450
I can't remember but there was a forth kind
as well.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.520
And anyways, what you would do is pick this
meat off of a hook and bring it over to these

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.279
ladies who would then put it through a grinder
and it would go into this bag like that.

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.649
So it was a really cool to be right there
involved in the process.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.020
And it just made it a lot more special.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.880
And the other thing that I really noticed
that was a big difference is that the quality

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.270
of the actual meat itself is a lot better
than what comes from say packaged pre-packed

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.479
stuff you would find in a store.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.750
So the word Biltong.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.750
What does it mean?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.420
I actually had to look this up but now I can
tell you.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.460
So 'Bil' apparently comes from the Dutch word
for rump and 'Tong' means strip or tongue.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.209
But contrary to popular belief Biltong is
not made from bull's tongue, so don't be afraid

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.010
to try it because of that.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.520
What have you got in your hand over there?

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.150
Okay, and last but not least we have something
called Cabanossi which kind of looks like

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.790
a dried pepperoni stick.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.400
We also picked this up at the same store we
got the Biltong.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.629
So I'm going to try that.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:51.120
Yeah, so it is kind of like a greasy salami
stick.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.069
Again, chewy, salty, flavorful.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.890
I think it makes a great snack.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.890
Which one do you like better?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.510
Or do you like them both?

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.640
I do like them both but this reminds me of
salami or like a pepperoni stick so it is

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.359
something I am familiar with.

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.400
So I quite enjoy the flavor.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.340
One more bite.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.049
So when you're visiting South Africa, unless
of course you're a vegetarian, be sure to

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.049
try Biltong.

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.970
I swear it is pretty much addicting.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.930
I can't seem to stop myself over here.
