00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:07.720
This is Marko Vovk from www.houseinvestigations.com.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.530
If your basement leaks, has stains, mold,
or musty odors the first person to call may

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.549
not be your local waterproofer.

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.410
Weather they waterproof from the exterior
or interior it will be expensive and it may

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.609
not be necessary.

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:29.119
Many water proofers have pressure sales tactics
that require you and your spouse to be present

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.310
so they can get a signed contract.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.620
In addition, if you do not have the funds
they will process pay pal, credit cards, debit

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.330
cards, and may even barter for your gold and
silver coins.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.840
If they see that you are getting cold feet
they pull out the mold card and tell you that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.210
mold will make you sick.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.690
Sometimes they may tell you to waterproof
now or your home is going collapse, deteriorate,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:58.370
crack, settle and loose its value.They also
have great pitches like "We just happen to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.030
have a have a crew available this week and
we can give you a huge discount or if you

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.280
sign today we will through-in an air cleaner
valued at $1000 that is supposed to clean

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.220
and dehumidify your home.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.010
Let's face it, the only contraption you need
is a basement standard de-humidifier that

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.620
you can buy for less than 300 dollars.The
first thing you should do is analysis the

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.450
problem yourself or you may also want to get
third party non-bias opinion.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.630
Good people for this type of inspection are
seasoned home inspectors that may be ASHI

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.560
members with thousands of home inspections
under their belts.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.160
They are also probably are more familiar with
the better and safer waterproofer in your

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.880
area.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.110
Expect to pay a couple hundred dollars for
this opinion.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.280
In the Cleveland area, you can call Marko
Vovk.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.920
The first thing, determine if the moisture
stains or leaks are high or low.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.159
If the leaks, stains, or mold are in the upper
portion of your basement walls it may mean

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.220
you have poor grading, or a dirty, plugged
gutter or downspout.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.560
It may be a loose downspout or sump pump connections
that may be located only several feet underground.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.460
Additionally, it could be a leaking hose Bibb
or a sprinkler head located very closes to

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.460
the foundation.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.460
Do not expect the waterproofer to tell you
this because these repairs can be done for

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.460
fewer than one thousand dollars.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.500
Sometimes when we perform basement inspections
we find dirty gutters that overflow, or homes

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.480
that have those gutter contraptions gutter
caps, sponges or screens that may permit overflow

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.310
with intense rains and sometimes create winter
ice dams.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.139
Clean your gutters and downspouts and get
rid of those contraptions if they do not work.

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:31.599
I have seen many waterproofing systems installed
on homes that only had one crack that was

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.639
leaking.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.239
If you have a concrete poured foundation,
it will crack due to normal shrinkage.

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.810
If you have a masonry foundation, the crack
can be caused by many reasons, regardless,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.200
many times, you can simply dig out the crack
on the exterior and patch or epoxy inject

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.800
it for about eight hundred dollars.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.400
If it is a horizontal crack you will also
need to install interior horizontal wall bracing.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.750
If the stains or leaks are near the bottom
of the walls, they may be from many of the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.379
above problems or the draintile is actually
damaged, plugged, or sluggish.

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.819
First, look to see if you have trees in front
of your home or within twenty feet of your

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.079
home.

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.599
Trees grow and have roots that search for
water.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.189
Sometimes, you can simply snake the underground
pipes.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:23.959
If you do decide to snake the sanitary and
all storm pipes, you need to find a company

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.919
that also has a camera, so they can inspect
the pipes after snaking.

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.629
This may require digging down to the draintile
and installing a clean-out for snaking and

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.579
camera viewing at one of the back house corners.

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.329
The camera may find the break and now you
just have to dig up that isolated area.

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.620
You might even have to cut down that big tree
and stump out the roots or even do a partial

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.790
exterior water proofing repair.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.809
After you have done these not-so-expensive
repairs, and you still experience moisture,

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:58.529
you may be able to make the leaks more passive
by running your condensing dehumidifier.

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:03.819
When you run a condensing dehumidifier, it
sucks some of the moisture out of your foundation

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.049
system, so when it rains your foundation can
becomes a moisture-holding-reservoir and may

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.680
temporary hold some of that rain water.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.290
A wet sponge cannot hold moisture.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.270
If the sponge is dry, it can hold moisture
without dripping.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:24.259
Dehumidifiers can suck the moisture out of
your foundation, so when it rains, basement

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.490
moisture intrusion may not as significant.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.139
Additionally, dehumidifiers lower the indoor
humidity and minimize interior foundation

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:39.169
condensation which is also often misdiagnosed
for exterior foundation leaks.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.590
I have seen many unnecessary waterproofing
systems installed when the moisture problem

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:51.259
was only condensation caused by high indoor
humidity caused by possibly a furnace humidifier,

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.870
a moist crawl space, a ventless heater or
other.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.740
Many interior waterproofing companies install
interior sump pumps that do not have lids

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.330
100% sealed.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.860
Now you may have high radon gas, stone soil
odors, and certainly more indoor humidity

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.550
which can now permit indoor condensation.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.949
Interior water proofing systems have buried
perforated drain pipes have high humidity

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.280
and high vapor pressure which will travel
to low vapor pressure which is your basement.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.680
The waterproofer just created a nature moisture
generator or a natural humidifier.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.639
Moist air is lighter than dry air and will
rise into your home.

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:37.970
I have seen sump pumps with lids that are
not 100% sealed cause north windows and attic

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.810
sheathing to rot due to condensation during
cold climates.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.520
If the leak is at the upper sill plate or
band joist area, it may be a defective cladding

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.669
system like EIFS (synthetic stucco), hardy
board, Masonite, cultured stone or even a

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.230
leaking window or door system.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.720
Many newer cladding systems are simply installed
wrong and are actually rotting your house.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:09.090
These installations require a professional
cladding moisture survey or a water test which

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.040
can range from 195 -800 dollars.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.050
One of the newer problem we are now encountering
in the last ten years are homes built with

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:22.729
cultured stone that lacks a proper drainage
space or a proper drainage plane.

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:28.370
This fabricated material is often found on
larger more expensive newer homes.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.639
These repairs are very expensive and may require
full cladding removal and replacement.

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.530
Southern and western facing homes with cultured
stone are much more prone to this type of

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.240
failure due the wind driven rains.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.360
Therefore, before you sign you water-proofing
contract, inspect the home yourself and hire

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.990
a non-bias second opinion.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:56.199
If you do get a waterproofing estimate, get
a minimum of three and check the ANGIE's list

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.889
and BBB.

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:05.879
