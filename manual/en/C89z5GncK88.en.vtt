00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:06.246
(lively music playing)

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:07.671
Voiceover: We're at SFMOMA,

00:00:07.671 --> 00:00:10.703
and we're looking at a
large Robert Motherwell,

00:00:10.703 --> 00:00:14.004
"Elegy to the Spanish Republic No. 57,"

00:00:14.004 --> 00:00:17.321
and it was made in 1957, finished in 1960.

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.531
Voiceover: And there are a whole lot of
Motherwells that look a lot like this

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:22.693
and that are about the same subject,

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:25.677
and it's a series that he did
that occupied most of his life.

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:26.149
Voiceover: That's right.

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:28.328
He made over 140 canvases.

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:30.540
The very first one is very small.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.024
It was done on an 8-1/2Ã—11
sheet of paper in ink.

00:00:34.024 --> 00:00:38.697
It was meant to illustrate a poem
written by his friend and colleague,

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.284
Harold Rosenberg, the art critic.

00:00:40.284 --> 00:00:44.334
Rosenberg and Motherwell, this
is a decade earlier now in 1948,

00:00:44.334 --> 00:00:47.969
were co-editing an artist
magazine called "Possibilities."

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.952
There was only one issue, however,

00:00:49.952 --> 00:00:52.969
and this never made it into
that ill-fated second issue.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.532
Voiceover: So these forms, these
hanging suspended oval forms,

00:00:58.532 --> 00:01:04.326
the horizontal rectangular shapes that
don't ever quite touch the bottom,

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:08.349
the painterly quality around
the edges of the forms,

00:01:08.349 --> 00:01:12.001
it being hard to tell whether the white
paint is in front of the black paint

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.638
or vice versa,

00:01:13.638 --> 00:01:17.007
these are things that we
see in this entire series.

00:01:17.007 --> 00:01:19.017
There is something about these shapes

00:01:19.017 --> 00:01:20.220
and the way that they were painted

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.693
and the black and white that
suggested for Motherwell

00:01:22.693 --> 00:01:28.023
something about fascism and the
Spanish Republic and Franco.

00:01:28.023 --> 00:01:30.362
Voiceover: All issues relating
to the Spanish Civil War

00:01:30.362 --> 00:01:31.858
and the loss of democracy,

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.947
this opening gambit of what
would become the violence

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:35.485
of the Second World War.

00:01:35.485 --> 00:01:38.205
Motherwell was seeking
an abstract language

00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:42.168
that could embody his humanist feelings

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.914
and his deep sense of loss
and mourning and elegy

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:48.500
for the tragedies that
had taken place in Europe.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.578
Voiceover: And many artists were involved
in the Spanish Civil War, and writers. 

00:01:52.578 --> 00:01:53.025
That's right.

00:01:53.025 --> 00:01:55.975
A lot of Americans and other
Europeans were deeply sympathetic

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.953
to the democratic ideals of the Republic.

00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:00.922
Voiceover: And so it's hard to know
what these forms meant to him precisely,

00:02:00.922 --> 00:02:05.720
but it's not hard to feel a
brooding sense of entrapment

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.708
when standing in front of the canvas.

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:10.762
Voiceover: That paint can
also be emotionally direct

00:02:10.762 --> 00:02:13.683
is absolutely appropriate for
Motherwell's ideas at this time.

00:02:13.683 --> 00:02:16.592
Motherwell was a painter,
but he was also a critic

00:02:16.592 --> 00:02:18.843
and interested in
philosophy and literature.

00:02:18.843 --> 00:02:21.493
He is actually referencing
not only that original poem

00:02:21.493 --> 00:02:24.164
that this motif was intended
originally to illustrate,

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:27.433
but then he quotes the
great Spanish poet Lorca

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:28.981
in the first in this series,

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:31.142
which is, "At Five in the Afternoon."

00:02:31.142 --> 00:02:36.328
Voiceover: That poem by Rosenberg
that this motif originally illustrated

00:02:36.328 --> 00:02:38.499
had a feeling of sadism.

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.106
Voiceover: And suffering.

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:40.155
Voiceover: And suffering.

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:44.999
And so that becomes transferred to this
idea of looking at the Spanish Republic

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.143
and the Spanish Civil War.

00:02:47.143 --> 00:02:49.119
Voiceover: It's hard to look at
this canvas, for me at least,

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.977
and not feel the profound
loss and violence

00:02:51.977 --> 00:02:54.379
and Motherwell's need to find an idiom,

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.823
a visual language that can
convey it that is solemn enough.

00:02:58.823 --> 00:03:02.026
Perhaps the figurative
tradition feels inadequate.

00:03:02.026 --> 00:03:04.398
Voiceover: And let's not forget,
at this moment in history,

00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:06.730
Franco is still ruling Spain.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.731
Fascism is still very much alive.

00:03:08.731 --> 00:03:10.006
Voiceover: When this is being painted,

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.876
"Guernica" by Picasso, which
Motherwell was thinking about,

00:03:12.876 --> 00:03:15.297
that painting that is
blacks and whites and grays.

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:17.952
Voiceover: And that expresses
the horrors of a specific moment

00:03:17.952 --> 00:03:19.089
in the Spanish Civil War.

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.405
Voiceover: That's right.

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:23.504
Remember, it was at MoMA because
Picasso wouldn't let it go back to Spain

00:03:23.504 --> 00:03:25.481
so long as Franco was in power.

00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:27.616
So these were still real issues.

00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.571
Voiceover: So speaking to that violence

00:03:29.571 --> 00:03:33.350
that had been so prevalent
for so long in Europe

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.493
and trying to find a new
kind of pictorial language.

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.135
Voiceover: This is an
artist that we associate

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.255
with this great American school of
painting, Abstract Expressionism.

00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:46.276
But Motherwell reminds us that abstract
expressionism is tied to Europe

00:03:46.276 --> 00:03:49.018
and that its concerns
are not purely American.

00:03:49.018 --> 00:03:59.890
