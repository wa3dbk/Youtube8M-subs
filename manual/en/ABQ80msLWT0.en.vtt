Hello this is JB I'm with Austin Homebrew
Supply here in Austin, Texas. And we are discussing

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:16.080
equipment and ingredients and process based
upon making beer and wine at home. So with

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.319
that being said, right now I'm going to touch
upon a broad category and that's cleaning.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:27.460
You know how do you clean the different equipment
that we are using here. Ok so one of the things

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.520
that we utilize is brushes ok. And I'll just
show you a few examples ok. This particular

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:43.130
brush is used or cleaning out siphon hose.
It's got a three inch, three eights inch diameter

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.590
brush head which would fit right inside of
the standard siphon hose. So this is a siphon

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.440
hose brush. This guy is a bottle brush, that
will fit inside a bottles, for instance I

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.170
have a twelve ounce bottle here, and this
guy would simply fit down into it. Kind of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.520
hard to get it into it, it will spring out
once you get it done in there. Like so. Pops

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.820
out inside the bottle so it gets all the different
contact points inside of it and cleans it

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.229
out really nice and easy. And then the last
one I would mention is our carboy brush. And

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.850
the carboy brush has this L shaped angle to
it so that you can get up inside the neck

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.909
of the carboy. So these brushes start at about
three dollars and they go to about seven dollars

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.479
ok. So different applications, different shapes
of the brush for different applications. For

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.929
instance in this one so I can get up into
the top of that carboy or all the way down

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:56.259
onto the sides into the bottom. So just a
few different examples of the different brushes

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:59.579
that are available here, and different ways
that you can utilize them.
