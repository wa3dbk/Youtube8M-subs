00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's Sunday Morning on CBS and here again is Charles Osgood.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Osgood:  Stepping back from these small squares of paint reveals a self-portrait of the artist, Chuck Close.  

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Stepping into Close's studio reveals an artist of phenomenal talent and great physical courage.  Come see for yourself.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
A circle here.  A heart shape there.  Could there be hidden meaning in these images?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Close:  The building blocks of my paintings are not symbolic, they don't stand for anything.  

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Osgood:  Everyday, Chuck Close paints little squares.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Close:  And it's a little bit like an architect picking a brick, you stack up the bricks one way you get a cathedral, you stack up the bricks another way and you get a gas station

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Osgood:  But take a step back and it becomes clear this is no gas station.  Over four decades, Chuck Close has been reinventing the art of the portrait.  

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Even though for almost two of those decades he's done it confined to a wheelchair.  More on that shortly.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Close:  So here's where all the decisions are made.  I mean literally at this distance, I never go back, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I know from years and years of experience what four or five or six of these colors will do from a distance

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Osgood:  He starts every painting the same way, with a photograph.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Do you number these?  --&gt; Yeah --&gt;  So you know which square?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Close:  If you look at the photograph, every square here will become four squares in the painting.  

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There is no drawing on the canvas other than the grid.  I never draw a nose; I never draw a lip or anything like that.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Osgood:  We first visited Chuck Close in 1981.  He was working out on an exercise bicycle in his New York studio.  

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Our visit was during his photorealism period.  Close's paintings were so real, some viewers thought they were looking at photographs.  

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And they were big, really big.  The first painting Close sold was a nine-foot picture of himself, blemishes and all.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Close:  There's all kinds of evidence embedded in the person's face as to what kind of life they've led.  So it's sort of a road map of their life. 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
If they've laughed their whole lives they have laugh lines, if they've frowned their whole lives they have furrows in their brow.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Osgood:  But when Sunday Morning visited Chuck Close again, in 1991, the road map of his life had taken an unexpected turn.  He could barely walk.  

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Three years earlier at age 49, a blood clot had formed in an artery leading to his spine.  For weeks he couldn't move any part of his body below his shoulders.  

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
He feared he would never paint again.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Close:  I was scared to death, scared to death.  I think I always thought I was going to make it.  I was scared of living trapped in a body that didn't work.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Osgood:  His wife convinced doctors that encouraging him to paint again would help her husband recover physically and mentally.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Close:  We began to work with my occupational therapist in the hospital, trying to get orthotic devices, 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:47.000
something I could use to hold a brush and they built me a wheelchair accessible easel and I used occupational therapy for what I thought it was supposed to be, 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
a way to get back to your occupation.  And I started to paint while I was still in the hospital.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Osgood:  Today, you can find Chuck Close painting is his Bridgehampton, Long Island studio or at his second studio in New York City.  

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:11.000
His ability to walk has all but vanished, a brace supports his arm, his brushes are held by a strap on his hand, 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and he now paints with his entire arm, not just his wrist and fingers.  And there are other adjustments.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Close:  And that goes up and down so that I'm always at the right height.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Osgood:  Has your work suffered or has it in some ways ripened and gotten better?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Close:  What's changed is perhaps a slightly brighter palette, a more celebratory nature to the work because I was just so happy to be able to get back to work and to find a way to work again. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The other thing is, is that there's so many other things that I used to love to do that I put a lot of time and energy into, 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I used to mow the lawn, I cut brush, and dig holes, and chop out trees, and walk on the beach, and roughhouse with my kids and all of this stuff that I can't do anymore.  

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Thankfully, if I'm only going to be able to still do something that I used to do, I'm pretty lucky that it turned out to be painting.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Osgood:  His family is the center of his life.  He likes to paint them.  

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
His wife, Leslie.  

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
His daughters Georgia and Maggie.  

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He also paints his friends, including many other artists.  Close says his paintings have evolved, moving away from super-realism to focus more on abstract elements in the face. 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Osgood:  Occasionally does somebody look at what you've done and say, be mad that you've done what you have to their face?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Close:  Ohh, almost always.  Almost everybody hates the way they look, 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.000
some people immediately change the way they look, grow a beard if they didn't have one or shave it off if they did, 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but I would say just wait another 10 or 15 years and you won't mind, you won't hate it so much.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Osgood:  Which may be why Close remains his own favorite subject.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
You've done so many self-portraits.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Close:  Yes.  I've never thought of them as a bodied work until recently there was a retrospective of only self-portraits.  

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And then I thought, "Oh my God, how narcissistic, how incredibly self involved and egotistical.  Even I'm tired of me and I don't want to see another image of myself."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Osgood:  In recent years, Close has begun to focus on photography.  He uses the earliest form of capturing an image, daguerreotypes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Close:  It's exactly the same process as 1840 and in my opinion photography never got any better than it was at the very beginning.  Everything I love is already there.  

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Osgood:  And the bigger, the better.  Last fall, corporate giant United Technologies displayed an assortment of Close's images in a New York park. 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Close:  I wanted to celebrate ordinary people, so I decided to use them because they are so intimate.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Osgood:  Chuck Close is 66 now.  His work sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars and is shown all over the world. 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Twenty years after he almost died, he says he is one of the happiest artists you will ever meet.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Close:  There is no artists alive working today who gets more pleasure day in and day out, year in and year out than I do, period.  None.  

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I know there is no man or woman who gets more pleasure than I do.
