Hi, I'm Debbie Catz.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.390
I'm a certified clinical hypnotherapist here
in the San Francisco Bay area.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.471
I have a masters degree in social work.

00:00:09.471 --> 00:00:15.530
To learn more about this you can visit my
website at www.norcalhypno.com.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.470
And now I'm going to help you understand the
simplicity of hypnosis.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.800
So if you want to use hypnosis on some one
else the first thing you have to do is get

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.690
their permission because all hypnosis is self
hypnosis.So if a person does not want to go

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.570
in that relaxed stage known as hypnosis then
they aren't going to go.There are a number

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.480
of ways to induce hypnosis, one of the easiest
way is to tire the eyes and that can be done

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.420
by staring at a point on ceiling or staring
at somebody's hand, basically tiring the eyes

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.671
will get somebody to begin to get relax and
begin to want to close their eyes.Once you

00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:03.040
have achieved the eye closure,then you can
take a person to a favorite place,and in their

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.610
mind you talk about the mind's eye while their
eyes are closed they are using their subconscious

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.680
mind they are accessing their memory so they
will got to a favorite place perhaps out at

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.630
nature seeing all their favorite things using
all their senses to be there , so you direct

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.280
them uses all senses to be there, seeing all
your favorite things perhaps trees, mountains

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.760
may be an ocean and once they have done that
then you can deepen the state of relaxation

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:36.810
for more subconsciousness mind, the one way
to deepen the state of relaxation is to count

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.110
backwards, I am counting backwards from 15
down to 1 and when i am going to reach 1 you

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.630
are going so deeply relaxed, more relaxed
you have ever been.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.820
This isn't rocket science, its really pretty
easy.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:56.530
Start counting 15,14,13 and going all the
way down, you will be amazed how relaxed they

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.139
will become.
