Hey I'm Jade Seah and welcome to ChicPeek
DIY.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.990
Now you know we girls have a lot of STUFF.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.980
Meaning stuff like earrings - but maybe you've
lost one side; we have a lot of bracelets

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.969
with charms that some may be broken - so let's
say one charm is broken, you think you can't

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.710
use the bracelet any more; stuff like that.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:29.300
So today's DIY is all about re-purposing your
old bits and bobs.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.580
So what you're going to want to have is to
get together all your loose items.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.720
So I've here a very pretty button that fell
off a jacket; one side of an earring; couple

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.200
of pendents, stuff like that.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.300
So look for items that you like the look off
- you know like I think this is really pretty!

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.480
What you want to do is to just take out the
charms.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.399
Most of them come attached by this kind of
metal ring, and it's usually quite easy to

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:55.489
take off.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.190
So just using a pair of pliers kind of helps
the process along.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.980
Okay so I have seven charms here.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.670
You just want to get one of these binder rings,
which are basically like keychains - so this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.950
is a great way to re-purpose old keychains
as well!

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.560
Just take the ring and get some string.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.720
Here's when you can kind of personalise it
to your taste: if you want it to look very

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.991
dainty, you can go with thinner kind of thread,
and if you want it to look 'tougher' you can

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:29.570
go with things like leather cord or suede
cord.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:40.240
So thread it through, like so, and then take
your binder ring and just kind of tie it at

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240
different lengths.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.520
I like to tie it at different lengths because
it looks a lot more interesting than everything

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520
hanging off the same length.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.760
SO tie them at staggered lengths, you know,
some can be shorter, some can be longer.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.670
You can also use different coloured string,
you know so that it's more interesting.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:02.530
I just used the blue thread and now I'm going
to use the maroon.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.340
So that's two...

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.430
Okay and we're done!

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.450
So you'll end up with something like this
that you can kind of put on your bag as a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.370
bag charm; you can use it as a keychain and
they also make really good gifts!

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.920
So you can personalise them - I find that
a nice way to do this is to get alphabets.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
You know.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.830
they have those alphabet necklaces, or you
can go to any charm bracelet store and buy

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.629
an alphabet of your friend's name so it's
kind of a nice personal touch.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.150
So just have fun playing around with the different
elements; you know, the different charms,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.610
you can play around with different materials.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.230
Like I said, I've gone with a really delicate
thread here, but you can go with leather or

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.400
something if you want to 'toughen' it up.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.050
