00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, I said that Wikipedia has a very nice page that mentions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
all the types of hands, and it also gives the percentages for each hand.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That is, out of all the possible poker hands,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what percentage are a straight flush, four of a kind,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
full house, and so on, so here's the percentages.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We see that about half the hands don't have anything.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
They're just the high card with no pairs or anything else.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And then 42% are pairs, and then less for each of those.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we see the percentages align with the actual poker values.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That is, the most rare hand, the straight flush, is the highest ranking.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The next most rare hand, four of a kind, is the next highest ranking,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and the most common is the least highest, so that makes sense.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Poker is a sensible game from the point of view of probability.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, one thing we can do is see if we can duplicate this type of table.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That is, can we test our routines and make sure

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we've got it right in that we identify straight flushes,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
high cards, and everything else the correct number of times?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
What I'm going to do is come up with a program that randomly generates

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
decks or deals from the deck and then checks to see

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
what kind it is and checks to see if we can reproduce this probability table.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We're going to look at random deal percentages,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and first we're going to have a quiz.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Say we want to deal out a random number of hands

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then count how many of each type we have

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then come up with that table like we just saw from Wikipedia.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And the question is about how many hands should we deal out

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to get a good estimate of the probabilities?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That is, we're not going to get the exact estimate,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but we want to get some estimates that are close to the right probabilities,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and the more we sample, the closer we'll get.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Should we look at about 52 hands,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
about 50,000 hands, 700,000 hands,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or about 52 factorial hands?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And then I also want you to answer why,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so one per card, or do we need about 1,000 per card

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
so that the random variations are evened out?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Or do we need about 10 for least common hand, least common ranking?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Or do we need one for each of the possible permutations

00:02:31.000 --> 09:59:59.000
of everything that came out of the deck?
