00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.610
All good things must come to an end.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.360
So must the bad things, thankfully.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.790
This is the fourth and final Zhu Zhu Pets
DS game I have left to review, all four sent

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.870
to us by the legendary Felicity from the UK...all
four pretty much identical.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.950
I'm not sure if that's mercy or torture, because
frankly, it feels the same.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.510
That's right.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:57.210
In case you missed the first three reviews...holy
crap, these games are freaking identical.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.409
And it continues right 'til the end with Zhu
Zhu Pets: Featuring the Wild Bunch.

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.290
Only with this one...hey, let's add a pointless
structure.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.070
Because things were going a little too well,
right?

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.450
So, uh...another crazy piece of information
here.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.450
And maybe depressing.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.479
In our review of Zhu Zhu Princess, I said
that I couldn't believe they released three

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.010
Zhu Zhu games in less than two years.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.010
That's just ridiculous.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.620
But oh, wait...it gets better.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.420
Because this one, Zhu Zhu Pets: Featuring
the Wild Bunch?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.210
This is actually the second game.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.409
So let's update the timeline here...

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.649
The original Zhu Zhu Pets in March of 2010.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.140
This one in October, seven months later.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.960
Zhu Zhu Princess in February, only four months
later.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.310
Wrap it all up with Zhu Zhu Babies that November.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.920
That's four games...20 months.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.320
There's kicking the dead horse, and then there's
bashing its face in with a ball-peen hammer.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.710
Sure, it's morally and arguably legally questionable
behavior.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:05.950
But hey, as long as it sells more hamster
games, pass 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.240
the f*cking hammer.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.260
I'll tell you what, though.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.910
Of all four of these Zhu Zhu games on the
Nintendo DS, this is actually the only one

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.350
that feels different.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.060
Although...not because of the gameplay.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.930
This is still the same game at its core.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.660
What's different, though, is the game's structure.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.620
Unlike the other games, which are more streamlined...this
one's a lot more stupid.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.990
How about that?

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.810
The one thing it does differently ends up
making it worse.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.660
So, obviously...this is another pet game and
hamster, maze...thing.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.090
Half the game is nurturing your hamster, half
is shooting it through tubes like a tennis

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.050
ball on American Gladiators.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.100
Only not really, because that would be fun.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.730
About that structure, though.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.510
So...instead of the mazes just being attached
to the hub, they're on a map.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.290
Which means you have to go to a location,
walk to the level you want to play on the

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.990
map...and no, it's not an improvement.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.860
Anything that just makes it take longer to
pick a level is artificially lengthening a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.860
game.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.280
And especially for a kids game, that's an
unnecessary move.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.190
It's not done simply, it's not done intuitively.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.700
It's done poopsky.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.300
Hamster poopsky.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:22.230
You know, I've said in each of these reviews
that...these aren't bad games.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.280
This is another decent little kids game.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.380
The big problem with these Zhu Zhu games for
the DS...is that they're all the same game.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.220
They change something here, add some hamsters
there, throw in some new levels...and call

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.820
it a new game.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.380
There's literally no reason to have any more
than one of these.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.380
Unless you're Felicity.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:49.430
Who has five of everything.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.180
I was gonna do a nice conclusion here, but...that
would be too much effort for a collection

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.180
of games seemingly made without any.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.120
The best one was probably Zhu Zhu Princess,
this one's probably the worst.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.140
I don't know.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.430
I kind of blacked out for this little series.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.580
If you watched all four...thank you.

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.580
We suffered together.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.290
And I think what we've learned today is...that's
what Zhu Zhu Pets is all about.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.250
Mutual suffering.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:34.759
Mutual suffering and 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.760
hamster poop.
