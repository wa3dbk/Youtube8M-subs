00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.580
Hannah is getting her makeup done, specifically
her eyeliner.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.230
And I thought I'd take this opportunity to
go through her stuff.

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.230
It's Grace's Faces.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:09.230
Grace's Faces.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.919
I touch their stuff and then I leave.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:14.089
Good morning.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.839
It is 8:35am.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.570
Welcome to the behind-the-scenes of the Hannah
Hart "Grace's Faces" episode.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.670
Hooray!

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.980
It's very exciting.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.009
Hannah Hart uploads a "My Drunk Kitchen" while
we shoot "Grace's Faces."

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.009
Priorities!

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.570
The life of a YouTuber never stops.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.220
Oh, want to see craft services?

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.590
This is the before.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.890
Maybe she's born with it.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.500
Maybe it's all a mistake.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.460
The key to cooking is using food.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.260
Hannah Hart has a refrigerator that looks
to be 40% booze and 60% condiments.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.480
Let's do this!

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.480
To makin' food in Hannah Hart's kitchen.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.240
To "Grace's Faces".

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.010
Now let's cook.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:22.730
I'm gonna make a...
we have croissants left over from our really

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.130
elegant craft services.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.930
I'm going to make a croissant sandwich.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.090
First we start with the bread.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.120
Great.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.980
Then we're gonna put...I don't eat meat.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.940
Oh that's good.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.160
We have not just one, but two cheddars.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.780
The girl loves cheese.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:44.780
Cottage cheese.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.049
"Yay Cheese"
We get it.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.700
You love cheese.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.940
Let's make a cheese sandwich, says the girl
with a lactose issue.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.790
Okay, so we're gonna start with -- why do
people like cottage cheese?

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.090
Everyone says you eat with your eyes first.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.090
Yuck.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.950
That looks awful.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.950
Okay.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.950
Mmmmmm.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.950
Great.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
Cocktail artichokes?

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.349
That's not a thing.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.050
What cocktail are you putting artichokes in?

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.050
C'mon.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:23.739
Grace, you are a strong independent woman.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.189
You can do this.

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.189
Nope...

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.189
AH!

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.689
The sweet sound of success.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.080
Oh, these do not smell like they should be
going in drinks.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.489
So we'll put them on our sandwich.

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.719
Artichokes are the meat of the vegetable world.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:47.989
Brown sugar sweet and sticky sauce.

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.730
Oh, this smells surprisingly very delicious.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.049
So we'll put a little bit of this on top,
Oh, beautiful.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.109
You see the color contrast?

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.100
That's what we're looking for in a sandwich.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:11.159
A lot of bland beige colors mixed with a lot
of muddy brownish red colors.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:18.829
The best thing about being an adult is eating
the food you've made over a sink.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.370
Cheers.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.909
Nope.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.290
That's not a good thing to put in your body
at all.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.189
Hannah, where's your trash can?

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.269
Oh it's down there.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.040
You got paper towels?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.430
Thank god.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.510
One paper towel.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:47.689
You know, "Grace's Faces" is really more about
effort then successful execution.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:59.459
Why don't we move into the bedroom?

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.749
We've been set up.

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:04.239
Or have we?

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.269
Surprise.

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:07.870
Hannah Hart's nickname online is "Kinkmaster
Kink".

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.329
None of this is staged.

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.230
All of this is Hannah Hart to a tee.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.590
A quietly placed set of handcuffs.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.000
Where she even got these from as part of the
prank that she's trying to pull right now

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.890
is very confusing to me.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.960
Let's look at Hannah's closet.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.930
Oh, it's just all right here.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.949
Awesome.

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.780
Perhaps the only staple of Hannah Hart's wardrobe
is a vest.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:34.780
One vest.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.540
Two vests.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.540
Three vests.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.770
Four vests.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.370
I could be wearing one vest or four vests
right now and no one would have any idea.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.050
What else is there to see?

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.669
Oh!

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:52.340
She's been working on her fitness.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.340
Hannah Hart.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.509
Teeny tiny 80's weights in the corner.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:58.750
I love it.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:17.340
This does get difficult the more 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.009
you do this.

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.210
Let's move on, shall we?

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.699
Yup, there's the technique.

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:27.330
Classic "lick-and-touch".

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:33.030
Who is this old man Southern character?

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.770
The tutorial has deteriorated.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.340
So I'm gonna take the money that I feel like
I should be paid for watching that and exit.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.820
It's Grace's Faces.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.479
Grace's Faces.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:53.050
I touch their stuff and then I leave.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:06:02.530
Ah, you're like the James Bond of Makeup.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.539
This is taking me to the wedge...of glory.

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.270
Did Marc give you a wedgie?

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.319
So today I'm going to be doing a fresh and
awake makeup tutorial for you guys.
