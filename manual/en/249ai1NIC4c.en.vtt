00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.660
Welcome to Buyspares.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:10.459
This video will show you how to change
the direction that your fridge door opens.

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.290
Before replacing a part in any electrical appliance

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.289
you must ensure that the appliance is first unplugged from the mains.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.740
After emptying the fridge and disconnecting it
its best to lay the fridge on  it's back so you can get to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.579
screws underneath.

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.130
Using the appropriate screwdriver for your fridge

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.800
remove the screws from both sides.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560
You'll notice that one's considerably longer

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.650
by swapping these over it' will enable the fridge to open the other way.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.700
With these two screws removed the door can be taken off.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.500
Remove the screw which will now be
protruding from the top of the fridge

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.500
and refit it in the opposite corner.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.030
Remove the anchor from one side and the plug

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.780
from the other side these should

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.500
lever out quite easily.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.300
Refit them so that they're now on
the opposite sides.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.520
replace the door so that the screw now
protruding from the top of the fish

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.390
should now fit into the anchor. 
You can now replace

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.619
the two screws from the underneath of the fridge into the opposite

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.619
sides that they were in originally.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.909
The door should now open from the opposite side.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:54.060
