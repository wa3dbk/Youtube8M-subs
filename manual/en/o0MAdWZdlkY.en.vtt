00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.349
What is up everybody.

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:07.110
Muwen360 is here bringing you guys my full
in-depth on the Republic Wireless Moto G.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.210
So first before I talk about the device, I
want to first of all talk about Republic Wireless,

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.860
the company that’s providing the phone service
for your Moto G.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.610
So Republic Wireless is a relatively new cell
phone carrier and what’s really unique about

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:28.000
them is that they provide service through
their custom designed hybrid calling technology

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.280
which relies on your WiFi connection primarily
for calls and messages and when you’re not

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.470
not to WiFi, it automatically switches back
over to cellular on Sprint’s nationwide

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.470
network.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.570
Since most of us are on WiFi most of the time,
it makes a lot of sense to be able to use

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.320
WiFi for talk, text, and data so that’s
really the beauty of how Republic Wireless

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320
works.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.879
And from my personal experience, it actually
works quite well since I haven’t ran into

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.390
any problems making or receiving a call or
dropping any calls while transitioning from

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.330
WiFi to celluar or vice versa so it really
is a seamless transition that works.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.460
The call quality is actually pretty good on
WiFi and if you have decent Sprint coverage

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.280
around your area, the call quality over cellular
should be solid.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.320
But the best part is, Republic Wireless has
four great plans at great prices for you choose

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.320
from.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.080
It starts with the $5 WiFi only plan which
provides you with unlimited talk, text and

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.490
data all over WiFi.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.560
Now while this plan is a great choice if you’re
only using your phone on a WiFi connection,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.009
I personally would not recommend this plan
because it doesn’t give you the freedom

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.720
to place calls or text anywhere you go due
to the lack of cellular support, you’re

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.760
only limited to WiFi.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.590
The next plan up is the Republic $10 plan
which gives you unlimited talk and text over

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.370
cellular, and unlimited data over WiFi.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.280
So this is the plan that I’m rocking and
it works great for me because I have the ability

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.180
to talk and text wherever I go on both wifi
and cellular and since I use data mostly just

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.180
on WiFi.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.309
The next plan is the Republic plus 3G plan
and its essentially the same plan as before

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:14.930
with unlimited talk and text but with this
plan, you get the addition of unlimited 3G

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.930
data.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.680
So it’s great if you’re planning to use
the internet without a WiFi connection.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.510
However, unlimited data in reality just means
5GB of full speed data each billing cycle,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.449
and if you exceed that limited, nothing bad
will happen you’re not going to get charged

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.939
for overage fees or anything like, they’ll
simply just reduce your data speed until the

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.279
next billing cycle.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:41.349
Now there is also a 4th plan available at
a price of $40 and the only difference with

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.059
that is you get the faster 4G data instead
of 3G.

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:50.529
However, this plan is only available for the
Moto X, not the Moto G because this version

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.129
of the Moto G only supports 3G.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.590
So overall, I think Republic Wireless is a
great carrier if you’re looking for a cheap,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.239
affordable phone service.

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.829
The coverage is great, there are no contracts,
no unreasonable fees and you still have all

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.150
the features available as you would expect
like voice mail, caller ID, number transferring

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.150
et cetera.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.150
There are a few things that I recommend you
to do prior to purchasing the service.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.590
Most importantly just, make sure to verify
the coverage in your area so you can assure

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.059
the service will work properly.

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.969
So overall I think Republic Wireless is a
great wireless carrier for its affordable

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.310
price and quality.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.290
I highly recommend it for those wanting a
cheap phone service that works so definitely

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.359
go check it out for yourself.

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.099
So now let’s talk about the actual device,
the Moto G itself.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.319
So let’s start off with the design, so the
Moto G is very similar to the Moto X in terms

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.319
of design.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.979
We still have the curve and the dimple on
the back for the Motorola logo so the phone

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.699
still feels nice in the hand.

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:55.379
It’s got a weight of 143 grams so it’s
definitely not light but it does have nice

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.379
weight to it.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.389
The back plate of the phone has a soft touch
matte finish which is comfortable to hold

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.359
but it also is a fingerprint magnet.

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.189
The backplate also happens to be removable
but that’s only for replacing it with another

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:11.729
colored shell use for customization.

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:14.219
The battery is not user removable.

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:21.259
Love the form factor of this device, it’s
a 4.5 inch 1280x720 HD LCD IPS display with

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:26.810
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 and the display also
has water repellent coating to prevent water

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.729
damage which is awesome.

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.530
Super sharp screen with a pixel density of
329 pixels per inch.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.150
And what’s really cool about this 4.5 inch
screen is that it’s great for one-handed

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.150
use.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.620
Very easy to hold it with one hand.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.330
So Very pocket able since you can fit the
device this inside pretty much any pocket

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.330
or purse.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.910
Now around the device, we have the silver
power button and volume rocker on the right.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.939
Micro USB port and microphone at the bottom.

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.199
3.5mm headphone jack up top with another microphone.

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.650
We have the 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
here capable of 720p HD video recording and

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.979
the earpiece.

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:12.939
On the back, we have the speaker grill, and
the 5mp megapixel rear facing camera along

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.360
with LED Flash.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.789
The Moto G is running on the latest major
version of Android.

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.680
Android 4.4 kitkat and it’s running a very
stock version of it as well.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.340
And is expected to be updated to the upcoming
version of Android, Android L. Very fast device

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.340
all around.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.090
Apps load up very quickly.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.320
Landscape to portrait mode transition nice.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.800
Watching YouTube videos was nice and smooth.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.789
Playing games like Minecraft and Temple Run
was a great experience and even more graphically

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:49.909
intense games like Dead Trigger 2 ran perfectly
smooth so it pretty has handled everything

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:55.830
I threw at it all thanks to its Qualcomm Snapdragon
400 quad core processor.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.310
So really a fast experience overall haven’t
ran into any lag issues or problems everything

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.379
works fine as I expected on the Moto G.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:10.430
So really the Moto G is an exceptional phone
at an exceptional price point of only $150.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.599
So really the Moto G is a great device, a
pleasure to work with, and if you’re someone

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:20.889
that’s looking for THE best budget phone
on Android, THE Motorola Moto G is it.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.389
So this will wrap up my review and I hope
you enjoyed.
