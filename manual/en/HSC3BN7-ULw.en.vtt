Hi! My name is Ken and I am here today to
talk to you about Chess. Now Chess is divided

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.799
in 3 parts; the beginning which is the opening,
various openings, a whole bunch of different

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.111
openings which one can learn, the middle part
of the game where pieces are eliminated and

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:20.440
training is going on and the end game where
one opponent has a material advantage and

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.890
is trying to check mate the other opponent.
I just wanted to briefly talk about the end

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.119
game. Here is a scenario that comes up a lot
where you have the King and the Queen from

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.360
one opponent and the King left from the other
one. The object here is to get the King into

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
check. So I am using my Queen, I put the King
in check, the King has to move. I then move

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.940
my King down, starting to box the King in
but I have avoid what is called Stalemate

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.710
which I will talk about. I then come up here
and I call check. I always keep putting the

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.430
King in check. The King moves back. Now I
cannot go up on this board, so it is limited

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.390
to the back board here. I then move my King
down. Now if I come here I've got check mate.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.960
The King cannot move any other position. It
moves here its in check, moves here it is

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.970
in check, moves here it is in check. A stalemate
which is also known as a draw could be had

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.500
if I just move over here and the King has
no place to go. Every move it moves it goes

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.200
into check. So you can't move here, it's in
check, can't move here, it's in check. Say

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.390
I have another piece on the board which I
am going to put my black Knight. It can't

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:41.680
move here, its in check so any place it moves
it goes into check, check, check, check, check.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.600
That's a stale mate. I want to avoid that
at all costs. Otherwise the opponent, I have

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.710
a material advantage. But the opponent is
going to win the game because he cannot move

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.299
except to move in check which creates a stalemate.
I always have to keep the opponent in check.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:57.710
Thank you.
