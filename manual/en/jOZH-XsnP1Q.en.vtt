00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:25.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: Hi I’m Darren Kennedy and I’m here at Matalan HQ to meet with their senior design team who are going to be giving me the inside track on what’s hot for spring/summer.

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.500
So Ruth, what exactly is your role here at Matalan? 

00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:41.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: I’m ladieswear design manager. I’m here to deliver trend to our customers, to make sure we have the key silhouettes, prints, patterns, fabrics.

00:00:41.501 --> 00:00:44.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So you’re involved right from the design stage to when it lands on the shop floor.

00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: Yep, from start to finish.

00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:48.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So what would you say are Matalan’s main trends are for spring?

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:53.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: Defiantly monochrome, whether you wear formal or casual, monochrome is huge!

00:00:53.501 --> 00:01:01.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: When we say monochrome we think quite classic and conservative but actually for spring/summer 2013 it’s completely twisted on its head.

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:09.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: It’s really quite punchy with really wide stripes, these snake prints that are coming through, the whole spots and stripes mix.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:16.500
Black and white is so key for spring/summer and still for autumn/winter and the blue and white range, the blue indigo.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:23.500
It’s a really clean, quite minimal trend, its got all different hues of blue, white, a splash of aqua.

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:25.500
It’s quite sophisticated and elegant.

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:31.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So Ruth, designing is your bread and butter, but how important is quality and fabric choice to you?

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:37.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: Quality of fabric is imperative. We have beautiful patterns, we have angora in our knitwear.

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:52.500
I think you can just tell when the customer comes in now, she comes and gets the skinny jeans and it’s like twelve quid and it’s not something that will stretch or bag, it stays skinny. It’s beautiful and as good as anyone else on the high street so I’m really proud of that.

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So these are the trousers!

00:01:57.501 --> 00:01:59.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: These are my favourite piece.            

00:01:59.501 --> 00:02:03.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: These are gorgeous. These trousers probably tick two of your trend boxes, do they?  

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:13.500
&gt;&gt; RUTH: Yeah, the print is really important, this sort of scarf print. Printed trousers are going to be huge, we’ve seen that from autumn/winter.

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:19.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So tell me a little bit about what you do here at Matalan.

00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:22.500
&gt;&gt; LOUISE: I’m the design manger over at essentials.

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: What are essentials, are they accessories?

00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:34.500
&gt;&gt; LOUISE: Essentials is accessories, footwear, jewellery, so that obviously ties in really close to ladies wear, and then you’ve got swim wear, beach wear, lingerie, night wear.

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:35.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So all the fun stuff?

00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:38.500
&gt;&gt; LOUISE: Exactly! A lot of the things us girls love the most.

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:41.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: So for Matalan, what are the top line trends? 

00:02:41.501 --> 00:02:46.500
&gt;&gt; LOUISE: From a footwear point of view, loving the gladiator sandal with the studding on.

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:51.500
The studding trend was big in winter and that’s still set to continue through the summer season.

00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:56.500
From a bag’s point of view, it’s very much a tote season, so quiet a structured tote.

00:02:56.501 --> 00:03:02.500
Swimwear has picked up a bit of a sports trend, a few jungle prints coming through as well, so animal patterns coming through.

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:10.500
And then lingerie has very much tied in again with this blue and white theme. It’s beautiful, very much inspired by this porcelain prints.

00:03:10.501 --> 00:03:13.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: Louise, if there is one thing that is going to be really big for spring/summer, what is it?

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:24.500
&gt;&gt; LOUISE: It’s going to be denim. Denim is really strong for the season and then obviously what you are going to need back with that is white on the clothing, white accessories or you could opt for tan if you’re not wanting to go with the whole white look.

00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:31.500
This is the wedge, this is the got that real seventies platform look to it.

00:03:31.501 --> 00:03:37.500
It’s a great versatile piece, you can wear it day through to evening. It will go with your denim or your skinnies or even with a dress for a night out.

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:41.500
I quite like the peep toe, you know, it’s a real great fashion piece.

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:49.500
&gt;&gt; DARREN: Well I hope that has got you excited for spring/summer and if you would like some more inspiration on what’s coming up this season, make sure to log on to this week’s Kat’s Closet.
