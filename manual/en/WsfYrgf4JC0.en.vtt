00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.120
do

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.760
hello my spear fishing community

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.860
Today's video is about changing your flopper

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.960
different divers have different reasons
for changing their flopper

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.150
Some prefer them on the to others on the bottom

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.200
sometimes the flopper gets damaged

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.950
in this case the flopper is grabbing on the spear

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.460
I have tried loosening it off and it's not working

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.600
I'm going to completely remove it from the spear

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.789
So the tools I will need for this job

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.030
Is a metal file, a hammer

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.269
We could buy a pin for the flopper but

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.379
That would be cheating, so what I have done here

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.359
I have bought a bicycle spoke, it must be stainless

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.750
Don't go stealing the spokes of some poor kid  bike down the road

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.410
You want a brand new stainless steel spoke

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.400
So what we first need to do

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
Is remove that flopper from the spear

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.000
So in order to do that we have to wear off this pin.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.030
Grind the head of this pin off and it should fall out

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.040
too much trouble

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.600
filing pin

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.830
removing pin

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.920
position flopper close to vice

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.640
The pin gets pushed through

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.100
pin removed

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.600
Now I know that look like I just got a phillips screw driver to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.000
use as a punch, but that is just an optical illusion.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.160
There is no way I would do such a horrible thing like that.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.800
So next we have to cut off the threaded part of the spoke

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.500
because that's of no use to us

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.310
So we have cut off the threaded part

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.600
now what we effectively have to do is make a

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.800
new head, it's not going to be as wide as this.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.100
but um, hopefully it will be wide enough to

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.500
not slip out, so we're not going to

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.010
give this a really good beating

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.940
because if you do that, you will tend to collapse the

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.600
the spoke onto itself. So what we want to do is just work away at it

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Make that burr over as big as possible.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.000
Now ideally I would be using a lot smaller hammer than what I have here

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.600
So that's just as it is really, I don't have any

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.780
smaller hammers, but a nice little

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.800
kids hammer would almost be perfect

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.890
burring the pin

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.500
I rolling the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.300
hammer over, so your trying to burr over

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.480
I small amounts at a time

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.560
high speed burring

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.500
high speed burring

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.390
high speed burring

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.100
I don't know how well you can see that, but burring that over

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.300
actually took like almost four minutes

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.800
steady hammering. Now there is a very

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.180
still a very slight curve in that pin

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.900
but I'm not too worried about that. As you will see

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.100
it's the perfect size pin in diameter

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.430
for the spear

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.660
Just enough play or movement  there

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.900
so that it moves around easily. So now what we do

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.200
we get that pin, check

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.100
which way up..oh the other thing is, I have worked on this flopper so that it's not

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.079
grabbing anymore

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.300
Myself like the flopper on the top.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.600
So line this up

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.500
Feed it all the way through

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.490
now will be cutting it off.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.580
leaving

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.610
ourselves about three or four
millimetres proud so that

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.000
you've got a bit of metal there to burr over.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.400
So I will get a marker

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.600
This is a large marker, so I'm going to make sure the line I put on there

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.420
gets cut off

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:00.590
 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.680
like so

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.650
Not much pressure needed

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.620
 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.560
O.k

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.700
Put that down there

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.960
 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:26.700
keep the spear as flat as possible make sure you got a
nice a solid surface

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.200
get rid of this thing

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.300
Again we go through that same process of beating it lightly, now

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.600
if you hit too hard in one hit

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.100
you can actually bend the spoke while it's

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.900
inside,you will end up with a curve inside the actual

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.600
spear. so again we're just gonna take our
time

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.790
I'll skip this process otherwise you get
bored out of your tree

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.000
okay that's pretty much finished. I do think
I could have gotten a slightly

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.960
better looking finish if I had a smaller,
hammer

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.700
a small hammer with a curve in the head, what I am finding is the head

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.400
is flat.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.000
starts bouncing against the flopper while your trying to put pressure on the

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.480
pin

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.100
But I'm my happy enough that's going to
hold well

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.900
that it's not going to slide out, and that there is still plenty of strength there.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:28.000
Now, as you can see the flopper

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.100
is not grabbing on that spear. But what I do want is that when I strike that spear

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.700
like that.. that the flopper stays up like this

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:40.930
I'll be covering that in an other video

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.900
All right, there we have it. One new

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.100
pin. The only extra tool I really needed was the

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.700
the punch that looks

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.700
extremely similar to a philips screw driver.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.800
So there we go. Just something to

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.600
keep in mind if you get caught out
somewhere and I just wanted to show you

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.510
the job done with a bicycle spoke spike
because accessibility of these

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.580
will generally be a lot easier

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.900
than finding two millimetre Pin for a
flopper.

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:18.400
I hope you enjoyed this video and you want to
