00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.600
Everyone wants to be happy but not everyone achieves it.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.000
Is there a particular way toachieve happiness? 
Does the "Happiness handbook" exist?

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Happiness is consequence of what we are, what we do, 
and how we face our life;

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.000
as every life is different, there can't be a
happiness handbook or any rules that tell us:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
make this and you will be happy, 
think about that and you will never be sad

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because it is not finding what to do to be happy, 
is how you have to do it.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.400
There are different steps of happiness: Can
Americans be happy? But... they aren't aware of ham, are they?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.000
The same happens with God, you can be happy 
without being aware of his existence,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.600
but when you realize how much he cares and
 how much he loves you, you feel very lucky.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.400
I think that worrying about material goods 
is not going to make me happy:

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.800
I can have the latest flagship smartphone 
and I will be happy for a while,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.000
but this is not getting me to true happiness;

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.979
I'm going to be happy
if I forget myself, my own things and concerns

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.000
and I start worrying about other people.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.000
Life is a fairy tale: the same as Little Red
Riding Hood meets the big bad wolf to get

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.400
to Grandma's home, in our life we have troubles:
facing that troubles and getting over them

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:50.470
is what is going to make us truly happy. Problems are part of our lives actually.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.000
Can people who don't face problems be happy?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.000
Looking backguards and remembering all these years,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I can assure you that it is worth it dedicating to Christ's cause.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:15.000
As John Paul II used to say: You are happy
because of what you are,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
not because of what you have: happiness is in the heart, is in love,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
is in helping the others for their sake, 
without expecting anything in return.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.500
Happiness is contagious.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.100
Be happy making people around you happy.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.200
The more happiness I give, the more happiness I have.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.700
As Saint JosemarÃ­a used to say: You don't
need a comfortable life to be happy,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.579
you need a heart in love.
