00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.250
in case you haven't heard a
famous name plate with a quarter of a

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.139
century history in australia has
returned to Nissan's showrooms

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.219
for those of you who have been living under a
rock for the past few months

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.639
it's the Pulsar

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.619
and this particular model is flagship 
variant of the regular Pulsar range

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.890
the TI, that comes with all the bells and whistles

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.019
all pulsar's come with a decent spread a
standard features

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:31.249
including alloy wheels cruise control six
airbags multifunction and multiadjust

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.190
steering wheel and a full-size spare
wheel

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.910
externally the TI boasts the biggest
alloys seventeen inches in diameter while

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.040
at the front there is gas headlights

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.580
inside the TI takes on a luxury focus with leather seats, pushbotton

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.040
engine stuff bluetooth with audio
streaming two zone climate-control

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.400
a reverse view camera and a colour sat nav and infotainment display

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.210
and as a top tier model until the arrival of the sss sports version

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.290
the TI employs only a continuously variable auto gear box, in tandem with

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.080
Pulsar's one point eight litre petrol
engine

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.900
we have to admit

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.630
we're not the biggest fans of cvts
they tend to be a bit noisy and a little bit

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.090
sluggish at building up to speed

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.150
and in the cvt of the pulsar

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.140
well it does have that sound of

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.020
imitating a slipping clutch

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.590
but saying that it accelerates smoothly and it's
pretty quick to get off the line and

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.060
there's also another bonus over the manual
because the engine is doing about a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.810
thousand revs less at  high-way speeds

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.200
that contributes to a cabin that is
free of intrusive noise including

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.109
limited wind whistle

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:41.580
and efficiency

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.630
with fuel consumption improved by nearly
fifty percent over its predecessor

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.840
this small Nissan slurps just six point
seven liters of unleaded petrol every

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.340
a hundred kilometers

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.390
it says a comfortable refined cruiser
where the pulsar TI hits the sweet

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.460
spot

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.730
the suspension has a soft set up that
is more focused on a ride that is supple

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.810
and good at absorbing bumps without being at
the expense of body control

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.730
yes there are better cars to steer in this
segment in terms of being sharper

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.129
more dynamic

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.259
but the thing about the Pulsar is that it's got loads of tyre grip

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:18.089
plenty of composure

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:23.249
and the steering is linear and well weighted

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.889
it's not exactly a small car four
point six meters long

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:30.669
though Nissan has also ensured good packaging
has also created generous cabin space f

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.969
for all occupants as well as a massive boot

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.620
it may be a bit of an exaggeration

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.310
to call this a mini limo

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.719
but a Nissan Pulsar TI certainly has more in common with cars from a

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.109
class above

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.659
and with the return of that badge, expect this car to be big metaphorically too
