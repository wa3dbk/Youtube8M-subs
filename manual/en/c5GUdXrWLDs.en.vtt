00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:24.840
I’ve been paying quite a lot of attention
to the earliest moments of the NES, staring

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.580
into the aftermath of the Big Bang, as it
were.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.050
So, how better to cleanse my palate than by
going to the other extreme of the spectrum:

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.230
the system’s swan song.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.910
The capstone on the machine’s nine-year
run of excellence, a run in which “Nintendo”

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.720
became synonymous with video games in America.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:53.710
Wario’s Woods hit the NES in 1994, becoming
not only the last game on that system, but

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.230
the only one to carry an official ESRB rating.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.920
It’s a wonderful tale of... well, of blowing
up monsters inside hollow trees.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.400
You’d think that’d cause a pressure differential
and cause the entire thing to explode... but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.770
apparently these trees are made of stronger
stuff.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.821
In a fairly radical departure from the standard
mode of object-dropping puzzle gameplay, you

00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:22.270
have no control over what falls where, but
all kinds of authority on the floor of the

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.060
tree itself.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.900
Your Toad, a comfortable one unit square,
regulates the descending masses (and whatever

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.689
stack of monsters started out in the tree)
by picking up, kicking, running up and over,

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.200
flipping, and otherwise arranging them in
colored rows.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.020
Complete three-in-a-row of a particular color,
including at least one bomb, and the whole

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.670
lot explode... and I’d at least expect Toad
to pass out or start bleeding from the ears

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.960
or something.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.630
But no!

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.030
Our intrepid hero continues on, arranging
objects horizontally, vertically, or diagonally,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.200
until all the monsters are annihilated, at
which time gold rains down from the sky and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.069
he runs headlong into the next tree full of
monsters.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:15.040
You’d think he’d learn one of these times!

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.930
Anyway.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.560
Serving as an incentive to your expedient
extermination is the threat of Wario interceding

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.000
and taking the place of your good friend Birdo
up there.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.140
While Birdo has control of the situation,
only bombs will fall, thus facilitating your

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.710
exorcism.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.989
Take too long though, and the flighty... erm...
thing... will take off, at which time Wario

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.370
makes an appearance and starts raining down
more monsters (and thus, fewer bombs).

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.470
Adding to the confusion are more difficult
monsters that add certain stipulations, such

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.040
as requiring two blasts in quick succession
to be eliminated, or changing color after

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.660
one round of explosives, or requiring detonation
in a particular direction.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.700
I’m not entirely sure how that works, scientifically
speaking, but then we’re back to Toad bleeding

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.720
from the ears and eyes.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.849
And frankly, that’s a place I’d rather
not be.

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:08.849
Man.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:15.540
NES games get more and more difficult to digest
the more Mythbusters you watch.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.360
It’s a nice change of pace, and it’s a
novel twist on the standard (read: rather

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.150
worn) puzzle mechanics.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.269
An SNES version came along with the NES, but
since it wasn’t the last of its kind, it’s

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:30.709
not nearly as notable.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.410
Wario’s Woods was one of the first games
for the Wii Virtual Console, or you can obtain

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.060
a copy in Animal Crossing if you’re particularly
lucky.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.930
I came looking for something different, and
something different I did receive.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.490
I’ll soon be back to scouring the big bang
of the NES, but it’s helpful to know where

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.760
things end as you watch them begin.
