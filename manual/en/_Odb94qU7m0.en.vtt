00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.779
Welcome back to thecrochetcrowd.com.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.460
Today's tutorial is all about doing the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.170
Knit Stitch and actually making your

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.299
crochet look like it's virtually

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.099
knitting. So this is a really interesting

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.200
concept and it really does work. It's

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.300
actually quite that's amazing why knit if

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.560
you can do this.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.599
Okay, so what we have here is that we have

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.910
that there're strings coming down in the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.759
front and the back side just like so.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.320
But what happens is that what, if you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.270
turn them in a certain way they'll look

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.700
like they're literally knitting. So now

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.800
it's up to us to change the way that

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.390
we're grabbing it in order to make it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.070
look like knitting. So if you're just

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.020
joining us today we've been working on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.270
this sample throughout the series but it,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.890
you can get started and still do the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.190
same concept right away. So instead, what

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.390
we have been doing I'm gonna do a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.480
Simple Stitch knitted version you can

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.790
also do other versions for the knitting

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.010
as well. It's all a matter where you're

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.770
going to grab this particular project. So

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.660
here we go. So we're just gonna wait, in

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.210
Simple Knit we came in from behind. In

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.729
Purling that we just did is that we came

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.250
in from the back side. In Knit Stitch

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.259
we're gonna go right between those

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.630
two strings, so we're gonna go right

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.539
in to the back side grab the yarn and

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.579
pull it up. And what this is gonna do

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.350
is it's gonna pull these two strings

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.819
so it makes it looks like it's knitting.

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:23.939
So let's go for the next one, so we

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.700
simply come in and go on a diagonal so

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.189
that the other string is on behind and

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.759
pull up and through.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.600
Okay, so in diagonally and both of these

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.020
strings will be one in the front, one in

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.459
the back. Again this is really a quick

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:46.649
process too for your knitting. It, it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.179
really does look like knitting which is

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.859
shocks me half to death you can imagine.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.700
So simply again just, there's two strings

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.679
were coming in just going onto one side

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:02.870
going to the back.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.900
So that's the interesting thing about

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.320
Tunisian crochet is that essentially it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.820
all depends where you grab the project

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.910
in order how it looks. So I'm simply

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.750
diagonal, again this is really no big

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.760
deal.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.190
And then finally on the last one we come

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.920
into the, just like before the chain or

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.220
pull through, okay. So we're ready now to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.530
knit as always.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.360
So we're the first one we wrap and pull

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.210
through one only and then wrap and two.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.380
Wrap and two, wrap and two all the way back.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.620
Oops, I went three that time. See how

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.690
he just backed out and grabbed it, no big

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.810
deal. So I'm gonna show you that one

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.610
more time because we have knitting

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.680
already on now we have the Knit Stitch

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.340
already working like so. So there it

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.190
looks you see that it looks amazing.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.530
So now simply to start the knit, knitting

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.720
again, again we can we come into that same,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.880
first one go back on an angle in between

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.340
the two strings going up and down and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.060
pull through.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.220
So it's essentially, I find this when you have to

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.200
do at least two to three rows before you really

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.910
start seeing the effects of the knitting.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.069
So you can actually start seeing it

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.560
there. Isn't that amazing?

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:46.430
Who knew! I love this, this is really cool.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.260
Apparently there is a way to do this in

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.750
crochet as well. Regular crochet to make

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.010
your stitches look like it's knitting.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.140
That's something I need to figure out yet. But

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.840
that's another tutorial for another time.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.600
So here we go.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.970
You see I kind of got my rhythm I, I know

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.090
what I'm doing. So at the end again just

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.370
a chain make sure there's two strings,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.080
pull through,

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.299
so you're now ready to come back in the

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.320
other direction. So wrap and through, okay

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.660
and now wrap and through two all the way

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.970
back. So you'll notice that the, the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.190
knitting looks a lot tighter. It is

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.520
tighter. So it's a great way, so an afghan

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.870
would take a lot longer for this

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.479
particular process but you can see the

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:40.220
results are just phenomenal. Phenomenal!  And

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.530
again in order to fasten this off, if

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:43.880
you were doing a whole project like that

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.440
you'd still have to do the fastening off

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.510
process in order to make it work.  But

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.169
that is totally, totally incredible. Until

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.209
next time I'm Mikey on behalf of
