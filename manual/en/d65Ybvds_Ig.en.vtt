00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.840
I want to show you guys today how to deal
cards. This is something that’s some people

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.650
can’t just do quite right; I’ll give you
a couple of pointers, Basically, you want

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.710
to push the cards off when you are in mechanics
grip and if you don’t know mechanics grips,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.210
just check out the other video. You are in
mechanics grip you want to push off cards,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.810
you want to try and push them off one at a
time, and you don’t want to have a big spread

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.940
of cards here because it’s going to make
it hard for you to grip on to just one card.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.500
So you are going to try and regulate how many
cards you are pushing over by using these

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.150
three fingers here; that’s kind of a gage.
You can feel how many cards you’re pushing

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:56.500
over and all you want to do is be able to
push off one card at a time. Another thing

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.010
that’s very important when you are dealing
is that you don’t expose the cards in anyway

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.330
and flicking them down like this can obviously
and really expose the cards to other players.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.890
So it’s a good practice and what they do
in casinos is they kind of glide the card

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.190
across the table or just push it right to
the person they just deal with down under

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.800
the table and in front of him and push it
to the person because you don’t want to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.360
have someone prematurely see what the value
of card is. You know if you’ve got a big

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.030
table you don’t really want to push the
card all the way across because it could catch

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.880
a puff of air and then flip over all together
and that’s not good at all. So probably

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.350
the best way of doing it is just to you know
go around, get as close you can to each person

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.549
and just put the card down. There is no need
to flick it down, just place the card down

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.100
in front of the person it belongs to. So that’s
the basics of dealing a card.
