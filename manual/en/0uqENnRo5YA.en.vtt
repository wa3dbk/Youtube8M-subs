Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.834
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:09.367
This week, President Obama
announced a bipartisan

00:00:09.367 --> 00:00:12.667
compromise to reduce the
deficit and avoid default;

00:00:12.667 --> 00:00:15.500
announced an historic fuel
efficiency standard that will

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.633
save American families money;
held a Cabinet Meeting;

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:20.967
and celebrated
his 50th birthday.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:25.500
That's July 29th to August
4th or "Disaster Averted!"

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
(stamp)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.934
Narrator:
On Friday, July 29th,
the President addressed

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:34.934
the nation on the status of debt
negotiations and on the ongoing

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.200
effort to find a bipartisan
solution to reduce the deficit

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.333
and avoid defaulting on our
obligations for the first time

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.700
in our nation's history.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.433
The President:
Raising the debt ceiling simply
gives our country the ability to

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:50.100
pay the bills that Congress
has already racked up.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.567
I want to emphasize that.

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.400
The debt ceiling does not
determine how much more money

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.800
we can spend; it simply
authorizes us to pay the

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.367
bills we already have racked up.

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:03.667
It gives the United States
of America the ability to

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.400
keep its word.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.233
The time for putting
party first is over.

00:01:08.233 --> 00:01:10.200
The time for compromise
on behalf of the American

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.066
people is now.

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:15.800
Narrator:
Later, the President announced
an historic agreement on a fuel

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.700
efficiency standard but
will save American families

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.400
$1.7 trillion in fuel
costs and by 2025,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.900
results in an average
fuel savings of over

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.166
$8,000 per vehicle.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.934
The President:
This agreement on fuel
standards represents the

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:36.567
single most important step we've
ever taken as a nation to reduce

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:38.467
our dependence on foreign oil.

00:01:38.467 --> 00:01:39.133
Think about that.

00:01:39.133 --> 00:01:42.367
(applause)

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.633
So we are happy to welcome
all the auto companies to

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:46.800
this effort.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.667
I also want to point out all
this progress we're talking

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:54.000
about today, the promise
of this agreement;

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.834
it is only possible
because we've made

00:01:56.834 --> 00:01:58.967
investments in technology.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.100
Autoworker:
Appreciate you steppin' up.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.100
Autoworker:
Thank you, so much.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.066
Autoworker:
Thank you for saving our jobs.

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.533
Autoworker:
Thank you, very much, Mr. President.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:07.266
Narrator:
Later in the day, the President
sat down for an interview with

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:09.967
Itar-Tass News Agency of Russia.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:13.300
And then welcomed four
democratically-elected African

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.600
leaders from Niger, Benin,
Guinea and Cote D'Ivoire.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.767
Alyssa Mastromonaco:
We'll have you sign our guest book.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:20.667
Alassane Quattara:
Great.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.000
Narrator:
The President underscored
the importance of moving from

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.800
holding free elections to
developing strong institutions

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.100
and checks and balances;
promoting economic growth

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.834
and development; and
leaving a positive legacy

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:33.967
for their successors.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:34.500
(camera shutters clicking)

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.433
The President:
Despite the impressive
work of all these gentlemen,

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:41.033
I've said before, and
I think they all agree,

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:43.867
Africa does not need
strong men; Africa needs

00:02:43.867 --> 00:02:44.934
strong institutions.

00:02:44.934 --> 00:02:49.800
So we were working with them
as partners to build effective

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.467
judiciaries, strong
civil societies,

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.900
legislators that are
effective and inclusive,

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.300
making sure that human
rights are protected.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.266
Narrator:
On Sunday, July 31st,
the President held a news

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.600
conference to announce the
"bipartisan compromise" to

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.667
reduce the deficit and
raise the debt limit.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.700
The President:
It will allow us
to avoid default;

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.333
it will allow us
to pay our bills;

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.734
it will allow us to start
reducing our deficit in a

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:18.333
responsible way; and it will
allow us to turn to the very

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:20.934
important business of doing
everything we can to create

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:24.834
jobs, boost wages and grow
this economy faster than it's

00:03:24.834 --> 00:03:25.934
currently growing.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.500
Narrator:
On Tuesday, August 2nd, as the
final votes were announced from

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.967
the floor of the Senate
Chamber, the President

00:03:31.967 --> 00:03:35.467
prepared to address the American
people on the compromise that had

00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:38.834
been reached to reduce the
deficit; avert an economically

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:42.700
disastrous default; and the
next steps that must be taken

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.934
on a larger plan to address
our fiscal responsibilities.

00:03:46.934 --> 00:03:50.767
The President:
Voters may have chosen divided
government but they sure didn't

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:52.633
vote for dysfunctional government.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:55.300
We've got to do everything in
our power to grow this economy

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.166
and put America back to work.

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:58.667
That's what I intend to do.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:00.233
And I'm looking forward
to working with Congress

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:01.400
to make it happen.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.367
Narrator:
That afternoon, after Bill
S.365, or the Budget Control

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:08.600
Act of 2011, arrived
at the White House --

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.567
(stamp)

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:11.533
-- it traveled to
the clerk's office,

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:12.500
where it was date stamped --

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.100
(stamp)

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.600
-- then on to the Staff
Secretary's Office where

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.000
it was announced, and finally
to the Oval Office where the

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.100
President signed the Bill into law.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.734
Later, the President welcomed
the crew of the Space Shuttle

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.967
Endeavour, and the U.S.
Commander of the International

00:04:29.967 --> 00:04:34.834
Space Station Expedition 26 to the Oval Office and congratulated

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:38.133
them on their recent return
and their successful mission.

00:04:38.133 --> 00:04:42.600
The President:
The only persons more relieved
to have you guys back here than

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.900
me are your families, obviously.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.600
And you couldn't have made us
prouder on the last mission.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.467
I had a great time
calling up there.

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:54.967
And, you know, I think it's
a great way to cap off an

00:04:54.967 --> 00:04:57.033
extraordinary career
of the shuttle.

00:04:57.033 --> 00:05:01.500
Narrator:
On Wednesday, August 3rd, the
President held a Cabinet Meeting

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.900
where he spoke about the need
to end the stalemate in Congress

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.266
over the FAA, another
Washington-made crisis,

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.967
leaving tens of thousands
of folks out of work.

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:14.767
The President:
This is a lose-lose-lose
situation that can be easily

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:19.467
solved if Congress gets back
into town and does its job.

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:22.400
And they don't even have
to come back into town.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.300
The House and the Senate could,
through a procedural agreement,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.100
basically do this through
unanimous consent and they

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.467
can have the fights that they
want to have when they get back.

00:05:32.467 --> 00:05:35.300
Don't put the livelihoods of
thousands of people at risk;

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.400
don't put projects at risk; and
don't let a billion dollars,

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.533
at a time when we're scrambling
for every dollar we can,

00:05:46.533 --> 00:05:49.467
get left on the table because
Congress did not act.

00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:52.667
Narrator:
On Thursday, August 4th, the
President celebrated his 50 birthday.

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:55.033
White House Staffers:
(singing)
♪♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪♪

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:58.000

And thanks again for checking
out your West Wing Week!

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:05.667
(applause)

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:08.667
The President:
I'm glad that I have a chance
to see some of the great cars

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.066
that you are manufacturing.

00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:14.033
As some of you may know, it's
only a matter of time until

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.033
Malia gets her
learner's permit --

00:06:16.033 --> 00:06:16.967
(laughter)

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:20.967
-- so I'm hoping to see one of
those models that gets a top

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.367
speed of 15 miles an hour!

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:24.834
(laughter)

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:29.800
The ejector seat any
time boys are in the car.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.433
(laughter)

00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:32.800
So hopefully you guys have
some of those in the pipeline!
