00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:11.219
[Introduction slides to background music]

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.650
[PAUSE]

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:19.080
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: Scientists from the Australian
Institute of Sport have pioneered a new form

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.300
of immersive technology that allows cyclists
to experience every aspect of the Olympic

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.520
course without ever having been there.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.949
&gt;&gt;Dr David Martin: What Project Deja Vu is
all about is to try to capture as much information

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.670
as possible during test events so you can
come back to Australia and essentially recreate

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940
the specific demands of competition.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.649
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: Cyclists train on a bicycle mounted
in front of a large screen which runs footage

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:47.610
of the actual course.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.280
The bicycle is computer programmed to provide
the same amount of friction as the cyclist

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.050
would experience on the course cycling up
a hill.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.930
&gt;&gt;Female cyclist: You can definitely feel
coming down here ‘cause there is resistance,

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.719
and then that’s when your gears come into
play so you’ll ramp them up so you can then

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:05.719
get your speed going.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.909
And you get to ride the course, you get to
see where you’re going, see where the corners

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:13.209
are, see where the descents are so you can
really get a good idea of the course and what’s

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:19.170
involved as opposed to just sitting and riding
and not being able to visually see where you

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.170
at what point.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.560
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: Athletes work with coaches, dieticians
and experts in skill acquisition to optimise

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.679
their performance on the course.

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.289
&gt;&gt;Dr David Martin: What happens is we take
the information we collect when we’re over

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:36.179
in London, we come back and on the bicycle
behind me and on the TV screen in front of

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.859
me, the cyclist can actually experience a
virtual reality.

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.930
This allows the cyclist to practice their
sports nutrition – when would I drink, how

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.049
much would I drink?

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.770
It also allows them to practice their pacing
strategies – when should I hold myself back

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.340
a little, when can I open it up and give as
much as I possibly can?

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.859
And the idea by going through this creation
of these simulated environments is that when

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.959
the athletes get over to London they’re
not giving a tentative effort, they’re giving

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.410
a maximal effort and they feel very, very
confident that they’ve left no stone unturned

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.489
– a cliché but a good one – and that
they’re actually able to give what they

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.180
feel is their very best effort.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.519
&gt;&gt;Voiceover: Project Deja Vu is just one avenue
the AIS is exploring in its quest to help

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.819
cyclists perform better.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.239
&gt;&gt;Dr David Martin: Australian sports science
has been very innovative over the years but

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.989
it’s fair to say that there are a number
of countries that are copying the Australian

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.459
Institute of Sport model.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.590
Every year we have groups from China, Japan,
New Zealand, America, Canada, France, Germany,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.489
Great Britain, they come and they look at
this model.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.459
How has Australia become so successful in
such a short period of time?

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.190
And obviously a lot of countries want to emulate
what’s going on here at the Australian Institute

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.010
of Sport.
