{textColor:65280,65280,65280}{width:960}{justify:center}

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.620
{plain}

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.120
[00:00:07.66]
In the previous chapter, we experimented

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.080
with the Merge Path shape effect to go

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.759
[00:00:12.39]
ahead and create a complex

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.000
compound shape for multiple paths.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.220
[00:00:15.81]
We used those to create

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.070
variation on this gear look.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.360
[00:00:19.23]
However, there is a whole group of

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.160
different shapes effects that are worth

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.330
[00:00:23.44]
exploring, and that's what

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.330
we'll do in this chapter.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.211
[00:00:25.67]
Now if you like, you can go back to

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:33.350
your original rounded rectangle, turn off

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.140
[00:00:29.62]
the polystar so you have the simple shape.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.769
[00:00:31.18]
Or let's get some more practice in.

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:39.780
[00:00:33.11]
Select the comps folder, make a new

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.239
composition.

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.239
Size isn't so important.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.530
[00:00:38.63]
I'm going to choose the NTSC Square

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.909
Pixel size just for starters, click OK,

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.729
[00:00:44.05]
solid-color fill, solid-color stroke,

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.859
whatever color you like.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.050
How about back to the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.699
[00:00:51.27]
red we were working with earlier?

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.329
[00:00:52.55]
And now change your shape selection to Star.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.569
[00:00:57.53]
Star is the most complex of the

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:05.750
parametric shapes, so this will give you more

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.140
[00:01:02.12]
options to play with later on.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310
[00:01:03.48]
Go to my Comp panel, toggle apostrophe,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.000
just to make sure I'm more or less centered.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.530
[00:01:08.13]
It's not critical, but it'll just give

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.880
us room to play with.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
Apostrophe again to

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.100
[00:01:11.84]
make it go away and drag out my polystar.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.600
[00:01:15.11]
I'm now actually going to knock it

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.549
down to a fairly simple four-point star.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.939
[00:01:19.90]
Press Shift to center out the rotation.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:26.939
[00:01:22.39]
But this is a more

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.520
interesting shape than just a rectangle.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.530
[00:01:24.29]
Now I'll release the mouse.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.719
[00:01:24.74]
And as before, we have a shape layer

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.820
with a shape group called Polystar.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.619
[00:01:32.82]
There's this particular parameters, such

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.579
as a number of Points, Inner and Outer

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.060
[00:01:36.46]
Radius, rounding, et cetera.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.260
I'll twirl that up.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.020
[00:01:39.93]
Most of the shape effects can

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.000
be applied after a shape group.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.130
[00:01:43.77]
However, I like to keep things inside

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.260
the shape group just for organization.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.810
[00:01:47.14]
So I'm going to make sure I have by

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.800
group selected before I use the Add button.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.121
[00:01:50.97]
The first one we're going to

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:58.729
play around with is Trim Paths.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.090
[00:01:55.85]
This is a way you can make a shape layer

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.539
draw on or draw off by animating the

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.220
[00:02:00.90]
Start or End properties.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.690
[00:02:04.67]
If we turn off our fill for a second

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.150
and did Trim Paths, you'll see we'd be

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.620
[00:02:11.28]
trimming just our stroke.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.430
[00:02:13.13]
Now I'll turn that fill back on.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.700
[00:02:18.57]
If you have multiple shapes inside your

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.930
shape group, you can go ahead and draw them

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.260
[00:02:24.10]
all on simultaneously or one after the other.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.870
[00:02:27.84]
This is very similar to what the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.099
Stroke effect could do with mask shapes.

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.780
[00:02:33.24]
One other thing that's kind of

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.381
interesting about Trim Paths is if you want
to

00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.620
[00:02:35.71]
have a partial path, like say that much,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.020
you can use the Offset parameter to

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.319
[00:02:41.13]
chase around your shape.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.990
[00:02:43.20]
Again, that's particularly useful if you

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.709
happen to set your fill off and all you

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.360
[00:02:48.95]
have is a stroke, because now you'll

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.629
chase around the outline of your shape.

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.890
[00:02:52.68]
I can turn off my Outlines, so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.200
you can see that more in isolation.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.549
[00:03:00.45]
I'll turn this back on so

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.409
you can see the original shape.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.349
[00:03:04.24]
Like all other elements of a shape

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.379
group, you do have a visibility eyeball

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.460
[00:03:07.97]
right next to your shape effects.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.790
And I'll just turn off Trim Paths for now.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.209
[00:03:12.72]
I'll select my shape group again and

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.069
this time pick something a little bit

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.000
[00:03:16.30]
more fun, like Twist.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.019
[00:03:19.28]
What Twist does is very simply

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.400
twist your shape around a center point.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.439
[00:03:23.74]
And you can see you can quickly

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.800
create really cool things like saw blades,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.030
[00:03:28.62]
tribal tattoo forms, et cetera.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.310
[00:03:31.60]
Since twist is happening after your

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.489
shape path, any change to your shape path

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.970
[00:03:38.14]
will then get twisted.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.629
[00:03:39.64]
For example, if you were to animate

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.489
the radius, you'll get some interesting

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.489
[00:03:44.52]
effects.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.049
Same with things such as the
Roundness; those will get twisted as well.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.670
And I'll undo.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.299
[00:03:51.37]
Twirl that up, twirl up Twist, and turn that

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.299
off.

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.299
[00:03:55.17]
Select my group, and we'll

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.760
keep getting more complex.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.150
[00:03:58.68]
Beyond Twist is one of my

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.610
favorite shape effects, Pucker &amp; Bloat.

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.069
[00:04:03.61]
Not only does it have great name, it

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.330
creates some very fun distortions to your
shapes.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.590
[00:04:09.03]
Basically it decides if the segments

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.070
between vertices of the shape get bowed

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.830
[00:04:15.03]
outward or pulled inward.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.910
[00:04:17.54]
Outward is bloating, inward is

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.500
puckering, and you'll see some interesting
things

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.500
[00:04:24.47]
happen at the vertices.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.530
[00:04:25.67]
As you pucker in, the overshoot back out again.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.500
[00:04:28.06]
So this is a way of quickly

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.700
creating some very complex shapes.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.670
[00:04:34.34]
So as you can see how things fill in,

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.700
I'll turn on that solid color again.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.020
[00:04:39.18]
This, like virtually any other primary

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.390
shape layers, can be animated, so you can

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.220
[00:04:43.24]
create some really fun graphical animations

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.940
[00:04:47.02]
with frankly a minimum

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.190
amount of work on your part.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.850
[00:04:49.56]
For example, this shape would have

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.550
taken quite a while to draw by hand, but

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.770
[00:04:53.04]
instead, it's just a four-

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.900
point star and a shape affect.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.570
[00:04:57.00]
I'll knock this down a little bit so

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.380
you can see what's going on, and again any

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.040
[00:05:01.46]
changes to say the Radius of

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.100
your shapes affect the final result.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.530
[00:05:07.66]
Twirl this up and turn

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:16.080
off Pucker &amp; Bloat for now.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.720
[00:05:12.32]
If a Pucker &amp; Bloat is a bit too organic

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.960
for you, it's hard-edge brother is Zig Zag.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.630
[00:05:18.40]
Once I turn that on, you'll see we get

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.850
these serrated teeth along the segments

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.410
[00:05:24.37]
of our particular shape.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.740
[00:05:25.56]
I'll twirl that open, and you have

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.190
a couple of different parameters.

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.940
[00:05:28.98]
You have the number of ridges per

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.580
segment between vertices, so I can knock

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.590
[00:05:33.78]
that down, just get big

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.340
teeth, increase their size.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.520
[00:05:36.03]
Again the more you push, the more

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.990
you overlap and the more interesting

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.990
[00:05:39.90]
shapes that you get.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.430
[00:05:40.90]
I'll knock this down to something

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.530
more sensible, like around there, and you

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:51.520
[00:05:44.39]
can also choose whether or not you get hard-edged

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.040
zigzags or rounded corners to your zigzag.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.160
[00:05:50.77]
Now hopefully you're seeing

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.490
already how fun shape layers can be.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.960
[00:05:54.96]
I mean even you create all sorts of

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.100
complex graphical elements relatively easily.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.650
[00:05:59.35]
I'll turn off Zig Zag and try another one.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:09.680
[00:06:03.67]
Rounded Corners is obviously a very simple

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.680
one.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.680
[00:06:06.27]
In this case where I have this star,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.680
you can go ahead and round of those edges.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.240
[00:06:09.25]
Now since there are rounding parameters

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.970
in parametric shapes, you don't need to

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.610
[00:06:14.13]
use Round Corners to achieve that effect.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.880
[00:06:16.20]
But if you've drawn something with

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.410
the Pen tool and you have sharp edges,

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.870
[00:06:19.88]
rounding gives you a way of softening

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.130
those edges or to animate the amount of

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.770
[00:06:23.23]
rounding in the path that you've drawn.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.230
[00:06:24.96]
I'll turn that one off.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.380
[00:06:38.01]
