Hi my name is Lucy Spain on behalf of Expert
Village here to talk about cheerleading stunts.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:13.790
Now there are lots of stunts we can perform
on all girl squads. You can use as many as

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.359
two people and then you can use up to five
people, which is what you usually use when

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.500
you're doing the basic stunts. Now the most
simple all girl stunts is going to be shoulder

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.520
sit. Now the shoulder sit is basically going
to be one girl sitting on top of another girl's

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.070
shoulder. Now the best way to get up into
the stunt, I know we all do it with our friends

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.840
and joke around and just hop on up there.
That's really not going to look appropriate

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.200
if you're doing that in a game setting. So
if you're going to be the base, you're going

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.839
to want to make sure you've got a nice solid
wide stance. You're going to want to put one

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.469
leg out so she has a stepping stool right
here. She's going to put her inner leg, we

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.920
like to call this the pocket in cheerleading,
because it makes a nice stepping stool. You're

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.030
going to want to keep your hands stiff above
your head like this, so she can step in, swing

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.821
her back leg over, once you feel that she
is secure you hold both hands, step up and

00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:10.880
then we're going to want to grasp onto her.
She's going to link behind and we're going

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.150
to push down on the top of her legs. We can
also get into a shoulder stand that way, which

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.510
would be one girl standing on the other girl's
shoulders. It's going to be the same entry.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.720
She's going to step, then step. Once you feel
she's secure, you're going to keep holding

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.910
on with one hand until she stands directly
up, then we're going to want to pull down

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.971
on her calves as hard as we can on top of
the calf muscles to lock her on. Now if you're

00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:40.290
flying, it's really important to squeeze your
ankles together around the back of the person's

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.770
neck and head. Now that we've covered the
two person stunts, we can move onto the basic

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.090
all girl stunts. We're going to need five
people to do this stunt. You can get away

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.130
with four, but it's best to have five if possible.
We're going to have our two bases, our primary

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.110
base; we're going to have our secondary base.
These girls are going to be responsible for

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.390
getting the girls up in the air. We're going
to have our flier, and behind her we're going

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.200
to have a back spot and a front spot. Now
as the bases, it's really important to remember

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.650
to keep a flat back at all times. We don't
want to be hunched and curled over. So you're

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.550
going to get injured that way. We want to
make sure that you bend from your waist and

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.450
your knees and as stay stiff as possible when
we're lifting up, power from the knees. Keep

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.860
a stance. If you're a different height than
your other base, one girl may have to be all

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.390
the way up, another girl may have to spread
her legs a little wider to get even. The front

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.361
and back spots' main responsibility is to
help load the flier in, the back spot?s; you

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:45.860
need to hold those ankles. And flier, it's
your job to trust the people beneath you,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.150
stay tight, and ride it up in the air. Once
we're in the basic position, which we'll call

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.540
a half right here, we can go all the way up
into a full, or we can go all the way up into

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:57.570
one-legged stunts.
