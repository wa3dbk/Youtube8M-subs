Hey Geeks, this is James from Accessory Geeks
and today we'll be taking a look at VanD Flashing

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.970
LED TPU Case for the Samsung Galaxy S4.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.440
This is a very unique case because it takes
advantage of a feature that is not so well

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.369
known in the Galaxy phones and this feature
is called "Flash Notifications".

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.920
Now, you can access "Flash Notifications"
in the accessibility menu and when you do,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.219
it turns the flash on every time you get a
notification, like a text or a call, but this

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:47.791
case uses that and kind of channels that light
around to the edges or, in this case, the

00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:52.160
whole case and the case lights up as you get
texts.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:24.430
Really, the best way I think to demonstrate
this is to show you, so here we go.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.810
Now this feature doesn't actually require
an external battery or any additional battery

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.980
or anything else because it just uses the
on board battery and the on board flash which

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.600
is already built into the phone in order to
activate the case lighting up.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.450
As a result, it does take some battery, but
according to VanD this only takes less than

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.750
1% of the battery life per full day of use,
which is pretty excellent.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.320
Now, just to go over the case really quick,
it is a one piece TPU case.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.920
So TPU being a sort of hard rubber or soft
plastic.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.630
It's a durable material, but it has a nice
flex to it so it fits in there quite easily.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.910
As you'll see, the cut outs are very accurate;
everything pretty much perfectly.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.230
The case even fits in here nice and snug,
with a good lip around the edges.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.780
The buttons are very tactile and it's a stylish
case - it feels very nice in the hands.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.770
This has a little bit of a texture to it,
very nice.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.990
If you need to use the flash, just flip this
down, use the flash and when you're done,

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.730
close it and you can use flash notification
again, which is quite excellent.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.100
It comes in three colors.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.700
We got this hot pink, this dark navy and this
rainbow love.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.319
Now, if you're interested in this case or
