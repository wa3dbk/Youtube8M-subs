coffee shop brought to you by aromacup.com

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.960
got a quick and easy recipe for you
today we're gonna show you how to make a

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.149
Cafe' Latte

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:51.239
By making use of the Keurig Rivo single serve espresso machine

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.830
It features Lavazza Technology

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.390
so it's not going to give you a really
great  espresso and let you get

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.720
That real kindof specialty
coffee drink

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.320
taste that you want without paying the specialty coffee price

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.040
and you can do it in your own at home
coffee shop which is my personal

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.950
favorite part

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.489
Let's dive in and show you this quick and easy recipe.

00:01:09.589 --> 00:01:13.200
OK, so all you're going to need for
this recipe is going to be some milk

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.619
And you can use pretty much any type of milk
that you would want uh... i have just

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:18.410
regular cow's milk here

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.460
you wanna make sure it's cold and you
can use hemp, you can use soy

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.050
And all of these different types of milk, whatever you may want to use.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.310
You need some milk

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.320
uh... usually you're gonna want at least
eight ounces maybe a little bit more

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.360
depend on how much you want to heat up

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.450
you going to need a uh... Revo pack
for your Rivo  machine, these are

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.189
specific to the Rivo

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.289
they only work with this machine that's
going to give you your shot of espresso and of

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:42.920
course you need an empty cup

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.350
And you need any flavors or sweeteners you
might want to add we've got some ginger

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.720
syrup some raspberry and we've got some chocolate so you've got a lot of different things

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.930
that you can do

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.930
making your

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.829
latte

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.270
using the Kuerig Rivo

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.799
So let's dive in and talk about how it's done.

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.790
So the first thing you're going to do is you're going to make your shot of espresso

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.840
open up the brew basket on the top of your machine
place to Revo pack clothes that were

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.219
and now place your Rivo pack and now place your mug

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.260
choose the espresso shot size you would
like to do, now, I'm going to do a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.859
lungo, which is usually a double
shot, I'm just going to press the button on the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.559
far left machine right here

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:23.130
machine gets going very quickly it's got
a very high pressure pump

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.719
uh... in the machine running about
fifteen bar

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.499
and that is

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.380
actually more than adequate enough to
give you a nice shot  of espresso it's

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.460
very important when pulling espresso

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.610
that you have very good pressure

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.980
and you have properly tamped espresso

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.080
you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.780
The Espresso that's inside of those
Rivo Packs is tamped to a specific

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.330
pressure so that you're going to get the
right amount of uh... coffee out of your

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.429
shot of espresso

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.299
this is all very important because
that's where you can get that flavor that you've

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.279
really come to expect otherwise is just
going to taste like watery coffee and

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.859
that simply is no good

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.459
now that pressure as well as you mention
is going to give you that nice layering

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:03.350
on your shot

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.599
you can see right here that i've got a nice
crema on the top

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.679
and then i have sort of this coloration
going down to the bottom it shows that

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.209
I've got a nice shot of espresso

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:14.810
Now I'm just going to leave that guy there

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.680
Now my milk I've already added to my pitcher and something I've mentioned about

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.160
The Revo before is that when you pull
this pitcher out to you fill it up with

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.699
milk

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.059
we filled it to the max fill line here on
the pitcher, when you push back in you (machine beeps)

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.509
wanna hear that beep is important because it lets you know the machine is ready

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:32.949
to start frothing your milk

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.489
Now you just need to choose the type of froth you would like to do, I'm going to use the

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:37.630
Latte froth

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.519
which is the button in the center of the machine right here

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:45.010
Immediately the Rivo is going to get work and it's going to start spinning up

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.990
frothing my milk, and of course it's going to
inject air into it to give me that

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.749
froth as well as it has a frothing whisk

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.989
inside of that pitcher

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:58.159
And it's going to heat my milk up, so it's basically going to do all the work for me.

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:01.429
Now the other thing I should mention is the machine
definitely moves very quickly it's

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.269
something I really like is that you
basically press a button and it gets

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:05.209
going

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.010
A lot of single serve machines I'm used to pressing the button

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.200
and waiting and waiting until it starts
doing something

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.799
and then it brews

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:16.349
and we know we know that a single serve
coffee the whole purpose really when you

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:17.849
come right down to it is speed

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.739
you want this drink, you want it fast

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:23.080
You want ot save some money and you're going to do that when you use a one stop shop machine

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.439
like the Keurig Rivo.

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.430
Ok, so

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.229
enough talking let's get to coffee, right?
We've got our milk,

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:34.679
and it is ready and frothed. Now because
i did a latte froth,  I'm not going to have

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:35.980
as much

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.319
Foam, and you're going to notice
that i do that we have some foam here

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.960
but i have a lot more hot milk that's
because with a latte,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.869
we typically are going to have

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.529
a lot more uh... hot milk than we are going to have foam.  Now I"m going to get

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:52.759
adventurous and I'm going to use some of the ginger syrup that i have here today

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:56.150
might be a little too much but we'll see
it never hurts you've go to experiment that's

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.710
what we do here at Aromacup.com

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.260
So we'll do a little ginger syrup

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.370
And now I'm jusg going to simply pour my milk in

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.270
going to get my milk first

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.330
and then i'll get my foam

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.159
that looks pretty great to me and now

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.990
Of course, I can stir that up a little bit i
can add a little bit of cocoa or cinnamon

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.479
To the top or put some more sweetener
in or I've got my Latte,

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:23.570
and i did all that in just under
about five minutes which is pretty great

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.280
for single serve machine i have to say
i've been very impressed with the

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:30.640
Rivo, the flavor of the espresso is
awesome, the milk frother works great,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.649
It does its job very very quickly and it does on
one machine which is super cool

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:38.239
So there you go guys, again all you need for this is you need that Rivo Pack, you need some

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:43.069
milk and of course you need your Kuerig Rivo machine, and our recipe coming to you here
