00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.300
I've been flying on so many different aircraft fleet, all this years

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Old already. Are you recording, no right?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.900
Have to keep the children quite and happy, in order to have a happy flight

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900
I think all they want is comfort

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.900
Since July till today, I've not seen the aircraft empty

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.900
My life as cabin crew, I met the man of my life, I've two kids

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.500
and looking forward for a few more years 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This is my 32nd year

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.500
I'm the oldest crew in the aircraft today

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.900
I grew up with the airline.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I joined the airline when I was 20 years old - now I'm 52

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.900
What are you going to do in London this time?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This time I'm going to London, to close the agreement on the A380 engine

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.000
Our guys actually learnt a lot. Just to let you know this aircraft got a motherboard

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900
It's good to have partner like oneworld

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.900
and the use each other's strength

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.900
and good reputation as well

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.900
Hello everyone! The kids are here.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900
Total? How many toilets? Eight!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Hello everyone! The kids are here.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.900
This is where we put the meals but there's no more meals here now because all the meals is in your stomach.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.900
This is where the cabin crew sit, who wants to try?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.900
Tighten the seat belt under your belly

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
This is how we sit during take off and landing

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.900
I think they (kids) are very excited to see the specs of the aircraft

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.900
I've been a private pilot but this is completely different ball game

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.500
A lot more exciting

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900
It's a lot more challenging

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.400
It's a new step for MAS

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.900
We're going to be part of a really excellent alliance, oneworld

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.400
with very prominent airlines as a members

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.000
Like BA (British Airways), Qantas, Cathay (Pacific), Japan (Airlines)

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:50.000
Looking forward to show the other member airlines

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.000
What Malaysia Airlines can do!
