Drinks with Diablo

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The Horse's Neck cocktail.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Welcome back !

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It's another episode of Drinks with Diablo

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with your host, Jöhnny Dîablø 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
for TheFNDC.com. And today, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we're making a classic drink. It goes back

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to the 1890s, the Horse's Neck.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And why is it called the Horses Neck?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, we're going to find that out in a minute.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What you're going to need are some lemons,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
some ginger ale, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and some Jameson Irish whiskey.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
OK. So, here's the whole deal:

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You get a...it's a tall drink, so you're going to need a tall glass.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You need a lemon.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now what you're going to do...

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
OH, first off...Hold on.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I'm skipping a step.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You cut some lemon slices and put some

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
at the bottom of the glass.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Like so. Throw down.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Like that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Mmm-kay. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Those are a little thin, oh well.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Ok, so you've got lemon slices. NOW,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
What we're going to do is...

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this is where it gets the name

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the Horses Neck.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We're going to peel...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is a fat lemon, too. I don't know if you noticed.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You're going to peel

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this time we'll just get the peel

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
just one continuous peel as far as we can take it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And THAT is how it gets the name

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the Horses Neck.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
'Cause it's a long chunk of peel; I guess its similar to a horse's neck.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Or so they must have thought a long time ago.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Oh yes. Look at that. One continuous peel.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
[ continues peeling lemon ]

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Hey, this is home grown.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Homegrown lemon off a lemon tree.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Thank you to my girlfriend's mom

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for planting that tree. OK.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Look at that. Whooooaa. CRAZY.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's epic. Okay, that's perfect. You might not

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
get one this big with lemons from the store, but

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you can always hope, right?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay, so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[ laughs ]

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Put that in there, throw some ice...

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
yes! Stuff that sucker in there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yes, lots of peel.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Normally, this would be, like,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I don't know, a multi-step thing.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You'd probably have two lemons worth here.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Or just one lemon and just stuff it hella.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You would normally have more ice

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to hold it all in place, 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but this is the epic lemon of all time.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
* Don't forget to twist it, because I forgot here *

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
What we're going to do...

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
you've got all that lemon, your beautiful lemon rind

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
in there, and THAT is what's going to give it it's flavor:

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The lemon rind. You're going to fill this up with Jameson

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
About, I don't know...halfway.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Probably I should add more ice in there.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
To be honest it's all peel right now.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
&gt;&gt; Amy: [ laughs ]

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: I know ! 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Hey man, St. Patrick's Day.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So, halfway up. You got ice, you got -

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
you get the general gist of this, right?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
OK, good.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Jameson, and ginger ale.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's really similar to a Spicy Irish

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
except no gingerbread liqueur.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's really similar to a Big Ginger.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
[ pours ginger ale ]

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Just like that. And

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
here we go. And when you get to the bottom, you can squeeze the lemon out.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
You get all that flavor, You get all that Jameson

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and all that ginger ale.Let's take a taste.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
[ tries some Horses Neck cocktail ]

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
That is very Irish-y. Lots of Jameson,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
lots of ginger ale, lots of lemony goodness in there. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
OK.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You probably could squeeze those lemons, too,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
at the bottom, before you put them in. Anyway,
