00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.570
At some point you may have to use a database
that was created by someone else.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.810
This happens often when you start a new job
and this lesson we're actually going to work

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.550
with an existing database as well - The Ready
to Read database.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.460
One of the common tasks you'll do when working
with a database is create reports.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.720
Reports are one of the ways you can extract
information from the database tables and display

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.450
that information in a meaningful way.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.370
Basically, reports summarize and present data
that is stored in tables.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.250
Reports in Access can look just like any report
you create manually in Word.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.470
The difference with Access is that you don't
have to enter the data directly into the report

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.250
like you have to when you're working with
the Word document.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.610
Instead the report is created using information
you've already stored in your database tables.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.240
Let's take a look at if you are the ways you
can create reports in Access.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.400
To see these, just select the Create tab and
then locate the reports group.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:22.030
You can create a new blank report in design
view or in layout view.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.280
You can also create a simple report using
this report's commands, which produces a report

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.640
automatically or use the Reports Wizard to
specify the details you want to include in

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.700
your report.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.550
In this lesson, we'll take a look at the reports
command and the reports wizard.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.340
Let's get started by creating a report automatically
using the reports command.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.100
First click the table or query in the navigation
pane that contains the data that you wish

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.580
to include in the report.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.310
When you create a report using this command,
you can only use data from one source.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.330
For example, to print off my customer mailing
list, I would select the customer info table.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.080
Then click the reports command.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.170
Access automatically generates reports that
include all the fields in the customer info

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.200
table.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.230
See how fast that was?

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.670
You can edit and format an Access Report - just
like you would in other Microsoft Office Software.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.010
We'll talk more about that in another lesson.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.080
If you want to have more control over the
fields that appear in the report or want to

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.450
use information from multiple tables, and
you need a little help from Access in creating

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.800
the reports, the Reports Wizard may be right
for you.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.730
Just click the Reports Wizard command and
a dialog box will appear.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.780
First, you need to select the query or table
you want to use in the report.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.170
Let's see.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.790
I want to create a report that includes the
titles of the books that people of the various

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:14.790
states ordered.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.570
So, I'll select the customer info table.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.550
The fields in the table will appear in the
Available Fields area.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.060
Just select the field you want to add and
click the right arrow button to add it to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.780
the list of selected fields.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.730
Do this until all the desired fields are added.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.340
If you want to add all the fields just click
the double right arrow.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.630
You can also click the left arrow button to
remove a field from the selected list.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.360
I actually want to add everything except the
customer ID.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.750
To switch to another table just click the
dropdown arrow and select a different table

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.930
or query.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.190
I'll select the books table.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:10.019
And then select the fields that you want to
include in the report.

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.730
When you are ready, click Next.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.349
During this next stage of the Wizard, you'll
be asked a few questions about how you want

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:21.910
the information in the report to be displayed.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.940
This will vary based on the field you include
in the report.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.600
Right now were asked how we want to view the
data.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.300
If you switch between by Books and by Customer
Info, you will see the image on the right

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.850
change.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.800
I actually want to organize the reports arranged
by the state.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.620
So, I'll select by Customer Info.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.340
Then click next.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.430
You then may be asked whether you want to
group.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.590
I actually want to organize the information
by state, so I'll select that and then click

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.310
the right arrow.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.050
When you do that, the image on the right will
change to reflect the new organization.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.800
Click Next.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.300
Then you are asked how do you want to sort
the records in the report.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.600
For this example, our only option is title,
so we'll select that and then click Next.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.720
You now have some choices about layouts and
orientation.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.480
You can click each layout's option to see
how it affects the report.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.950
I'll just set it back to stepped, and click
Next.

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.300
Now choose a style.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.960
As you select each one, you'll see a preview
of it on the left.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.360
This style will be applied to the report to
give it a professional look and feel.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.900
Once you find one you like, click Next and
then enter a name for the report.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:05.270
Finally, you have to decide whether to preview
the reports or to modify the design.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.250
We'll learn more about modifying report formatting
later.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.289
So, we'll click Finish.

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:16.919
And the report opens in print preview format.

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:23.290
If we scroll to the right, we can see all
the fields we selected from both tables are

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.720
included in the report.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.830
Also, the information is arranged by state.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.759
Reports are a powerful tool that allow you
to extract information from one or more tables

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.729
and present it in a way that is easy to understand.

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.300
Reports can be viewed on the computer or printed
for ease of use.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.960
We'll talk about modifying and formatting
reports and another lesson.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:54.230
But for now, spend some time using the Reports
command to create automatic reports and the

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.410
Reports Wizard to create reports with specific
fields from multiple tables.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.930
You'll soon see how robust the Access reporting
tools really are.
