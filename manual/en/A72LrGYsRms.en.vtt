[crunching sound]

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.600
Greetings Wheezies it's august eleventh

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.100
After listening to all your song submissions last night

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.614
I grew tired so excuse me if I seem a bit stationary today

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.520
in the comments

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.020
ihatetheshirtstoo said that I looked shaggy.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.829
I don't know what you are talking about that makes me angry

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:22.980
I'm not going to dignify that with a response

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.020
[comical sound effect]

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.880
Billions of you sent in awesome songs about chips and salsa to see if you could win the Benzene t-shirt featured in many of my

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.840
movies

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.140
Today is the day we decide the winner.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.280
My entire cast and crew worked hard all night trying to figure out which song was the best

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.840
And you know who showed up to help? Kelly Clarkson. And Chewbacca. And a hamster. Then one guy left and came back upside-down

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.680
[music in background] My brand new windows were no help at all. It was a long difficult process, but I think we handled it with ease

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
And we finally decided on a winner!

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.120

[Chips and Salsa are fun to eat. [so fun] It's an authentic Mexican treat [oh so Mexican] green or red or spicy or mild

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.039
Salsa comes from onions and tomatoes garlic and peppers and cilantro not potatoes

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.860
Scoop it in a chip and stuff it in your face. Try not to get it all over the place.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.860
Chips and Salsa!

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.160
