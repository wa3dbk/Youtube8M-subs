Hey John JT here from Handy Toyota like I told you I was going to do a quick video for you to show you the truck that I am pricing you out on 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.400
what we will do is we will do a walk around on the truck so you some of those neat features that are on this particular one

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:21.400
again this is the 14 SR5 TRD off road as we walk around 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.120
you can see you do get the TRD rims and the different tire a little bit more aggressive tire that comes on just the SR5 you do have the tow mirrors on this one as well

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.920
they do extend out and you do have the  blinker built in 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.520
in the back of the truck you can see that you have the blistein suspension 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.660
as well as the other neat feature that is added on to this truck which is that TRD dual exhaust 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:01:04.320
(Exhaust Noise)

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.760
alright John so here we are on the inside of this Tundra we are about to talk about the one biggest rare thing about this truck

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.040
this is an SR5 TRD but it does come with a shifter on the column and a bench seat

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.400
so you do have six passenger seating with storage inside this as well as underneath the seat here

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.280
I cannot stress enough how rare of a truck this is you usually will get the center console here with the shifter on the floor 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.880
so this is very rare obviously you have your AC air conditioning and you heating here 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:42.240
touch screen radio with XM radio free for 90 days on the steering wheel you have all your Bluetooth controls and all your audio controls 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.800
obviously power windows power door locks and cruise control are standard

00:01:45.802 --> 00:01:48.640
you do have a light levelizer over here on the other side 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.680
when you put weight on the back you can drop your headlights down so that they are not shooting up into the start with weight in the bed

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.200
alright John so like I said this is a beautiful truck 14 TRD SR5 its very very rare 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.800
its got a lot of extra accessories on it like the dual exhaust and the tow mirrors 

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:13.680
and like I said that rare feature of that fact that it has got the six passenger seating instead of that center console is huge 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.680
