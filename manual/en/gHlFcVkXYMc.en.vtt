Hey guys!

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.980
So today I'm going to do a tutorial based
on the mask from "Scream", so if you guys

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.400
like this type of video, if you think this
came out pretty cool, which I thought I did

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.939
a pretty good job on this one to be honest,
don't forget to give me a thumbs up!

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.980
So the first thing you want to do is outline
where you're going to have the eye holes and

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.360
the mouth.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.820
I would start with white body paint and then
if you need to make any changes you can just

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.080
use a makeup wipe.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.730
To me, that was the easier way to do it.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.379
You can do it with black instead- personal
preference- but for me, I went with white.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.530
You also don't have to use the biggest brush
that you own to do this.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.769
That will probably save you a headache.

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.140
And then once you start painting your face,
just make sure the white is as opaque as you

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.140
can get it.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.140
You don't want any patchy spots because I
don't think that that's very scary... patchy

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.769
spots on your mask.

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:29.900
I don't know, that's just me.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.070
Then once you have that down, you can start
working on the black eye holes, and then the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.659
mouth and the nose.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:40.130
I would use a smaller brush for this one just
so you don't mess up the white that you've

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.260
already done because that will be the biggest
pain in the butt to fix- believe me.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:02:04.220
I've had to do that before... not fun.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:14.980
Then, when you're painting your mouth, try
really hard not to get the paint in your mouth

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.900
because it really doesn't taste good.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.850
Also don't forget to do your ears when you
do this.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.920
It'll look kind of weird if your whole face
and chest is painted and your ears are just

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:50.030
normal people colored.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.380
Then for my favorite part of this video, is
the shading!

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.870
I don't think that was gramatically correct,
anywhoo!

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.880
For this, I would just look at a picture of
an actual mask, or if you have one with you-

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.470
I don't know why you would be painting your
face like this if you have one, but whatever.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.900
Just pick a side that you're going to have
the kight coming from and make sure to shade

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.130
really well on the other side to give you
alot of shadow to bring out the depth and

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.960
definition in this look.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.690
I'll have a link to the picture I used in
my blog there'll be a link down below if you

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.190
guys want to check that out.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.959
And just for the record, this is about the
4th time I've tried to do this voice over,

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.310
thank you tech issues.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.310
So!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.970
