00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.379
June 2010 Roundup.

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.389
After a quiet start to the year, June saw
a variety of major handset announcements from

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.849
major manufacturers.

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:21.740
Apple.
The biggest news this month was the launch

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.550
of the new-look Apple iPhone 4 with major
improvements in processor speed, the camera

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.859
and display it was a must-have for most Apple
fans. However, problems with the antenna have

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.230
blighted the iPhone 4's launch.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.090
Motorola.
The Motorola Milestone XT720 is an enhanced

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.489
but keyboardless version of the existing Milestone,
based on the Korean MOTOROI handset. Heading

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.210
for the US only, the Motorola DROID X comes
with a huge screen and improved features,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.261
but it is a big beast of a phone. Aimed at
large businesses, the Motorola ES400 Enterprise

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:05.469
Digital Assistant is a high-end Windows smartphone
for the always-connected enterprise customer.

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:11.789
At the other end of the smartphone market,
the Motorola FLIPOUT is a MOTOBLUR enabled

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.859
device with a very unusual rotating QWERTY
keyboard.

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:22.030
Nokia.
The Nokia C2 is a low-cost handset that is

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.810
also Nokia's first dual SIM phone. Cheaper
still, but with a less sophisticated double

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.409
SIM arrangement is the Nokia C1-00. The confusingly
named Nokia C1-01 and C1-02 are very cheap

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.850
traditional phones with surprisingly good
features. The Nokia X5-01 is a sliding QWERTY

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.659
smartphone with a highly unusual square design
that should turn heads.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.760
Sony Ericsson.
Sony Ericsson's second Android phone, the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.079
Sony Ericsson Xperia X8 is a bit more modest
than their high-end X10 handset and is a lot

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.210
cheaper. The Sony Ericsson Yendo is a Walkman
phone with a touchscreen, but not much else

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.540
to recommend it. The Sony Ericsson Cedar is
a more environmentally friendly phone than

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.930
most, but will customers desert rivals to
buy it?

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.840
Samsung.
Samsung aims to bring its Bada OS and Wave

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.439
brand to a more affordable price point with
the Samsung Wave 2 and Wave 2 Pro smartphones.

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.650
Another Android phone competing in the midrange
market is the Samsung Galaxy 3 or Galaxy Apollo

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.769
depending on carrier.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:42.810
LG.
LG's most significant phone to hit the market

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.569
this month is probably the LG Town GT350,
the latest generation of affordable messaging

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.430
phones aimed at European customers.
