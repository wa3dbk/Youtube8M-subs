00:00:06.452 --> 00:00:07.903
Imagine that day by day,

00:00:07.903 --> 00:00:10.700
your field of vision 
becomes slightly smaller,

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.528
narrowing or dimming

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:16.382
until eventually you go completely blind.

00:00:16.382 --> 00:00:19.179
We tend to think of blindness
as something you're born with,

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.003
but in fact, with many diseases
like Retinitis pigmentosa

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.607
and Usher syndrome,

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:27.275
blindness can start developing
when you're a kid,

00:00:27.275 --> 00:00:29.615
or even when you're an adult.

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:33.247
Both of these rare genetic diseases
affect the retina,

00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:38.390
the screen at the back of the eye
that detects light and helps us see.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.705
Now imagine if the eye 
could regenerate itself

00:00:41.705 --> 00:00:44.630
so that a blind person could see again.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.827
To understand if that's possible,
we need to grasp how the retina works

00:00:48.827 --> 00:00:52.526
and what it has to do 
with a multitalented creature

00:00:52.526 --> 00:00:55.168
named the zebrafish.

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.893
The human retina is made
of different layers of cells,

00:00:57.893 --> 00:01:01.302
with special neurons 
that live in the back of the eye

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:05.031
called rod and cone photoreceptors.

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:08.020
Photoreceptors convert 
the light coming into your eye

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.042
into signals that the brain uses 
to generate vision.

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:15.381
People who have Usher syndrome
and retinitis pigmentosa

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.987
experience a steady loss 
of these photoreceptors

00:01:18.987 --> 00:01:23.351
until finally that screen in the eye
can no longer detect light

00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:26.245
nor broadcast signals to the brain.

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:30.705
Unlike most of your body's cells,
photoreceptors don't divide and multiply.

00:01:30.705 --> 00:01:34.820
We're born with all 
the photoreceptors we'll ever have,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.909
which is why babies 
have such big eyes for their faces

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.217
and part of why they're so cute.

00:01:40.217 --> 00:01:42.629
But that isn't the case for all animals.

00:01:42.629 --> 00:01:46.606
Take the zebrafish,
a master regenerator.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:52.524
It can grow back its skin, bones, heart
and retina after they've been damaged.

00:01:52.524 --> 00:01:57.438
If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina
are removed or killed by toxins,

00:01:57.438 --> 00:02:03.032
they just regenerate and rewire 
themselves to the brain to restore sight.

00:02:03.032 --> 00:02:05.670
Scientists have been investigating
this superpower

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.643
because zebrafish retina are also 
structured very much like human retina.

00:02:10.643 --> 00:02:14.796
Scientists can even mimic the effects
of disorders like Usher syndrome

00:02:14.796 --> 00:02:18.612
or retinitis pigmentosa
on the zebrafish eye.

00:02:18.612 --> 00:02:22.758
This allows them to see how zebrafish
go about repairing their retinas

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:26.997
so they might use similar tactics
to fix human eyes one day, too.

00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:30.016
So what's behind 
the zebrafish's superpower?

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:34.872
The main players are sets of long cells
that stretch across the retina

00:02:34.872 --> 00:02:36.764
called M端ller glia.

00:02:36.764 --> 00:02:40.367
When the photoreceptors are damaged,
these cells transform,

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:42.324
taking on a new character.

00:02:42.324 --> 00:02:46.019
They become less like M端ller cells
and more like stem cells,

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.750
which can turn into any kind of cell.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.324
Then these long cells divide,

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.702
producing extras that will eventually
grow into new photoreceptors,

00:02:53.702 --> 00:02:58.581
travel to the back of the eye
and rewire themselves into the brain.

00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:02.663
And now some researchers even think
they've found the key to how this works

00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:06.327
with the help of one of two chemicals
that create activity in the brain

00:03:06.327 --> 00:03:09.442
called glutamate
and aminoadipate.

00:03:09.442 --> 00:03:10.513
In mouse eyes,

00:03:10.513 --> 00:03:14.743
these make the M端ller glia divide
and transform into photoreceptors,

00:03:14.743 --> 00:03:17.086
which then travel 
to the back of the retina,

00:03:17.086 --> 00:03:20.561
like they're replenishing a failing army
with new soldiers.

00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.376
But remember, none of this has happened
in our retinas yet,

00:03:24.376 --> 00:03:28.318
so the question is how do we trigger 
this transformation of the M端ller glia

00:03:28.318 --> 00:03:30.250
in the human eye?

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.823
How can we fully control this process?

00:03:32.823 --> 00:03:36.354
How do photoreceptors 
rewire themselves into the retina?

00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:39.308
And is it even possible 
to trigger this in humans?

00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:42.940
Or has this mechanism been lost
over time in evolution?

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.449
Until we tease apart 
the origins of this ability,

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:49.082
retinal regeneration will remain 
a mysterious superpower

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:51.198
of the common zebrafish.
