ray suarez from race talk wrote agreed to
use for alternet and it has to do with the

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:15.480
fact that our public schools are short-changing
latino students now i found this uh... fascinating

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.720
because

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.960
a lot of people don't know that our public
schools are funded through uh...

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.349
property tax cell allot of uh...

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:32.349
schools that are uh... heavily populated with
latino students art in poor areas with low-cost

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.400
housing so of course uh... that leads to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.520
kal less funding for the school because the
property taxes and as much as it would be

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.460
richer areas and that they don't have the
same resources and the same teachers as us

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.390
students do in areas like beverly hills

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.290
so um...

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.500
maybe this is a good way for politicians who
think about other ways to fund education other

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.120
than relying on the property tax

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.629
i totally agree but i think it's absurd that
u

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.750
you based education on property taxes because
how is that equal opportunity if you live

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.160
in a rich neighborhood

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.810
with great property values or poor neighborhood

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.330
but that's always a conservative conservative
argument is like although you know if that's

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200
that's up to the parents and it's like

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.060
i get that i get that um... i'm somewhat sympathetic
to that to a point

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.080
but then how is that the kids fall that's
always come back to his house of powers of

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.020
the kid's fault that he grows up in a neighborhood
flow property values so as education is not

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.550
opt apartments on it that's not the kid's
fault it's not that that's why you're absolutely

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.100
right

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.790
ip-based of course puts latino students added
gigantic disadvantage it makes it even harder

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.580
for them to advance and you know in this piece
written by where uh... race why is he talks

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.500
about

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.140
how few latino students uh... getting high
school actually in a role in college and actually

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.010
graduate college even fewer actually graduate
college so there at this disadvantage and

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.600
i think that it's something that we need to
focus on in our country because as i've mentioned

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.770
a million times before on the show education
is always the last thing the politicians are

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.660
thinking about when their campaign they always
talk about it all we want we want to reform

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.410
education is very important we want to make
sure that our country advances because education

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.500
is power nadi ideology always say these things
during their campaigns and then when they're

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.200
actually elected when they're actually in
office they don't you anything and at the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.660
fact that education is funded by property
taxes blows my mind
