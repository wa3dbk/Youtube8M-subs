00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.329
Today we're going to make Ear Wire Hoops.

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:16.009
We're going to begin with two links of twenty or twenty
two gauge half hard wire that are about half an

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.019
inch longer than you would like the circumference
of the hoops to be.

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.800
I use artistic craft wire to practice with
before going to precious metal.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.800
Use your round nose pliers to convert each wire into
an i-pin.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.020
Use a bench blocking and chasing hammer to slightly
flaten on the top

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.020
of the two i-pins.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.289
If the i-loop opens during hammering, use

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.200
your round nose pliers to wiggle it close.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.130
Press the eye of one pin against ring mandrel
using the thumb of your dominant hand.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.910
Use the thumb and fingers of your other hand
to wrap the wire tightly all the way around

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.060
the mandrel.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.850
Now slide the loop off.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.220
And run the wire end through the pin eye.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.340
You're going to place it back on the ring mandrel

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.580
to the size of the hoop of the earring that you would like. Make
sure that the end of the wire doesn't come

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.160
out of the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.770
pin eye.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.900
And I just bend

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.890
the wire with my fingers to tighten it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.350
around the mandrel.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.900
Slide the loop off the mandrel and place it on
the bench block

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.690
with the pin eye over the edge of the bench
block so that the loop lies flat. Lightly hammer

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.690
the loop with your chasing hammer all the way
around slightly to slightly flatten it and stiffen it.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.319
If needed slide the loop back onto the mandrel to
restore it's circular shape.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.180
With your flush cutters you're going to trim off the
bent wire

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.009
to about an eighth of an inch in length.

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:27.009
Use your diamond file to smooth your rough edges
on the wire end.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:29.639
And here's your

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:30.870
hoop earring

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.329
You will repeat all the steps to make the second
hoop earring.
