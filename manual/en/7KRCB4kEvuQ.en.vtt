00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.510
I'm going to show you how to do stitch resist.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.410
This is a really cool technique and even though
it's a little bit more advanced I'm going

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.930
to guide you through it.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.800
This wave pattern was achieved just by stitching
the waves that you see and gathering them

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.820
together.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.890
The only stitch that you'll need to use is
a running stitch, which is a pretty easy stitch

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.589
that even a child can do.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.170
I'm going to show you how I did it.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:40.410
Using a needle and really strong thread you're
going to start the running stitch following

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.750
the shape that you want to do.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.940
I did waves.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.800
You could do circles, flowers, heart shapes,
whatever you want.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.680
The trick here is that you want to do the
stitches pretty small, and you want to have

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.830
really strong thread, so when you're gathering
it you can gather it pretty tightly.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:04.299
So I'm making my running stitch.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:12.399
I've stitched most of the wave, I just have
a couple of stitches left.

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:19.479
I know that this can be a pretty time-consuming
technique, but the results are totally rewarding,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.200
so I encourage you to give it a try.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.999
This is how it should look before you start
gathering.

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:34.520
You see that I did a little bit of gathering
already, but it's just a plain running stitch.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.530
This is the part now where you really will
be thankful if you've chosen really strong

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.860
thread.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.420
Because you want to start gathering all your
stitches, like making pleats as tight as possible.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.600
The pattern will only appear if you actually
make it pretty tight, so really go as strong

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.159
as possible here.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.310
You see here that I'm making these little
puff pleating here and this is what it will

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.310
look like.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.290
If I had done the same thing in all of my
waves here in the fabric, you would just see

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.350
it gathered in different places.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.590
So after you gather it, you also want to tie
it pretty hard, because once you put it in

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.569
the dye bath, the gathering will likely come
undone.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:25.010
At this time we don't need the needle yet
and this is really strong thread and this

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.180
is what it will look like before you put it
in the dye bath.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.879
Just these little puffs and you see it on
the other side you have all these gatherings

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.170
here.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.630
Every little pleat that you formed with the
stitch will create these little dots that

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.630
you see.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.450
And that's how you create your pattern.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.129
You should play around with different thicknesses
of threads.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:50.000
Also, with different shapes, and make some
swatches in the beginning.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.970
It is sometimes a frustrating technique, because
you spend all that time doing the stitching,

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.310
and after the dying, not a lot of results
appear.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.780
But I can guarantee that you'll get better
as you go, and one day you'll be able to do

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.980
something like this.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.989
This is how you do stitch resisting tie dye.
