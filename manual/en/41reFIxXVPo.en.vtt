00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.889
I chose Shenandoah because actually it's

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.049
the only school I applied to I didn't

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.599
want to go anywhere else but the reason

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.090
I chose a one it was location but two

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.840
because I appreciate and enjoy and think

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.160
that smaller schools and personal

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.220
attention are better education first

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.439
thing was is when I hadn't even applied

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.710
yet and I had questions about what my

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
class requirements were prereqs and that

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.000
kind of thing and and i emailed not

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.079
thinking I was going to get a response

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.820
quite honestly but I got a response

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.140
within a couple days saying absolutely

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.969
here's what you need here's what you

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.960
should do and i was able to have that

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.190
exchange before i was even a student here

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.219
before I even applied the one thing that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.219
really stands out to me is my class is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.760
really close we have a small class which

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.789
is nice but we all get along we all care

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760
about each other we all want the other

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.880
students to do well you know if somebody's

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.260
struggling in anatomy you know I stepped up

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.180
and said hey I'm good with anatomy let

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.890
me help out I said well not so great

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.930
pharmacology can you help me there so we

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.400
really support and care about each other

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.970
and we have potlucks where we plan

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.860
a potluck at least once per semester and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.270
it's just a time where we all come

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.979
together and I think that's something

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.650
that's really unique as well I decided

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.470
to be a PA when I was about 25 and I was

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.600
in a transition time and I knew I was

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.390
interested in health care I didn't know

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.939
which area so I talked to OTs I talked

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.990
to PTs and PAs and doctors and I was

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.720
looking for a profession where I would

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.460
have the ability to interact with

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.520
patients of all ages and i found that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.369
with the PA profession everybody was

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.799
happy for one each PA i talked to is

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.570
really happy and content with their job

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.229
which was huge for me and two i could

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.240
go into primary care it wasn't really

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.189
long schooling which is one thing I was

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.540
also looking for is nothing that was

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.870
going to be

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.060
too long in the classroom it's kind of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.170
at the point where I knew what I wanted

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.830
and I wanted to go get it and the third

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.170
thing was that as a PA I have the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.850
ability to go into multiple fields I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.070
don't have to be in primary care because

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.230
I chose it the first time I'm not always

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.830
there although I plan on it but going to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.090
school you have the ability to go into

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.680
surgery you can go in a cardiothoracic

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.960
you can go into urology whatever you

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.340
choose this schooling gives you that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.710
background to then be able to go forward

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.110
into the field that you prefer and if

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.450
you want to go you know change ten years

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.620
down the road then you have the ability

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.180
to you don't have to go back to school

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.820
and I think that is an amazing part of

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.090
being a PA, be a PA you know it's the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.780
best profession in my eyes you know it's

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.100
going to take into consideration their

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.110
background but if they're kind of with

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.690
an open book not sure where to go talk

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.210
to people and talk to the professionals

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.470
out there and you'll hear that the PA

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.480
profession is up and coming and people

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.340
are happy with it I think the best way

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.050
to come and get to know Shenandoah is

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.030
come to Winchester see the community

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.940
come to the main campus and get a tour

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.100
there but really come to HPB because

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.330
that's where the health professions are

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.970
and come to an open house and talk to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.410
people we always have students there PA

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.940
students always come and are part of

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.190
the open houses and interviews talk to them

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.720
what do they like what are some

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.160
drawbacks what are some good things what

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.720
are some bad things there's gonna be bad

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.310
things too that's natural it's how

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.250
things go but how do you approach them

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.600
and how do you overcome them you know

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.489
and just come and talk we're pretty nice

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.860
people here pretty welcome and friendly

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.880
and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.150
we want to see new PA students because

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.560
they'll be our colleagues and our peers

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.600
and we want good professionals coming up

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.840
as well
