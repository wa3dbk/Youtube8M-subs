00:00:00.013 --> 00:00:01.563
(woman's voice) You know, 
I consider myself

00:00:01.577 --> 00:00:03.257
a psychiatric survivor,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.922
a human rights activist,

00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:07.948
trauma survivor, I'm also a 
breast cancer survivor.

00:00:07.962 --> 00:00:10.968
You know, I'm a- 
a lot of surviving in my life. 

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.422
What has helped me
in my recovery

00:00:13.435 --> 00:00:17.493
is finding the consumer/
survivor/ex-patient movement.

00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:20.408
I kinda knew 
when I was in...

00:00:20.422 --> 00:00:23.792
locked up in a hospital, 
taking a lot of drugs...

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.757
well, I was given 
a lot of drugs that ah, 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.297
there was something more 
than this, something more.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.443
I got to meet some 
really cool people.

00:00:33.457 --> 00:00:36.497
I met Judi Chamberlain,
I met, ah,

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.078
 Howie the Harp,

00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:42.133
I met ah... Ed Knight.

00:00:42.147 --> 00:00:44.687
I met all these people.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.677
I was just blown away by them,

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.573
you know, and I said 
to Judi, I said,

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:52.112
who's allowing you 
to be doing alternatives?

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:54.152
And she laughed!

00:00:54.165 --> 00:00:57.597
Because... I think people
need to understand

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.105
in mental health we're not really
allowed to do anything,

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:02.617
they tell you what it is 
that they want you to do,

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.625
and here she's doing what 
she feels is good for her,

00:01:06.638 --> 00:01:10.222
and her spirit, and and 
her activism. 

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.167
And I was just blown away.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.493
And I came back home,
and I just...

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:18.397
st- was in the movement
at that time,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.367
and I was starting to
spread the message

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.727
of self-help, 'cause at that time, 
there was self-help,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.572
and advocacy. Language 
has changed through

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:29.145
ah, the years. 

00:01:29.158 --> 00:01:32.073
Um, so... before, 
you know,

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:33.977
are you- you're consumer, 
you're survivor,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.420
now you're human rights 
activist (laughs)

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.242
so um, peer-advocate, 

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:42.292
you know, different, 
different ah, terms...

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:45.280
But I really believe that
people can recover

00:01:45.268 --> 00:01:47.287
and people have a
story to tell,

00:01:47.287 --> 00:01:49.037
and people can...

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.195
support each other by 
listening to the story.

00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:54.690
And you know, just listening

00:01:54.678 --> 00:01:56.683
helps people feel like 
they're not alone,

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.340
and I feel when 
I'm talking to 

00:01:59.342 --> 00:02:02.180
someone in the movement, 
or a friend,

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:04.818
or... a family member,

00:02:04.807 --> 00:02:08.130
and they really are validating 
me and my experience,

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:11.270
it's like I'm on top of the world,
and I think that's

00:02:11.258 --> 00:02:14.168
what's missing for people, 
is connection.

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:17.842
And, ah...

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:19.790
I think if we have connection,

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:21.538
all the other issues

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:24.830
life, the mental health system,

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.082
you know, you can
get through it.

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:29.708
And I think, celebrating

00:02:29.697 --> 00:02:32.062
you know, some of our leaders

00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:35.412
from the past
and learn from them,

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:37.462
is...

00:02:37.462 --> 00:02:40.188
helps us get through
the different stages

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.747
and the new experiences 

00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:45.995
ah, that we're going to 
experience in human rights.

00:02:46.008 --> 00:02:48.938
So to me, you know,
we have all these problems

00:02:48.952 --> 00:02:52.070
with mental health,
and... ah,

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:54.947
forced electroshock.
All of those things are there,

00:02:54.948 --> 00:02:57.105
But if you have the 
people together,

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.160
working on it, 
fighting for change,

00:03:00.148 --> 00:03:05.133
social change, 
then you're not alone.

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:08.655
Um, you know Mind Freedom
I think is,

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.708
Um, has really helped people

00:03:11.722 --> 00:03:14.025
come together, 
and not just survivors

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:16.497
of the system, 
but all people

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:18.005
who want to fight 
human rights.

00:03:18.005 --> 00:03:21.155
I just think, we all should be
working together,

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.177
and I think the 
message is now

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.622
we have been talking to 
each other for a long time,

00:03:26.635 --> 00:03:29.413
and now it's time to talk to
people in the public

00:03:29.427 --> 00:03:31.810
about what these 
issues are, because

00:03:31.812 --> 00:03:35.448
someone in my family could 
be dealing with mental health,

00:03:35.437 --> 00:03:38.203
you know, my son, 
I mean, you know,

00:03:38.192 --> 00:03:41.280
it's not a separate issue, 
mental health over here,

00:03:41.268 --> 00:03:43.982
mental illness over here,
it's everywhere.

00:03:43.982 --> 00:03:46.163
And so we have to address it.

00:03:46.177 --> 00:03:49.245
And we have to let people know
there are alternatives,

00:03:49.247 --> 00:03:51.190
and people that are there 
to connect with you. 

00:03:51.178 --> 00:03:52.992
You don't have to be afraid.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.008
And I- but I do think 
the label is stigmatizing.

00:03:56.997 --> 00:04:00.010
You know, whatever people
want to call themselves,

00:03:59.998 --> 00:04:03.045
you know, bipolar, 
schizophrenia, whatever,

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:05.112
you're a person first.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.347
And I think that's missing, 
and so I think some

00:04:07.335 --> 00:04:11.085
of the stigma campaigns 
have not been that successful.

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:13.038
You're not a disease,
you're a person.

00:04:13.027 --> 00:04:15.135
I struggle with that, 
with the label.

00:04:15.135 --> 00:04:18.678
Am I somebody's daughter?
Am I somebody's mother?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.362
I think that's what's missing,

00:04:20.362 --> 00:04:23.902
and that's why it's so hard
for people to really connect,

00:04:23.903 --> 00:04:27.240
with "mental health", 
you know? So,

00:04:27.228 --> 00:04:30.027
I think that, over the years

00:04:30.027 --> 00:04:32.462
I have taught my family, 
for one,

00:04:32.463 --> 00:04:35.837
that you have to support 
people where they're at,

00:04:35.825 --> 00:04:37.397
and it's not about drugs. 

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:40.103
It's about all different kinds
of approaches.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:43.897
And I have, ah,
for me to stay well

00:04:43.885 --> 00:04:46.932
I have done meditation,

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.088
I'm a Reiki two practitioner, 

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.303
and I'm very happy about it

00:04:51.317 --> 00:04:53.300
because that's what 
keeps me together.

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:56.062
Now this is just me, 
other people have other

00:04:56.063 --> 00:04:57.823
ways that they heal. 

00:04:57.823 --> 00:05:00.520
But I need to do that,
I need to breathe more,

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.658
exercise. I choose to
not have my mind clouded. 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.157
I choose to just feel
whatever it is.

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:10.062
Depression, 
you know, sadness,

00:05:10.062 --> 00:05:12.200
loneliness, all those feelings,

00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:13.862
and cope with it.

00:05:13.863 --> 00:05:15.945
People struggle with
the messages

00:05:15.933 --> 00:05:18.138
that you'll never get well.

00:05:18.127 --> 00:05:20.935
I was told I would never get
married, I'd never go to school,

00:05:20.935 --> 00:05:23.842
I'd never be a mother,
and I, I've gone to college.

00:05:23.855 --> 00:05:26.327
I have a son. I'm married.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.548
So imagine someone
telling you that

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:32.035
and you internalize that
and then you don't do

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:36.052
you don't- you don't 
become your best self

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:39.493
because someone has said
you can't do those things

00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:42.618
based on a psychiatric disability.

00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:45.562
You know, you get down on
what the public is thinking,

00:05:45.575 --> 00:05:48.193
I don't think they've 
caught up to recovery,

00:05:48.195 --> 00:05:50.148
and human rights,
and mutual support,

00:05:50.148 --> 00:05:53.522
and peer support, ah
trauma-informed, 

00:05:53.523 --> 00:05:55.077
all these things.

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:57.120
I- I don't think that they 
caught up to that.

00:05:57.108 --> 00:05:58.968
You know, when they 
look at someone who's

00:05:58.957 --> 00:06:01.380
labelled with a 
mental illness, they said, 

00:06:01.368 --> 00:06:03.813
well, maybe they're violent,
maybe they'll act up,

00:06:03.802 --> 00:06:07.083
or you know, um
so they don't see us as people

00:06:07.072 --> 00:06:09.913
and they need to, 
so they have to catch up to us.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.635
To be a survivor of psychiatry

00:06:12.623 --> 00:06:15.617
is you survived the 
mental health system,

00:06:15.605 --> 00:06:18.835
you survived forced electroshock,

00:06:18.823 --> 00:06:21.668
you survived taking drugs,

00:06:21.657 --> 00:06:23.480
or being forced to take drugs.

00:06:23.468 --> 00:06:26.073
I think Mind Freedom... 
you know

00:06:26.062 --> 00:06:28.037
you can have a choice,
you know,

00:06:28.025 --> 00:06:30.598
if you want to take 
psychiatric drugs,

00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:33.460
but when you're forced to,
we're against that.

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:35.938
And we will fight with you
to stop that.

00:06:35.927 --> 00:06:38.492
We're not- everything should be

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.430
your choice, informed,

00:06:41.418 --> 00:06:43.832
ah, decision making.

00:06:43.832 --> 00:06:46.222
Ah, when the system...

00:06:46.223 --> 00:06:49.797
imposes that because
you have a diagnosis

00:06:49.797 --> 00:06:51.670
that you must take drugs,

00:06:51.683 --> 00:06:54.508
oh by the way, we feel 
you need to have electroshock

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.305
without your consent, 
that's just wrong.

00:06:57.293 --> 00:06:59.553
And that's, um...

00:06:59.542 --> 00:07:02.843
that's what we've been 
fighting for, a very long time.

00:07:02.832 --> 00:07:04.850
There's not a quick fix,

00:07:04.838 --> 00:07:08.357
it's not, a pill and that's
going to solve my whole life.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:10.127
When you go into the system

00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:12.590
and you're stripped of 
your dignity and your rights,

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.523
that's traumatic.
