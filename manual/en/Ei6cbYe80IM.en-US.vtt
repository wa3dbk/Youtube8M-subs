00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.690
Hi everybody, today's a Tech-Tip-Monday, and
today we show you how to charge your phone

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.880
properly.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:19.430
90% of the times you complain about your phone,
it is because its battery does not last enough:

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.960
you can barely get it to survive to the afternoon,
and don't even think of playing with it.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.750
So what can you do?
Well, first thing you have to subscribe to

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.030
our channel, that's totally going to help.
Second thing, you have to learn how to charge

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.030
it.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.710
Most of us, including me for a long time,
are used to make our devices completely drain

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.649
out the battery and then leave them to charge
overnight for hours.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.989
Guess what: that's exactly what you're not
supposed to do.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.989
Lithium batteries like those found in every
modern smartphone are not thought for full

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.660
discharge and consequent full charge, and
that procedure does actually harm them. Instead,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.129
you'd be much better off with shallow and
frequent charges.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.479
According to experts, the sweet spot is something
in between 50 and 80 percent, so stick to

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.060
that range when you can.
Besides, lithium batteries have a life span

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.619
based on charge cycles, so the more you completely
discharge them, the faster they'll die.

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.319
However, there is one exception to this rule:
one full discharge a month appears to be actually

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:28.020
useful for "calibration", but more than that
is absolutely not recommended.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.659
Another thing to keep in mind is to always
use proper chargers: you don't want to use

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.069
a massive charger for a tiny battery, because
that is likely to overheat the battery, and

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.450
heat is the worst enemy of battery life. The
cooler you can keep your batteries, the more

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.700
they'll last.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.549
As much as wireless charging is super convenient,
the energy dissipated in the transfer will

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.789
all end on your battery, worsening its conditions:
charging your phone or tablet wirelessly every

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.170
once in a while won't do any harm, but we
do recommend not to do that all the time.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.430
Something else that is often underestimated
is to keep your ports clean: dusty cables

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.670
and ports often result in slower charges or
in the phone not charging at all. Do your

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.200
spring-cleaning and keep that dust away from
your phone.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.360
Finally, one last suggestion we'd like to
give you is to always use quality material:

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.349
you may save 10 bucks or less buying unofficial
chargers and cables, but that might result

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.540
in worse battery life, longer charging times,
and also regrettable accidents like phones

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.560
that catch fire.
You don't want that, do you?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.870
As a closing note, it is important to highlight
that all of these suggestions are aimed for

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.431
a better long-term durability, rather than
for a massive immediate improvement: it's

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:50.959
worth saying though that if you have a non-removable
battery like iPhones do, keeping these advices

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.620
in mind might be more helpful than it looks.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.170
