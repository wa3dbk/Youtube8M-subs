00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.760
Wassup Guys, This is Bharath here, welcome
back to another Video

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.860
Today we are gonna take a look at The Hype
Itself the One plus two. We will be unboxing

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:19.789
with a Twist on and a mini review.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.390
Well Whats inside the box take a peek for yourself

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.349
so fast ? naaahhh lets rewind a bit and unbox with out the xray vison

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.780
Once you open the Box , at First you will
see the OneplusTwo Itself, now lets just put

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.620
that to the Side for now, next there is a
Bright Red Coloured Packet which contains

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.480
the Quick Start Guide and Manual, which no
one Never Reads , and at the Bottom, you have

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.579
the Travel adapter and The USB to Type C cable.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.260
The One plus two surely feels premium than
the one plus did in hands thanks to the Magnesium

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.409
outer Frame, and a tad smaller than the Oneplus
one. The Back Cover is much easier to remove,

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.850
there is a small slot on the left bottom corner
to just slot in and take of the back cover.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.220
And this time you need to do that to slot
in your sim Cards which are Dual 4G LTE Slots,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.000
this time around its nano SiM Slots, so go
ahead and walk-in to your nearby operator

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.650
Store and Change that if you have not already
done that.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.960
There is no Expandable Storage or Removable
Batteries but the 64Gb internal Storage and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960
the 3300MAH batteries should be all that you
need on the Oneplus two, but what you do have

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.570
are a Variety of Back cover choices, Including
Rosewood, Kevlar, Bamboo and Black Appricot

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.840
will be coming up with a comparison with a
one plus two and a one plus one soon so stay

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.649
tuned for that.
In the Front you have a 5.5 Inch in cell Full

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:54.860
HD Display with 401 PPI and a Brightness of
600 Knits, its Powered by A Qualcomm MSM8994

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.780
Snapdragon 810 v2.1 Chipset clocked at 1.8Ghz,
Couple with 4gb LP DDR3 Ram and paired with

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.820
the Adreno 430 GPU for the Quick and Rich
Graphics,

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.150
The Front Looks more refined with a 3 Button
Layout with the Center Button being a Touch

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.050
Pad type home Button embedded with a Finger
Print Sensor and two other capacitive buttons

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.150
for your home and back keys which you can
interchange and customize from within the

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.870
software. The Fingerprints Sensing also works
from Standby so no need to double tap or press

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.400
the power button, instead just rest your fingers
and it directly takes you to the home Screen.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.670
The Fingerprint Sensor take a bit of time
to Register but that’s a onetime process

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.920
after which it’s a breeze
The Outside body is built with Aluminum and

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.360
even the Buttons feel like metal this time.
On the right you find the Power button below

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.350
which the volume rockers are placed this time
and at other side has the Alert Slider which

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.080
allows 3 different modes based on the New
Android Notification setting this comes in

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.050
handy for many of us who are working and need
control over the volumes and notification

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.340
priority at our finger tips.
At the top you find the 3.5 mm headphone jack,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.580
and at the bottom you will find the Type C
port for charging and data transfer and a

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.290
mono speaker on the right while I feel the
left is for a microphone. USB Type C may not

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.280
be currently the Trend but it is the Future
of USB.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:22.610
The Software it runs on is the Oxygen OS 2.0
Customized for the one plus two and right

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.700
out of the box there was an update as well.
Oxygen OS comes very close to stock Android

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.260
giving you some basic customization options
like changing the settings and the launcher

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.920
background to a darker or different colors
to choose from. When you go to the left most

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.800
part of the screen you will find something
new and it’s called Shelf where you will

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.210
find all the recently used things, from contact,
apps to almost anything, you can also customize

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.620
this with just a few steps depending on your
mood you can also disable it if you want which

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.200
is a nice thing from oneplus unlike other
manufacturers who give a lot of bloatware,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.560
oneplus sticks to near stock which we all
love.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.930
The Camera has the Same 13MP Resolution but
hosts a Large 1.3 Micron Sensor, with a F2.0

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.340
Aperture Laser auto focus and Dual LED flash
with Optical Image Stabilization Built in

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.510
. and also the camera app is redesigned with
a new feel to the overall photo and video

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.790
experience. This can also shoot 120 FPS slowmotion
recording at 720P resolution. And 4k at 30FPS.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.620
The Focus time is snappy and the pictures
are without any haze or blur thanks to the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.640
OIS and quick focus time, check some sample
shots and Video from the Oneplus two latest

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.580
software update, I will leave the links in
the description as well.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.920
The Thing that this lacks are NFC, Quick Charge
and Wireless Charging, but I guess couple

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.680
of these don’t come into a lot of use other
than quick charging feature,

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.000
As far as the pricing and availability goes,
currently only the 64GB Storage coupled with

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:56.730
4GB RAM is available for 389$ or 24999/- INR
and soon will follow with a 16GB paired with

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.260
3GB of ram instead at 329$or 22999/- pretty
soon.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.360
I will be coming up with a lot more on the
oneplus two, stay tuned, and that’s it guys

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.630
for this video thanks for watching and this
is Bharath here signing off.
