00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.210
I've been trying to make a decent second computer
in case of emergencies, or if somebody comes

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.370
around and stays. I bought myself a second-hand
i5 2500k, RAM, case and motherboard for Â£200

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.910
and planned to use my old Radeon 6870 as the
graphics card, resulting in a fairly decent

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.830
PC. But of course, there have been problems.
First of all, the postage. UPS has ONE MISSION

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.369
and that's to deliver the stuff to my place...
and yet they did anything but. Credit where

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.870
it's due, I was out the first time they called
and they said that they'd redeliver. Days

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.260
passed but alas, nothing. So I looked up online
and for some reason they had changed the address

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.730
after the first attempt to next door's. Oh.
I phoned them and they apologised and corrected

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.990
it and said that they'd try again. Nothing.
I looked online... they had delivered to next

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.450
door again. 3 times. I was waiting there for
them as their van pulled up every time. A

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.219
few days later the van pulled up again to
take it away from a seemingly random house

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.020
on my street and back to a warehouse somewhere.
You can't make this stuff up. Here's the proof.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.239
So I eventually salvaged my old PC case and
gave up on that order. Funnily enough, a replacement

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.869
mouse is currently lost in their warehouse
for a month as well since they can't apparently

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.299
find my address, even though it's EVEN GOT
THE NUMBER OUTSIDE! It couldn't be easier.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.580
But that's not the only issue. I got the rest
of my stuff and decided to build it. This

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.530
was on the day that I was woken horribly early
by some people who had come to make sure that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.469
the fire alarms worked in the place I'm now
living. I put it all together, turned on the

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:27.459
power, the fans started whirring... and then
they stopped again. Oh dear. It could have

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:31.419
been anything! I ensured that everything was
plugged in. I tried re-inserting all of the

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:35.521
components. The same thing continued to happen,
apart from one time where taking out one of

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.140
the sticks of RAM worked but then didn't the
next time I tried the same setup. I don't

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.859
know why computers do this to me. If there's
one thing you should know about computers,

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.960
it's that what SHOULD work doesn't and to
fix them it's a case of trying everything

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.049
you can possibly do until you stumble on the
one odd tip that seems to work. This is the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.140
reason why helping somebody with computer
troubles over the phone or internet so frustrating.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.029
Besides, the fix is often something risky
and dangerous that you wouldn't attempt on

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:03.209
anything other than your own equipment.
Running out of ideas to get my PC to work,

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.309
I had the genius idea of trying to plug EXTRA
things into the motherboard to try and get

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:11.379
it started! I found a connection on my PSU
which fitted a port on the motherboard- it

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.950
wasn't needed but perhaps I was just being
silly and it was an important connection!

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.950
I mean, PC building is just like less user-friendly
lego, isn't it. Surely if it FITS then it's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.299
okay... right? I plugged it in, turned on
my computer and there was a horrifying electrical

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.879
zap sound and the connecting wire shone bright
orange before snapping off. A cloud of smoke

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.450
rose to the ceiling. I frantically turned
off the power, grabbed a large towel, opened

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.489
the window and began flapping it wildly to
get the smoke out of my room. Good news is,

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.150
the fire alarm didn't go off. Bad news is...
it most certainly should have.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.019
I'd like to clarify that I'm not some kind
of demon housemate. I don't throw wild parties

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.909
late at night, I don't grope housemates as
they walk past and I most certainly am not

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.230
a pyromaniac. I even gave my candles away
before moving to minimise the risk of a fire.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.819
But things like this have got to happen at
some point and it happened to be right now.

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.560
I then discovered that I had ECC RAM when
my motherboard required non-ECC. I took some

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.409
out of my main PC setup and got it working
first time. Moral of the story: don't ask

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.040
me to build you a computer.
Later I bought an SSD to complete the setup.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.040
Here is the Windows Experience Index for those
who are interested, along with some benchmark

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.540
results. One of the most problematic builds
that I have ever faced but the end result

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.269
has been worth it, even if I may never use
it.
