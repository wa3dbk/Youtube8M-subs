00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:13.739
Why I decided to come for the stem cells? Because this is my last chance. 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:25.960
I have already tried all other types of medicine in Europe and this is the only possibility to do 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.320
something and maybe to feel better,
move better, do more, be more 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.300
energizedâ€¦ In my opinion, this might be the only chance. 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.080
My name is Agnieszka Filipkowska, I am 34 years old, I come from Poland and since my 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.700
birth I have had SMA, which causes my muscles to disappear. Itâ€™s type one.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.920
My muscles disappear. Every year I am slightly weaker

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.140
My hands are too weak to do things. All the muscles 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.920
in my body are sadly disappearing.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.520
So, I chose Beike because here the stem cell therapy and rehabilitation

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.410
are really good and this month-long rehabilitation helps me a lot. 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.930
It is perfect here, the exercises in the swimming pool and in the therapy room. The therapists

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.520
are very nice and they know exactly what kind of exercise I need to do. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.500
Before the stem cell therapy, I used to say that it be would nice if my condition stopped (degenerating).

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.119
In my opinion, this being my third treatment, I feel a bit stronger 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.119
than 3 years before and I don't catch a cold any longer.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.920
I have finally finished my Ph.D and before I had no strength to do it. 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.080
I did not have the energy to type on a keyboard 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.340
and now it is possible after two therapies.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:48.800
Moreover, now I have a new dog (a shepherd dog) and now I can go for a walk with him 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:59.020
for two or three hours in the woods or around the city. I feed him something tasty 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.600
when he does something good.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.940
So, I can move much more than before.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:17.020
I hope that this third time is not my final visit (to BBH-Beike) and I will try 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.720
to do whatever it takes to come here once more. First of all I would like to thank my mother, 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:34.700
who is here with me. Then of course, special thanks to the doctors, to the staff and for my

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:44.769
sponsors in Poland who financed me and supported me all along. So

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.000
again "Thank you".
