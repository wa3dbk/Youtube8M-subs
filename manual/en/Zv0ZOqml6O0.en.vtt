00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:11.567
Veteran Pilots understand that flying is learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:17.100
This is Luke and Billy and welcome to the new season of Follow the Leader!

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.600
During the break, the show underwent significant changes.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.767
First of all, the tasks.

00:00:33.167 --> 00:00:38.533
Now it’s not enough to be the first to send us the completed route; you should be the one to fly the route the fastest!

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.867
And here, by the way, is the new route.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:48.733
So take your Bf 109B and fly to the region with the Lighthouse.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.333
You should complete the route and do all maneuvers shown in the video.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.933
Another important change.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.500
Now you can save your replays! Hurrah!

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.333
So just send us an email with your replay attached! No longer do you need to worry about YouTube.

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:18.833
Don’t forget to make sure “Save battle replays” is selected in the Options menu.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:22.267
Good news to all those who haven’t quite mastered their controls right now;

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:27.167
we’re still rewarding those who give a good effort and put on a spectacular show!

00:01:27.267 --> 00:01:30.967
Finally, some great changes were made to the prizes.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:36.167
Now you will receive 6000 gold if you manage to complete the route in the best time.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:41.467
And ALL of those who are just a few seconds slower will get 5000 gold. And so on…

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.867
So you will have to push yourself to get the grand prize!

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:53.633
The rewards for the most interesting tasks and extraordinary botched attempts remain the same at 5000 and 1000 gold, respectively.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.000
It is also possible to earn additional rewards!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.967
Pilots, note that this is the first challenge of this type

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:05.967
and so the conditions of getting prizes may or may not change depending on your reaction and response.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:11.767
Last but not least, we have not forgotten about the winners of the last video of the first season.

00:02:11.867 --> 00:02:16.100
They received their prizes on time, and you can see their names on your screen.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.000
That’s all for now.

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:23.233
Our email address is the same – tryrepeat@wargaming.net

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:27.133
In the email subject, you should put the number of the Follow the Leader episode,

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:34.567
your nickname, your region – North America or Europe, as well as the time it took to complete the route… or mark it as a “Fail”.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:38.367
So we’re waiting for your replays and your feedback on the new show format.

00:02:38.467 --> 00:02:40.033
Cheerio!
