00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.000
CASSEROLE "NESTS"

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.855
My name is Elena. I am pleased to welcome you at my kitchen!

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:16.594
Today I will make a very easy dish called Casserole "Nests".

00:00:16.594 --> 00:00:24.453
We need the appropriate pasta in the form of nests. They come in different sizes.

00:00:24.453 --> 00:00:33.900
Ground beef, cheese, sour cream, milk, water, onion, pepper and salt. That's all we need.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.800
Finely chop the onion.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.300
I always leave the tail for comfortable holding to chop the onion.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:00.834
On a heated pan pour 2 tbsp of vegetable oil.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:08.794
Fry onion until golden brown.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.000
Cook on medium heat.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.001
Onion is browned. Add mince to it.

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:30.233
Mix everything together and fry lightly.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.900
Add salt.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.223
A little pepper.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.800
Continue to cook.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.000
It took 5 minutes. Mince is prepared. Turn off the heat and set aside.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Take the grill or pan.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.428
Spread the nests.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.236
Place the mince in each nest.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.255
Place the tomatoes on the top.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Grate the cheese.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:36.400
Mix the milk and sour cream in a bowl.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:45.800
Add the water.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.595
Add pepper.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.014
Salt it a little.

00:04:11.014 --> 00:04:15.208
Stir.

00:04:15.208 --> 00:04:19.776
It easier to do with a whisk.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.900
Pour into the grill.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.655
Sprinkle with grated cheese.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.878
Cover with a lid.

00:05:22.878 --> 00:05:27.799
Put on the small heat.

00:05:27.799 --> 00:05:31.000
Cooking under the lid closed for 15 minutes.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.394
It took 15 minutes. Turn off the heat.

00:05:34.394 --> 00:05:37.700
Leave the nests under the lid closed for 15 minutes.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.474
The dish can be served to the table.

00:05:42.474 --> 00:05:47.608
All the liquid absorbed into the nests.

00:05:47.608 --> 00:05:55.178
Gently shift on the plates.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:09.914
You can sprinkle top with paprika or greens.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.834
The dish is ready!

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:20.373
I cooked a quick dinner! Bon Appetite!

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.000
