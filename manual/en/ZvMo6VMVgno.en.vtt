for LPTV and today we're down at 1433 Hamilton
Street at the new location

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.690
for Budget Blinds and inspired drapes. I'm
gonna go in take a look around and get a

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.210
tour

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.690
new shoproom. so what brought you over to
this location leann

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.680
well we were really excited to find this
location because it has a lot of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.050
character and a lot of space and that's
what we really wanted to use to display

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.980
of our beautiful

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.080
products. So in the warehouse district we spent
a lot of time refinishing the floors and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.980
exposing of the brick so that it's a
wonderful space to visit

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.780
but also showcases all of the different
products that we have very beautifully so

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.570
the window coverings, the blinds we do a lot
of home decor

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.879
so we have carpets and bedding and we have the space to do that now

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.879
and you guys have been in business for
quite some time now? we have been in

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:43.840
business in Regina

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.059
an area since 2008 so we service the whole
City of Regina

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.739
we service down in Estevan and Weyburn
everything in between so we go out to

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.590
rural areas

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.680
if you're on a farm we have no problem coming out
to help you find the perfect product

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.940
but the one piece of advice that I wanna
offer when you're coming in

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.160
don't be overwhelmed it's really our job
to show you all the options but then

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.449
bring

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.720
it down to, maybe a few choices that would
work perfectly in your home for function

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.290
and beauty

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.320
so it's really our job to ask a lot of
questions and and narrow all of the choices down

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.020
to make something that's perfect for you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.720
coming into the showroom is a great idea
to start and to get some ideas and then

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.189
really what we specialize in

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.460
is in home consultation so we bring the
show room to you

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.070
and go through my room with you and talk
to you about no what's the point of

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.170
covering the window what do you want to
look like what do you want the feeling

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.640
to be

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.460
our installers are team members here so
they work for us and that there are

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.710
really fast that's what we hear all the
time your installers were so quick they

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.060
were in and out we hardly even knew that
they were in our house

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.829
and we have I'm a few exclusive
vendors

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:45.390
mainly our biggest vendor would be the
signature series and so they are our

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.450
biggest factor in the inspired rates
program we just rolled out

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.110
so you guys also also take care decor in
rooms as well I know you guys customized

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.720
pillows

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.310
even bedspreads? yes we have on along
with all the drapery fabrics

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.189
the majority of them as well
can be made into custom bedding

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.969
so that would include anything from a duvet
cover, a throw

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.569

pretty much any shape and size that you

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.569
