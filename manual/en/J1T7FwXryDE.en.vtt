00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:05.970
BLADE KOTELLY: So the
class is broken up

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.840
into two sessions, a Monday
and a Wednesday class.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.130
Each class is two hours long.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.030
The typical class runs where at
the beginning of the semester,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.400
there'll be more lecture
than towards the end.

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:28.810
JOEL SCHINDALL: Blade and
I have developed a style

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.660
for teaching the course
which works very well for us.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.990
It's a bit like Our
Town where the actors go

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.520
through their paces, and
every once in awhile they stop

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.620
and the stage manager
comes on stage

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.660
and makes an
editorial comment that

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.720
couldn't be conveyed
in a direct fashion.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.205
We evolved it perhaps
because Blade is charismatic.

00:00:47.205 --> 00:00:49.810
He is very effective at
the teaching of the course.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:50.850
He knows the material.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.450
He lives the material.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.680
But I've had a lot of the
experiences in industry

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.440
about how this material
actually plays out.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.440
So typically Blade will do
the bulk of the instructing

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.480
in a very Socratic
manner, which is

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.769
part of what makes
the class effective.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.740
Blade is very, very good at
evoking from the students

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.400
their ideas about
what is design.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.540
Meanwhile, I will
listen to the progress.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.710
And where Blade touches
on a subject which

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.070
can be enhanced or embellished
by talking about real world

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.570
experience relating to
that particular topic,

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.660
I'll chime in.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.970
Blade is wonderful about
stopping just about

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.940
in mid-sentence and allowing me
to work with the students just

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.340
a little bit to engage
them on this, to share

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.670
with them about it.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.570
And then I go back and sit
down, and Blade continues right

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.420
where he left off.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.410
BLADE KOTELLY: The lectures are
interspersed with activities.

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.030
So students will do some
hands-on activities every,

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.480
let's say, half hour.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.810
Probably at the limit is about
halfway through, about an hour

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.150
through, they'll have to do
something no matter what.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.480
Because you want to keep
students' attention up.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.500
There'll be some classes
which are, like I said,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.860
primarily lecture-based.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.280
Some classes where it's a lot
of students working in groups,

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.160
and then we're stopping the
work, asking a question,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.310
sharing ideas,
and evaluating it.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.290
Some classes run in
a very Socratic way.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.670
So we're really having
them come to conclusions.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.350
So a class on
ethics, for example,

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.100
runs better when you
teach it Socratically

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.570
because they need to become
engaged with the material.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.800
And if you're just
saying, here are

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.790
examples of ethical problems.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.220
And here are their solutions.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.780
They can check the box.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:42.682
OK, yes I get that.

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:43.640
That makes sense to me.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.340
Or maybe there's something
where they don't quite get it,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.506
and you could bring up some
interesting discussions.

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:50.260
But I think it's more successful
to have them think about it

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.360
and be able to then
even argue in class.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.040
And so you find
divergent points,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.467
and you have different
students hash them out.

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.550
And you'll find that
sometimes other students will

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.054
come in having
turned their brain on

00:03:02.054 --> 00:03:04.220
and being sparked by an
idea and say, wait a second.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.790
No, no.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.010
I think they're right.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.094
And because we use
name cards that

00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:11.760
have the name on the
front and the back,

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.470
the students can see
each other's name

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.014
and can say, you know, what
Joyce said was really good.

00:03:17.014 --> 00:03:17.680
No, I like that.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.080
That was an important point.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.496
Basically they can
see each other.

00:03:20.496 --> 00:03:23.600
So it connects a class
to be able to start

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.510
learning together, which makes
the learning process actually

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.130
very important for those kinds
of classes to be in person.

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.880
The class is meant to
have a lot of interaction.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.460
As much as possible, really.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.340
At the end of a big school
day, from 3:00 to 5:00 PM,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.460
they could be tired.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.965
And they probably stayed
up really late the night

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:42.230
before so they're
probably definitely tired

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.810
around that time.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.351
So you want to make sure that
you're keeping them entertained

00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:47.630
and engaged with the material.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.550
I mean, it's really-- every
class has great material.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.080
Any class can have
great material,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.630
but the attitude, I think, is
that if you get your students

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.110
to be engaged intellectually,
they'll learn it faster.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.110
Then when you're trying
to shift their thinking,

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.620
you're not just simply
explaining a concept,

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.310
but having them
think differently.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.685
Then you need to
engage them even more,

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:09.810
because you need to change
the way their brains are

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.280
functioning and get synapses
to fire even differently.

00:04:17.587 --> 00:04:19.420
JOEL SCHINDALL: We bring
in outside speakers

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.760
for some of the talks.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.380
And the outside speakers
are an eclectic mix.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.650
In some cases, we'll bring in
someone from the Engineering

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.950
faculty who is particularly
gifted at communicating

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.130
mechanical engineering
design skills

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.430
or electrical or
chemical, because we

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.630
want to give the
students-- there tend

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.410
to be some discipline
unique ways of thinking,

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.150
and we want to give the
students an idea of what

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.500
the broad range is.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.220
But other times we
bring in someone

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.050
who seems rather off-the-wall.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.420
We brought in someone
who has started

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.220
two or three restaurants
in the Boston Area.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.860
And you say, a restaurateur?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.010
What does that have to
do with engineering?

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.080
And the students
come to the class,

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.790
but don't really expect
to get anything of value

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.580
until they find out that
designing a restaurant

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.670
is a really significant
design process.

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.880
You have to look at
what do the users want?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.760
How do you greet them
at the restaurant?

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.090
What type of food do you have?

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.500
How do you design the space?

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.470
How do you make the patron in
the restaurant feel welcome?

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.070
How do you make the staff
function effectively?

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.860
There are many, many aspects.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.820
And to see someone in front
of the room who is not

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.560
an engineer, and
yet who is using

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.410
some of the same
engineer thinking

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.480
that you use to solve a
problem that you never thought

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.535
much about, because when
you go to a restaurant

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:42.160
you just hope that the food will
come and that it'll taste good

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.680
and that it won't
be too expensive

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.970
and that your favorite
dish will be there.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.460
But you tend not to
pay any attention

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.690
to how were you
greeted by the hostess?

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.950
How were you seated?

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.220
What are the wait staff doing?

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.570
How is the cook
working in the kitchen?

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.090
And you begin to
realize that there

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.980
are many more
dimensions in the world

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:05.340
that you're interacting with
than you pay attention to.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.050
BLADE KOTELLY: If we have a quiz
in class, we administer a quiz,

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.430
we swap all the quizzes,
we review all the answers.

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.357
Quizzes tend to have a lot
of the questions repeated

00:06:21.357 --> 00:06:23.940
on each quiz so if they didn't
know the answer the first time,

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:24.850
they should know
it the second time.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.330
And they'll definitely
know it the third time.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.420
Because we review it in class.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.961
We'll spend several
minutes reviewing

00:06:28.961 --> 00:06:31.720
that quiz to make sure students
can use it as a learning

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.220
opportunity, because I do
want to do a diagnostic to see

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.280
what are they getting?

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.260
Are they doing the reading?

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.510
I want them to do the reading.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.175
It's how I test for it.

00:06:40.175 --> 00:06:42.300
But I also want to make
sure that they're learning.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.210
And if they haven't
done the reading,

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.460
maybe they learn a
little bit from this,

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.100
maybe they'll ask some
different questions.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.266
So we'll have someone grade
and then give the result

00:06:49.266 --> 00:06:51.095
to see what the contour
of the grades are.

00:06:51.095 --> 00:06:53.220
Even though they've already
swapped papers and done

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.719
their own grading, students go
through and check all of them

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.980
again so they can understand
what the contour is

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.570
so I can understand are students
not reading the book yet?

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.184
Maybe we assigned
the book too soon

00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:04.600
and they weren't able to get
to the bookstore soon enough.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.199
Or maybe they're in
a real crunch time,

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.240
they weren't able to review
some of the material.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.448
So we try to do a diagnostic
to see what's happening.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.667
The teaching assistants
will take notes,

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.250
one teaching assistant
will take notes

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.530
during class of everything
that we discussed

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.579
so we can tune out the
slides and topics later on.

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.120
The may be an example that we
haven't used before that either

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.576
is topical, because now a
company releases a new product

00:07:33.576 --> 00:07:35.200
that we want to be
able to incorporate.

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.800
Or there'll be a new way
to articulate something.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.730
They'll say, oh, that's
a really good way

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.920
that we were able to
articulate this idea.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.060
Or a really good moment
that happened here in class.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.820
Let's think about how to bring
that into the curriculum.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.870
So we're always taking
notes about each class.
