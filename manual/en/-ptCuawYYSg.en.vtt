00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.980
Hey guys it’s your girl Keiko Alingas and
I’ve got big big news for you all.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.930
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panasonic has recently announced the
World’s First Digital Single Lens Mirrorless

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.699
Camera Recording High Quality Video in 4K.

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.020
Now, for those of you who follow us, you’ll
know that we shoot review videos all the time.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.210
What you may not know is that a lot of these
videos are shot with this guy, the Panasonic

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.210
GH3.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.369
&nbsp;So when news of the highly anticipated Panasonic
GH4 was officially announced, I just had to

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.560
share it with you guys.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.250
The new DMC-GH4 was announced to be the ultimate
photo/video hybrid Digital camera as the successor

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.510
of the GH3 to bridge the gap between consumer
and professional video cameras.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.250
The main structure of the GH4 is composed
of magnesium alloy full diecast front &amp; rear

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.250
frame.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.690
&nbsp;&nbsp;It also features splash &amp; dustproof construction
thanks to the sealing on every joint, dial,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
and button.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.940
&nbsp;&nbsp;Characteristics pretty similar to the
GH3.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.090
According to Panasonic, the image quality
for both photo and video is dramatically improved

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.720
with the newly developed 16 megapixel Digital
Live moss Sensor excelling both in sensitivity

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.920
and response and even claims to suppress rolling
shutter effect when recording video.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.630
The newly developed Venus Engine image processor
boosts performance with a new quad-core C.P.U.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.920
that lets high speed signal processing required
for rich video recording such as 4K, offer

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.560
superior noise reduction, and a max I.S.O.
of 25,600.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.289
For photographers, the GH4 will have a max
shutter speed of 1/8000th, with high speed

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.859
burst shooting at 12 frames per second.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.060
Of course, the most highlighted feature is
unlimited 4K video recording in M-O-V or MP4.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.530
At Full-HD the GH4 is &nbsp;capable of recording
video with an ultra high bitrate at 200 megabits

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.070
per second (ALL-I) or 100 megabits per second
(IPB) without a recording time limit.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.230
Keep in mind, you will have to use an SDXC
or SDHC Memory Card compatible with UHS Speed

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.130
Class 3 when using high bitrate video recording
modes over 100 megabits per second.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.140
For more practical control over focusing,
the GH4 incorporates a Focus Peaking function

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.140
that shows the peak of focus.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.900
Peaking of focus can be seen while monitoring
your subject in live view.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.440
It can be set to HIGH / LOW / and OFF and
the color can also be changed to blue, white

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
or orange.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.140
This function also works when controlling
the camera through a smartphone or tablet

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.280
via Wi-Fi in both photo &amp; video recording.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.690
Other unique features include Time Lapse or
Stop Motion Animation which can be produced

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.730
from the GH4 without post production.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.640
RAW image files can also be developed in camera.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.980
The new GH4 sports high-precision, high-speed
dual OLED displays.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.000
Both the LVF and rear monitor adopts OLED
to achieve high speed response with minimum

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.190
time lag while
enhancing the resolution.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.000
Optional new Accessories also available includes
a new powerful External Flash with not only

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.080
wireless control but also doubles up as an
LED video light.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.480
A new Stereo- Shotgun Microphone, and a very
unique Interface Unit exclusively for professional

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.040
workflow with the GH4.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.010
The new interface unit enables more powerful
video transmission.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.390
It complies with Full HD.

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.280
&nbsp;Four two two, ten bit.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.260
&nbsp;Four parallel outputs that can be used for
4K, also four two two, ten bit output.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.260
&nbsp;Both with time code.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.790
It has 2 XLR input terminals, and volume can
be controlled for Left and Right separately.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.350
&nbsp;Which can be monitored via an L-E-D audio
level display on the back of the unit.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.040
The 12 volt DC IN is highly compliant with
large-capacity industrial batteries and continuously

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.940
supplies the GH4 with power.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.250
&nbsp;Unfortunately, when using Four two two,
ten bit output, simultaneous video recording

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.650
on the Memory Card in the camera is not possible.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.000
&nbsp;And HDMI output from the camera is disabled
when the camera is mounted on the Interface

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Unit.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Downer)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.190

found in the new Panasonic GH4, but &nbsp;for
