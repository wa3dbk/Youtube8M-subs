00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.510
Chocolate is even healthier than you think.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:37.450
It makes you happy and when you're happy,
you're more motivated, or something like that.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.680
My point is, maybe we could find a compromise?

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.830
Oatmeal with Chocolate!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.600
Jogging?

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.820
No Chocolate.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.490
Are you having any plans for today, do
you wanna go to the park?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:20.460
Oh, I'm so busy, I have an Interview today
and that will probably last the whole day.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200
I don't understand what Tom has against
chocolate, it's thanks to brittle chips

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.250
and dark chocolate chips,
I survived my first state exam.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.430
This is Julia. Julia and I know each other
since playschool.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.270
We are best friends,
since she made me eat her sandpatty.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.630
She doesn't look like it, but she can be
very persuasive.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.410
Hey, how are you? IÂ´m sorry to hear about
Peter, your apartment and your job.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.270
I never liked Peter anyway, asshole.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.720
You name it!

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.070
ASSHOLE!

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.810
I missed you.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.210
And how are you?

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.490
Do you really wanna know?

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.650
Yes.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.030
Fantastic! The agency is going well, one
contract after another and ... man ...

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.240
I'd highly recommend.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.010
Yeah.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.460
How weird that your living with Tom now.
Is he still as hot as you remember?

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.430
mmh

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.900
I think that means yes.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.210
So you only need the perfect job
and your happy life would be complete!

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.450
Honestly I'm not sure, if law is still the
right thing for me?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.500
After this interview, I guess not!

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.850
Dr. Schultz? Oh my gosh, it is such an honor
to meet you, I'm such a fan of your work.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.260
I've been following the case of the
Soltau family for weeks.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.800
It is so rare to have the chance to witness
a mistake of law.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.840
The question is couldn't
he avoid the mistake or could he ...

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.670
Excuse my interruption, but what do you
want? I'm in a hurry.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.060
Oh I'm sorry I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Emma Nussbaum.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.230
I've been working the last few years for 
the "Frank" law office.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.630
Never heard of it.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.820
Also criminal law. But ... my actual
request is,

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.230
I'm looking for a new  legal clerkship and 
I already talked to your secretary and ...

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.670
Yeah, Yeah, just give me your documents 
and I will look through it.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.830
Thank you!

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.270
I mean, how could I possibly know what I
want, since I haven`t experienced much yet.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.650
How about skilled manual work, like a
roofer, that sounds interesting,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.350
you're the whole day outdoor, 
a lot of fresh air.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.830
Yes, but don't you suffer from vertigo?

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.610
You're right, stupid idea.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.990
But how about medicine?
I'm sure, I would be a fantastic Doctor:

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.030
"Emma Nussbaum to the operating room,
please!"

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.230
Emma, you're already collapsing as soon
as you see a bloody steak.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.090
Now she is exaggerating.
It happened only once.

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.250
Can you just support me?

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.330
Emma I always support you,
but this is just the frustration talking.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.090
Tomorrow everything will look different.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.610
Excuse me, work is calling.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.990
Ok I need to go.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.230
Is our girls night still on?

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.260
Yes.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.870
Perfect.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.460
I'll see you tomorrow
and please perk up!

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.860
Everything isn't so bad, if you think about it.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.370
Julia is right, it could be worse. 
So, I don't have a Job,

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.480
I live in a shared apartment 
and I'm Single,  but so is half of Berlin.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.460
And this could even be the
beginning of something really big.
