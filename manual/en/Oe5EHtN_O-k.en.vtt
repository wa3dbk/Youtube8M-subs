00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.880
Kyoya was sad because he was beaten by Gingka.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.600
Doji said that he can help him.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.560
To defeat Gingka

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.060
he had to pass through a hard training.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.120
When he was at the last stage of his training.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.140
He had discovered his new special move.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.620
He and Gingka battled once again.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.980
Kyoya’s special move left Gingka in a difficult  situation.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.900
But Gingka didn’t give up and managed to beat Kyoya with his own special move.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.240
After the march,  they were friends now.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.480
It’s time to wake up Ryuga from his deep sleep.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.540
Hey!

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.900
Hey you, wake up.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.320
Five minutes.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.840
What five minutes? Get up now. Get up!

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.320
Get up.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.180
Okay.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.580
What happened?

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460
You must get up. Come with me, quick.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.780
Okay I am.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.380
You can use L-Drago from now on.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.300
I can reach my goals thanks to Ryuga.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.480
Sir, how long are you planing to show orange juice like drink?

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.400
Shut up, don’t compermize me.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.700
Don’t compermize me.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.360
Now f*ck off.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.560
Yes, sir.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.660
Come out, Doji!

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.920
I’m here.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080
What, did you bring Ryuga too?

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.440
You’ll pay for what you’ve done Ryuga.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.280
Let’s start then.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.000
3,2,1 Let It Rip!

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.660
Attack Pegasus. I’ll destroy you. Do you hear me? Attack!

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.680
There’s something wrong with this Beyblade.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.840
It’s coming from the wrong way.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.800
Yes, correct!

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.040
L-Drago is the only Beyblade that turns left side.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.880
and that’s because it’s known as the forbidden Beyblade.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.740
But when it comes to attack, Pegasus shouldn’t be defeated.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.440
Don’t you get it?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.640
What happens when L-Drago turns left while Pegasus turn right?

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.620
It steals Pegasus speed.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.240
You’re useless like your father.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.400
What did you say?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.140
I’ll tell this a thousand times.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.720
Your father was useless.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.980
What are you doing we’re battling here.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.420
Okay go on, go on.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.920
Ryuga transferred his power when he first used it

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.300
and he had to sleep for some time.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.620
Gingka’s anger gives him power to get well.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.480
Pull yourself together Gingka!

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.700
Come on Pegasus Starblast Attack!

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.420
Finish him!

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.380
It’s my turn.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.560
L-Drago gained enough power.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.200
Hang on Pegasus, hang on, come on!

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.880
You’re done for. Dark Move, Dragon Emperor Soaring Destruction!

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.900
Hang on Pegasus, hang on!

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.840
No, I have lost.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.220
Gingka’s anger provided Ryuga’s recovery.

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:07.160
No, I helped Ryuga’s recovery.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.120
Let’s go Ryuga.
