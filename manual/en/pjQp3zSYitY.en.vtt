00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800
So when customers first hear about the model they say,

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.960
“Wait a second, there’s a store where I can’t buy anything?”

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:10.424
[Music]

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.420
So I’m Erin Ersenkal, VP of Guide Shops and planning at Bonobos.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.880
So I think what’s so disruptive and revolutionary about this concept

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.620
is you got a retail store that’s not your typical retail store.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.060
We carry one of everything you got on your website. So it’s really a physical representation of our website.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.600
This really hasn’t been done before.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.780
[Music]

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.240
The early on as an online only business, we had many customers

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.980
coming to us and asking us to try on the clothes in person.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.560
Pretty soon we realized listen we got something here, lets set up some dressing rooms

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.560
in our headquarters and see if we can make a bigger deal out of this.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.820
"Hi, how are you? I’m Jewlz. Welcome to Bonobos."

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.100
So most guys hate to shop. So what we’ve done, we’ve said hey you know what, lets make it better,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.880
lets make it all about you and make it easy, hassle free, and pair you up with one of our guides.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.560
"Your chinos are slim. We’ve got straight legged, slim, and tailored in our cuts. This is in the middle. I think its perfect for you."

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.440
We’ll spend anywhere from a half hour to an hour really working with that customer to figure out what works best for you.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.920
And then at the end of it we’ll place an order online and it will be delivered to you in one to two business days.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.220
It’s free shipping both ways.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.860
It’s a one-on-one experience where you’ve got full access to all of the sizes and styles that we’ve got on the website.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.860
And then you can walk out of here hands free

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.660
and they have one of the best customer experiences they’ve ever had in their life.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.340
And they come back. And we keep getting note after note after note from customers

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.020
telling us its one of the best shopping experiences they’ve ever had.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.020
We’re also able to offer that customer a size range

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.240
that couldn’t happen in a physical location if it weren’t for this model.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240
So, the guide shops have been really successful for Bonobos.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.600
So, we’re taking that and applying it to our women’s brand Ayr, A-Y-R.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600
We think that it’s going to be great for women as well.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.240
We’re at 17 locations right now, we’ll be at 20 by the end of the year.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.300
And to see the growth coming from a 450 square foot test

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.360
to now 4,000 square foot store on 17th and 5th avenue

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.980
we’re really at main and main when it comes to retail in the United States.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.520
I think its just a great testament that this model is here to stay

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.680
and we are continuing to learn every single day how to make that experience for the customer better.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.220
Does Valencia make me look fat?

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.720
No...

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.660
Hashtag, take me back.
