Hi, I'm Kendall Roberg, and today we're going to plot complex numbers.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.500
Now, this may look like an ordinary coordinate plane, but it's not.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.500
Let me label the axes, and you'll see why.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're going to label this one, which we normally call the x-axis, the real axis.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.000
And up here, what we normally call the y-axis, we're going to label it the imaginary axis.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.800
Now, where we encounter complex numbers, they're usually written in standard form; that is, a + bi.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And we call a the real part of the complex number.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And we call the coefficient b the imaginary part of the complex number.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.000
Now we're ready to plot some complex numbers.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We'll start with a pink one.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.000
We're going to plot 2 + 3i.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, the real part is 2 and the imaginary part is 3.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.000
That means we plot this complex number by going over 2 on the real axis and up 3 on the imaginary axis.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So this complex number is right there.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's try another one.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We'll do it in green this time.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
How about -3 + i?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now the real part is -3, and the imaginary part is the coefficient 1. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So let's go over 3 on the real axis: 1, 2, 3...and up 1 on the imaginary axis.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So this complex number is right there.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.000
Let's do one more...in orange.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
How about 3i?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:15.000
Now this one looks like it doesn't have a real part, but it does; it's just 0 because we could write this as 0 + 3i, and then we'd see that the real part is 0, and the imaginary part is 3.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.500
So we go over 0 on the real axis and up to 3 on the imaginary axis. 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So this complex number is plotted right there.
