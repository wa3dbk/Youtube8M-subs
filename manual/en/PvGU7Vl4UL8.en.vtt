Eugenie Kitchen

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.629
Hi, I am Eugenie.

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.769
Today I am going to make macarons.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.660
Some people pronounce it macaroon.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.900
And there are so many recipes and demonstrations
out there.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.160
So today I will not invent my own recipe,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.000
I will use the recipe of Cordon Bleu,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.210
the cooking school in Paris.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.820
And Aeri,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:31.970
thank you so much!

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.089
Aeri’s Kitchen is a Korean cooking channel.

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.420
She recommended my channel,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.339
so there were many views and subscribers yesterday.

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.969
Everybody,

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.440
Thank you so much and welcome to my channel.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.300
I will do my best!

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.629
For this recipe, you will need:

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.649
60 g egg white,

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.730
30 g caster sugar,

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.170
50 g ground almonds,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.480
90 g confectioners’ sugar,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.000
a pinch of salt,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.980
40 g strawberry jam,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.120
and red food coloring.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.820
First,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.410
in a mixing bowl,

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.540
add in the egg whites.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:29.540
And beat it rigorously until foamy.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.200
Then slowly add in sugar while whipping.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.960
Keep incorporating the air into the egg whites

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.790
until soft peaks form.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.790
This is called, "French meringue".

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.060
Add in a drop of red coloring.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.140
And whisk until combined.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.739
In another bowl, sift ground almonds,

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.269
confectioners’ sugar,

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.799
and salt.

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:20.049
And whisk together.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:26.939
Pour the confectioners’ sugar mixture into
the meringue

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:36.959
And fold with a spatula.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.629
Stop folding when the surface of the batter
starts to be shiny.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:58.629
Fill a pastry bag fitted with a pastry tip
with the batter.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.950
Then fix the parchment paper on the baking
sheet.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:17.469
And pipe on a parchment paper.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:23.389
After finishing piping, let stand at room-temperture

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.879
until the surface is dried.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.099
Today it took one hour.

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.099
Bake for 13 minutes at 150 degrees C or 300
F.

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:46.329
Once cooled, remove macarons carefully off
the parchment paper.

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.310
On the bottom side of a macaron,

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.359
put a teaspoonful of strawberry jam

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.279
and make a sandwich with another macaron.

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:03.099
Macarons…

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:07.389
I think the beauty of the macaron is the feet.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.519
I mean the frilled ruffles on the edges.

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.919
And the surface looks like egg-shell,

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.160
and now it also feels like egg-shell.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.160
And the texture is soft and chewy. (If you like this, give me thumbs up!)

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.190
Voila,

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.960
characteristics of French macarons.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.900
