00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.500
Who wrote the scriptures, anyway?
If you say, "Over 40 men,"

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.269
you are half-right.
Physically, over 40 men did take

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.070
a writing implement in hand and did
put words down for others to read.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.600
But is that all? Is the Bible just
"man's book," as so many have said?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.830
Most of you would say,
"No, it's also God's book."

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.320
Yeah, but

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.579
some of us are really
"practical atheists," leaving God

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:35.890
out of the picture at crucial points.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.730
Do you want to see some places
where God has been left out?

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.809
Hi, I'm David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.649
I recently did a vlog about the
Israelites crossing the Red Sea, showing

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.989
that even Bible maps are biased.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.109
But you know,
people who make these maps,

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.149
as well as people who put the footnotes
in Bibles --including King James Bibles,

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.130
sometimes don't pay attention to
the literal words of scripture.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.130
Some even place the Red Sea crossing at
a shallow place they call the Reed Sea.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:23.759
A brother in Christ came up with a list
of verses here, talking about

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.799
the Red Sea crossing.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.110
Listen to them carefully.
I'm going to quiz you right after.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.490
You may want the subtitles on for this,
or you may want to get your Bible out.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.990
Ready? Pause if you need to.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.689
Exodus 15:5
"The depths have covered them"

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.909
Exodus 15:8
"the depths were congealed

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.310
in the heart of the sea."

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.609
Psalm 106:9
"he led them through the depths,

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.729
as through the wilderness."

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.859
Nehemiah 9:11
"their persecutors thou threwest

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.320
into the deeps"

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.909
Isaiah 51:10
"that hath made the depths of the sea

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.920
a way for the ransomed to pass over?"

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.220
Now for the quiz:
Did anything in those verses sound

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.480
like shallow water or a swamp?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.480
Some people say, "In Exodus and Psalms,
even Nehemiah, those were poems!"

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.519
First, what about Isaiah 51:10?
Isaiah was talking literally

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.200
about the Red Sea crossing.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.959
Second, who says that just because
something is in poetic form,

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.049
that suddenly it is no longer true?

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:50.049
Remember, man didn't write the Bible
alone. God's hand was on man's hand.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.200
And you'll say to me,
"Where in the scripture is that?"

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.780
And then I'll say,
"I'm so glad you asked!"

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.780
Get out your Bible to 1 Chronicles 28:19,
This is when David gave to Solomon

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.099
the instructions, the pattern of the
temple that Solomon was about to build.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.549
1 Chronicles 28:19
"All this, said David, the LORD

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:30.549
made me understand in writing
by his hand upon me, even

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:37.519
all the works of this pattern."

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.650
God made David to understand in writing,
with His hand upon David.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.980
That's inspiration.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.980
But "All scripture is given by
inspiration of God," including the poetry.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.159
What does that tell you?

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.150
Regarding the Red Sea,
it was deep, not shallow.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.959
SO Moses would have to know, anyway, right?
I mean, he had JUST CROSSED IT!

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.159
If Moses said it was deep,
then it was deep.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.920
Duh!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.389
And the scriptures are literal.
We must take them literally.

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.430
And if you take scriptures seriously,
and literally, then you will start

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.880
asking this question, every time
somebody starts saying something

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.169
about the Bible:

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.600
I can do it in five words:
"Where does it say that?"

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.300
Or even three words: "BCV"
(Book, chapter and verse).

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.870
To take the scriptures seriously
and literally,

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:50.750
you need a Bible you can trust,
one that you can take literally.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.440
So when you start reading a map
for the Red Sea, if it marks

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.710
a shallow place, it's wrong!
You saw 5 verses that tell you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:04.120
it's not shallow.
And there are more.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.940
You see, when you
stop taking scripture literally,

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:12.940
you stop taking scripture seriously.
When you stop taking scripture seriously,

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:19.770
and literally,
you stop believing scripture.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.580
Then you make stupid map mistakes,
like this,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.780
and you stick them into footnotes,
and you teach them to others, and

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.199
you push them to doubt the scriptures.

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.710
It's not "just poetry."
It's holy scripture.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.960
It's what God gave you to teach about
who He is, what He did,

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.740
what He does and what He will do.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.810
You need a Bible
you can absolutely trust

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.550
for something as important as that.
And I've been telling you for years

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.770
that it's God's preserved words-
in English,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.630
for us, it's the King James Bible.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.120
If you don't trust your Bible,
make sure you get one you can

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.620
absolutely trust.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.880
Otherwise, you make mistakes
as stupid as trying to drown

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:20.410
the entire Egyptian army
in a few inches of water.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.639
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
