Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking No-Bake S'more Cheesecake

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.640
Hi Bold Bakers! Where I live in California,
we're heading into a season of warm weather,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.300
picnics and BBQs. So I thought this would
be a really good time to show you how to make

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.710
a No-Bake S'more Cheesecake. So let's get
baking! Actually, no we're not baking this

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.650
week. We're mixing. So lets get mixing.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.830
To make this cheesecake, we're going to use
the same method that we did for No-Bake OREO

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.050
Cheesecake. Now I know that was a hit with
you guys because I received fantastic photos

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.300
so I hope you enjoy this one just as much.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.190
We're going to start out by making our cookie
crust. My no-fuss, no mess way to make a cookie

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.469
base is to put your cookies in a ziploc bag.
I'm using graham crackers for this because

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:52.800
you use graham crackers for S'mores but you
can use digestive biscuits or any kind of

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.100
oaty biscuit you can find. Take your rolling
pin and bash the cookies until they resemble

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.910
small crumbs.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.129
You don't need a machine, you don't need to
clean up anything. It's perfect!

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.949
Do you guys like my rolling pin? I found it
in a thrift store in Santa Monica and I thought

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.750
I had struck gold. I think it's absolutely
beautiful and perfect for crushing cookies.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.409
And there you have it, perfect cookie base.
Add in your melted butter and then mix it

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.030
all together. Mix until all of your cookie
crumbs are coated in butter.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.360
Once it's mixed, pour it directly into your
springform tin. The best way to level out

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.780
the base of your cheesecake is just to go
in with your hand and push it all in.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.840
It's a little bit of a messy job.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.450
So our cheesecake base is done. We're going
to pop it in the fridge and let it set and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.299
harden. Then we're going to get started on
our chocolate cheesecake filling.

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:41.750
You can make your cheesecake filling on a
stand mixer or by using a hand mixer. You

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.780
can even whisk it by hand. You're just going
to need a lot of elbow grease but you'll get there.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.829
The first important step when making your
cheesecake is to melt your chocolate first

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.320
and let it cool while you continue making
the rest of the cheesecake filling.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.920
Into the mixer, we're going to add our cream
cheese. Now make sure your cream cheese is

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840
at room temperature because it beats so much
better and you end up with no lumps.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.259
To this we're going to add in our sugar and
vanilla extract. To cream it really well,

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990
it will take around 3-4 minutes.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.009
During the whisking, you might want to go
in with your spatula and just scrape down

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.850
the sides to make sure all the cream cheese
gets beaten. Ok, great!

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.600
This is looking lovely and smooth. Now to
this we're going to add in our cream and then

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.320
turn it back on and whisk it all together.
As you can see it starts to thicken up really fast.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.769
Now I don't add gelatin into my cheesecake.
What's going to make it stiff is actually

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:34.070
the chocolate and all of the cream cheese
and how well you whip up this mix together.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.540
This is how thick your cheesecake should be.
It shouldn't fall off your spatula. So what

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.419
we have here essentially is a plain cheesecake
base. You can add anything to it. For the

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:45.220
OREO Cheesecake, we added in OREO to this.
Today we're going to add in chocolate but

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.949
you can add in anything that you like and
it will taste great.

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.139
Now it's time to add in our chocolate. Now
I told you melt it earlier because I want

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.160
it to be the same temperature as the cheesecake
filling. Now we're going to add a little cheesecake

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.320
filling into our chocolate to loosen it up.
This method is called "introducing."

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.750
By doing this, it means that the two mixes
will blend really well together. Once you've

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.540
introduced some cheesecake in there then add
it to the rest of the cheesecake filling.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.720
What you want to do now is work really fast
and mix it really well.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.500
And this is your cheesecake filling. It looks
gorgeous! And it tastes gorgeous too.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.510
Now just add your filling into your prepared
tin. To smooth down the top of your cheesecake, use a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.410
little spatula and try to get it as level
as possible. Remember it is homemade so it's

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:28.479
going to be a little bit rustic.

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:32.810
And that's it! That's how easy it is to make
a beautiful and decadent cheesecake. So I'm

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.030
going to pop this guy in the fridge for around
four hours or so. You can even do it overnight

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.609
or make it up to two days in advance. And
once it's set and nice and firm, I'm going

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.510
to add on the marshmallow topping.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.919
Just a reminder that all my recipes can be
found on my lovely new website, BiggerBolderBaking.com.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.750
And as always, don't forget to subscribe to
my channel.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.470
So my cheesecake has been in the fridge for
a few hours so I think it's time to take it

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.519
out of the tin. I'm very excited that my cheesecake
has set and it looks absolutely gorgeous.

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.820
Now this is the way I like my cheesecake with
a really thick crust.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.729
So far for our S'more, we have our graham
crackers and our chocolate. So the next very

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:09.609
important ingredient is marshmallows.

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.739
For this next layer, it's really easy. We're
going to top our cake with marshmallow fluff.

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.790
Now in some countries, you can buy marshmallow
fluff but what we're going to do is melt down

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.729
some marshmallows and make it ourselves.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.949
All you need to do is pop your marshmallows
in the microwave or over a pot of boiling

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.450
water until they melt and they're like a marshmallow
lava. And then we're going to put this directly

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:28.460
over our cake.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.330
Be warned, this is a sticky job.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.900
Wow! Our cake looks really amazing. To give
it a beautiful finished touch, I'm going to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.500
toast the marshmallows. Now I'm going to do
this using a blowtorch but you can actually

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.460
put it under a grill really fast and just
toast the top of the marshmallow and it will

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.180
look and taste amazing.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.680
Now you can enjoy S'mores a whole new way!
And whether you serve it at a BBQ, picnic

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.380
or any occasion, you can be guaranteed it
won't last long.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.560
Thank you so much for watching! And if you
haven't don't so already, don't forget to
