00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.560
Hello to all of you! In this video, I will show you how to make a water marble design.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.530
I will show you several tips and technics to carry it out.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.660
I will also show you three types of water marbles: the simple design, the spiral and the millesfeuilles.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.600
I hope this video will be useful to you.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.120
And that you will carry them out well!

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.120
Let’s have a look!

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.150
We’ll start with the simple water marble design.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.780
I have a jar filled with room temperature tap water.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.600
I choose my nail polishes. You can use more than two colors if you wish.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.850
You can also mix different brands of nail polishes. You don't have to use the same brand.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.310
Now I start putting some drops of polish in the water.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.820
First, I put two drops of the same color.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.930
Then I put one drop of one color and another drop with another color.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.860
If it doesn’t spread out, use a doting tool, turn it around in the water so it spreads the circles

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.530
And I go on, if I have enough space.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.130
The water marble technic should be done quickly

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.540
Because the nail polish dries very quickly.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.910
Then I use a doting tool to draw several lines. And I have them join together at the end

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.260
to make the simple water marble design. As you can see, I make several petals.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.610
Then I use an artificial nail - or my real nail as you will see later

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.340
I dip it in the water marble.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.790
I blow on the surface of the water to make it dry.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.390
So I can remove what's left quite easily.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.010
Then I remove the artificial nail out of the water to get the simple water marble design as you can see.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.990
Now I will show you how to spread out a drop of nail polish that doesn’t spread.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.350
If your drop is in water for more than 5 minutes, it’s obvious that it's gonna be dry.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.350
But if you just drop it and it doesn’t spread out

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.870
Just use a dotting tool and turn it around in the water.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.570
This will spread the drop of nail polish.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.990
And now I add the second color in the water.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.430
It is also important to protect your nails.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.670
Or else you'll spread the nail polish all over when you'll dip your finger in the water.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.770
To prevent this, put some tape on your finger.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.620
One piece under as you can see.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.540
And one piece to protect the upper side of the cuticle.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.320
Once you have dipped your finger in water, turn and remove it.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.040
Use a pair of scissors, to cut the tape.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.140
Then with tweezers, remove the tape.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.590
That’s it! You’ve been protected!

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.940
To make the French manicure, you can use this method with the help of some guide strips.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.490
You make the white French first.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.490
And then you make the water marble over it.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.490
Then remove the tapes.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.280
There’s another method. You can also use some cuticle oil or even olive oil.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.280
Apply it on your skin.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.920
Do not touch your nail or else your nail polish won’t even last for two days.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.080
Right then, all you have to do is to wash your hands to remove the extra nail polish.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.080
And it goes away easily.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.140
I will show you now how to make the spiral design.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.870
With two nail polishes or more, using the same method.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.890
Open your nail polish bottles before you start.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.840
It will allow you to gain a few seconds and it’s very important.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.450
So I make several circles in the water.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:34.910
Like the first one, if it doesn’t spread out, use a dotting tool and turn it around in the water.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.390
You can now go on with the other circles.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.800
It is important to make as many circles as you can for the spiral design.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.180
If you do not have enough circles, it won’t look great!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.580
Then I use a dotting tool to draw a spiral in the water.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.870
Don't make it too fast, or it will make the whole design move

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.050
It won't work and won’t be beautiful.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.730
You can add more effects on the side if you want.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.950
Now I dip my nail in the water.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.960
Before that I have stuck an artificial nail on my nail since I already had a nail art on my nails.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.040
This is an example of what you should not do.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.270
You need to protect your nail. You’ll see that I’ll have nail polish all over my finger.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.120
You can remove it quite easily but it is better to protect it.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.880
It’s important to blow on the water.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.290
And so you will remove all the residues at a time to avoid having dirty water for the other nails.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.050
This is the spiral water marble.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.050
Unfortunately, we can’t see it well.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.540
As long as the nail polish is wet, you can scratch of nail polish.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.540
But it is better to protect your nails.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.860
These are examples of spiral water marble designs.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.610
Now I will show you the third design, it’s the mille feuille.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.030
I’m using two nail polishes.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.300
To make the mille feuilles design, there should be as many circles as possible.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.630
Or else the final result will not look great.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.720
Then with a dotting tool, I draw a line up then one down.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.720
And another one up very thin.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.510
The closer the lines are to each other, the better will be the design.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.800
Do it slowly so it doesn't shift the design.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.520
You should never dip your dotting tool in the first or second circle.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.970
Because they were the first two circles done and they might already be dry.

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.800
Here for instance, I’ve started with the blue circle.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.340
Now I dip my artificial nail in the water.

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.690
I blow and then I remove the extra stuff.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.370
Here's the millefeuille design.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.150
You might have bubbles on it, it is not inevitable!

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.220
It might happen sometimes. In this case, I dip my finger back in water

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.670
and then I press on the water marble design as long as it's not completely dry to burst the bubbles.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.610
The reason I dip my finger in water is to avoid leaving my fingerprints on the design.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.030
If you have white holes after breaking the bubbles,

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.760
Use a dotting tool and the matching colors to fill them.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.890
Don't hesitate to add some lines with a liner brush and glitter flakes to embellish your water marble design.

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.960
Now I will show you what happens when you throw the drop from too high.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.160
It falls at the bottom of the jar and it makes a small bubble.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.830
If goes back up and breaks, you're lucky.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.610
What you should do instead is have your brush closer to the water and touch it with the drop.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.850
But not with the brush because water will spoil it.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.200
Not all nail polishes work for the water marble design by the way. It doesn’t depend on the brands but on the texture.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.550
I don’t know if it works with the first nail polishes I’ve shown you, you should try it.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.130
Generally it works very well with lacquers.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.080
It doesn’t work with base or top coat. Doesn't either with cracked nail polish.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.280
It doesn’t work at all with glitter nail polish.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.910
Nail polishes with satin or matte effect when they dry, don’t work either.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.690
Here are some examples of water marble designs I’ve made.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.460
And these are the water marble designs I’ve done earlier on my fingers.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.910
I haven’t changed the designs on some fingers.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.680
On my ring fingers and my thumbs, I’ve made a simple water marble design.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.910
I hope that this video will be useful to you.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.960
I did my best to tell you all about water marble designs in 7 minutes.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.230
See you soon for another video!
