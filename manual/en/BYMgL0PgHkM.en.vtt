Hi, this is Laura Turner, and right now, we're
going to talk about how to plot a romance

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.389
novel, so obviously, you've already started
with your novel, and you've started to figure

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.880
out who the characters are, and all the certain
things, where the world, the world that you're

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.630
living in, is going to be set. Whether it's
a fantasy world, or the real world, and now

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.160
you need to know how to move the novel forward.
My best advice for constructing the plot of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.070
the novel, is to treat each chapter as it's
own individual story. Create the chapters

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.250
with a beginning, a middle, and an end, and
on that note, create a chapter that hooks

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.490
into the next chapter, because you're going
to have a long string of forty, fifty chapters,

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.290
if it's a long romance novel. You're going
to have lots of little episodes, that all

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.910
tie together, and the most important thing,
whenever you pick up a book and you start

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.820
to read, is that you want to continue to the
next chapter, to see what happens next, so

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:08.200
don't conclude your chapters with a finite
end. Leave us hanging. Give us an actual hook,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:18.520
or a ford, into the next scene or chapter,
so keep us tense, as it were. Number two,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.170
always make your world full of conflict in
action. You really need to keep the romantic

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.420
tension between the heroes up, and you need
to keep that antagonist, sort of driving your

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:39.770
plot. Make sure that your novel is dramatic,
and of course, the one thing you really need

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.331
to pay attention to, which is going to be
my final point actually, because there are

00:01:43.331 --> 00:01:46.640
so many different ways that you can plot a
romance novel, depending on what your story

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.450
is, where you need to go. Figure out what
your ending is, and I would say for a novel,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.600
you could almost plot your outline backwards.
You could say, I want Loretta to get together

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.479
with Antonio, at the end of the novel, and
so you say, how am I going to get there? so

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.650
what you'll do, is you'll have that as your
ending, and you'll go back through each chapter,

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.450
to try to figure out, what the best way to
plot this action, is going to be for you.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.040
That way, you don't get caught up in a lot
of time, trying to figure out what's going

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.620
to happen next, but as we all know with writing,
you can go off on tangents and figure out

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.180
where to go in the story, but always keep
that ending in sight, and that's my best advice,

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.540
for plotting a romance novel.
