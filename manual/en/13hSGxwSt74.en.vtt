00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:08.470
Let's talk about travel because a simple fact is
that your airline, travel agent, travel provider

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.019
is not going to want to talk to you 
about the truth of what is happening

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.269
But if you are watching the news

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.359
you are aware that around the world is
not a lot of financial uncertainty

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.970
Europe is facing a lot of problems.
American there are layoffs unemployment

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.739
All sorts of things even in Canada

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.039
we are starting to approach a recession

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.240
Uncertainty high unemployment

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.350
and low wages. There are a whole bunch of
problems that are happening

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.330
But this works in the favor of people looking to 
travel looking to explore their options

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.550
Because over the last few decades and I have
talked about this in many videos

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.020
destinations governments all had this mentality of
build it and they will come. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.100
Build up new areas. Put in new resorts bigger
and better

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.690
and we are going to attract people

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.810
We are going to attract the vacationers

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.479
And that work really awesome while the
economies around the world were exploding

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.550
But now they are imploding

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.759
So all of these areas are competing for
less and less vacationers.  

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.790
In the Riviera Maya alone there are more than
seventy thousand accommodations

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.130
and the times I have traveled I have seen

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.760
the vacancy rate be anywhere from

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.730
thirty thirty five percent to the high of seventy percent

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.810
But this is just the Riviera Maya in the
Caribbean 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.909
For European travels you have a choice of 
the south of Spain

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.379
the Canary Islands North Africa

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:47.200
You Egypt with the red sea and you know

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.600
with all the trouble they have had there

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.740
And the dependency they have on travel
and tourism it is a sure thing

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.880
that they are going to be trying to woo back
the vacationers

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.399
So that deals are going to be phenomenal

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.300
Absolutely phenomenal

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.549
What that means is do not jump in early

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.310
In North America there is a site called hotel dot com

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.659
hotels dot com

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.760
They are the only ones that are actually talking
about the fact that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.689
the last minute deals are the best

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.129
Wait for the last minute

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.419
Now this is something that resorts and
destinations and airlines don't like to hear

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.679
wait for the last week because they cannot 
plan on last minute deals

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.239
So if you really care that you want to make
sure your airline is successful and makes

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.729
lots of profit and that

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:39.290
Book early book really early 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.880
Book your hotels your airline everything early.
Make sure you pay the most

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.790
so they can be prosperous

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.450
But if you're like so many other people out there

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.079
That you worked hard for the money and you
want the best that you can get

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.039
for the least amount of money

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.629
more often than not the best bet

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.749
is last minute deals

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.379
And like I said with the reduction in travelers

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.299
and the abundance of destinations

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.299
your choices are going to be phenomenal 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.079
and the prices are going to keep coming down and down

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:18.119
It makes no sense for an airline to fly a 200
passenger plane with 100 passengers

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:20.299
So the closer it comes to the departure date
the lower the prices will come 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.069
Cindy and I have been doing this for years

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.119
and yes we have traveled on airplanes

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:35.169
exactly as I said 200 passenger airplane
with a 100 passengers on board

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:40.169
So my advice again is wait for last minute 
Check your options

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:45.949
In the Caribbean Dominican Republic is
offering phenomenal deals

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.989
But if people start booking there well you can
bet your pants that it’s going to be 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.029
Riviera Maya Mexico that is going to 
start competing

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.179
And even in Mexico think of the competition

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:58.449
Riviera Maya Cancun Puerto Vallarta

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.070
Acapulco has had such bad press

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.209
Mazatlan Ixtapa I mean

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:07.209
there are so many different choices

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.339
So many different resort options and
there are many great resorts

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:15.099
If you have gone to one resort chain

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.079
over and over do not be afraid to try
another one because

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.879
it does notmatter if It is for Barceló Iberostar

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:27.379
Riu Palace whatever. There are great restore chains 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:33.660
and they all want to make your vacation the 
best it can be so that you come back

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.130
They are offering more and more and this again comes
into that build it and they will come mentality

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.990
the more they offer the higher the probability you will go 
back home and

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.870
be bragging about his fantastic vacation
You will have videos and photographs 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.410
You will be telling people about it

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:57.219
so they will be getting customers clients vacationers

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.460
We the consumers are in the driver's seat today

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.030
All it takes is patience

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.580
And if you are patient you are going to get 
the very best deal 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.220
And this is something like I said that airlines travel
agencies don't like to talk about 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.680
And it doesn't just matter of for

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.379
winter warm summer getaways. I mean even
if you're looking for ski vacation

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.699
Look at all the ski resorts that you
have to choose from

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:26.930
and all the hotels and accommodations
and villas

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.199
and cabins that they have

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:30.610
Check around

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.509
Keep checking and the longer you wait
the better deals you are going to get

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:36.649
At least that's the way I see it
