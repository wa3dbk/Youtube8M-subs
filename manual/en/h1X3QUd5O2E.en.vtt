00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.600
We're down here at Lone Hollow Ranch in Texas.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.670
We just got done sighting in the Savage Lady
Hunter, shooting great.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.530
Let's see if we can get in the stand and get
ourselves a really nice blackbuck.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.740
Although our primary focus is on world-class
whitetail hunting, we offer many exotics as

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:27.740
well.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.640
In particular, the blackbuck antelope.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.910
The blackbuck antelope is a beautiful animal.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.870
Small body, long spiraling horns, make a beautiful
trophy.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:01:58.909
You can hunt them a couple of different ways,
safari style from the Jeep, or hunt them from

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:39.340
a blind.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.790
Last night down here in Texas, last chance
to take this buck.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.860
Got my first blackbuck.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.440
The Savage Lady Hunter, perfect shot, performed
flawlessly, so glad I finally got to pull

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.750
the trigger on it.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.470
It's a great gun.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.090
All you women out there are really going to
love this gun if you get a chance to use it.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.090
Go out and get one.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.870
It's a great gun.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.450
You can't ask for more than this right here.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:13.200
What a beautiful, beautiful blackbuck.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:21.630
This has been a chance of a lifetime to come
down here and hunt in Texas.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.350
I want to thank Savage for sending me down
here and letting me be able to field test

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.950
this Lady Hunter gun and be able to shoot
my first blackbuck.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.530
I hope for a lot more chances in the future,
and just, thank you guys.
