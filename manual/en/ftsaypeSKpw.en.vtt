00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.300
It must be satisfying for you to be here today?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.400
It’s a pleasure and a privilege for any footballer to be present at this Gala.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.800
It is the second year that I have had the good luck to be here,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:33.300
representing footballers around the globe who strive to be good professionals.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.000
I already had this experience last year and know it will be a memorable occasion.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:59.500
You’ve been voted for by your fellow players. For me, they are the only ones who can really judge.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:12.500
That’s right. Football players are the ones who really know about those best and worst moments,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.500
what is to overcome injuries. To be chosen by them is yet

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:47.000
another motivation to improve day by day, and I want to thank every one of them.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:02:04.000
What remains of the young Torres? Today you are not a kid any more.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
There is a great deal and very little left over from those days. Little because I am growing up and

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:22.000
getting closer to my objectives, much because I am still playing with the same enthusiasm.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.000
I also believe that good footballers always have to be good role models for youngsters.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:45.000
Children must be able to play and enjoy football without having to think about what’s behind the game.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:59.000
I enjoy assuming that responsibility of being a role model for young people and hope to continue even after I retire from the game.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.700
Everybody used to talk about Marcelino’s goal, although you might not remember it;

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:20.000
nowadays everyone talks about Fernando Torres’ goal.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.700
That’s true. I was lucky to be at the right place at the right time and hope that we don’t have

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.700
to wait so long to win another European Cup. I hope my goal won’t be remembered too long.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.700
Even though it is always nice to have your name go down in the history books,

00:03:47.800 --> 00:04:00.000
people should remember it above all as a goal of the whole team.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.600
Everyone who knows you knows of your solidarity and that your voice carries weight.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:30.000
That makes being able to count on your collaboration in FIFPro so important.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:40.000
Helping children is a pleasure for me. Children are our future and it makes me happy

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:54.000
to provide them with everything I did not have as a child. Children are our only legacy.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.700
Especially now that you’ve become a parent yourself? These are highly important issues for you.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.700
My congratulations. This has been a most agreeable interview.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.500
Many thanks. It’s been very enjoyable for me too.
