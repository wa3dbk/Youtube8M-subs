00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.020
This is Diana Sullivan in Austin, Texas,

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.380
and I'm doing some beginning machine knitting videos,

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.360
some simple lessons,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.920
and I think it's very important, as we go through the cast offs, to talk about the option of using a crochet hook --

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.439
taking the knitting off the machine and crocheting along the cast-off edge.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.699
So the first thing that you want to do is put some waste yarn onto the open stitches so you have a few rows.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.519
Another thing you want to be thinking about is:   rather than just cutting the yarn short,

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.859
leave some yarn to crochet with.  So I've got -- I've measured out a couple of yards.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.379
Then I'm going to take it off the machine

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.039
and just demonstrate

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.689
how you can can finish your knitting using crochet.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.649
Now, very often time, when I've been at club meetings and seminars, I've observed women

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.799
crocheting off their knitting after they've bound it off,  but this is one of those shortcuts.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.378
You don't have to bind off first.  You could just jump aboard and crochet.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.629
So this is the open stitches up here, which are being held by waste yarn,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.049
and here's the yarn with which you would crochet.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.610
You can crochet

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.530
from the wrong side,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.530
like this, going

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.540
with an ordinary crochet hook, first in the rightmost stitch and then the next, and then the next, and working on across.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.590
You could also

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.590
turn it over.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.729
You could end with your yarn tail on the right, if you're right-handed,

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.290
and you could crochet -- see how I'm turning this, kind of letting it roll --

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.139
you could crochet into these stitches here, here, here, here, on across.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.559
You can put any crochet border that you like on.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.130
You can slip stitch and not do much of a crochet at all.  If you just slip stitch,

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.199
it will look like this sample. It will have this chain edge

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.869
along the edge.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.429
You can do pie crust stitch, which is a very popular border on

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.720
crochet, or you could do double crochets, whatever you wanted to do, but think of this as one of your options.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.950
Now as a

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.810
leftie, I

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.929
will show you how I would crochet

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.540
off.   I would just

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.279
pick up this loop this way, with this yarn in the front.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.030
I just kind of poke the waste yarn out of my way, and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.759
then I will do whatever crochet stitch that I have in mind and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.589
crochet on across.  This is nice because you could just sit in your easy chair with your good reading lamp

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.259
and relax and not be sitting over the machine, and it goes quickly.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.290
After I have crocheted across, I would unravel this waste yarn.  However,

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.910
what I want to do is demonstrate the very popular

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.829
pie crust stitch, which is also called crab stitch, which is also called

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.520
backwards single crochet.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.060
And if you're left-handed --

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.679
first I'll demonstrate it left-handed.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.860
Now, you have to be patient with me when I get to the right-handed part because I don't work as well

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.540
right-handed.  Basically, you dip down and you go in the next stitch to the left,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.910
which is the wrong direction.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.969
Normally, I crochet toward the right as a leftie.  And then you bring that through and you do a single crochet.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.810
And then here's the next one -- go under and get it and then

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.250
pull the loop through.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.429
And here's the next one.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.180
And here's the next one,

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.230
and

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.000
here's the next one.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.190
So that is the pie crust stitch, also known as the crab stitch.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:19.169
It makes this pretty rolled edge that has little ridges like the ruffled edge of a pie crust.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.040
 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.120
Now right-handed --

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.120
let's see how I do

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.320
right-handed.  For me, this is a foreign world.

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:40.889
Okay, I'm going to insert the hook in the first stitch, and pull the loop through and just make a chain

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.370
to begin.  Then,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.820
since I'm going backwards -- normally right-handed people go from right to left.  Since I am going backwards,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.359
I'm going to go under and go through this stitch right here

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.909
Didn't get it.  I'll get it this time.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.429
Pick up a loop and crochet that one off.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.950
Next one, I'm going to go in this stitch right here, so I go under and through the stitch

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.000
to get it.  Got it.  Good.  Pull the loop through

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.800
and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.889
again yarn over, crochet that off.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.479
Next stitch, right here, swing under and get it,

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.109
poke through, grab a loop,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.710
yarn over, and pull through that.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.649
Next stitch -- getting a little loose -- would be this one.

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.469
Poke the hook through,

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:58.470
yarn over, pull the loop, yarn over again, and pull through there.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.790
Next stitch would be here.

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.879
Yarn over, pull the loop, yarn over, pull through there.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.720
And so forth.  Now,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.100
rather than take a long time

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:25.369
with you watching me crochet painfully in the wrong direction, let me pull out this waste yarn so you can see how it looks.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.520
These are still open -- I didn't cast them off obviously --  but you can see right here

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.539
what a pretty design it makes.  It's just a very nice edge, very popular.  You can do a lacy crochet border.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.540
There are a lot of things that you could do with it,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.869
but I just want to have it in your mind that I always have the option of

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.189
crocheting off rather than doing the bind off on the machine.
