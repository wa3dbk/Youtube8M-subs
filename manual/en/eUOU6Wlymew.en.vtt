00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.840
OK so another thing I wanted to do is

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.790
to replace the cabin
filter

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.109
cause I've seen that after this kind of mileage, mine's done about about

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.740
76 thousand now, 76 thousand miles

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.269
they do become black if they haven't been changed before, so I've had my car for a few months now

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.649
let's see what it looks like

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.240
so on a UK AP1

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.440
the cabin filter will be on the passenger

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
here, as you can see it's covered up

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.149
I'm going to firstly remove this rubber strip, because it's also holding

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.730
pins in which hold this plastic in, I'm going to use a 4mm

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.440
socket, because it's small enough to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.439
push up on the back of the pin

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.580
so the first pin is here

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.260
pop

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.840
second pin is here

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.340
*pop*

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.520
that should be enough

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.280
really

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.380
do one more

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.280
now this should just come up

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.073
and it says here "up"

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.750
and there you can see the cabin filter

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.110
it's basically clipped in

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.830
look inside there

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.170
quite a build up

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.310
dust

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.900
and dirt

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.849
seeds and...

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.840
bits of leaves, now let's put it next to the new one to see what it looks like

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.530
so here's the old one

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.560
next to the new one from Honda

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.019
guess we have to put it back in this
case somehow

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.080
that comes out like that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.610
this one will just pop back in

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.400
should click in like that

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.490
okay it's ready to put back in

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.440
now I just pop it back in

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.940
and it just literally sits in the filter sized kind of hole, that goes into the cabin

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.260
OK so there is a ridge that this top bit fits in that you have to get in first and then this side

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.030
will clip in afterwards

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.230
get it back down and then cause we haven't ripped out the

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.430
pins from rubber

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.860
you don't need to fiddle to try and fit them back in

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.514
you literally just push them

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.320
back down, that's it!
