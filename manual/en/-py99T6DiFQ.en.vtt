00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.410
On one hand we've already had an Assassin's
Creed game on the iOS - your mileage may vary

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.770
on how successful it was for you, but we got
one. On the other, Gameloft have decided to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.770
give gamers what they expected to see, albeit
with a pirate-y touch in BackStab.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.840
Henry Blake has been betrayed by his supposed
long-time friend Kane for crimes against his

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.030
people and after four years Blake is finally
given the opportunity to escape his imprisonment

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.780
and seek revenge. So far, so standard, but
if you didn't see the first twist coming immediately

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.770
you're less likely to be upset at the direction
the game takes shortly thereafter. Suffice

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.620
to say your swashbuckling hero will spend
most of his time brooding over his plans for

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.570
revenge while spending a whole lot of time
acting as a sort of errand boy for the citizens

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.570
around him.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.489
In keeping with its assassin-ish roots, Blake
is able to free-run over most terrain by simply

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.950
running towards it. This presents some problems,
notably the times when it doesn't activate,

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.650
requiring a jump to get things started or
needing to tweak a camera angle just to drop

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.900
down a level. Overall the controls aim for
simplicity over immersion and when they work

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.580
you'll find yourself flitting across rooftops,
dropping down on foes and countering groups

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.049
of enemies with ease.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.810
Sadly this doesn't allow for a lot of depth
in the gameplay either, meaning battles can

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.310
be often reduced to a simple matter of jabbing
attack until enemies are dead. The lack of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.740
finesse and challenge in the combat leads
to Blake being more of a brute than a dashing

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.290
hero, but at least he's willing to pick flowers
when the time calls for it.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.590
On the surface of it, BackStab is a pretty
game to look at, but the polish is lacking

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.030
and at times the game engine struggles to
keep up with what's on screen, leading to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.530
some nasty bugs. The visuals are also backed
up by some decent voice acting performances,

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.400
but the decision to break up the dialogue
with odd pauses simply to fit the stiff animations

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.530
renders some cutscenes as all but painful
to experience. What should be a rich world

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.400
filled with the occasional ruckus comes off
as incredibly sterile.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.330
Without a question, BackStab aims high, but
between its bland combat and somewhat scattershot

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.729
approach to gameplay, the final result is
something that falls short of the mark due

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.670
to its lack of direction. Fans of games like
Assassins Creed would do well to approach

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.299
this one with an open mind; if all you're
after is an excuse to run around and smack

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.590
some heads you're far more likely to enjoy
whats on offer in this title.
