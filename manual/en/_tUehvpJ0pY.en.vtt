00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.770
Hey guys this is the 3rd video today on shading

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.189
And just, you know, to make it different,
I thought I would draw the Earth

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.180
And the Sun and these arrows are going to
represent light! :D

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.550
So what I'm doing here is I am establishing
where the light source is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.230
So i'm just going to~ in a general sense say
that the light is going to be

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.509
top right of objects and the Shadow is going
to be bottom left of objects.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.369
Shadow is like the bottom I dunno 4th of an
object or something.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.910
So light top right, shadow bottom left.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.320
And I'm going to show you how to do Anime
style

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.239
Or what I consider that style to be.

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.089
And to me it's all about solid tone, solid
shapes, and mostly hard edges.

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.610
So here we have our young Vegeta-looking character.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.810
I'm going to start on his face in the jaw
area.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:01:00.219
And right between the ear and his eyes, I'm
going to draw this line down his jaw.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.190
I really like this line.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.480
This is actually where the light and the dark
meet.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.490
It's like their ETERNAL STRUGGLE, right here.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.750
This line.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.060
I like it because to me it shows where the
front of his face

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.380
Turns and becomes the side of his face.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.710
So this shading right here, this shadow, can
really add dimension to your face

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.320
And give it a really 3D effect.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.409
And I'm just following the contour of his
jaw from the top part by his ear

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.940
All the way down to his chin.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.920
Under his jaw there's going to be another
shadow

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.450
I'm going to follow the curve of the line
above it, his jaw.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.220
I'm going to take note of the width of the
shadow right here

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:51.270
And I'm going to make it the same for his
neck to keep it uniform.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.329
To do the shading, this is my usual grip,
the "classic" grip

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.079
And I'm going to switch my pencil grip to
"shading style".

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.280
This is a lot easier to do shading because
you have more pencil on the paper

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.300
And you can cover more ground.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.520
This is not actually how fast I shade.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.530
This is time lapse.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.560
Now I'm going to shade the jaw and sometimes
I will actually shade the whole ear

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.140
I think that's totally reasonable to do

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.190
But for this one I'm just going to shade the
little circle.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.860
And shade this area right here.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.090
I think there's going to be some shadow in
there.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.510
So shading in right here.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.590
And now I'm going to finish shading in his
jaw

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.470
I'm going to make sure his ear is closed off

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.940
So I don't mess up.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:05.460
And go into hyper mode, time lapse, and do
in the shadow.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.100
Another area where it's good to have a shadow
is under the nose

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.000
So I'm going to draw a triangular shape right
under the nose.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.340
Just like that.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.060
Another good spot is right under his mouth
so I guess under his lower lip.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.430
Sometimes there's a little oval shape right
there.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.530
If you think about his nose, his nose has
dimension.

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.230
It sticks out.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.480
Right next to the eye sometimes there's that
shadow.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.490
So I'm trying to find out what that shape
looks like with the shading.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.050
And I'm kinda playing around with different
shapes.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:03.720
I think that pretty much~ that looks good.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.710
Now we can move on to his hair, his eyebrows.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.810
Here for his bangs, I'm starting at those
tips

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.480
And I'm making little triangular shapes on
the left side of those bangs.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.600
Remember, light on the top right.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.989
Shadow, bottom left.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.169
right?

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:23.169
:)

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.479
So I'm continuing to make these little triangular
shapes

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.689
Lining them up with the next shape.

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:40.710
As it gets farther away from us, they get
really tiny!

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.540
And I never do this (laughs).

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.199
I never add shadow to the eyebrows.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.319
But I thought I would try it for this video

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:53.699
Because maybe you would wanna add shadow to
your eyebrows

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.990
And be different.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.849
Be cool like that :P

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:01.939
Now I'm going to do some shading for his hair
and this can be tricky

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.960
So I'm starting at his side burns, bringing
some lines up

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.439
And I'm going to try and mimic the shape of
his hair.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.860
His hair on the left side.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.400
Remember, this line is where "light meets
darkness."

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.669
ETERNAL BATTLE

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.849
So I'm copying the contour lines on the left

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:27.000
And this goes all the way up to the tip.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.469
There we have our shadow area! :D

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:36.389
And then all you gotta do is switch your grip
to "shading grip!"

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.020
It's like martial arts stances or something.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.080
Wow, that is some time lapse right there.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.889
And just shade it in.

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.719
And this will

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:55.979
wrap up our little video on doing a face in
Anime style

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.360
So remember, Anime style is all about solid
shapes

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.629
Make a hard edge where the light meets the
dark

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.789
And just go about shading

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.129
and so... umm...

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.900
I forgot what I was going to say.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.900
Oh yeah!

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.439
I'm going to do a magic trick now.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.120
I'm going to make a bunny appear from this
tissue.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.129
I'm just joking (laughs)

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.130
This is actually what you want to do if you
want to smooth out your shading

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.910
That really looked like a magic trick! (laughs)

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.169
It's like, "look here!"

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.189
But you basically roll up tissue or toilet
paper, whatever

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.879
And just go over your shading

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.099
And what this does is it blends in all of
your strokes

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.469
so it makes your shading really smooth

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:40.340
And even if you go over the lines don't worry

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.930
Because you can take your kneaded eraser and
just erase it

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.949
And you should have a clean edge to get that
style.

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.550
So let me know what you guys think about this
stye.

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.330
This is the kind of style that you would do
if you're doing

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.039
Traditional Manga tones where you cut it out.

00:06:57.039 --> 00:06:59.669
You can have this pattern on your character

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.830
Or if you're doing color work in Paint Tool
Sai or Photoshop

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.790
You would definitely have hard edge lines
like this

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:09.479
So you could "paint bucket" and fill in the
shadows.

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.039
And if you are interested in seeing other
styles of shading

00:07:13.039 --> 00:07:15.889
I have two videos for you

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.229
One is on the Naruto style that I just did

00:07:19.229 --> 00:07:23.090
And that is characterized not so much by tone
but by lines

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.659
And I sort of dissected Kishimoto's style
and showed you guys his technique in that

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:29.659
video

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:33.449
I also have one on an Anime style for that
pose

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:37.379
So check it out and let me know what you guys
think.

00:07:37.379 --> 00:07:39.499
Have fun as always and I'll see you guys next
time d^^b
