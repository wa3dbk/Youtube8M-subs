00:00:00.756 --> 00:00:02.956
[music playing] What
I first thought was,

00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:12.686
"Wow this is really cool,

00:00:12.906 --> 00:00:17.386
this isn't like any classroom
I've ever had before."

00:00:17.386 --> 00:00:18.846
When the students first walk

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:22.256
into this classroom it
sends the message right away

00:00:22.256 --> 00:00:23.756
that this is not
business as usual.

00:00:24.116 --> 00:00:26.506
You walk and in there are
these beautiful round tables

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:30.756
and you instantly become
part of a team and you start

00:00:30.756 --> 00:00:33.256
to be responsible to
one another in that team

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:37.216
to bring what you've learned
and to teach one another.

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:42.406
There are connections at
each table that allow you

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:45.416
to have three computers
at the large table.

00:00:46.016 --> 00:00:49.306
These computers are connected
to a monitor that the table owns

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:52.636
and with just a tap
of a button one

00:00:52.636 --> 00:00:55.056
of the three computers
can be displayed on that.

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:57.376
This is my first
class of the semester

00:00:57.976 --> 00:00:59.436
and I was just blown away

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:01.766
that this is what a college
classroom could look like.

00:01:02.216 --> 00:01:05.266
The technology really
enhanced it I think for me

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.476
because you could see
what they're talking

00:01:07.476 --> 00:01:08.946
about up on the big screen.

00:01:08.946 --> 00:01:10.616
If you found something
you could show it

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:11.706
to everyone else in the class.

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:14.936
If i see something interesting
on one of these screens,

00:01:14.936 --> 00:01:16.496
I can send it to
everybody's screen.

00:01:16.726 --> 00:01:19.476
So we're able to
do peer evaluation

00:01:19.826 --> 00:01:21.636
of one another's work
right on the fly.

00:01:21.946 --> 00:01:25.326
There was eight of us at a table
and you were with them everyday,

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:28.496
so by the end of the
semester you were really close

00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:30.546
with those eight
people and it was great

00:01:30.596 --> 00:01:31.796
for interacting with them.

00:01:31.896 --> 00:01:33.386
I think the course
work we covered

00:01:33.386 --> 00:01:35.786
in this class was probably
a little more challenging

00:01:35.786 --> 00:01:36.666
than in most classes.

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:39.716
But the classroom definitely
facilitated a much easier way

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:40.656
to get everything done.

00:01:40.786 --> 00:01:43.416
We call this a concept
laboratory instead of a lecture

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:45.716
and I look at it as a place

00:01:45.716 --> 00:01:49.116
where students bring what they
already know, what they learn

00:01:49.116 --> 00:01:53.256
from the textbook and they
use that to build new ideas,

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:55.576
to build new connections,
build applications.

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.516
One of the biggest aspects
of this course was teamwork.

00:01:59.006 --> 00:02:01.626
I think I probably learned
the most from my peers,

00:02:01.936 --> 00:02:04.426
just like bouncing
ideas off of each other

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:06.856
and giving each other feedback.

00:02:07.346 --> 00:02:09.756
If you ever had a question
it was so easy to just turn

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.606
and ask the person
sitting next to you.

00:02:11.606 --> 00:02:14.376
It was a lot more friendly
and open in this classroom

00:02:14.376 --> 00:02:15.346
than in other classrooms.

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:18.696
It was a lot easier to
ask your peers for help.

00:02:18.696 --> 00:02:21.066
We all came into this classroom,
we were all mostly freshman.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:23.226
We didn't really know
anybody and by the end

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:24.866
of the semester I felt
like I knew the people

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.566
at my table better than
I knew anyone else.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:31.336
That whole feeling, that you can
walk into a science classroom

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.106
and there's this immediate sense

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:35.056
of community is quite,
quite special.

00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:38.536
The professor can walk
around and get to each table

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:40.536
and make sure that they
interact with each student.

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:42.886
When we were in here I'd always
be talking about that professor,

00:02:42.916 --> 00:02:45.976
asking questions, getting
feedback right away.

00:02:46.406 --> 00:02:48.456
I would come over and
interact with small groups

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:51.396
of students rather than trying
to present some information

00:02:51.566 --> 00:02:54.746
to large groups of students
and it surprised me how easy

00:02:54.746 --> 00:02:59.266
that was to do and
how amazingly, I mean,

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.916
amazingly wonderful
the students were.

00:03:02.276 --> 00:03:07.586
The kinds of solutions they
came up with were astonishing.

00:03:07.776 --> 00:03:10.236
I mean, I was really
inspired and awed by the kind

00:03:10.236 --> 00:03:13.236
of conversations
they were having.

00:03:13.336 --> 00:03:16.456
So I think it helped me
really understand students

00:03:16.806 --> 00:03:18.536
in a much deeper, better way.

00:03:18.776 --> 00:03:21.046
It was an amazing experience
getting to know people,

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:24.606
getting to use higher
technology, using microphones,

00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:32.486
doing things that you're
really not used to doing

00:03:32.866 --> 00:03:36.946
in a classroom setting
just made it a much deeper

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:37.866
learning experience.
