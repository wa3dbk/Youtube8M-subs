Hey guys, in this video, I'll share how to
make pizza.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.709
This recipe is Italian but it is highly requested
by Nigerians!

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.730
Here are the ingredients you will need.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.760
These are my favourite toppings, feel free
to use any food item for your pizza toppings.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.030
First we prepare the pizza dough.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.920
Sift the plain flour into a sizeable bowl.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.920
Add the yeast and mix.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:38.120
Add the sugar and salt and mix very well.

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:49.699
Then add the olive oil and mix mix mix.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.390
Start adding the warm water and mix at the
same time till all the water has been absorbed.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.280
Then continue with your hand till a smooth
soft dough is achieved.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.270
Cover with a thin plastic film or a warm towel
and place in a warm place to rise for 1 hour.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.789
Rub some margarine in your oven tray and sprinkle
some flour on it

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.610
making sure the flour covers all the margarine.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.600
After 1 hour, you'll notice that the pizza
dough is puffy.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.510
Knead it for a bit and transfer to the oven
tray.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:59.060
Start spreading the dough in a circular motion
like this till it's about 12 inches in diameter.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.269
The dough may resist as you do this but keep
doing this till you can get the dough to spread

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:11.269
as wide as possible.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.030
When happy, cover the dough and place in a
warm place to rise again for 45 minutes.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.030
While waiting for the dough to rise, we slice
the veggies for the topping.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.890
Then fry the minced meat in a small amount
of vegetable oil.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.200
It is done when the beef turns pale.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.230
To prepare the tomato sauce for the pizza:
get some tomato stew,

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.980
this is just fresh tomato puree fried in vegetable
oil.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.400
Add stock cube, onion powder and salt.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.400
You can also add basil and other dry herbs.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.080
After 45 minutes, the dough will be puffy
again.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:34.080
Spread it out more and you will notice that
this time, the dough is more obedient.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.120
Rub some olive oil on the dough.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.979
Spread the tomato sauce.

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.979
Then sprinkle the cheese on top.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:03.400
Put it in a preheated oven and bake for 20-25
minutes or till the pizza crust is light brown

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.800
and the cheese is liquefied by the heat.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.800
Bring the pizza out from the oven and place
the rest of the toppings.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.639
I also love to sprinkle some cheese on top!

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:32.639
Put it back in the oven for 2 minutes max.
And that's it!

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:55.600
