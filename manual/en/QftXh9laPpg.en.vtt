Hi this is Elise McMahon with ExpertVillage.com
and in this video series we are going to be

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.450
talking about canine dental care. If you would
like to find out more about my services you

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.080
can visit my website at www.canineheadstart.com.
So we have talked about teaching your dog

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.430
how to get a dental exam, giving a dental
exam, we have looked at teeth bites, puppy

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.260
teeth, adult teeth, found tartar on teeth,
we have talked about doing some light scaling

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260
of tartar on teeth. Now we are going to talk
about general maintenance, one thing you can

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.210
do starting when the dogs are very young puppies,
you can get them used to having their teeth

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.210
brushed. So we are going to do some teeth
brushing a little later on, but right now

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:59.969
I want to show you different types of brushes
that you can use. There are different styles,

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.560
different colors, of course, this is one that
is often good to start using with puppies,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:15.820
it fits right here on your finger and it just
has very gentle soft, small projections. Again

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.990
you place it right here on your finger and
you can use it like that. it is fairly unobtrusive

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:31.990
to the dog and a lot of people like this style.
You also have â€“ these are essentially the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.470
same toothbrush just different colors, we
will look at the green one and you have a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.950
small side and a large side. You can also
tell that there is a difference in the density

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.390
of the brushes on the two sides, this is a
stiffer brush right here and this is a much

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.320
softer brush. This would be a brush that you
would use trying to get to hard to reach places

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.540
and to use on teeth that had a lot of build
up. And on this side you would use a brush

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.540
and it was just large teeth in the back, get
it right in the back of their mouth. Next

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.549
we are going to take a look at toothpaste.
