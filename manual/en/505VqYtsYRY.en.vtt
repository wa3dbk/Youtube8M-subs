Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.010
[pause]

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.950
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.620
There’s been a lot of talk about not getting
the full value of a rated SPF

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.190
from a sunscreen simply because people don’t
put enough sunscreen on. So

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.800
the question is, how much sunscreen do you
need to use in order to get true

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.270
protection from the SPF? And today were just
talking about traditional

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.660
carbon based sunscreens, not the chem-free
sunscreens with the zinc and the

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.590
titanium. So the amount of sunscreen that
you need to use for your entire

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.930
body, assuming you’re at the beach and you’re
just wearing a bathing suit

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.930
is about an ounce in order to get the actual
SPF value. Let me show you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.250
what an ounce looks like. All four of these
containers are one ounce

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:01.170
containers. I am going to put one ounce of
sunscreen into this container. I

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.740
know it seems like a lot of sunscreen but
that is what one ounce of

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.380
sunscreen looks like. That’s what it takes
to adequately cover your body.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.030
And by the way, this is a five ounce tube
of sunscreen which means you’re

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.350
only going to get five applications out of
this. Okay, so what happens if

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.659
you don’t use the right amount of sunscreen?
For instance, what happens if

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.350
you just use a half ounce of sunscreen? Well
let me show you what a half

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:34.580
ounce looks like. Certainly you would think
that you would get a lot of sun

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.569
protection from this amount of sunscreen.
But actually, an SPF of 50

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:46.200
becomes an SPF of 7 if you haven’t used
the full ounce and an SPF of 15

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.119
goes all the way down to 4. Alright, for the
moment let’s just assume

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.679
you’re not going to the beach, you’re
going to work. It’s a spring day and

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.920
the sun is out. The only thing that’s not
covered by clothing is your face

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.709
and neck. How much do you need to cover your
face and neck to get the true

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.129
protection? You actually need an amount of
sunscreen that’s about the size

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:18.370
of a quarter or a third to a half of a teaspoon.
And that’s what you need

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.439
for your face and neck. If you use these amounts
of sunscreen, you will get

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.720
the full protection, the full value of the
SPF but remember you also have

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.280
to reapply your sunscreen after you swim,
after you perspire and every two

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.890
to three hours. In about two weeks I’ll
show you the amount of chem-free

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.030
sunscreens you need to apply to get the full
value and full protection of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.430
those.
