00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.600
So let's look real quickly at an entire hand
of Omaha. We're not going to do much betting

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:16.960
in this hand, but we are going to have a designated
dealer, shown by the dealer button, and Omaha

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.630
is a hold 'em game, which means that it's
typically dealt with blinds instead of antes

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.970
to force action, which means that there's
a small blind, and we'll call the small blind

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.970
one chip, and a big blind--we'll call that
two chips. Now, the cards are dealt with two

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:44.440
down cards. The first person to receive a
card is a small blind. I'm sorry, four down

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.820
cards. I was thinking Texas Hold 'Em for a
minute. Four down cards. Everybody looks at

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.389
their starting cards. You know, you're doing
this number. You're looking at your four starting

00:00:57.389 --> 00:01:07.420
cards instead of your two starting cards.
You're looking at your cards here. It's a

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:18.710
great hand actually. And there's a round of
betting. Let's say everybody calls. Thing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.981
about Omaha, is what you're doing, is you're
using two of your down cards, and three of

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:30.220
the cards from the board. And we're going
to deal that real quick. Going to burn one

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:42.000
card, deal the flop, there's a round of betting--let's
say everybody checks. Burn one card, deal

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.380
the turn. There's a round of betting. We're
going to say everybody checks. You burn one

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:57.660
card, and you deal the river. And then, you
look at the best five card hand using exactly

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.450
three cards from this board, and two cards
from your down cards. Just real quick, as

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:14.172
a sample, we'll show that the best hand here
is--we're going to play the pair of fours

00:02:14.172 --> 00:02:23.990
on the board. And that's it. We're going to
play the pair of fours, the queen, and the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.579
ten and the seven. Three cards from the board,
and two cards from my pocket cards.
