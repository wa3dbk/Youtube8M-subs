Hi everybody, I'm John Graden from the Martial
Art Teachers Association, and johngraden.com.

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.360
How do you take a punch? First off you try
not to, you try to avoid that punch, because

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.840
blocking is technically a waste of time. I
would rather be hitting than blocking. But

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.189
sometimes they do score, sometimes we do take
a shot. Let me talk to you and demonstrate

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.340
a couple of ways you can take a punch. Joining
me from Pro Star Mixed Martial Arts is my

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.949
good friend, Joe Brignoli. Okay, it's for
my safety. Okay, let's start forward, and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.910
just throw a right hand right here please.
Okay, here's a classic cross or reverse punch

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.580
from boxing or kick-boxing. When I am going
to take the shot, and I'm not able to avoid

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:51.620
it, I want to ride the power; ride the power.
I'm going to try to rob the punch of its power

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.320
by moving my head in the direction it's going.
Often you'll see boxers and kick-boxers do

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.030
this in the rink. And if you're at the wrong
angle, for instance it's here and he punches

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.690
and I ride it, it looks like he really hit
me hard. But a good fighter's riding that

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.370
power. So sometimes you'll say, "oh that was
a really good right hand", not really, it

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.290
just looked that way because I rode the power.
The other option, if I stay here I'm going

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.140
to absorb all that concussion, and that really
hurts, that's where you get in trouble. So

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.570
I'm going to try to ride that power. Here's
another technique that I use a lot through

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.460
the years, because I'm a counter fighter;
when I come in, I'll use my forehead to block

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.360
the punches, rather than my hands. So in other
words, if I'm using my hands (throw a right

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.920
hand please), If I'm using my hand to block,
I'm tying that weapon up, I like my weapons

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.370
to be free. So what I'll do sometimes, I'll
snuff the punch with my forehead, I'll just

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.060
take it right- there's a hardest part of your
head right here. When ever you see martial

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.970
artist break boards, or break ice with their
head, it's always in the front because it's

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.840
very strong. You could take a good shot there.
So I'll snuff it here, which allows me to

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.513
keep my hands free, and fire on my opponent.
So you want to ride it; first you want to

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:01.420
avoid it, but if you're going to take it,
ride it, and if you have to get hit, try and

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.840
snuff it out with your forehead. I'm John
Graden, I hope that helps. Thank you.
