D: What's up Fish Tank People? FishTankTV.com†dustinsfishtanks
bringing it to you from Steve's house on a

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.220
Species Sunday. Now using my normal camera
because that freaking Codec froze on Species

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.620
Sunday low quality stuff, but I am going to
bring you high quality video. †Here's what's

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.380
going on. Steve, your 55 looks amazing, bro.
But we have to speak about something else,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:26.560
bro. People have been asking me, they have
to know - a fish that you have bred my friend.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.439
I want to talk about Discus today. Bring it
to me, dude. If you are a beginner and you

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.540
have had some experience with some tanks,
you have had some good fish and you want to

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.010
get a Discus, put me in your seat, what †you
would you do, talk to me about some Discus,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.309
bro.†
S: If you are a beginner, I don't recommend

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.410
Discus.†
D:I haven't done them folks. I think I will

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.770
kill them, I don't even mess with them.†
S: I have a few thoughts about Discus and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.360
you can believe them. People have different
opinions but here is my thoughts of it. First

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.259
thing about Discus is - Discus thrives at
84 degrees. So if you want to take the Discus,

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.609
you are committing yourself to at least 80
degrees, so you have to throw a lot of your

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:12.490
species through out the window because a lot
of species can not even handle 80 degrees.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.490
The other thing is - Discus are heavy eaters,
especially baby Discus. So, I wouldn't recommend

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.270
doing to planted tank with a baby Discus.
My advise to you - raise Discus up in a bare

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.039
bottom tank or in a tank with no plants, do
a lot of water changes, get to grow to the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.020
size you want, train it on pellets some kind
of low-maintentance food. You can do a blood

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.729
worms but if you do a lot of heavy beef heart
, it won't work with planted tank. You will

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.729
have a tons of algae. So, I really think Discus
minimum size take absolute minimum as 55.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.639
75 gallon work really well with Discus, 125
is even better, the better but you have to

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:56.159
be willing to do the water changes. I am getting
ready to set up a 72 gallon.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.509
D: That's what we are trying to pin them in
the corner folks with †species Sunday. We

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.279
are committed, bro. Now you have to do, is
Discus 72 gallon.

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:10.719
S: So, the thing is they like a lot of water
change, you have to keep the temperature to

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:15.099
80 degrees. You †have to keep high quality.
RO water is not a must, especially if you

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:20.469
have a decent quality city water. If you got
a really high mineral water, you are going

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:27.469
to have to do a little RO or distilled water,
it is just a must. As far as feeding them,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.930
if they can take pellets, you are going to
get a lot less waste, it is going to do a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.019
lot better. I suggest you do like 75 - 4 adult
Discus or something really like it. You don't

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.620
to overstuck your tank! You simple easy to
grow plants, I think Rotella does great with

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.879
Discus
D: What are some good plants for Discus?

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.959
S: Cryptocorns go great with Discus, I like
Anubius. As far as some of the more fancy

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.319
stuff like the Star grass, It doesn't like
the heat.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.209
D: So the thing is here, that there is a difference
because a lot of plants can handle low temperature.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.749
A lot of people know that I don't run any
heaters at all on my tanks, I keep them at

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.870
a low temp. So with Discus you are going the
opposite direction to that. So that is something

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.859
to be careful of.
S: I think fast growing stuff is really good,

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.900
because you typically are going to feed them
heavy. So, you are going to have a lot of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.430
waste. So if it grows fast it's going to compete
against the algae better. So you really want

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.599
a heavy planted tank if you can do Discus.
D: And if I were to do it, I would do a bunch

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.930
of jungle val and a bunch of Sage and just
let them cruise in and out of it. Considering

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.540
tank mates since we are looking at some, what
can you keep in with Discus?

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.239
S: So corecats go great with Discus.
D: Corecats can handle high temps, don't mind

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.239
it.
S:Cardinal tetris, shrimp...Bromino tetris

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.269
are really hard to keep too, but they work
great at high temperatures. They are cool

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:02.060
fish. People don't keep them a lot, so I highly
recommend those. You need good filtration,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.060
you need good heater, you need good temperature
control. They don't need a lot of light, you

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.450
can do a lot of light and some of them will
tolerate it, but as a species, they do not

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.900
like a lot of light. So the perfect tank is
probably something lower, just a couple fluorescent

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:25.900
bulbs, do something like Rotalla and Dwarf
Sage and just let it grow with its own pace.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.280
I had done dirted tanks with Discus. It can
work, I have also used some of the Amano soil,

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.139
good filtration is the key, good water changes.
D: And you bred them as well?

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.780
S: We will have an update when I get my Discus.
I would also recommend getting Discus from

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.780
a good breeder. I like RockyMountainDiscus.com,
I like MisterDiscus.com which is the Sunrise

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:55.259
Tropical place. Those are the two ones I had
best experience. I also want to shout up to

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:01.110
my boy Rob in Hawaii with Hawaii Discus. He
is a cool dude, so don't be afraid to order

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.139
from him either.
D: Nice. One last question for you to let

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.979
you go right now. I know it's unfair for me
to ask because I got a project hanging over

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.060
my head...
S: You can't breed Discus in a planted tank.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:16.360
D: When do you think you will have Discus
tank, brother? People have been asking, you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.979
are going to say when it's ready and we can
leave it today.

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.500
S: September.
D: September? That's far out. Hey, we'll take

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.330
September.
S: Give me some time.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.240
D: All right. Species Sunday from a different
cam. I hope I can upload this sucker. Be gone.
