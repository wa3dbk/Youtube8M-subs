00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.069
Getting started with GarageBand â€™09

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:05.839
Welcome to GarageBand â€™09

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.607
When you first launch GarageBand

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:11.044
you'll see a project window.

00:00:11.044 --> 00:00:15.582
Here you can create new projects for anything
for piano, guitar or keyboards

00:00:15.582 --> 00:00:18.651
to podcasts and iPhone ringtones.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.855
You can also quickly create a song
with Magic GarageBand,

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.825
from a cool blue song to a traditional rock track.

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:27.293
And with "Learn to Play"

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:30.497
learning to play an instrument is easier than ever.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:33.099
Here you can choose what type
of instrument you want to learn

00:00:33.099 --> 00:00:35.235
and which lesson to take.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:39.472
Lesson one for both guitar and piano
are already installed on your Mac

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.108
and you can download the rest
from the lessons store.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:46.312
To start your lesson just select it
and then click "Choose".

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.683
When the lesson opens
it'll automatically begin playing.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.519
[Teacher speaking]

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.522
In guitar lesson one the teacher
covers the basics

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:59.292
including hand position, tuning and technique.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:03.463
You can jump directly to different
sections by clicking on the timeline.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:06.266
[Teacher speaking]

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.869
And you can repeat parts that you want practice
by clicking the cycle button.

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.140
[Teacher speaking]

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.444
Open the setup window to choose
to view notation, its score names,

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:22.215
chord grids, tab or standard notation.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.250
And when you're ready, click "Play song"

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.388
to play the entire song along with the teacher.

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.723
At the bottom of the window the guitar animates

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:36.362
to show you which strings to play
and how to place your fingers.

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.299
You can slow down part of the song
to make it easier to learn,

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.503
then increase the speed until you can play
along with the original tempo.

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:49.209
The volume slider lets you control
the overall volume of the lesson.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.245
You can even learn how to play
songs directly from

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:54.581
some of today's most popular artists.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.883
The "Lesson Store" offers artist lessons,

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:58.918
just choose a song, purchased it

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:00.887
and it's downloaded to your Mac.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:04.157
When it's ready, you can find the lesson
in "Learn to Play".

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.860
Artist lessons work the same way
that the basic lessons do.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:19.739
[Teacher speaking]

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.541
You can skip to a certain parts of the lesson,

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:26.446
[Teacher speaking]

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:33.052
[Piano music]

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:38.224
and you can slow down the playback
to make it easier to practice.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:41.961
But the best part of artist lessons
is playing along.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.599
[Play music]

00:02:51.938 --> 00:03:00.446
Using the mixer you can solo the artist track
to practice along with the artist.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:03.750
Or turn the band back on
and the artists track off,

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.085
so you can play along with the band.

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:13.293
With GarageBand, learning to play
has never been easier.
