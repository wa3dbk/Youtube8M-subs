00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:03.206
- People often ask me how I do my hair

00:00:03.206 --> 00:00:06.501
because apparently I
have the hair of an angel

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:09.033
covered in starlight and money

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:10.683
with a butt to write home about.

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:12.886
I thought I would do a step-by-step guide

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:15.520
so that you can try to
be as good as me at home.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.141
Try, you can try!

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:19.563
This is actually my second
beauty video in a row.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:21.859
And I'm looking extra beautiful
today for the occasion

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.261
because when I was cooking earlier

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:25.333
a bawl fell out of the cupboard,

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:26.854
hit me on the nose.

00:00:26.854 --> 00:00:28.584
So that's why this is happening.

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.453
No good can ever come of cooking.

00:00:30.453 --> 00:00:32.099
This tutorial obviously
won't work the same

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.886
for people who have different hair length

00:00:33.886 --> 00:00:35.628
and hair texture to me.

00:00:35.628 --> 00:00:37.930
I like to describe my natural hair look as

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.776
a sad boneyard,

00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.622
but hopefully it'll help at
least two people out there,

00:00:42.622 --> 00:00:45.350
because if I can help just two people...

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.917
First of all, I wash and dry my hair.

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:49.825
Once I've washed it I
usually brush it quite gently

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:51.227
and then dry it quite roughly,

00:00:51.227 --> 00:00:53.103
and they usually go
upside down a little bit.

00:00:53.103 --> 00:00:54.890
Some people are into that sort of thing.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.118
Then I add a heat protector spray.

00:00:57.118 --> 00:00:59.036
This one is from Superdrug's own brand

00:00:59.036 --> 00:01:00.702
because I am spicy like that.

00:01:00.702 --> 00:01:03.668
So I spray this on,
brush all that through,

00:01:03.668 --> 00:01:06.400
and I make sure that there
are no giant knots in my hair

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.294
that I'm not going to notice
and then somebody else will

00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:09.645
in the middle of textiles class

00:01:09.645 --> 00:01:10.790
and they'll point and laugh at me

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.196
and then everybody will
say that I live in a bin.

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:14.796
Next I take a large barrel curling wand,

00:01:14.796 --> 00:01:17.113
this one is by Mark Hill,

00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:18.859
but I do have a BaByliss one as well,

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.383
because they made such a good crimper

00:01:20.383 --> 00:01:22.321
back in 2003 that I clearly trust them

00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:23.357
with my hair forever.

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:24.766
And I just curl my hair like this,

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.311
a kind of sideways
angle away from my face.

00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:30.120
Imagine that your hair is mad
at your face and it's going,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.814
''No, no Derek, I can't even look at you."

00:01:31.814 --> 00:01:33.194
My face is called Derek.

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.893
If you're using a wand
without a clamp like I am

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:37.707
you'll have to hold the hair in place,

00:01:37.707 --> 00:01:38.845
and that can be pretty dangerous

00:01:38.845 --> 00:01:40.958
so just pretend I'm wearing
a heat protecting glove

00:01:40.958 --> 00:01:43.305
and I didn't lose it down
the back of a radiator.

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:45.771
Ironic, because now it'll always be hot.

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.823
That's not what irony is
the longest mo-re-set.

00:01:47.823 --> 00:01:49.966
The trick to having good hair for me

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.032
is letting myself not care a little bit.

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:52.865
When I was in school

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:54.120
if I dumped my hair and
I walked out the door

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.295
and then the wind was like,

00:01:55.295 --> 00:01:56.128
''ha-ha-ha, fuck you,"

00:01:56.128 --> 00:01:57.822
I would feel really
self-conscious about it.

00:01:57.822 --> 00:02:00.151
But now if just kind of let
everything go with the flow.

00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:01.812
So I brush all the curls out

00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:04.047
so they are super, super loose

00:02:04.047 --> 00:02:06.762
and that my hair just has
like a slight wave to it.

00:02:06.762 --> 00:02:08.279
If I'm going out for a night on the town,

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:09.620
I might put some hair spray in it,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.439
but let's face it, after
this I am just going

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:12.714
to watch the Kardashians.

00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:15.295
I usually put some of this R&amp;B Lush

00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:16.751
hair moisturizer in my hair.

00:02:16.751 --> 00:02:18.379
And then you just fiddle
with it until you're happy.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.492
You know what else you fiddle
with till you're happy?

00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:21.791
That is pretty much it,

00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:23.241
that is how I do my hair.

00:02:23.241 --> 00:02:25.001
Okay, this is going to
be weird so bare with me,

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:27.321
but I want to go from talking
about something very frivolous

00:02:27.321 --> 00:02:28.815
to talking about something very serious.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.712
Obviously, you've all heard
about the earthquake in Nepal,

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:34.151
I think they estimate now
about 7,000 people have died

00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:35.877
and 14,000 people have been injured,

00:02:35.877 --> 00:02:37.158
and they seriously need our help.

00:02:37.158 --> 00:02:38.813
They currently have three million people

00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:39.934
in need of food aid.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:40.979
I'm going to link to

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:42.639
the Disasters Emergency Committee Appeal

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:44.121
in the description below.

00:02:44.121 --> 00:02:45.730
Please make a donation however small

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.534
to help them start to rebuild their lives.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.831
That was the most awkward segue way ever.
