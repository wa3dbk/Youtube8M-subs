Hello I'm Daniel from e-outdoor.co.uk and this is The North Face Mens Gotham Jacket

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.600
The outer fabric uses North Face Hyvent technology which repels the water from the outside while maintaining breathability

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.500
the insides are also seam sealed to stop the water coming through

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.700
the 550 fill goose down delivers an unequal impression recovery as well as an impressive warmth to weight ratio

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.340
this means the goose down will puff back up after use

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.059
I can feel it is a really warm Jacket yet
extremely lightweight

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.010
starting from the top with the hood you can see the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.950
faux fur trim which is fully removable with the zips

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.000
at the sides for all those of you that are not fans of the fur

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.100
the hood has the 550 down inside which keeps your head warm and you have toggles each side

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.320
to really bring the hood in and stop the cold

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.739
moving down to the snap down storm flap. As you can see it has The North Face on each button

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.129
and under you have the zip

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.210
inside baffle which adds a bit more protection from the cold and wind

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.500
moving onto the pockets on the
left hand side here we have the bicep

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.430
pocket which is zip closed. An extra long tab

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.500
for easy access with gloves

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.400
On the right side of the chest we have a deep pocket snap closed same as the left

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.080
the inside of the left pocket has two compartments

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.130
and undoing the zip is easy access

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.159
with a Velcro pocket allowing for media players

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.320
with headphone holes at the top. There is two side entrance

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.100
pockets which are snapped closed with a brush lining inside ideal for

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.000
handwarming

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.500
This Jacket is 29 inch length with ribs around the cuffs and hem to keep body heat in

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000
and gives you that classic bomber jacket feel

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.500
so if we look inside on the left-hand side here we have the zip security pocket

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.500
and just above the cord guide

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.900
If I turn around you can see The North Face departure logo on the back

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.269
The North Face Gotham Jacket offers both style

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.939
and protection from the bitter winds especially on those cold Dark Knights

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.000
this color and many others are available at e-outdoor.co.uk
