00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.759
Hi, I am Carmen Lynne, with Expert Village,
so now leading on from where we were before

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.929
with signatures, what I would like to do is
show you sample signatures of some famous

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.630
people and see what we can analyze from that.
So as you can see a lot of these signatures

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.540
of famous people are underscored and that
is a great indication that this is a special

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:28.140
person or an important person, or that's how
they consider themselves. Mark Twain?s signature

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.899
has a kind of waving line underscore, and
waving lines, as I may have mentioned before,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.659
indicates humor. Ok, Elizabeth R., that means
Elizabeth the first, of England, see how proud

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:46.880
her signature is there. As you can see this
signature here, slopes a little upward from

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.460
the rest of the writing, and you might remember
that indicates optimism, so this person, is

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.440
also wishing to appear using a little more
optimistic than they really are. This person

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.019
is very optimistic, you can see how that slopes
upward and also very confident, it's fairly

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.971
large writing and it's underscored. This one
again has an underscore, and you see that

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:16.210
this underscore actually looks a little bit
like a dollar sign on it's side, so what would

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:24.360
that indicate? This person is fairly concerned
about money. And this one even more, and the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.560
writing itself is really angular and you have
got this very ornate kind of underscoring

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:41.460
here. This it doesn't have an underscore but
what it has is very long dynamic t stem, a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.140
t bar, I should say, its crossing over, see
how it goes over the whole of the name. And

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.550
this one is very interesting, he has actually
crossed himself out, with his signature and

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:02.260
what that indicates is, somebody who is almost
trying to cross himself out, in and occasionally

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.140
you might see this is somebody's signature,
this is actually somewhat of a, this could

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.670
be a challenging sign. If you see this in
someone?s signature this indicates there is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.700
something about them where they have crossed
themselves out. And if this is something you

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.480
do, I would advise you to stop doing it.
