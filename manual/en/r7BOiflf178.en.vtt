00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Today the Subaru WRX STi!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We are not going to test it in the P.C. Hooftstraat and I am not wearing a suit, because I want someting more comfortable

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Which is easy to move in. Because this car is for the rally roads with lots of corners

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The roads where you can go to the maximum with this car, and that's what we are going to do today!

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The WRX STI, when you take a look at his appearance, you will say it has a pretty agressive look

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Subaru made the front really agressive; wide wheel housing, a big bumper, a nice grill with the STI logo

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Yes, this car is made for the rally, and with the license plate for on the open road.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.000
You can test your driving skills with this car, and that is what we did today.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You will probably think that there is missing something at the back. And yes, that's true; a spoiler.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is an ''executive version'', and it just hasn't the spoiler. Too bad!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Let's be not to negative, because this; the engine, 2.5 litre boxer engine with a turbo is just fantastic!

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The sound, the handling. In every gear at every rpm the engine is there, including the power.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And that's the most important thing of this car, because I have nothing bad to say about the engine and the car's handling.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
This engine produces 305hp and goes from 0 to 100km/h in 5.2 seconds

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Is pretty fast, but that's not interesting about this car. This car is all about the handling and that's just perfect!

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
This car isn't totally unknown for me; I have worked in a Subaru dealer for a year

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And I noticed that this car isn't a bestseller in the Netherlands. Thanks to the taxes on this car it is pretty expensive

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The WRX STI costs 69.000,- Euro and for that money you can buy enough other great cars

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But you get very much fun for your money, you can push this car to the maximum

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The interiour looks just fine, you don't have very much buttons

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The most is hard plastic, but what do you expect from a Japanese car.
This car is all about the driving, and that is just great.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000
With the WRX STI the love the sport mode and adjusments to the frame

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Here we have the SI Drive system, thanks to this I can put the car in a ''sport sharp'' mode

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:16.000
That makes the accelerator a bit more sensitive and the car more rigid

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We can also adjust the differential

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Maybe for on a track that you have more propulsion on the rear wheels

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You read and hear a lot complains about the interiour of Subaru

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But I think that they are not true, because it looks good and yes it is hard plastic

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But what's wrong with that? Nothing! When are you touching your dashboard when you are driving?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Your hands should be on the wheel and on the gear-control and are you focuses on your driving

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000
What do you expect from a car like this?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
After a weekend with the WRX STI, I can only be postive about this car

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It is unbelievable how far you can push this car 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Everybody who isn't used to drive fast cars can drive very fast with this car and that's just thanks to the competence of this car

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I am going to bring it back to Aalsmeer, I want to thank Subaru NL for this weekend. I am sold!
