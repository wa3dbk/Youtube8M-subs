00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.349
The 2015 TLX is the best car for you if you
want to be a part of Acura's return to the

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:08.220
front ranks of sports sedans.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.240
It's been a while -- probably since at least
2008, with the last of the really good TL models.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.900
The all-new TLX recaptures that blend of engaging
performance and Acura value. But is it good

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.820
enough to displace such all stars as the BMW 3 Series and Audi A4 on your shopping list?

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:34.200
I'm Chuck Giametta. Join me for a CarPreview
video review of the 2015 Acura TLX.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:44.860
[music intro]

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.900
A new nameplate, the TLX replaces two cars
in Acura's lineup: the slightly longer TL

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.900
and the smaller TSX.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.220
The new TLX borrows some understructure from
the Honda Accord - although with significant

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.000
upgrades to make it stiffer and quieter.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.479
And that's a hurdle the TLX must overcome.
Why would someone choose this car over a BMW,

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.600
Audi, or Lexus IS - none of which is based
on a mainstream family sedan?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.990
We'll there are some good reasons.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.130
It looks pretty good. The grille integrates
a palatable version of Acura's chrome beak,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.840
complemented by standard LED headlights. The
side view is unexciting but uncluttered.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:39.159
So is the tail. Overall, it's clean if undistinguished
-- and a far better design than the 2009-through-2014 TL.

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.270
The mechanical bits are sound, too -- even
though this car is based on a front-wheel

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.999
drive chassis rather than the sportier rear-wheel-drive
layout of most leading rivals.

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:54.060
And both available engines are essentially
re-engineered versions of ones also found

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.620
in the Accord. That helps control costs.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.420
Available only with front-wheel drive is a
2.4-liter four-cylinder with 206 horsepower,

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.760
17 more than in the Accord. It has far less
torque than the turbocharged fours in the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.000
European competition, but also uses less gas
than those turbos.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.910
The alternative is a 3.5-liter V-6 with 290
horsepower. That's more than it makes in any

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.540
other Honda or Acura but still short of the
sixes in the top rivals. It does beat their

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.480
fuel-economy ratings, though, and is available
with front-wheel drive or the automaker's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.090
Super Handling all-wheel-drive.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.430
Acura does apply drivetrain technology that
elevates the TLX beyond any Accord and gives

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.840
it road manners on par with some pricier sport
sedans.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.700
The transmissions are state of the art. The
four-cylinder uses an eight-speed dual clutch

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.760
gearbox that employs a torque converter to
eliminate low-speed hesitation common to dual-clutch transmissions.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.290
The V-6 has a nine-speed automatic. And all
front-drive TLXs have Acura's Precision All-Wheel

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.660
Steer system that pivots the back wheels a
few degrees to enhance handling.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.230
Also standard is the company's Integrated
Dynamics System . An Eco mode relaxes powertrain

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.700
and climate-control calibrations. Sport modes
sharpen steering, throttle, and transmission response.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.660
The six saves gas by automatically de-activating
three cylinders in low-demand driving. And

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.280
all-wheel-drive models can shut off when the
car is stopped.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.130
All this makes for a pretty entertaining ride.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.390
Don't dismiss the four-cylinder without a
test drive. Helped by the clever transmission,

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.510
it's an overachiever, with surprisingly lively
pickup.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.940
The smooth, strong V-6 is more in keeping
with this car's aspirations. Unfortunately,

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.100
if you pair it with front-wheel drive, rapid takeoffs can induce torque steer - that's when

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.730
a car pulls to the side under hard throttle.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.230
The solution is Super Handling all-wheel-drive.
It funnels power fore and aft and side to

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.000
side for outstanding grip. And you can monitor
its action.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.520
The lighter weight of the four-cylinder pays
off in impressive agility and balance, but

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.410
every TLX has superior steering feel and inspires
confidence on the road.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:21.499
Wind, tire, and engine noise is subdued, and
while the ride is firm, bumps register with

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:25.919
a single thump and you continue on with no
sloppy rebounding.

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.520
This is the engineering enthusiasts remember
from the great days of Acura.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.919
Compared against the rather generic exterior,
the interior seems invigorated.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:41.889
The dashboard is modern and every TSX has
pushbutton ignition and real analog gauges

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.780
not video projections.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.689
The double-deck screen is debatable. It can
simultaneously show, for example, the navigation

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:56.080
map and radio presets. But it suffers redundancies
in displays and controls. We're not alone

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.439
in doubting the logic of this design.

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:03.090
There's also a little brain exercise demanded
of the unusual transmission controls that

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.150
come with the V-6 engine. It's this array
of buttons that looks cool and saves space.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.139
But unless you've memorized their shape and
positioning you'll need to look down to make

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.120
certain you're activating the correct gear.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.069
You get a conventional shift lever with the
four-cylinder engine, and both transmissions

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:28.099
have steering-wheel paddles for a degree of
manual control, though the small plastic levers

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.159
lack style or tactile satisfaction.

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.939
That's in contrast to almost everything else
you come in contact with in the cabin. It's

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:43.719
not quite up to the best available in top
rivals, but materials quality is very pleasing.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.820
This woodgrain and this metal-looking trim
is in fact plastic but at least it's very convincing.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.700
Front seats are roomy and supportive, the
driving position excellent. Power heated buckets

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.650
are standard and perforated Milano leather
is included with all-wheel-drive and optional

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.020
in place of leatherette upholstery.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:08.309
In back, knee room is good but if you're taller
than six feet your head's going to be brushing

00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:09.189
the ceiling.

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:14.029
We like the condensed design of these front
seatbacks; it gives you a better view forward

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.069
than you get in some cars with bulkier headrests.

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:22.379
At about 14 cubic feet, trunk volume is around
the middle of the class. Acura gives you an

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:27.659
inflator kit instead of a spare tire, but
models with the V-6 are available with this

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:29.439
handy underfloor bin.

00:06:29.439 --> 00:06:34.879
A split-folding rear seatback is standard
but you'll notice the passthrough is rather

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:41.159
tight. That's evidence of the extra bracing
that's gone into the TLX's structure.

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:47.039
Even the least expensive TLX comes nicely
equipped with the LED lamps, power moonroof,

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.919
rearview camera, heated mirrors, and Bluetooth
connectivity with Siri interface.

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:57.809
Adding the $4,000 Technology Package gets
you navigation, lane-departure and rear-cross-traffic

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:01.330
alerts, rain-sensing wipers, and the Milano
leather.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:06.199
For another thirty-three-hundred bucks, V-6
models can be equipped with the Advance Package.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.919
It includes the Technology Package, plus cooled
front seats, adaptive cruise control, front-collision

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:17.129
mitigation, and the automaker's first self-steering
lane-assist system.

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:24.289
Acura doesn't have the brand prestige of Audi,
BMW, or Lexus. But it does enjoy a great reputation

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:28.060
for reliability and for low cost of ownership.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.400
That the TLX costs less than comparably
equipped rivals isn't really unexpected. That

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:37.939
it's a good match for driving enjoyment is
a welcome surprise.
