00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.630
cars.com auto review

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.860
hi I'm Dave thomas cars. com after a
lot of fast cars over the years and many

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.879
believe now there are five hundred
horsepower

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.250
but none and I mean none are as fast as
2012 Nissan GTR

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.220
special appearance changes to the front
where that may seem cosmetic but they're

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.200
actually functional

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.510
on the front is air inlets are actually
bigger thats to get more

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.539
air through the turbos under the hood is
also new LED lights on the front

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.949
every car I seventy like these days I
believe it or not the GTR wasn't as good

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.570
as it could be so for 2012

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.780
it's actually more power 45 more
horsepower

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.510
the top number now it's 530 horsepower
some reason the sense of how to get over

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.210
.500 but it's really Facebook at the 16
yr four seconds

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.930
alotta has a get into a car with this
much power

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.329
it's hard to translate hola to the road
that's not a problem

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.329
JKR all-wheel-drive all four wheels

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.780
car really fast has a six-speed
dual-clutch transmission what you

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.170
believe in a lot of black lawyers drive
around town

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.329
but for sure gonna shift yourself using
these battles here

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.569
and of course when a ship from first the
second go get almost

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.789
a gf your salary heart literal pushing
back into the sea

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:24.670
really severely the home

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.490
when I think I've noticed there this car
day-to-day that when it down says

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.710
automatically when your bumper to bumper
traffic

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.439
makes a loud clunking sound from the
back because that's where the

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:34.330
transmission actually

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.649
his I also think people on the road
don't think I know to drive you don't

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.570
think I'm performance is worth a hundred
thousand dollars for Nissan

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.360
the interior is really nice too is also
practical you can take kids in the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.020
backseat

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.720
and a truck is really large you talk
about unique cars

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.360
you have to mention the GTR there's
nothing else like it on the road

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.479
there's certainly nothing like it for
under a hundred thousand dollars there's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.360
no waiting at this paper that kind of
money

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.360
anywhere

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.200
