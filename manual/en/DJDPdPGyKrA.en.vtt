00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.620
Greetings, this is Ken Drozd from the National
Weather Service in Tucson.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.080
What's the monsoon going to be like this year?

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.440
That's probably one of the most commonly heard
questions around southeast Arizona this time

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.440
of year.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.040
This video will take a look at some of the
key factors that go into making a precipitation

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.090
forecast for the monsoon, which extends from
June 15th through September 30th.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.730
While there are many factors to consider when
making such a forecast, we'll consider three

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.020
of the most common, ocean temperatures, current
drought areas and climate models.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.110
Warmer than normal temperatures in the equatorial
Pacific Ocean, or El Ni単o usually means a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.580
drier than normal monsoon for southeast Arizona,
but not always.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.970
The current drought in parts of the western
U.S. could actually lead to above normal rainfall

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.970
for us.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.510
The longer term climate computer simulations
are indicating that a wetter monsoon is in

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.510
the offing.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.310
We'll take a look at each of these factors
in more detail in a minute or two.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.170
So how much rain is normal?

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.240
Obviously, that depends on where you are exactly.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.510
In general southern and eastern areas tend
to get more rainfall than northern and western

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:18.360
areas and mountains tend to receive more rain
than valleys and in general, average rainfall

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.890
ramps up as the summer progresses, peaking
in July and August and waning again in September,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.420
but this all varies from year to year.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.000
In this series of maps, heavier average rain
amounts are indicated in orange and red, with

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.250
those areas normally receiving 3 to 6 inches
of rain during the month indicated.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.270
In this series of maps, the amount of rain
that fell in 2014 is compared to average.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.340
Greens and blues indicate areas which received
more rain than average for that particular

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.430
month in 2014, while yellows and oranges show
where it was drier than normal.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.490
July of last year was sort of hit and miss
while much of Cochise County and western Pima

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.290
County received above average rainfall last
August.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.280
Then of course there was September, when Norbert
and Odile helped bring above normal rainfall

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.999
to much of southeast Arizona.

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.909
The relationship between El Ni単o and our
monsoon is not as strong as it is when we

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.439
are talking about winter precipitation.

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:21.430
But by and large, the warmer temperatures
in the equatorial Pacific (which are shown

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.489
in orange on the graphic on the upper right)
tend to lead to a drier summer in southeast

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:27.840
Arizona.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.930
The flip side to that is the warmer oceans
tend to favor the development of a greater

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.499
number of tropical storms and hurricanes in
the Eastern Pacific.

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:43.010
If their moisture can make it this far north,
southeast Arizona can get increased rainfall.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.840
This would usually take place in September,
such as was the case last year.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.700
The graphic on the lower right shows that
nearly all models are predicting a continuation

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.109
of warm Eastern Pacific Ocean temperatures
into the coming winter.

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.569
That could mean a wet winter for us, but for
now, back to the monsoon...

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.569
These tables show various cities across southeast
Arizona and the number of years monsoon rainfall

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:12.029
was either above, below or near normal when
an El Ni単o was present.

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:16.860
Like was mentioned earlier, El Ni単o usually
leads to a drier than normal monsoon, but

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.110
other factors can come into play that cause
this not to be a hard-fast rule.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.560
Another factor that can influence the monsoon
is, believe it or not, drought.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.720
In order for monsoonal moisture to advance
and persist as far north as Arizona, high

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.159
pressure to our south needs to shift northward.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.930
While the high doesn't sit in the exact same
location all summer long, it can favor one

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.180
region over another for a number of weeks.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.640
The area of high pressure is really a dome
of very warm air during the summer and as

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.889
such tends to favor areas that have been persistently
dry through the winter and spring.

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:54.260
This year, much of the Intermountain West
fits that description as seen here by the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.639
drought monitor on the left and the mountain
snowpack map on the right.

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:04.459
If the area of high pressure favors the Great
Basin area as in the simulation shown, a favorable

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.329
flow of moisture into Arizona from the southeast
could result, leading to more days with significant

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.909
rainfall.

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.310
A consensus of longer term computer models
are indicating that July, August and September

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:23.290
will end up wetter than normal across much
of the western U.S. including southeast Arizona,

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.100
as shown in green in the top graphic.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.750
While the official outlook from the Climate
Prediction Center is in general agreement

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.620
with the climate models for a good portion
of the Rockies and southern Plains, in southeast

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.820
Arizona, their forecast is not as clear cut,
calling for equal chances of a wet, dry or

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.340
near average monsoon in some areas, but favoring
above average rainfall in Cochise, Graham

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.750
and Greenlee counties, as shown in the bottom
map.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.690
Similar outlooks, not shown here, for the
August through October period and the September

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.930
through November period, are more decidedly
wet.

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.400
In conclusion, all the factors that go into
determining what kind of a monsoon we'll have

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.650
in southeast Arizona are not in complete agreement.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.950
As is usually the case, some areas will receive
more rain than others throughout the monsoon,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.940
and certainly on any given day.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.820
However, there does seem to be some agreement
that the latter half of the monsoon may be

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.340
a bit wetter than the first part, like it
was last year.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.590
Will that mean that we'll experience the widespread
rainfall as a result of tropical cyclones

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:27.690
again this year?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.210
Maybe, or maybe not, but we should all be
prepared for flash flooding and the other

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.190
dangers associated with thunderstorms during
the monsoon.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.310
Thanks for listening to this presentation.
