00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:34.983
Yeah. That was like 6, 7 years ago

00:01:34.983 --> 00:01:37.639
I met these people back in Australia

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.180
Ever since, they've been really supporting me so much

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.023
That’s why I’m still here

00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:44.487
Thanks all my friends

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:46.175
Everytime you call my name

00:01:46.175 --> 00:01:47.851
I see you smile thru my lens

00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:49.896
If I see you cry let’s find better way

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:51.327
Every tears we shed together

00:01:51.327 --> 00:01:53.119
We just hope everything gets better

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.641
Need to understand each other bit more

00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:56.847
So me n' Dee made a track called ‘Better Days’

00:01:56.847 --> 00:02:00.222
Monday to Thursday, we work hard have few drinks in my place

00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:03.662
Friday and Saturday, we get together and party all day

00:02:03.662 --> 00:02:06.842
That’s why on Sunday, sometimes spend whole day to recover

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:08.450
If you judge book by its cover

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.414
We might look like stupid-ass motherfuckers

00:02:10.414 --> 00:02:11.992
Back then, back then n’ shit

00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:13.859
Everybody talk about old good days n’ shit

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:17.289
We wish if we can but never be able to go back to those days

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:18.639
That’s why we carry on our ways

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.607
Focuse on our dreams don’t run away

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:23.215
Day in and day out, we keep going

00:02:23.215 --> 00:02:24.230
Gotta step up our games

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.597
You know what the fuck is going on

00:02:25.597 --> 00:02:27.529
No matter where we at our bond is forever

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.095
When we are apart we are tied in our heart

00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:31.119
Look up the same sky n' let’s sing a song

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:32.552
As wind blows my face

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.247
Feel blessed with amazing grace

00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:37.535
Makes me feel like just like I’m seeing you guys face to face

00:02:37.535 --> 00:02:39.207
This one is dedicated to all my homies

00:02:39.207 --> 00:02:40.807
Thanks for being there for me

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:42.542
We all share some common loves

00:02:42.542 --> 00:02:44.294
The moon paints the sea like it's a canvas

00:02:44.294 --> 00:02:45.905
Why so many people judges a book by its cover

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:47.647
Once you look inside and understand a person

00:02:47.647 --> 00:02:49.328
You will see the good side and become close

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:51.551
I’m always here for you to support whatever decision you make

00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:53.035
The Beginning, we met at a bar in the city

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:54.867
Felt something special and became a crew

00:02:54.867 --> 00:02:56.655
We started hanging out every weekend

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.319
Get together and head to the city

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.975
Fox introduced me to DVS

00:02:59.975 --> 00:03:03.235
And at the club with Chaddy, we get smashed and performed together mic relay

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:04.515
When B-2wo joined us 

00:03:04.515 --> 00:03:05.356
'We were the bomb in the house'

00:03:05.356 --> 00:03:08.561
Every Friday afternoon, we get tougher in our places

00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.101
Drink up, smoked up and partyed up

00:03:10.101 --> 00:03:11.947
Those fellas are always my precious friends

00:03:11.947 --> 00:03:13.516
No matter how far we are, we are together in our hearts

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:14.535
'I'm always here for you'

00:03:14.535 --> 00:03:17.108
Every moments we shared together is the treasure of my life

00:03:17.108 --> 00:03:18.923
That's why we are here today

00:03:18.923 --> 00:03:20.491
Life can only be lived once

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:22.313
Every single day I spent in overseas is a moment that is special

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:23.995
7 years I kept hustling

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.675
In the place where people speak different languages

00:03:25.675 --> 00:03:27.331
Had encounters with so many people

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:29.187
I can’t find enough words to thank you all for your friendship and love

00:03:29.187 --> 00:03:30.826
Our pinkies are tied with destiny (red string)

00:03:30.826 --> 00:03:32.515
Beyond the border, country meets country

00:03:32.515 --> 00:03:34.283
Many nationalities exist in the melting pot

00:03:34.283 --> 00:03:36.015
My heart goes out to Melbourne and Japan

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:37.675
No matter how much time flies

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.456
I keep doing what I do

00:03:39.456 --> 00:03:41.128
God smiles only for those who believes

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:42.877
When you believe, the door will open

00:03:42.877 --> 00:03:44.544
That’s why we keep walking forward

00:03:44.544 --> 00:03:46.459
And that’s why the sun will shine on us

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.767
You know what the fuck is going on

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:49.724
No matter where we at our bond is forever

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:51.400
When we are apart we are tied in our heart

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.442
Look up the same sky n' let’s sing a song

00:03:53.442 --> 00:03:54.735
As wind blows my face

00:03:54.735 --> 00:03:56.519
Feel blessed with amazing grace

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.768
Makes me feel like just like I’m seeing you guys face to face

00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:01.368
This one is dedicated to all my homies

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:03.101
Thanks for being there for me

00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:04.811
We all share some common loves

00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.573
The moon paints the sea like it's a canvas

00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:08.152
Why so many people judges a book by its cover

00:04:08.152 --> 00:04:09.904
Once you look inside and understand a person

00:04:09.904 --> 00:04:11.584
You will see the good side and become close

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:14.519
I’m always here for you to support whatever decision you make

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.051
One for my homie

00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:17.830
Two for my family

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.396
Three for my babe

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:21.118
Four for myself

00:04:21.118 --> 00:04:24.172
Day by day, Every single day is a brand new day

00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:28.028
3 years now since I get back to catch up and step my game up

00:04:28.028 --> 00:04:30.692
Turn over the page because this is my chapter 2

00:04:30.692 --> 00:04:32.551
Imma take this journey together with you

00:04:32.551 --> 00:04:34.620
Hooked up with new crew I roll with you

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.956
My new story line is to shine and smile ain't none to cry

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:40.060
It’s just begun just fired starter gun

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.580
New race goes under the sun

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.812
Gracious all my holmes

00:04:42.812 --> 00:04:44.572
From down under, now in Chile

00:04:44.572 --> 00:04:46.364
Across the globe my new story began

00:04:46.364 --> 00:04:49.735
Japan, US, chile collaboration of these three great nations

00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:51.944
Languages of different intonation

00:04:51.944 --> 00:04:53.068
It’s the new generation

00:04:53.068 --> 00:04:55.406
Remember the name, we are the 'TRINATION'

00:04:55.406 --> 00:04:58.221
Chapter 2, My new journey starts on the other side of the earth

00:04:58.221 --> 00:05:01.949
Across the vast sea, where my new endless journey has started

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.228
Ain’t nothing can disturb, change or affect my decision

00:05:05.228 --> 00:05:07.428
It’s a battle within myself through all the trial and tribulation

00:05:07.428 --> 00:05:08.968
And I will live my life with this music

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:10.098
You know what the fuck is going on

00:05:10.098 --> 00:05:12.019
No matter where we at our bond is forever

00:05:12.019 --> 00:05:13.634
When we are apart we are tied in our heart

00:05:13.634 --> 00:05:15.844
Look up the same sky n' let’s sing a song

00:05:15.844 --> 00:05:17.155
As wind blows my face

The moon paints the sea like it's a canvas

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:30.395
Why so many people judges a book by its cover

00:05:30.395 --> 00:05:32.179
Once you look inside and understand a person

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:33.863

The moon paints the sea like it's a canvas

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:57.866
Why so many people judges a book by its cover

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:59.682
Once you look inside and understand a person

00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:01.394
You will see the good side and become close

00:06:01.394 --> 00:06:04.034
I’m always here for you to support whatever decision you make

00:06:04.148 --> 00:06:09.397
You know, to me, friend is like looking myself in the mirror

00:06:09.397 --> 00:06:10.828
You know what I mean?

00:06:10.828 --> 00:06:12.564
If they happy I'm happy

00:06:12.564 --> 00:06:14.517
If they sad I'm sad

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.242
We reflect each other

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:17.620
You know what I'm saying

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.381
We are actually two different things but

00:06:20.381 --> 00:06:24.170
sometimes we share the same feelings and unite as one

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.312
It gives me hope and passion to live on another day

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:29.693
Until we have better days

00:06:29.693 --> 00:06:32.245
Our journey goes on....
