00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.060
In this training video we will look at how
to handle an asymmetric spinnaker.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:22.260
The asymmetric spinnaker is flown from a retractable
bow sprit which launches with the sail.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.800
Asymmetric spinnakers have now all but superseded
conventional spinnakers in modern boat design.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.430
The large sail area delivers extra power to
the boat, which will add a whole new dimension

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.210
of fun to your sailing.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.820
The spinnaker is a large sail that can only
be used when the boat is on a beam reach,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.870
broad reach or training run.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:50.430
It cannot be used on a close hauled or close
reach point of sailing.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.620
Like the other sails on your boat, the spinnaker
has three corners.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.510
They are also called the head, the tack and
the clew.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.149
The sail is made of a much lighter ripstop
sail cloth than the other sails.

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.270
The head of the sail attaches to the spinnaker
halyard, and is best tied using a bowline

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.800
knot.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.119
Next run your hands along the leading edge,
or luff, of the sail until you find the corner

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.980
tack, which is then fixed to the end of the
bow sprit.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:30.840
Again this is best done with a bowline.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.810
Next attach the retrieval line.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.920
This is a continuation of the halyard, and
is attached to patches on the sail, again

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.740
with a bowline.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.619
Next you should hoist the sail to check things
aren’t tangled.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.259
When the sail is hoisted, go to the spinnaker
sheets and pass one of them around the front

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.729
of the forestay.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.090
And through its control fairlead, and the
other through the fairlead on the other side

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.340
of the boat.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.920
Tie a figure of eight stopper knot in the
end of both sheets, and then tie both ends

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.510
of the sheets together using a reef knot.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.610
With all the ropes connected correctly you
should then pull the sail into the spinnaker

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.069
chute by pulling on the retrieval line, but
be careful that the sail doesn’t get caught

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.469
around the trolley, as this could cause damage.

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.739
With the jib rigged you may choose to relocate
the forestay and tie this back to the mast.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.659
This prevents the spinnaker from snagging
on the wire and also keeps it clear of the

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.670
jib when furling.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.030
You must remember to reconnect the forestay
before you lower the jib at the end of your

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:56.670
sailing session, otherwise the mast 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:08.439
will 
fall down.
