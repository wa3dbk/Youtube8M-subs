00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.390
Hi I'm Tricia, an organic gardener.  I grow
organically for a healthy and safe food supply,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.849
for a clean and sustainable environment,

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.349
for an enjoyable and rewarding experience.

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.799
Spring is on the way and the fruit trees are
ready to bloom.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.750
Just before bud break is the perfect time
to fertilize.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.130
Not every tree needs fertilizer every year
nor in the same amounts, if you fertilize

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.039
too much you'll get too many leaves and
shoots and not enough fruit.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.410
Luckily the tree can tell you what it
needs.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.530
To find out if your fruit tree could use a
fertilizer boost

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.920
start out by locating last year's

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.050
growth rings.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.020
Measure from the growth ring

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.610
all the way out to the end of the branch.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.709
Measure several spots around the tree

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:51.769
and average them together to get your number
for average growth that the tree had last

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:52.580
year.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.490
There are target growth rates for different
species

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.030
and whether the fruit tree is non
bearing, which means a young tree that did

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.630
not set a crop last year or if it's
bearing.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.600
If your trees have been heavily pruned

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.820
or your last year's growth is longer
than the target growth

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.280
don't fertilize.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.830
If last year's growth

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.540
is in the middle of the target growth

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.690
you can either not fertilizer or
fertilize with a lower application rates.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.040
If last year's growth

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.800
is on the low end of the target growth
or less than the target growth

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.119
fertilize at the full application rates.

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.049
The amount of fertilizer to give your
tree depends on the age and size of the

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.310
tree.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.310
The maximum a tree needs is one-tenth of
a pound of actual nitrogen per year old

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.319
or per inch of trunk diameter
measured

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.220
a foot above the ground.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.820
Don't give your trees more than one
pound of actual nitrogen in one year.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.460
Use an organic high nitrogen fertilizer

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.000
blood meal, soybean meal, chicken manure,
cottonseed meal and feather meal

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.880
are some great organic nitrogen sources.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.750
or you can use a fertilizer that's
specifically for fruit trees like this

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.470
E.B. Stone citrus and fruit tree food.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.210
For micro nutrients use compost.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.569
The NPK numbers on fertilizers show
the percentage of nutrients per pound of

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.809
fertilizer.

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.659
N,P and K

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.779
refer to actual nitrogen,

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:19.189
phosphorus and potassium.

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.499
For example

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:25.229
my five-year-old apple tree needs a half
a pound of nitrogen fertilizer.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:30.569
The E.B. Stone fruit tree fertilizer that is
seven percent nitrogen

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.110
or you can think of it as point zero
seven pounds of nitrogen

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.969
per one pound of fertilizer.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:39.040
Half a pound

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.859
or point five divided by the percentage

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.409
point zero seven

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.849
gives me seven pounds, which is the
amount I should apply.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.499
Based on the calculations my tree needs a
pound and a half of fertilizer which is

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:57.709
three cups. The easiest way to do it is
to sprinkle the fertilizer around the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.389
tree and then rake it in and water deeply.

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:05.149
Don't start fertilizing next to the
trunk, start a foot from the trunk and

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:09.019
spread the fertilizer evenly all the way
out to the drip line.

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.509
The drip line is the perimeter of the
trees farthest reaching branches.

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:18.519
Another very effective but a little bit more
difficult way to add fertilizer to your fruit

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.389
trees

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:23.319
is to drill a series of small holes so
that the fertilizer can get right to

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.259
the roots. Dig the holes six inches down and
twelve to eighteen inches apart

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:30.420
from a foot outward from the trunk

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.819
to the drip line.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.789
Sprinkle a little of the fertilizer
you've measured out according to the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:39.479
recommended rates in each hole and then
cover up with soil.

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:42.389
There are a lot of nutrients like
phosphorus and mycorrhiza that

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.499
don't travel well through the soil

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:47.689
this insures that you get these
nutrients right down to the root zone,

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:49.500
where they can do their best work.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.910
After fertilizing add a one inch layer of
compost so that you get all the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.649
micro-nutrients you need.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:01.949
Don't fertilize in the fall because that can
stimulate new growth

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:04.879
that might get damaged by frost.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.199
In addition to nutrients the trees need
oxygen

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.669
and if you live in an area with
compacted soil, you may want to try this tree and

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:17.279
shrub aerator which will deliver
oxygen directly to the roots. Poke it into

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:20.579
the ground about six inches down and
turn on the water

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.159
continue to push it into the ground

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:27.999
when you see a foamy combo of air and
water come up to the ground it's saturated

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:29.269
and your done.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:32.230
Fertilize with care and your trees will grow big and strong.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.910
Grow organic for life!
