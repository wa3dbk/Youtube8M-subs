00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:20.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Hi I’m Darren Kennedy and I’ve come to St Albans to visit the Barlow family who went online and won our festive makeover.

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:24.500
I’m here today with my team to give their house a fabulous festive look.

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:33.500
Hello everyone and congratulations on winning the Matalan Christmas makeover! Are you very excited?

00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: We’re over the moon, absolutely delighted!

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: What’s Christmas normally like in the Barlow household?

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:43.500
&gt;&gt;DAD: We’ve got all the family coming around, 15 people, so it’s going to be a noisy and fun affair.

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:46.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: What’s your normal style with the decorations?

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:55.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: It’s normally a mix. We have something for the adults, to try and make it look quiet classy but we also like all the 
Christmas characters and the lights and Santa for the children.

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.500
And obviously the tree is really important so that Santa can come down the chimney.

00:00:59.501 --> 00:01:01.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: And Daisy what about you? What type of decorations do you like?

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:06.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: I have a pink Christmas tree that I put up in my room.

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: So you decorate your bedroom?

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: And I have a homemade angel.

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:16.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Well this year you don’t have to lift a finger because I’ve got my team here and we’re going to deck your halls with 
whole lot of festive cheer.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:23.500
What I want you to do now is pack you off for the afternoon and when you come back, you’re going to have a lovely Christmas house awaiting you. 

00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:24.500
Does that sound like a plan?

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: That sounds amazing, thank you very much!

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:29.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Well I hope you like it now, the pressure is on!

00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.500
Right, we have gotten rid of the family so it’s time to get my team in and get cracking.

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:54.500
So we’re starting off with your Christmas tree and always, always, always, put the lights on first, because if a light bulb goes for whatever reason, you can take them off easily. 

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:04.500
My first tip for decking out your home this Christmas is to pick a colour scheme and stick to it.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:11.500
Here we have chosen the classic red and gold. Clashing lots of colours can end up looking really messy.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:22.500
If you want to be on trend this Christmas, and let’s face it who doesn’t, then think rustic.

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:28.500
Use woodland tones and animal like iconography so your home is fashionable and festive this year.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:39.500
When it comes to your dining room table, than more is definitely more this time of year. Stick to the colour scheme and pile on 
lashings of gorgeous table wear.

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:50.500
Well that is the all-important dinner table set, we just need to light the candles then we’re good to go.  

00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:57.500
Okay guys, I think we’re done.

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:02.500
Guys are you ready?

00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:03.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: Yes!

00:03:03.501 --> 00:03:04.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Do you want to come in?

00:03:04.501 --> 00:03:05.500
&gt;&gt;DAD: Yes please!

00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Come on in. 

00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:07.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: Wow!

00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:09.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Welcome to Christmas!

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:10.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: Wow!

00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:16.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: What do you think?

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:17.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: This is unbelievable!

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:19.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: Are they real?

00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:27.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: I love the tree, I love the tree, absolutely fantastic! I love the little figurines, the soldiers, they’re beautiful! 

00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:29.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Aren’t they really Christmassy! How about you dad?

00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:33.500
&gt;&gt;DAD: I love the tree too. Really fantastic!

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:39.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: And Daisy, what about you?

00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: I like the Christmas tree and the candles.

00:03:42.501 --> 00:03:48.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Good eye, you spotted the candles. I have to say, one of my favourite pieces are the silver reindeer.  

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:50.500
&gt;&gt;DAISY: They’re lovely.

00:03:50.501 --> 00:03:52.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: Really stylish aren’t they Daisy?

00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: We slightly rearranged your furniture, did you notice that?

00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:59.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: It looks really good, I like the room laid out like this.

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:03.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: Which means, you have all this open space to the dining area.

00:04:07.501 --> 00:04:09.500
Mum, you seem very happy, I have to say.

00:04:09.501 --> 00:04:14.500
&gt;&gt;MUM: It is beautiful, I love all the red! I just want to get a turkey out now!

00:04:22.501 --> 00:04:29.500
&gt;&gt;DARREN: So that’s the Barlow family home laid out for Christmas. If you would like to see how they get on with their wardrobe makeover then stay online a pop over to this week’s Kat’s Closet.
