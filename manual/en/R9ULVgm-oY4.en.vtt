Daddy Troy: Welcome back to Gear Daddy, I’m
your host Daddy Troy.&nbsp; Today’s topic father’s

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.480
day gifts for the photographer dad, speaking
of photography, check out the front of this

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.811
Baby Bjorn box.&nbsp; It’s got a photograph
of a dad on it.&nbsp; Thanks, Baby Bjorn.&nbsp; So,

00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:25.130
we are going to talk about three types of
camera’s today and gifts associated with

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.261
them.&nbsp; First of all the phone camera, next
we are going to talk about little point and

00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:35.399
shoot camera’s and finally gifts for the
dad who shoots on an SLR.&nbsp; Our first gift

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.680
is an iPhone app.&nbsp; It’s called Autostich.&nbsp;
The camera on the iPhone only has a certain

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.210
amount of angle to it and therefore you want
to take a giant panorama of say mountains

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.239
and you want to get the whole thing into perspective
you can use Ausostich to do that.&nbsp; It’s

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.039
a real easy to program to use.&nbsp; You simply
take some photos with your phone, go the program;

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.570
it calls up your photo library.&nbsp; You drag
the photos into a special area of the screen

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:05.900
and you simply press go or stitch and voila.&nbsp;
You have a panoramic shot that you can either

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.301
leave has it is or crop.&nbsp; Save it and then
have it has a high-resolution photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:16.580
second gift is another iPone app, its called
Best Camera.&nbsp; It’s from a photographer,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.420
whose name is Chris Jarvis.&nbsp;&nbsp; What’s really
neat about him is that he’s a professional

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.090
photographer but his whole deal is that the
best camera is the one you have with you.&nbsp;

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.030
Which is exactly what happened to me recently
on a trip to the country with my kids.&nbsp; Where

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.720
at a dance hall, it was four in the afternoon
when I took this photo and the photo is severely

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.390
backlit.&nbsp;&nbsp; It’s kind of washed out.&nbsp;
So best camera allows me to put a filter on

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.170
this.&nbsp; First thing I’m going to do is de-saturate
the shot.&nbsp; It’s going to go black and white

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.970
and then I’m going to warm it a bit which
gives it a bit of a sepia feel.&nbsp; I can than

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.410
save that photo back to my iPhone with all
the filters applied or I can share it via

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.220
Facebook or Twitter.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can also share
it with the Best Camera community, which also

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.250
uses this particular app.&nbsp;&nbsp; Which then allows
others to learn what filters I used as well

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.370
as me to learn what filters they are using.&nbsp;
It’s a great learning opportunity for me

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.289
as a photographer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, is a wireless
SD card.&nbsp; This will transmit pictures wirelessly

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.379
from your camera to your computer and if there’s
a wireless network present where you took

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.060
the picture it will also, geo-tag or geo-locate
your picture s, so later on you knew where

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.299
the picture was taken.&nbsp; Really handy, these
are between&nbsp; $40 and $100, depending on the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.082
functionality of the card.&nbsp; There called
iFi.&nbsp; This is a camera extender and this

00:02:27.082 --> 00:02:33.090
model is called the xShot.&nbsp; It’s a telescoping
rod that goes from 9 inches to 37 inches and

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.730
allows you take pictures of yourself and other
people as well as some scenery in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.659
You can use it to take pictures above crowds
and it costs $30.&nbsp; Well it is Father’s

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.189
Day which means summers here so what not go
the pool and take some pictures of kids underwater

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:54.590
with this Dicapack waterproof camera case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It’s a soft-shell case although it has a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.349
hard attachment, which allows the zoom lens
on your camera to go in and out as you use

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.530
it.&nbsp; These cost between and $20 and $50 and
our a great deal.&nbsp; For all you SLR dad’s

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.889
out their single lens reflex dad’s you might
to think about or asking your family to help

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.560
you think about getting a polarizing filter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It really will help you step up your game

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.099
in terms of photography.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A polarizing
filter will eliminate reflected light and

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.379
it will also make skies really a deep blue.&nbsp;
In order to buy one you will need to know

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.519
the thread size on the lens of your camera
and these will cost you between about $30

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:37.761
for an off brand, all the way up to $50 for
a name brand such as Tiffen or Hoya.&nbsp; This

00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:42.090
is called a light scoop and it’s for SLR
cameras.&nbsp;&nbsp; SLR cameras have a little popup

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.170
flash on them.&nbsp; Usually it creates a lot
of shadows, it’s not a really great flash

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.019
and if you don’t want to shell out the bucks
for a high-end flash to go in your hot shoe

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.889
instead you can buy for 30 bucks the light
scoop.&nbsp; You can see it’s a mirrored surface

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:58.970
right there.&nbsp; It goes onto the hot shoe in
your camera although it does not receive any

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.849
power from it.&nbsp; And you’ll notice what
happens when I press the button to take a

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:12.010
picture.&nbsp; The flash pops up inside of the
light scoop.&nbsp; It hits the mirrored surface

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.310
and goes off onto the ceiling and then fills
the room full of light.&nbsp; You can see from

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.950
these images right here that these one image
has a lot of shadows and this other image

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:29.090
has no shadows at all.&nbsp; And finally for SLR
dads it the black rapid camera strap.&nbsp; It’s

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.470
totally reinvented the camera strap.&nbsp; Rather
than attaching the camera strap to the side

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.320
of the body he has attached it to the tripod
screw on the bottom of the body of the camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.760
And the attachment point actually swivels
which allows you to pull the camera up quickly

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.780
and have it to position and rather than moving
the whole strap the camera slides along the

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.010
strap therefore you don’t get choked, the
camera strap does not slide off your body,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.260
and well worth it if dad’s going to be shooting
in the field for a prolonged length of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.320
Well that’s all this week for Gear Daddy.&nbsp;&nbsp;
