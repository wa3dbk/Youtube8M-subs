Hello Summoners and welcome to my Top 10 Escape Champions video.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.040
When you think about escaping in League of Legends the best weapons

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.820
are usually a Blink-sort of Ability, Movement Speed boost or Hard Crowd Controll Spell

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.854
and I've come up with the 10 best Champions 
list that I think have the best capabilties to escape.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.473
My name is Hepodix and hope you enjoy.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.660
Tristana is the AD Carry I wanted to include amongst the other AD Carries available

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.974
because I personally think she has the best escape capabilities aside them.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.360
Her main escape comes up from the second Ability Rocket Jump (W) which has slight

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.640
delay upon activating but it does slow too and reset upon assits and kills.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.380
Her main escape comes up from the second Ability Rocket Jump (W) which has slight

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.720
delay upon activating but it does slow too and reset upon assits and kills.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.120
That mixed with her Ultimate Buster Shot (R) that knocks away Champions and runs on

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.720
moderately low cooldown, Tristana is able to succeed well when it comes to escaping.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.000
Tryndamere is without a doubt one annoying Barbarian when it comes to escaping.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.798
Even though his only Crowd Control effect comes from the Mocking Shout (W)

00:01:23.798 --> 00:01:27.434
he's advantage lies within the sustain when you can heal with Bloodlust (Q)

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.800
and become unkillable for brief time with 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.760
Undying Rage (R).

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.500
Also Spinning Slash (E)
helps out to escape and even go through walls which all are really nice stuff combined.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.020
I highly believe Gragas is a Champion that doesn't get that well noticed when

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.804
it comes to escaping situations, but he really does that quite well.

00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:06.444
Now that the Barrel Roll (Q) slows and Body Slam (E) knocks as well he has quite many

00:02:06.444 --> 00:02:10.299
Crowd Control spells to escape with and the Ultimate Explosive Cask (R)

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.739
is really amazing escape Ability too.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.980
With these adjustments around I think Gragas has become quitenasty barrel master with its rich and delicious escape methods.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.380
Singed has been a one legendary escaper since it's release and I can't blame it

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.920
as even one of the famous quotes regarding him is called "Don't Chase Singed."

00:02:39.306 --> 00:02:45.226
In terms of CC Singed has an AoE slow Mega Adhesive (W) and Fling (E) that throws them away.

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:50.386
His first Ability Poison Trail (Q) makes enemies go hesitant because you'll being often poisoned if you 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.640
chase this bad boy.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:59.160
Also the Ultimate Insanity Potion (R) compiles the other Abilities together as Singed is truly nasty one to catchup.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.180
LeBlanc is one tricky Assassin and also a great escaper too.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.900
Teleporting back and forth using Distortion (W) makes up an excellent tool

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.160
and you can even Mimic (R) that for true juke madness!

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.520
Even though she can't silence anymore, her root Ethereal Chains (E) is a good CC

00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:27.613
and that invisibility duration on her Passive Mirror Image is better and works out excellent in many situations given.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.640
Ohhoh, hello! We got another Assassin, Mr. Zed nice to meet you. 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.260
As we know Zed can burst down squishies from 100 to 0 in a matter of seconds,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.537
he's escaping on the other hand reminds me of LeBlanc because of the ability to teleport back and forth. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.620
The difference however is that Zed's teleporting is much more complicated to controll 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.320
but it's also more confusing and therefore satisfying when executed a great escape 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.155
with a flipping ninja like this.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.160
The Demon Jester Shaco is truly a one nasty trickster and is also frustrating to chase in.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.020
All of his 4 Abilities helps you to escape in a different ways, but the fun thing is that

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.884
you have to be smart when to use what or it can end really sadly.

00:04:22.884 --> 00:04:26.888
The best plays however comes from the Hallucinate (R) because you are able to trick

00:04:26.888 --> 00:04:31.096
the enemy so badly that they will focus down the clone and let's you escape but

00:04:31.096 --> 00:04:36.513
combining that with the other Abilities comes up with little practise but rewarding when tricking successfully.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.260
Fizz is very known for his dexterity and let's you escape in different situations pretty well.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.531
First of all he is able to walk through units in lane which prevents blocking.

00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.871
Secondly Fizz's Ability Playful / Trickster (E) is one of the best escape Abilities in

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:10.914
the whole game as you can nullify pretty much any kind of damage output.

00:05:12.171 --> 00:05:19.171
Also Fizz can travel back and forth with Urchin Strike (Q) and his Ultimate Chum The Waters (R) helps out with its nice Crowd Controll as well.

00:05:23.793 --> 00:05:28.913
Nidalee has been a great escaper always even though she lacks CC completely!

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.860
That aside her Passive makes Nidalee go faster in brushes and that Cougar Form (R) nails it as you gain

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.540
passively even more Movement Speed and that insane escape potential when spamming Pounce (W) 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.540
is just sick.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:45.860
I also think Nidalee is great because some 
escaping Champions only have that short momentum 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.300
when to escape and spam the cooldowns but Nidalee can escape longer distances

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.781
better with its sneaky abilities combined.

00:06:03.256 --> 00:06:09.016
Lee Sin is in my opinion the best escape Champion and he doesn't even need eyes for that.

00:06:09.016 --> 00:06:14.553
There are just too many ways how you can execute an escape with Lee Sin and he is just so badass

00:06:14.553 --> 00:06:19.434
that you're even able to escape with Sonic Wave / Resonating Strike (Q) if used correctly.

00:06:19.434 --> 00:06:23.754
Lee Sin can also slow enemies with Cripple (E) and kick away with Dragon's Rage (R)

00:06:23.754 --> 00:06:28.559
which are both good escape tools and Safeguard (W) is what bakes the cake when you can dash

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:33.373
to ally Minions or Champions and even wards which all combined and mastered makes up the 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.420
best escape tools in a total.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.000
Allright so that covers up the 10 best escaping 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.925
