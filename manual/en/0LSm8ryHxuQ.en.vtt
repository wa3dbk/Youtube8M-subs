00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:36.700
My name is Bree Aldridge. I'm an assistant
professor at Tuffs University. We study the

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.960
bacteria and the host cells involved in tuberculosis
and my lab is focused on trying to see if

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.050
we can understand what's different about the
bacteria that survive longer with drug treatment

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.260
from the bacteria that are killed quickly
and we hope to use that information to design

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:03.299
shorter, more effective drug therapies. One
thing that my lab does is a lot of live cell

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:11.080
microscopy. So to do that we put cells, bacteria
in these little microfluidic devices, essentially

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.240
this is like a rubbery substance with holes
in it and a channel inside and we inject microbacteria,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.690
the causative agent of TB, into these devices
and it's on a piece of glass so we can set

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.280
it on the microscope stage and simply image
cells growing for a long periods of time.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.050
And then what we do with that is we get a
ton of information about how many related

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.440
cells are growing and we bring together mathematical
modelling, engineering approaches, and biological

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.030
approaches and so in order to do that well
we actually have to work with other labs and

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:52.070
other investigators both in the Boston area
and around the country. I was born and raised

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.810
in Tucson, Arizona. I definitely didn't love
science as a small child. I loved finding

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.240
patterns in the world and I loved to try and
be creative. It wasn't until I hit maybe middle

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.970
school and high school and I really started
to love math and some of the extracurricular

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.000
science activities like science Olympiad and
math competitions. I think it's important

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.150
for students to remember that learning the
basic knowledge base that you have for any

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.560
discipline doesn't really reflect what doing
the work is like and it's okay if you get

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.329
a C in an introductory class to remember that
doesn't mean that you're not good enough to

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.010
do science and research, it just means that
maybe you need to adapt your study techniques

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.959
and that's really all there is to it. When
I started my post-doc work, I started by watching

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.659
how these bacteria that caused tuberculosis
grow and it's something that not a lot of

00:02:55.659 --> 00:03:00.469
people had done before. And in the process,
we were able to discover something new and

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:05.909
it resulted in a paper being published in
Science, one of the top journals. It was really

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:11.069
a great time for me and helped launch my career
and the start of my own research group here

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:20.709
at Tuffs. Now it's really nice to be the principle
investigators, I can be sitting in my office,

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.749
writing a grant or doing something and someone
will come running to my office and grab me

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.760
from my seat to bring me to the microscope
and it's really fun to see them be so excited

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:36.590
about something that they've just discovered.
To be successful in science or at least to

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.919
run a lab is a lot like running a small business.
You wanna work in an area where if you stop

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:46.370
working, no one else is going to help solve
that really important problem. What you also

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.680
can do is assemble a team of really great
supporters. Those individuals can really help

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:00.799
you also find your voice and help be an advocate
for you to navigate this world and get noticed.

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.809
I think having a career in science and motherhood
are actually a really great pair, because

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:11.739
in science you usually have the flexibility
to allow you to go home when you need to be

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.620
home. I had my baby during my post-doc and
I was really worried about whether I would

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.169
be productive or not and I think it really
helped when my post-doc mentor suggested that

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:29.060
I just, she didn't say lower my expectations,
but be kinder to myself and understand that

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.960
my world had kind of changed and that things
would settle after a couple months and she

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.370
was absolutely right. I think a lot of the
creative thinking that happens in science

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.010
happens outside of the lab when you're doing
other things like outside hiking , shopping,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.130
knitting, cooking, whatever you do outside
of work can actually be a really productive

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.990
time for your career as well. In the end I
think I'm really happy being a working Mom.}
