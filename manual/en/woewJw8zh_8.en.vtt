00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.849
Hey youtubers it’s charlie since it’s
been a couple weeks since i’ve done a Legend

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.210
of Korra Book 3 update I thought it was time
to do a nice long video to get you guys excited

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.640
for 2014.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.750
So here are 10 big things we need to talk
about.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.750
Number 1 - Book 3 Footage?

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.480
When will we be able to see a trailer and
artwork?

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.329
In February every year Nickelodeon does it’s
upfronts.

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.599
That’s where they show clips from all their
programs to advertisers so that they’ll

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.730
give them money.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.059
From a practical standpoint this is Nickelodeon’s
most important event all year.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.489
This will be the first real time anyone sees
any footage from Book 3.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.000
Unfortunately because we’re not advertisers
we won’t be able to go.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.989
The first time regular people will be able
to see any new clips will be at their Press

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.129
event in May.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.809
That’s where big news outlets and bloggers
get invited to see footage and learn about

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.199
the new season directly from the creators.

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.400
I might have a chance to get into that event.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.280
After that it’s really conventions like
Comic Con where footage is screened in public.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.040
But next year will be a little bit different
because…

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.510
Number 2 - Book 3 will premiere much earlier
than it did this year.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.510
Why?

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.630
Because they started working on it as well
as book 4 right after they wrapped production

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.630
on Book 2.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.630
Meaning, by the time we were seeing Book 2
episodes, they were already animating book

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.630
3.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.819
That process takes a long long time, and at
New York Comic Con this year in October they

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.829
said they were about halfway done animating
book 3.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.280
The sooner they finish, the sooner it can
air.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.670
They can even start airing episodes before
the last few episodes are finished being animated.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.719
Because the majority of Korra’s audience
are younger, most shows like that premiere

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.920
during late spring early summer just because
that’s when those people are more likely

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.319
to be watching a lot of tv.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:46.109
Conservative estimate, you’ll see Book 3
episode 1 in June, possibly as soon as April.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:47.109
Pretty awesome right?

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.720
Number 3 - If they finish airing the season
before Comic Con this summer what will they

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.279
do at their panel?

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:56.670
Easy, book 4.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.329
They won’t even be close to finishing animation
on Book 4 by next summer, but they will have

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.649
had enough time to cut a trailer.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.249
So even though their Comic Con panel next
year will cover a lot of the aftermath of

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.740
what happens during Book 3, they will be teasing
a lot of book 4 details.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.470
Remember this last year they aired the entire
first episode during their panel.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.720
I don’t expect them to air a full book 4
episode, but I’ll be there just in case.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.470
Number 4 - What are the biggest changes to
book 3 right now?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.100
Mostly the addition of the spirits in the
physical realm and the locations.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.280
The new locations and the changes to old locations
will largely inform the new and old characters

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280
we’ll see again as well as the story.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.200
Republic City will still be a part of book
3, but because Korra will be traveling to

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.140
the earth kingdom for most of book 3 it won’t
be featured as much.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.360
The big change is all of the spirit wilds
that will grow from those vines that the dark

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.920
avatar gew when he invaded during the finale.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.550
Those big vines will be like homes for spirits.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.600
I wonder how much rent they charge.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.990
Number 5 - What are those new locations?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.320
I already did a video about how it’s going
to be all about the Earth Kingdom, but the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.660
actual cities we’ll see are Ba Sing Se and
Omashu.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.090
I’m also holding out hope for Kyoshi Island.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.900
The issue with Korra is that there are only
13 episodes, which leaves half the time to

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.200
travel to all our favorite old places from
Last Airbender.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.930
So we’ll only see the places that are most
important to the story.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:14.930
Namely Ba Sing Se.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.970
Meaning that Omashu is a long-shot too.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.970
As is kyoshi island.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.710
Konietzko and DiMartino confirmed there is
an earth queen.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.220
Note the gender, queen.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.640
So the story will largely revolve around her
city.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.640
Number 6 - Who is the earth queen?

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.070
Nothing is confirmed, but the best theory
is that it’s Alyson Stoner who’s playing

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.870
a character named Opal.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.650
She originally confirmed she was voicing a
character before book 2 premiered, but it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.090
looks like her character was intended to be
a major part of book 3.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.932
Since Opal is a type of precious gem, it’s
pretty likely that this is the case, since

00:03:44.932 --> 00:03:49.260
character names on Last Airbender tended to
flow from their character traits.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.210
Like Azula and her blue fire.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.920
The other possibility is that Opal could also
be a kyoshi warrior, but I still think it’s

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.520
more likely that she’s the earth queen.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.020
Even though the story will be totally new,
just like previous books of korra you can

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.320
always expect certiain Last Airbender themes
to come back.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.690
Kooei was being manipulated by Long Feng,
and just like Kooei, Opal is being voiced

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.440
by an actress with a really young sounding
voice.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.950
So it’s possible that Korra will have to
get rid of a new Long Feng type character.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.460
Number 7 - What about the Beifongs?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.560
One of the major subplots will revolve completely
around Lin and her family.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.180
The only glimpse we’ve gotten of Toph during
Legend of Korra has been in flashback.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.500
She’s dead in present day, but there’s
the largely unexplored issue of Lin’s father.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.550
The best three theories I’ve seen is the
duke, a new character we’ve never met or

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.000
she’s adopted and we’ll never know who
her father is.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.650
The creators have already said that we’ll
learn about Lin’s parents so I don’t think

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.650
she’s adopted.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.740
But I like the idea that her father will end
up being someone we’ve never met before,

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.740
but who is connected to the larger story of
book 3 and what’s going on in ba sing se

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.740
in present day.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.990
Number 8 - Why have they waited so long to
explain Beifong’s Family?

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.155
Remember how closed off Toph was before she
joined team avatar.

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:52.155
She eventually warmed up, but being blind
had really isolated her from her peers so

00:04:52.155 --> 00:04:53.155
a lot of that got passed on to Lin.

00:04:53.155 --> 00:04:54.155
And remember Toph was one of the founders
of Republic City with Aang.

00:04:54.155 --> 00:04:58.140
And what did all of Aang’s children say
about Aang as a father during Book 2.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.520
He was not a super attentive dad.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.850
Which was probably the case for Lin and Toph.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.570
Meaning she has some issues she’s still
working through.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.750
And I suspect that since the Beifong’s are
a very famous family, the rest of her relatives

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.660
also have some big issues we’ll learn about.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.400
Number 9 - Who is the villain?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.910
We don’t have any confirmation on who the
big bad will be, we didn’t even know about

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.880
vaatu and the dark avatar until book 2 aired.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.870
But what if the medium bad, the varrick of
book 3 turned out to be Lin’s father.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.960
What’s the biggest reason to never talk
about your parents.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.960
If they’re evil.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:30.960
And what would you do, you would probably
become an officer of the law and dedicate

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.960
your life to getting rid of crime.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
It’s more likely that Lin’s father or
her family is involved in some shady business.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
I don’t think they’ll be connected to
whoever the real villain is.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
Even Varrick didn’t really have any direct
relationship with Oonalack.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:35.960
The other big possibility is that it’s the
character Grey Delyle is playing.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.650
She announced she was playing a dark character,
but since we didn’t see her during book

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.430
2 it’s likely that we’ll see her during
book 3.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.430
It’s important to note that she’s not
playing Azula.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.150
It will be a new character we’ve never met
before.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:04.480
So keep sending me you Korra questions, I’ll
probably do a Korra Q&amp;A after 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.480
the holidays.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.830
I’ve got a lot of Sherlock and Doctor Who
to get through before then.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.120
I’m also trying to post a couple new videos
tonight explaining all the special stuff I’ll

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.120
be doing next week.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.120
