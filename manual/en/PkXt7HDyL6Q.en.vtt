Hi, everybody!
My name is Sergey Polyansky,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
today I’ll tell you about this
Ibanez GRGR121EX guitar.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The body of this guitar
is made of bass-wood,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the neck is made of maple,
it’s attached with 4 bolts.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The fretboard is made of rosewood,
24 frets.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This guitar has two stock humbuckers,
3-way pickup switch,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
volume and tone controls.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let’s listen to each pickup
with a clean sound.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, let's play it
with overdrive.
