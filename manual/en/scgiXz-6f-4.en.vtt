00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
An FX made by BEHRINGER, DM100 DISTORTION MODELER

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:09.606
Attracted to its suggestive "MODE" name,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.590
I bought without thinking.

00:00:13.547 --> 00:00:18.547
Now, that ability will be like?

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:35.266
Add sound effects to this, but...

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.770
"DIST" knob increase in full, and listen carefully...

00:00:43.884 --> 00:00:48.884
Sound effect is a slight leak.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.949
First, "MODE D+"

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:12.477
It sounds not bad, but, DIST knob slightly lower...

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:19.415
Significantly reduced the effect.

00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:23.644
When used, DIST konb is full blast!!!

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:29.985
Next, "MODE RAT"

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.150
Have been more mid-low-frequency output of than MODE D+

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.440
In this case, DIST knob slightly lower...

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:58.890
Significantly reduced the effect, too.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.050
Say again, when used, DIST knob is full blast!!!!!

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:08.720
The last, "MODE DS1". Immediately switched, terrible noise!

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:26.440
Oh, too much effects for me!

00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:45.030
Only in this case, a decrease in DIST knob, somthing it could use.

00:02:49.803 --> 00:02:54.800
I think, Practical use, turn up DIST knob full.

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:04.600
I move TONE knob suitably. Plese keep watching for some time.

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:29.940
[ In "MODE D+", TONE knob is NOT effective. 
 I'm sorry for my wrong operation ]

00:04:22.296 --> 00:04:30.300
How was it? When I use this pedal, DIST knob is full 
 up. I think "MODE RAT" suited to Solo play.
