00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.100
Millions of people all over the world 
connect to our vSpace Server software

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.000
to access virtual desktops and run 
their key applications every day.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.000
Until now, the many benefits of centrally 
managing and deploying virtual desktops

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.100
using our unique vSpace end-to-end approach

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.000
has been limited to users connecting with one 
of our best-in-class thin client devices.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.000
Thin clients are a great way to reduce
the costs and complexity 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.090
associated with managing and supporting 
desktops, but they’re not a solution

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.000
for every computing situation. 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.270
With the introduction of vSpace Client 
for Windows, we can now extend the value

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.000
of our simple, powerful and affordable 
vSpace virtual desktop solution 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.000
to Windows-based devices, including laptops, 
netbooks and PCs

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.200
even the older ones running XP that you 
thought you would have to replace soon 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.000
or have already left for dead.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.000
So, what this means is you can now use 
vSpace virtual desktops running on Windows 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.000
devices as a solution for your top IT priorities.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.000
Users can connect and run vSpace virtual 
desktop sessions from anywhere that offers 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.000
WiFi or better bandwidth as a great way 
to add mobility for your users. 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.000
They can connect from home or anywhere 
else when they need access

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.000
Just install vSpace Client for Windows 
on devices that your users may already own 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.000
and love using and you have an instant
Bring Your Own Device solution

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.000
Dust off those old PCs running XP and 
save the ones you thought you would have 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.000
to replace or upgrade to run Windows 7 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.000
again, just install vSpace Client for 
Windows and connect to vSpace Server.  

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.000
Congratulations, by using what you already 
have and what you already know how to manage, 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.000
you just saved your company a ton of money 
that you would have had to spend on new devices 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.800
and you just avoided a major hassle for 
yourself to get it all in place too 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The best part is none of this is
difficult or time-consuming.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.500
All you need is a working vSpace Server
with enough licensed connections

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.000
to support the additional Windows
device users you want to add

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.000
and the vSpace Client for Windows 
software which we make available 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.000
as a quick and easy free download.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.000
If you’re already using vSpace Server,
it only takes a minute or less to install

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.800
the vSpace Client for Windows software onto 
a Windows device so you can start using it 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.000
to connect and instantly start enjoying 
the benefits of a modern, high performance 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.000
virtual desktop experience.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.000
If you’re not using vSpace Server yet, 
it’s super easy to get started 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.000
and takes only a small fraction of the time
