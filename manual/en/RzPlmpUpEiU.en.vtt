On this episode of China Uncensored, It came from the deep!

00:00:08.003 --> 00:00:10.478
Hi, welcome to China Uncensored, I'm your host Chris Chappell. 

00:00:10.912 --> 00:00:13.253
This is how you write China in Chinese.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.404
 It's usually translated as Middle Kingdom.

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.411
I don't think that's a good translation. 

00:00:19.844 --> 00:00:21.739
Zhong, doesn't just mean middle.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:23.359
 It also means central.

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:26.140
And I think this is a much better translation.

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:29.409
China is the central kingdom, or country.

00:00:29.965 --> 00:00:36.956
Throughout human history, China has shaped the world, its influence emanating outward, the central hub of humanity.

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:38.926
Everything was invented in China. 

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:44.737
We all know about the Four Great Inventions--Gunpowder, printing, the compass, and papermaking.

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:49.968
But also things like silk, tea, lacquer, wooden coffins, and paper money.

00:00:50.636 --> 00:01:00.304
The Chinese were even the first to make alcohol--which I guess makes China, in a way, indirectly responsible for that Red Solo Cup song.

00:01:06.317 --> 00:01:14.814
I don't know how or why China was so ahead of the game, but this influence is so powerful, it carries on today, even in the most mundane things.

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:17.733
For example, everyone loves beaches.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:20.982
 But everyone also loves Mexican wrestlers.

00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:24.589
What if you combine those two things in one?

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:28.887
Well China has once again proven to be the mother of invention.

00:01:29.205 --> 00:01:30.972
Meet the face-kini.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:36.775
Only unlike a bikini, the idea is to show as little skin as possible.

00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:40.263
So why would you want to look like a bank robber at the beach?

00:01:40.688 --> 00:01:50.034
Well, unlike here, where everyone wants to get that gorgeous summer tan, in China, super pale skin is the unrealistic beauty standard to aspire to.

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:55.253
And if there’s one thing that ruins a perfectly good beach trip, it’s all that sun.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:03.967
So women have been donning the face-kini so they can have their proverbial cake and eat it too.

00:02:04.518 --> 00:02:06.985
Could this be the latest swimwear fashion? 

00:02:07.413 --> 00:02:08.955
Actually, yes.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.931
The editor for Vogue Paris ran a spread of face-kini models in her biannual CR Fashion Book.

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:26.259
This is insane! How is that a book? It’s totally a magazine! And speaking of unrealistic beauty standards. I mean who could look like that?

00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:32.310
Wow. Wonder what the Chinese version of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition looks like.

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:37.298
