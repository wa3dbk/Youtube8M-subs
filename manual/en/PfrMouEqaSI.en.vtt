hey what's up everybody this is don and
today we're checking out milk music this

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.269
is the brand new free music streaming
service from Samsung,

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:12.570
but real quick before we get into this I
wanna know what your favorite streaming

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.179
services

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.570
and why why do you choose one over the
other let me know down in the comment

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.070
section

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.650
a course melt music is only available
for Galaxy smartphone so that is the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.619
only downside but let's jump in and take
a look at it and as you can see this is

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.029
Mel

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.189
music it pretty simple and i mean it's
pretty clean interface nothing bad to

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.239
say about it so far I didn't have to
sign up for a new account or login via

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.399
Facebook or anything like that to use it
and along this

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.550
outer edge in the circle you can quickly
tune between stations

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.270
at the hop to the inner part in a circle
you can slowly to meet with the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.770
station's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.910
and there are just times up stations on
this obviously that's no different from

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.550
any other streaming app but

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.260
I do like how it's laid out and it's
very simple to navigate

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.180
now if you tap on it this top are up
here that has the category listed you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.719
can browse through genres

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.859
and kind of subgenres our sub categories

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.920
different stations available in milk
music and their art

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.220
times to choose from you can also
customize this list and I'll show you

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.100
that here

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.920
in a little bit but as you can see we
just have tons of stations to choose

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.780
from I think the best part about this is
that samsung claims there will be zero

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.520
advertisements played throughout the
listening experience which is awesome

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.920
because advertisements

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.590
on streaming app tend to get annoying in
your also allowed six

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.680
skips per station per hour so if that
counter kind of clicks down 20

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.180
and you wanna skip tracks while you can
just change the station to some

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.439
different and continue listening

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.150
no tenure at the bottom we do have a
menu button and if you press that you

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.009
can see here that we have the ability to
you

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.990
favored a song play a new song added
stations find out station info as you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.180
can see here to give you a brief
description

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.259
up the specific station you're listening
to you and we also have the ability to

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.680
create a station from that specific song
so let's go ahead and do that here

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.920
real quick what favorite this song and
then we will create

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.119
a station from it and that will actually
appear

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.140
in the my station section over here

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.680
on the side many bar Sophie pull that
out you can go to manage my stations

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.340
and you can view their specific station
you can remove it or find out station in

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.849
for so there are quite a few options in
here it's really nothing different than

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.410
any other streaming app but

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.200
I think the main benefit years that you
have 0 advertisements no long this idea

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.739
we do have some settings we can set the
audio quality we can allow the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.810
application to use my location and we
can say

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.920
explicit content on our of we can also
sign in to our Samsung Account here

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.580
which I believe will sync your stations
and preferences across

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.700
various Galaxy devices so if you have
more than one then

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.129
you can keep all your settings in one
place now over you we also have the

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.959
ability to customize the dial

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.830
and this will allow you to omit
categories from that big list or from

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.030
that little spinning dow right there so
if you don't wanna have certain

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.560
john is a music showing up in there you
can just unchecked those boxes or check

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.569
'em if you want more

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.950
and mineral immediately change that dial
as you can see there so

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.680
we only have if you john is a music to
be able to choose from now

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.060
as opposed to like the tenor 20 or so
that we had there before

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.690
of course you do have the ability to
create a custom station based on an

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.780
artist or a song names he can type in
the name there

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.980
and create a station just as you would
expect so it's going back at that

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.920
and finally at the bottom here we do
have history which will allow you to see

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.549
the history of different songs that
you've listened to so overall this app

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.069
is pretty straightforward

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.250
and it has a nice clean interface I am a
big fan of it's very easy to use I

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.930
really have nothing bad to say about
this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.540
except for the fact that I wish was
available on more than just

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.349
Galaxy smartphones maybe to bring it to
galaxy tablet in the future

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.409
but I don't think Samsung will be
bringing it to other Android devices

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.930
another thing I want to point out is I
did find a small advertisement but it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.730
was for milk music itself as you can see
right here so I'm not really sure if

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.040
that counts are not gonna let me know
what you think

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.269
down in the comment section and leave
your opinions have milk music down there

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.010
as well

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.879
weird names aside I think this is a
solid streaming app

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.019
its clean I really can't say anything
bad about it except for the fact that it

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.130
only works on Galaxy devices

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.919
so leave your opinions and leave me a
thumbs up if you enjoyed this video
