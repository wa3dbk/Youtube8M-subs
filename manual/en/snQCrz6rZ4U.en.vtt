00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.000
Friday, March the 29th, 2013. 
This Week on GOG: In case you missed it, here’s what’s new.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.200
With a title like "Krush Kill 'N' Destroy 2: Krossfire" 
you instantly know what to expect from a game.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.300
You will crush, kill and destroy your enemies, with no
consideration for crossfire around you, or even correct spelling.
Muster all your strategic skills! 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.500
In this explosive real time strategy game set in a nuclear wasteland,
you're up against an AI opponent that really knows what he's doing,
testing your defenses, flanking you, and setting up ambushes. 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.400
With well-balanced gameplay and units that evolve as they gain
experience, this game delivers challenge and excitement in
single and multi-player modes alike!

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.800
Strike Commander is full of real-world jet fighters, but in many
ways it resembles the legendary Wing Commander series.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.600
Even the dialog-heavy mission briefings are there, along with
cutscenes detailing everyday life in a mercenary base.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.200
The main focus here, of course, is the action-oriented air combat
simulation that will test your reflexes and skills as you blaze
across the skies of an extensive theater of war.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:06.500
With graphics that were jaw-droppingly photorealistic for the time
and a compelling storyline of global unrest that ties together
the action-packed dogfight missions, this is one game that
will take your breath away!

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.600
Pathologic is an odd--and oddly underrated--mixture of role playing,
adventure, and FPS, with just the right amount of creepiness and
a pinch of the surreal added for perfect flavor. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.100
In this tale of mystery, horror, and madness you need to save
a secluded Russian town from imminent doom.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:31.500
The streets and houses are full of eerie apparitions, the townsfolk
suffer from a mysterious plague, and the landscape has been
corrupted and twisted by strange monolithic constructs towering
over the world of men.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In such place only a thin veil of reality separates you from
falling into the eternal vortex of insanity. 
You only have 12 days to save the town--and yourself.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Will you dare?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.600
Next week's classic release will impress you with wondrous
opportunities to demonstrate your adventuring and strategic 
skills in the barren north. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:59.500
