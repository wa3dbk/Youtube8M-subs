When I met Michael,
I was 14 years old.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.780
And I knew that he was
going to be my boyfriend.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.780
[Chuckles]

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.880
We got married when I was 19.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.760
And we were both kids.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.720
We really didn't know what next.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.700
You know, get married,
and now what?

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.160
When we were divorced,
I remember the kids telling me

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.040
that their father confided
in them with a secret.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.560
And they said,
"well, Daddy still loves you."

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.100
"He doesn't want us
to tell you."

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
And I said, "Well, I know,
and I love him, too,

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.300
but Mommy and Daddy
have gone their separate ways,

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.260
but we'll always be a family,

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.260
and we'll always be
your mom and dad."

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.120
On 9/11, I remember getting up
to take my daughter --

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.320
she had a doctor's appointment,
so my daughter was home.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.320
At 9:04, I got a phone call,
and it was Michael.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.720
And he was calling
from the 103rd floor.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.000
And the first thing
that he said was,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.780
"I'm calling to say goodbye."

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.620
And I said, "Why?
Where are you going?"

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.820
And he said,
"Well, I'm in the building

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
that was just hit by a plane."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.260
He just wanted to tell me
how much he loved the children,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and he says, you know,
"I also want to tell you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.980
that I always loved you."

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.980
And I said, "I know.
The kids told me."

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
And, uh...

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.840
my daughter was there,
and she saw me

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.280
becoming a little hysterical,
and I didn't know

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.820
whether to put her on, 'cause I
didn't know how he would react.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.880
He thought she was at school.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.240
[Crying]

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.800
It just really breaks my heart
that he's not here for them.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.080
It's like the only thing
on his mind

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.080
was to tell the kids
that he loved them.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.960
And the thing is,
is that

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.960
my two children
look just like him.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.360
And they talk like him,
and they joke like him.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.180
So it's like he's there.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180
You know, I see him in them
every day.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.700
And as much as he
used to drive me crazy,

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.860
he was my family.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.860
And my best friend.
