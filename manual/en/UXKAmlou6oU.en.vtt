00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.273
&gt;&gt; Hi and welcome to the Product Design Show.

00:00:02.473 --> 00:00:04.779
I'm Allison Toepperwein.
&gt;&gt; And I'm Vince Penman.

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:13.105
This is the surfing episode, yeah,
where we explore how engineers create indoor waves.

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:24.255
&gt;&gt; Bruce McFarland, engineer inventor
at American Wave Machines,

00:00:24.455 --> 00:00:28.810
talks to us about how they developed
an innovative technology called SurfStream.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.458
This waterpark environment provides surfers
with an incredible indoor ride.

00:00:33.658 --> 00:00:39.105
Bruce got his inspiration for this technology
from the idea of surfing a standing wave on a river

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.513
and the dream of an endless ride.

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:44.189
We're going to look under the hood
of this impressive system

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:47.497
and explore its design from a fluid dynamics perspective.

00:00:47.697 --> 00:00:51.794
To do that, we'll need to reach all the way back
to our university fluids class

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:56.274
and revisit the natural phenomenon known as a hydraulic
jump, the major principle

00:00:56.474 --> 00:00:59.229
in which the surfing wave machine is designed.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.962
&gt;&gt; Hydraulic jump is a phenomenon that naturally occurs
in open channel water flow.

00:01:04.162 --> 00:01:10.450
When a moving flow of water releases into an area
of lower velocity flow, it slows down very quickly.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.227
The kinetic energy of the flow
is converted to potential energy

00:01:14.427 --> 00:01:17.783
in the form of a wave known as a hydraulic jump.

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:22.150
An example of an everyday hydraulic jump
is the stationary circular wave

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.112
that forms around a stream of water as it flows
out of the tap and contacts a flat surface.

00:01:28.312 --> 00:01:33.995
The jump is characterised by fast moving water
before the jump, where there is also low water height

00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:40.076
and a smooth flow, and a slower flow after the jump,
where there is also higher water depth

00:01:40.276 --> 00:01:42.013
and a more turbulent flow.

00:01:42.213 --> 00:01:46.659
&gt;&gt; To make a standing surf wave,
engineers use stationary submerged objects

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.803
to direct the moving water upwards.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:52.376
The shape of the object is altered
to create different types of flows.

00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:57.225
The determination of this shape involves complex
calculations which we've love to do

00:01:57.425 --> 00:02:00.203
but Vince forgot his calculator.

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:03.943
&gt;&gt; The SurfStream system starts with a series of pumps
in one end of a pool

00:02:04.143 --> 00:02:07.056
that push out a smooth, flat, fast flow of water.

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:11.197
This water is forced over a contoured bottom
that includes a spoiler

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:14.741
that is shaped much like a spoiler on the rear of a car.

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:19.685
The water then encounters
a smooth bump Bruce calls a foil.

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:26.203
When the water is forced over these contours,
the hydraulic jump is formed between a spoiler and the foil.

00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:31.552
&gt;&gt; What really sets the man made waves apart is that
they are standing waves, unlike the waves in the ocean.

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:36.132
When surfing on the hydraulic jump, a rider has
to manage the dynamic relationships

00:02:36.332 --> 00:02:41.185
between water streaming over the jump,
the nonholonomic constraints of the board surfaces

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:43.948
acting on the water, and the gravity vector.

00:02:44.148 --> 00:02:46.425
Now you know why we just say surfing.

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:52.078
The result is an infinite ride in a finite space that feels
like surfing a wave in the ocean.

00:02:52.278 --> 00:02:56.680
&gt;&gt; The standing wave can be adjusted to different shapes,
including left and right barreling waves,

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.991
stable beginner waves and natural standing waves which
are deeper and more challenging.

00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:07.788
This is accomplished by changing parameters such
as incoming flow rate, the incoming channel width and

00:03:07.988 --> 00:03:11.431
the contour of the bottom including the spoiler and the foil.

00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:16.145
The team at American Wave Machines selected Creo's
direct modeling to manipulate these parameters

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:21.625
because it allows them advanced surfacing features
and rapid design changes.

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:25.771
For example, if you want to change a barreling wave
from right to left,

00:03:25.971 --> 00:03:29.550
a mirror image of an angled spoiler replaces the original.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.291
The angled barrier allows the water
to be pushed sideways as well as forwards,

00:03:34.491 --> 00:03:41.680
creating a wave in which the water is pushed to one side in
a curl, much like a wave found naturally in the ocean.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.099
&gt;&gt; So now you must be wondering, where does
the water come from?

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.908
The answer? The water is circulated continuously.

00:03:51.108 --> 00:03:55.925
On a curling wave, for example, the water is pushed
to one side of the pool called the Venturi area.

00:03:56.125 --> 00:04:00.400
The water has to escape so as not to accumulate
and destroy the wave effect.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.848
This water is forced along this Venturi channel
and exits through a series of drains

00:04:05.048 --> 00:04:08.252
which feed back to the pumps, thus completing the cycle.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.599
&gt;&gt; You can try a free for lifetime version
of Creo's direct modeling yourself,

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:16.619
the same software the team at American Wave Machine
used to design the SurfStream environments.
