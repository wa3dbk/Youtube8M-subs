00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:18.889
Most older adults are safe drivers. But sometimes
health problems make driving risky or even unsafe.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.039
A professional evaluation with a Driving
Rehabilitation Specialist, or DRS,

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:36.839
can help a person decide whether or not driving is
still a safe option. The goal of the Driving

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:43.839
Rehabilitation Specialist is to keep drivers
safely behind the wheel whenever possible.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.039
When you first meet with a DRS, she will conduct
driving assessments to observe your reaction speeds,

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.039
judgment, planning, and maneuvering 
of a vehicle. Once the testing

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.320
is finished, the DRS can make a plan that
may include adaptive devices for your vehicle. 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.810
The DRS will choose equipment that is compatible with your
vehicle and, over the course of several sessions,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.810
train you how to use it. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500
A Driving Rehabilitation Specialist will 
also help you develop strategies to help 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
you cope with vision or cognitive impairments.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.320
A qualified mobility equipment dealer should
install any equipment the DRS recommends.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.350
Some states require that your driver's license
note any adaptive devices on your vehicle.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.350
Not every health problem can be overcome with

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.600
vehicle adaptions. Eventually, you may reach a 
point where it is no longer safe to drive.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.750
A DRS can help you make that decision, and plan 
ahead for a time when driving may not be possible. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.750
If you or your family member is ready to
consider an evaluation,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.750
Find a DRS in your area and learn more 
about available services.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.950
Take the steps to stay mobile,
but stay safe - 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.000
for yourself and for others on the road!
