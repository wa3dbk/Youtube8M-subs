and training efforts by visiting my websites

skiplacour.com, manformation.com, massmachinenutrition.com.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.480
And today I'm going to talk to you about bodybuilding.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.779
I want to give you an introduction to body
building.

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.500
When you become a body builder, you want to
set ambitious goals.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.060
You want to think big, get a good vision of
what you want to accomplish.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.180
You want to educate yourself of the process,
you want to read the body building magazines,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.510
you want to visit internet websites like skiplacour.com
and bodybuilding.com.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.600
Never stop learning.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.890
You also want to surround yourself with mentors,
people who can help you achieve your body

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.800
building and training goals.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.030
You want to structure your lifestyle; your
training, your eating habits, your rest, your

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.780
recovery, your lifestyle organization in a
manner that will support your body building

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.000
and weight lifting efforts.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.070
You want to fall in love with body building
and the training process.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.549
The more you are passionate about something,
the more you enjoy something, the better you'll

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.749
become.

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:27.479
How you can do that is to set up your own
self imposed standards.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.689
It's those things that you're going to do
every single day when it comes to your training

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.670
habits or your eating habits, and then you
do them every single day you'll gain momentum,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.210
you'll gain confidence and you'll enjoy the
process more and more.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.490
And always remember, you can always become
bigger, you can have more muscle, you can

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.499
always lift more weight, you can always lose
more body fat.

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.170
It's all about being the very best you can
be, it's about setting those standards.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.259
living up to those standards and enjoying
the process.

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.969
And that's a brief introduction to bodybuilding
and weight lifting.
