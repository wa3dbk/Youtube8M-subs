00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:05.930
How to Play 21.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.690
Often used to settle scores, 21 is a continuous,
fast-paced version of basketball with few

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.510
rules and little room for error.

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.960
You will need Three players A basketball and
a hoop or half of a court.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.150
Step 1.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.720
Decide who starts with the ball.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.159
Flip a coin, shoot for it, whatever.

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:27.640
To make it easy, let’s assume you’re starting
with the ball.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.779
Step 2.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.430
Take the ball to where the three-point line
is and put it in play.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.860
You are now on offense, and the other two
players are on defense.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.860
Step 3.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.190
Play as though it is a two-on-one game, and
try to score.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.200
There are no out-of-bounds or fouls.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.320
Use common sense about fouls and out-of-bounds.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.910
For example, if the ball rolls out into a
street, then you can stop play.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.980
Step 4.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.340
If you miss a shot or turn the ball over,
whoever gets control of the ball becomes the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.879
offensive player, and the former offensive
player switches to defense.

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:00.980
Step 5.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.160
When you make a shot, it counts for as many
points as it would in a normal game – two

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.030
points typically, but three points from behind
the three-point line.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.030
Step 6.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.460
After you make a shot, play stops and you
get to shoot additional free throws for one

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.510
point each.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.770
Step 7.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.270
If you make a free throw, you get another
-- up to three.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.820
If you miss, the ball is live and the game
continues.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.880
Step 8.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.390
If you make all three free throws, you get
the ball back and start over from the three

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.390
point line.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.360
When someone else gets control of the ball,
he has to dribble past the three-point line

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.810
to establish possession before he can shoot.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.950
Step 9.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.270
The game goes to 21, but the winning player
must win by at least two points.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.670
If two people are tied at 20, then whichever
player gets a two-point lead first wins.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.910
Did you know There are many regional variations
of the 21 rules, often requiring players to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.290
score exactly 21 to win, and making anyone
who goes over go back to 11 points.
