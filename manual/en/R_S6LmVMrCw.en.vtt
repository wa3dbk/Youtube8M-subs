00:00:08.292 --> 00:00:10.750
Tamrac's Velocity Series Sling Packs

00:00:10.792 --> 00:00:13.333
have a unique design that allow you

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.208
to carry your gear like a backpack

00:00:15.208 --> 00:00:18.417
but they provide quick access like a shoulder bag.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.417
This is the Velocity 7x.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:24.125
When you're on the move, you wear it on your back like a backpack.

00:00:24.126 --> 00:00:28.708
The padded sling strap comfortably distributes the weight.

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:31.792
When you need to access your equipment

00:00:31.793 --> 00:00:34.000
you simply swing the back around to the front

00:00:34.083 --> 00:00:36.500
The zippered top opens away from your body

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:39.208
for quick access to your camera with the lens

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:41.208
attached and you're ready to shoot.

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:43.083
With both hands free, you can access all of your gear,

00:00:43.084 --> 00:00:46.917
so changing lenses or installing a flash is quick and easy.

00:00:47.417 --> 00:00:50.583
There's a pocket inside the top for flat items

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.500
like filters, lens caps, and lens papers.

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:55.917
It's made of smooth nylon to protect LCD screens.

00:00:55.918 --> 00:00:58.500
The front accessory pocket organizes items like a

00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.167
light meter, mobile phone, MP3 player,

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:03.042
and other accessories.

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:05.208
Tamrac's patented Memory Management System

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.833
is incorporated onto the front of these pockets.

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.167
When you're done shooting, zip the top closed

00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:12.792
and swing it around your back,

00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:14.417
and you're ready to go.

00:01:14.418 --> 00:01:17.500
The Velocity 7x, 8x, 9x, and 10x

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:20.333
also have a Tuck-A-Way waist belt that keeps

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:24.917
the packs securely on your back while hiking or biking.

00:01:24.958 --> 00:01:27.208
You can customize your Velocity sling pack with modules from

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.500
Tamrac's Modular Accessory System.

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:34.125
Items like water bottles and lens cases quickly attach

00:01:34.126 --> 00:01:38.500
to the sides using Velcro and snaps.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.208

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:42.998
