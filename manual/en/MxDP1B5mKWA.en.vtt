00:00:01.565 --> 00:00:02.542
Voiceover: In this video,

00:00:02.542 --> 00:00:05.205
I'm going to talk about the brainstem.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:07.786
Brainstem.

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:10.591
We briefly discussed the brainstem

00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:11.944
when we were talking about the structure

00:00:11.944 --> 00:00:13.615
of the nervous system as a whole.

00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:16.199
Recall that the brainstem
is right around here,

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.904
and if we look at our larger drawing

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:19.248
of the central nervous system,

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.127
this is the brainstem right here.

00:00:21.127 --> 00:00:22.472
The brainstem connects, basically,

00:00:22.472 --> 00:00:24.847
all the parts of the
nervous system together.

00:00:24.847 --> 00:00:27.976
The brainstem connects the cerebrum on top

00:00:27.976 --> 00:00:30.560
and it connects the spinal cord below,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.399
and it connects the cerebellum,

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.199
which is behind the brainstem.

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.479
The brainstem also connects
most of the cranial nerves.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.440
I'll just write that over here.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.639
Cranial nerves.

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:44.439
Here's a different image of the brain,

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.864
looking at it from below.

00:00:45.864 --> 00:00:47.401
Here's there cerebrum.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.703
Here's the cerebellum,

00:00:48.703 --> 00:00:50.263
and here's the brainstem.

00:00:50.263 --> 00:00:52.287
All these little stringy things coming out

00:00:52.287 --> 00:00:54.800
are the cranial nerves, and most of them

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.936
are coming out of the brainstem.

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:57.576
We'll come back to that in a minute.

00:00:57.576 --> 00:00:59.664
Basically, because the
brainstem is connecting

00:00:59.664 --> 00:01:02.359
all these others of the
nervous system together,

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.447
its anatomy is complex.

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:06.760
There's a lot going on in the brainstem,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.727
even though it's a fairly small structure.

00:01:08.727 --> 00:01:10.696
It's just this little guy right here,

00:01:10.696 --> 00:01:12.369
but it does a lot of things.

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.550
Let's take a look at some sections,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.928
to look inside the brainstem.

00:01:15.928 --> 00:01:18.223
Recall that this top part up here

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:19.559
is called the midbrain,

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.448
this middle part is called the pons,

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:23.752
and this lower part is called the medulla.

00:01:23.752 --> 00:01:25.687
Now let's take some sections.

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:26.807
Let's pretend we're cutting

00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:28.937
through the midbrain right here.

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:30.600
We're going to look at it from the top.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.512
Over here this would be a
section of the midbrain.

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:36.560
Midbrain.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.288
When we're looking down
on it from the top,

00:01:38.288 --> 00:01:41.447
it's got these big parts that
stick out the front of it,

00:01:41.447 --> 00:01:43.200
and some little bumps on the back.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.105
Don't worry about the names

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:45.656
of any of those right now.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:48.256
Then, if we take a
section through the pons,

00:01:48.256 --> 00:01:50.431
so if we cut through the pons like this,

00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:52.351
and we look down at the pons from the top,

00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.884
this would be a view of
a section of the pons.

00:01:54.884 --> 00:01:56.196
Let me just write that.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:57.315
Pons.

00:01:57.315 --> 00:01:59.946
It's got this really big part
that sticks out the front.

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.818
Then let's take a section
here through the medulla.

00:02:02.818 --> 00:02:05.419
Let's cut through the medulla
and look at it from the top.

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:07.441
That would be this guy right here.

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:09.890
This is the medulla.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.091
"Meduh-la" or "Medoo-la."

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:12.634
I hear people say it both ways.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:14.627
The medulla has different shape.

00:02:14.627 --> 00:02:16.993
Each one of these three main divisions

00:02:16.993 --> 00:02:19.610
of the brainstem has a little
bit of a different shape.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.114
The inside of the brainstem
has some similarities

00:02:22.114 --> 00:02:24.250
to the spinal cord, particularly down low

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.890
in the medulla, where it's connecting

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.882
to the spinal cord right here,

00:02:27.882 --> 00:02:29.962
and similarly to the spinal cord,

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:32.530
most of the grey matter of the brainstem

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.330
is on the inside and
most of the white matter

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.794
of the brainstem is on the outside.

00:02:37.794 --> 00:02:39.258
It's a lot more mixed together

00:02:39.258 --> 00:02:41.084
than it is on the spinal cord.

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:43.690
There's white and grey
matter more scattered about,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.578
although most of the grey
matter's on the inside

00:02:45.578 --> 00:02:47.875
and most of the white
matter's on the outside.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.612
Much of the brainstem grey matter

00:02:49.612 --> 00:02:52.235
are just these distributed neurons

00:02:52.235 --> 00:02:55.514
that aren't in nice discrete little places

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:58.313
or bundles, and we call this

00:02:58.313 --> 00:03:01.729
the reticular formation of the brainstem.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:05.144
Just all these neuron
somas scattered about

00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:08.256
to a lot of the grey matter
inside the brainstem.

00:03:08.256 --> 00:03:10.081
Let me just write that over here.

00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:12.834
The reticular formation.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:16.621
The reticular formation of the brainstem.

00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:19.302
This turns out to be a
really important structure.

00:03:19.302 --> 00:03:21.101
The reticular formation of the brainstem

00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:24.861
plays a big role in lots
of autonomic functions.

00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:27.005
Autonomic.

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:29.556
Plays a big role in controlling things

00:03:29.556 --> 00:03:32.653
like circulation,
respiration and digestion.

00:03:32.653 --> 00:03:35.708
Some of our critical
organ system functions.

00:03:35.708 --> 00:03:37.461
In addition to that, participating in

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:40.014
a lot of these lower functions
of the nervous system,

00:03:40.014 --> 00:03:42.757
the reticular formation
sends lots of axons

00:03:42.757 --> 00:03:45.381
projecting up to the cerebrum up here,

00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:48.031
and plays a major role in
lots of the higher functions

00:03:48.031 --> 00:03:50.197
of the nervous system as well,

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:53.676
including cognition,
emotion and consciousness.

00:03:53.676 --> 00:03:55.118
A lot of the white matter

00:03:55.118 --> 00:03:56.981
that's passing through the brainstem

00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:58.677
is actually connecting the different parts

00:03:58.677 --> 00:04:00.845
of the nervous system, so for example,

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:02.708
on these drawings over here,

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:04.437
which are views from the front,

00:04:04.437 --> 00:04:05.949
cutting through the nervous system,

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.117
like I've done here,
and what these drawings

00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:12.325
are showing are what we
often call the long tracts.

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:14.789
Long tracts.

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:16.245
We call them that because they are

00:04:16.245 --> 00:04:19.253
collections of axons
traveling a long distance

00:04:19.253 --> 00:04:21.301
through the central nervous system,

00:04:21.301 --> 00:04:23.646
often connecting the cerebrum up top

00:04:23.646 --> 00:04:25.270
down to the spinal cord,

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.437
and they're just passing
through the brainstem

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:30.338
on their way to or from the spinal cord

00:04:30.338 --> 00:04:32.548
or the cerebrum, and there
are two big categories

00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:34.792
of long tracts that are really important

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:36.404
passing through the brainstem.

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:38.373
Let me write two little marks here.

00:04:38.373 --> 00:04:39.572
The first play a big role

00:04:39.572 --> 00:04:42.331
in the motor functions
of the nervous system.

00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:44.716
These are actually the
upper motor neurons.

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:46.372
Here in this drawing, what they've shown

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:48.445
is upper motor neurons
starting way up here

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:50.936
in the cerebrum and then passing down

00:04:50.936 --> 00:04:53.907
through the brainstem,
and mostly crossing over

00:04:53.907 --> 00:04:55.772
to the other side of the spinal cord,

00:04:55.772 --> 00:04:57.837
where they're going to
innervate lower motor neurons,

00:04:57.837 --> 00:04:59.868
and here what they're
showing in this drawing

00:04:59.868 --> 00:05:02.308
are somatosensory long tracts.

00:05:02.308 --> 00:05:05.087
Somatosensory.

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.648
There are different kinds
of somatosensory tracts

00:05:08.648 --> 00:05:10.808
carrying information
to the nervous system,

00:05:10.808 --> 00:05:12.048
but what this one's showing is

00:05:12.048 --> 00:05:15.176
somatosensory information
coming up the spinal cord,

00:05:15.176 --> 00:05:17.343
crossing, and going up the brainstem,

00:05:17.343 --> 00:05:18.472
and then going to the cerebrum

00:05:18.472 --> 00:05:20.290
on the other side from the body.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.400
The brainstem is playing host

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.263
to these long motor and
somatosensory tracts

00:05:25.263 --> 00:05:27.026
that are carrying information up and down

00:05:27.026 --> 00:05:29.704
between the cerebrum and the spinal cord.

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:31.805
As if all of that wasn't enough functions

00:05:31.805 --> 00:05:33.488
for the brainstem to be doing,

00:05:33.488 --> 00:05:36.114
most of the cranial
nerves, as I mentioned,

00:05:36.114 --> 00:05:38.383
are attached to the brainstem,

00:05:38.383 --> 00:05:39.527
and the cranial nerves are doing

00:05:39.527 --> 00:05:41.232
all sorts of different things.

00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:43.695
There are 12 pairs of
these cranial nerves,

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:45.968
and most of them are
attached to the brainstem.

00:05:45.968 --> 00:05:49.719
Let me just draw a few
on my drawing over here.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:51.055
Here's a much better drawing,

00:05:51.055 --> 00:05:52.424
where they're showing the brainstem,

00:05:52.424 --> 00:05:54.968
and all of these little
nerves coming out here

00:05:54.968 --> 00:05:58.023
are cranial nerves, and
there are 12 pairs of them,

00:05:58.023 --> 00:06:01.112
most of which come out of the brainstem.

00:06:01.112 --> 00:06:03.696
The cranial nerves perform
all sorts of functions,

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:07.007
including motor functions,

00:06:07.007 --> 00:06:10.863
sensory functions, and a number
of different kinds of senses

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:13.510
in addition to somatosensory functions.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.871
There's things like hearing and taste

00:06:15.871 --> 00:06:19.054
and a number of automatic functions,

00:06:19.054 --> 00:06:21.936
like reflexes and autonomic functions.

00:06:21.936 --> 00:06:24.334
Automatic functions.

00:06:24.334 --> 00:06:26.223
The cranial nerves are related

00:06:26.223 --> 00:06:29.502
to a lot of the grey matter
inside of the brainstem,

00:06:29.502 --> 00:06:32.116
because in addition to
the reticular formation,

00:06:32.116 --> 00:06:36.199
this number of neuron somas
that are scattered around,

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.606
there are collections of neuron somas

00:06:38.606 --> 00:06:41.173
that are nuclei, that are discrete nuclei,

00:06:41.173 --> 00:06:43.535
that have been named,
and the cranial nerves

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:46.535
are often carrying information
away from these nuclei

00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:48.406
or into these nuclei, depending on

00:06:48.406 --> 00:06:50.535
what functions they are performing.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:52.870
For example, in this
illustration over here,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:55.775
we're looking at the
brainstem from the left side.

00:06:55.775 --> 00:06:58.190
This is the front and this is down,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.558
and what they're showing are these nuclei

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:04.647
have neuron somas and then
axons are leaving the brainstem

00:07:04.647 --> 00:07:07.871
through cranial nerves to
perform motor functions.

00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:10.879
In this drawing they're
showing sensory information

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.279
coming in through cranial
nerves to the brainstem,

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.390
to different nuclei in different
parts of the brainstem.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.451
These cranial nerves are mostly performing

00:07:19.451 --> 00:07:22.502
these functions in the head and the neck.

00:07:22.502 --> 00:07:25.023
Let me just mark that in
on our person over here.

00:07:25.023 --> 00:07:26.655
There are a few cranial nerves

00:07:26.655 --> 00:07:28.854
that actually travel from the brainstem

00:07:28.854 --> 00:07:30.719
all the way down into the body

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:34.214
and perform functions in
the trunk and in the limbs.

00:07:34.214 --> 00:07:37.030
Some examples of cranial
nerve functions include

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:39.424
sensation of the face and movements

00:07:39.424 --> 00:07:42.887
of the eyes, face, jaw and throat,

00:07:42.887 --> 00:07:44.390
in addition to influencing organs

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.918
like the heart and the intestines.

00:07:46.918 --> 00:07:48.861
There's a lot going on with the brainstem,

00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:50.484
and I think I'll stop here.

00:07:50.484 --> 00:07:52.517
In later videos we can
spend some more time

00:07:52.517 --> 00:07:53.781
going into some of the details

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:55.012
of the different structures

00:07:55.012 --> 00:07:57.093
and the different
functions of the brainstem.

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:58.565
I just want to introduce it

00:07:58.565 --> 00:08:01.426
and give you a feel for all
the different things it does.
