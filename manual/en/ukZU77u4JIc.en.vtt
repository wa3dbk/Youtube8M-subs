00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.920
Basic motion.

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:09.920
The simplest type of motion is uniform motion;
a heavy ball rolling on the floor is a good

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.889
example.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.840
An object in uniform motion goes in a straight
line.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.840
In uniform motion, the velocity is constant
so the spacing from frame to frame is always

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.340
the same.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.349
The larger the spacing, the faster the speed
of the motion.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.590
The timing and spacing determine speed.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.070
Let�s look at an example:

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.070
This bowling ball is 12 inches in diameter
with two frames per drawing, that is, shooting

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.350
on twos.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.960
What is the speed of the bowling ball?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.960
The ball rolls about 20 inches per drawing
so 10 inches per frame which is about 15 m.p.h.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.880
Let's look at another example, specifically,
Wile E. Coyote on rocket skates in this classic

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.060
scene from "Beep Beep."

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.060
Let�s estimate Wile E. Coyote�s speed.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:58.479
He travels about the length of his ears (say
15 inches) per frame so he�s only going

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.920
about 20 m.p.h.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.340
There�s actually a small correction since
that video is playing at 30 frames per second

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.340
instead of 24 frames per second, so he's actually
going about 24 miles per hour.

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.540
You might have thought that Wile E. Coyote
was travelling much faster but since the camera

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.169
is tracking him we see objects whizzing by and
that looks fast enough.

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:30.650
In fact, with a faster speed the objects going
past him would be a complete blur, which is

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.279
uninteresting.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:40.680
When thinking about motion remember that uniform
spacings are not visually uniform when viewed

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.150
in perspective, as with the spacings between
these telegraph poles.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.760
Uniform motion may not seem uniform due to
the distortion of scale when shown in perspective.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.829
The spacings for this ball that is rolling
from foreground to background are actually

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.930
equal distances in perspective.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.639
Now let�s look at some video reference for
a ball drop.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.499
This was filmed in slow motion to allow us
to easily see the motion.

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:20.129
Clearly, this is not uniform motion since
the ball is gaining speed as it falls.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.129
If an object�s motion is not uniform then
the object is either speeding up, slowing

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.339
down, or changing direction.

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:37.339
If the speed is decreasing then the spacing
between drawings decreases, which in animation

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.879
is called �slowing in� (or �easing in�).

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.409
A sled slowing by friction is a simple example
of slowing in.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:53.409
If the speed is increasing then the spacing
between drawings increases, which in animation

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:58.309
is called �slowing out� (or �easing
out�).

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:04.159
Here you see two basic examples of slowing
out: a ball rolling down an incline and a

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:08.489
ball falling straight downward.

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.169
Slowing in and slowing out is yet another
one of the Principles of Animation.

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:22.169
A ball that�s thrown straight upward slows
in to and then slows out from the apex (i.e.,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.960
the highest point).

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.960
An apex is an example of an extreme, which
is a pose from which slowing out starts or

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.350
slowing in finishes.

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.020
Animating a ball that slows into an apex and
then slows out as it falls is challenging.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.220
If the spacings near the apex aren�t quite
right then the ball reverses direction at

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.100
the top in an unnatural way.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.530
The ball may appear as if it is hitting an
invisible ceiling.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.180
In these examples only the one on the right
has the correct spacings into and out of the

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.900
apex.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.200
In the animation on the left the ball seems
to hit an invisible ceiling near the apex.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.850
The spacings for the motion slowing into and
out of the apex are pretty good for the example

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.700
on the right.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.800
In summary:

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:33.800
Uniform motion is motion with constant speed
in a straight line.

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:41.200
The larger the spacings, the higher the speed
of the motion.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:48.200
Slowing in &amp; slowing out are important examples
of non-uniform motion.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.740
The apex is an example of an extreme.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.740
The spacings into and out of the apex are
critical to creating believable falling motion.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:07.270
In the next video we�ll see how to get those
spacings near the apex to look correct.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.560
See you then.
