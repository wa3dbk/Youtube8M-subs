00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:01.833
- [Voiceover] Let's do some examples

00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:05.001
of the writing expressions
with variables exercise.

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:06.286
So it says "Write an expression

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:08.703
to represent 11 more than a."

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.955
Well you could just have a

00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.790
but if you want 11 more than a,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.623
you would wanna add 11

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:20.054
so you could write that as a plus 11.

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:22.406
You could also write that as 11 plus a.

00:00:22.406 --> 00:00:26.041
Both of them would be 11 more than a.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.697
So let's check our answer here.

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:28.716
We got it right.

00:00:28.716 --> 00:00:30.537
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:30.537 --> 00:00:32.845
"Write an expression to represent the sum

00:00:32.845 --> 00:00:33.845
of d and 9."

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.569
So the sum of d and 9,

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:39.623
that means you're gonna add d and 9.

00:00:39.623 --> 00:00:41.345
So I could write that as d plus 9

00:00:41.345 --> 00:00:44.178
or I could write that as 9 plus d.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.900
And check our answer.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.161
Got that right.

00:00:49.161 --> 00:00:50.705
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:54.691
"Write an expression to
represent j minus 15."

00:00:54.691 --> 00:00:57.574
Well, I could just write
it with math symbols

00:00:57.574 --> 00:00:59.420
instead of writing the word minus.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.227
Instead of writing M-I-N-U-S,

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.310
I could write j minus 15.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.858
And then I check my answer.

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:07.898
Got it right.

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:09.839
Let's do a few more of these.

00:01:09.839 --> 00:01:11.018
This is a lot of fun.

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:14.768
"Write an expression to
represent 7 times r."

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:16.721
There's a couple ways I could do it.

00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.269
I could use this little
dot right over here,

00:01:18.269 --> 00:01:20.186
do 7 times r like that.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:22.674
That would be correct.

00:01:22.674 --> 00:01:24.469
I could literally just write 7r.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.060
If I just wrote 7r that would also count.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.399
Let me check my answer.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.117
That's right.

00:01:31.117 --> 00:01:32.611
Let me do a couple of other of these

00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:35.438
just so you can see that I could've

00:01:35.438 --> 00:01:38.038
just done 10 and this is not a decimal,

00:01:38.038 --> 00:01:40.291
it sits a little bit
higher than a decimal.

00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:42.487
It's multiplication and the reason why

00:01:42.487 --> 00:01:44.840
once you start doing
algebra, you use this symbol

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.403
instead of that kind of
cross for multiplication

00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:51.061
is that x-looking thing
gets confused with x

00:01:51.061 --> 00:01:53.064
when you're using x as a variable

00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:54.694
so that's why this is a lot more useful.

00:01:54.694 --> 00:01:57.111
So we wanna write 10 times u,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.904
10 times u, let's check our answer.

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:00.978
We got it right.

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:02.966
Let's do one more.

00:02:02.966 --> 00:02:07.455
"Write an expression to
represent 8 divided by d."

00:02:07.455 --> 00:02:10.206
So we could write it as
8 and then I could write

00:02:10.206 --> 00:02:13.039
a slash like that, 8 divided by d.

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:15.732
And there you go.

00:02:15.732 --> 00:02:17.510
This is 8 divided by d.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.081
Let me check, let me check the answer.

00:02:20.081 --> 00:02:21.637
I'll do one more of these.

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:23.341
Oh, it's 6 divided by b.

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:24.470
Alright, same thing.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.867
So 6, I could use this
tool right over here.

00:02:26.867 --> 00:02:27.995
It does the same thing

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.078
as if I were to press the backslash.

00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:32.157
So 6 divided by b.

00:02:32.157 --> 00:02:33.364
Check my answer.

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:34.697
We got it right.
