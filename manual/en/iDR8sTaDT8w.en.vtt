00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.244
What restaurant?

00:00:01.245 --> 00:00:02.930
It's downtown, honey.

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:04.180
But what street?

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.698
Aristides de Barros, 290.

00:00:07.699 --> 00:00:09.642
I don't know that street.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.161
Let's use the GPS.

00:00:11.162 --> 00:00:12.189
No,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.221
let me do this.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.170
Hello, Beto,
I was thinking about you.

00:00:18.171 --> 00:00:19.213
Hello.

00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:20.869
I'm here with Laura,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.421
we're going to a restaurant
downtown, can you help us?

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:25.110
Right, she's here.

00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:26.781
-What's this?
-The GPS.

00:00:26.782 --> 00:00:29.357
Now I'm only "the GPS"?

00:00:29.358 --> 00:00:33.909
-Can you help us? it's at...
-Aristides de Barros, 290.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.923
290. It's downtown.

00:00:35.924 --> 00:00:38.324
Ask that bitch for help.

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:39.369
What?

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.013
Beto, have you been dating
your GPS?

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:44.605
It's normal,
it has voice control...

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:45.878
Any problem?

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:48.781
Please, let's not
fight in this car.

00:00:48.782 --> 00:00:51.845
I'm not taking that
bitch anywhere.

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:53.885
Let me do it.
-Don't touch me!

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:54.962
Let me do it.

00:00:54.963 --> 00:00:56.860
-Are you defending the GPS?
-I'm not...

00:00:56.861 --> 00:00:58.666
-You're on her side.
-There's no side.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:01.130
we're going out to eat,
and she'll help us. Simple.

00:01:01.131 --> 00:01:03.340
Then turn it off now
and use your phone's maps.

00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:05.885
-No!
-Roberto, what the hell?

00:01:05.886 --> 00:01:08.750
Have you been using the maps
on your phone?

00:01:08.751 --> 00:01:10.493
I don't even
know how to use it.

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:11.557
You promised me!

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:12.621
Turn it off!

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:14.045
There's no need...

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:16.974
How many times were you late
and I helped you?

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.238
Roberto, I wanted...

00:01:19.239 --> 00:01:20.822
I'm not talking to you, slut!

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:23.901
-What? Shut up!
-Come and shut it!

00:01:23.902 --> 00:01:26.526
-Enough, guys!
-She caught my hair!

00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:28.870
She's crazy!

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:31.493
I'll show you
the way to hell!

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:32.541
Stop!

00:01:32.542 --> 00:01:34.222
I'll slap my hand
on you face!

00:01:34.223 --> 00:01:35.626
Stop!

00:01:35.627 --> 00:01:36.736
Focus! The restaurant!

00:01:36.737 --> 00:01:39.644
I'm not going anywhere with
that bitch showing the way.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.341
How are we getting there
if we don't know where it is?

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:43.836
We ask people for information.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.368
Ask people for information?

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.848
I never want to see you again...

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.632
I'll suffocate her...

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:54.448
Get that Waze thing
on your phone, now.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.105
Hello, Betinho.

00:02:04.594 --> 00:02:06.717
What's your destination?

00:02:06.718 --> 00:02:09.599
It's definitely
not with me.

00:02:10.367 --> 00:02:15.462
In 200m turn left on my chest

00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:17.782
and run over my heart.

00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:20.749
Searching new route,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.550
far from me.

00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:26.782
Attention, speed trap in 50m.

00:02:26.783 --> 00:02:30.446
Slut sitting next to you.

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:35.086
On the next roundabout
go straight ahead,

00:02:35.087 --> 00:02:37.430
and disappear from my life.

00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:40.917
You missed the highway.

00:02:40.918 --> 00:02:43.525
You missed your caring.

00:02:43.526 --> 00:02:46.606
You're out of desire,

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:48.398
You'll miss me.
