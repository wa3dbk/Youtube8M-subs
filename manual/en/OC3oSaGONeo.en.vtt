"D.J Tutorial For Beginners
If you're curious about the D.J art form definitely

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.160
feel free to also maybe
sigh up for a class.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.340
I instruct a class here at ""Rock and Soul"".

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.130
You can come
in and schedule a day for you to give it a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.440
little test run.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.779
And then ask yourself
if this is something that you want to pursue.

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.399
If the answer is yes, then there's
tons of people here and maybe you might have

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.649
some friends that can help you out.

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:42.290
To give you a more in depth breakdown of what
it takes to be a D.J.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.580
It definitely involves a lot of practicing,
research and organization.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.990
One of
the first things that I teach in the beginners

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.360
lesson out here at Rock and Soul.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.760
Is focus on counting bars because it's very
important to know how to do that first.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.250
Starting out if you don't know how to count
bars you're probably going to be lost

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.580
with keeping time.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.500
Lost with just understanding when to start
you're mix and when

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.920
to exit out of you're mix.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.500
So I have a song loaded up on my left deck
here and pretty much on counting

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.860
bars you're going to start off on ""the one,
one, two, three, four"", ""two, two,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.780
three, four"", ""three, two, three, four"",
""four, two, three, four).

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.360
If you notice
that's four bars of music that we just counted.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.120
And I counted to the beat and you
want to also say to yourself the bar that

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.120
your in.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.840
You don't want to count ""one, two,
three, four, one, two, three, four"", and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.970
so on and so forth.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.330
Because if you're not paying attention, you'll
definitely lose track of which

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.330
bar you're in.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.810
""one, two, three, four"", two, two, three,
four"", three, two, three,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.320
four, four, two, three, four"".

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.970
That's four bars of music that's how you count
bars.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.750
That is a very helpful tool to use when planning
out your mixes and you're planning out you're

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.750
blends.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.530
Just knowing when to start you're mix, when
to exit you're mix,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.539
and to keep a nice steady flow.
