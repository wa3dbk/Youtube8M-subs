00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.120
Hi, Alan Stratton from As Wood Turns dot com.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.040
You know as you are turning on the lathe,
you're building up a lot of sawdust, often

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.100
applying finishes, oil, other lacquers.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.970
And, gunk can build up on your lathe.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.430
So, you need to clean it.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.660
Just like you need to take a bath, you need
to clean your lathe.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.300
But, there's one tough spot -- that's inside
the morse taper.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.730
This is the equivalent to your mother telling
you when you were a kid, to wash behind your

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.000
ears.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.960
This is behind the ears of the lathe.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.040
Now, you could buy an expensive little rubber
thing to clean it from the suppliers.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.260
Or, you can do what I did, a suggestion from
the AAW, and buy a 20 gauge shotgun brush,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.100
about 2 and one-half dollars.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.830
It does not come with a handle but you're
a woodturner.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.050
Make a handle and put the brush on it.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:07.330
And use this brush to clean behind your ears,
inside the morse taper -- headstock and tailstock.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.540
So you're nice and clean, things don't get
bunged up and out of line later on.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.890
For my handle, I'm using a pen blank.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.280
It's from an exotic assortment that was on
sale on Black Friday, so I don't know the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.220
exact variety.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.470
The first thing I'll do is to drill the hole
for the brush.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.190
The tape on the drill bit marks my depth.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.010
If this wood were more dense, I could have
taped a thread, but this piece is too soft.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.980
Next rough turn the spindle with a spindle
roughing gouge.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.810
Then switch to a skew -- it does a much smoother
job than a gouge for me, at least, on long

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:54.729
thin spindles.

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.440
I want a simple design.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.140
The nose must be narrow to fit inside the
morse taper to extend the reach of the brush

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.140
just a little.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.780
The other end can be simple.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.270
I just want it easy and comfortable to hold.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.909
I'm not going to load it up with a lot of
beads and coves.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:22.990
I'll take it gradually, I have an overall
vision in mind but no details -- I want the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.550
details to emerge from the wood.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:39.330
I'll give it a little time to talk to me.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.330
Then sand.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.040
I used some coarse paper on a scrap board
to make the front taper more uniform.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.730
Then sand the whole handle.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.300
For finishing, I'm using my utility mix of
mineral oil and beeswax.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.770
Finally, start to part it off but take a break
to sand this new area just a little.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.310
Then hand sand the final little nub.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.400
So, here you are with your brush.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.430
Just as you clean behind your ears, clean
inside the morse taper on your head stock

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.390
and your tail stock regularly.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.190
This will avoid the buildup of gunk that will
throw off your equipment, make your equipment

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.490
last longer, make your results much better.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:27.380
