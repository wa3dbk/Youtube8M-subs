ALEX DANILO: They didn't
know what to expect.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.340
And I kind of thought
when we went there,

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.160
they might find
this really boring.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.645
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.630
So you know where
we are, people?

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.530
This in Sydney Olympic
Stadium, and this

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.500
is like the future of Olympics.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
Never mind human competition,
this is robot against robot.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.900
This is like machines.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900
When I was a kid, I
think like any kid

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.100
you don't really know what you
want to do when you grow up.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.222
I don't think I ever
planned to be an engineer.

00:01:06.222 --> 00:01:07.680
I think just going
into engineering

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.300
was just a side effect of
enjoying building things.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.758
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.750
So these teams are putting
their robots together.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.060
This is like a real
robot right here.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.690
Check this out.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.940
Let's have a look.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.060
Mainly it's like actuators.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.480
There's motors here.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.616
There's stressed out cables.

00:01:50.616 --> 00:01:51.240
There's chains.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.890
There's all these control wires.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.101
Servers are probably
in there somewhere.

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:57.600
Wow.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510
Would you like to build a robot?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.070
BOY: I don't think so.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.450
ALEX DANILO: Why not?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.711
BOY: Because they could
electrocute people.

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:08.919
ALEX DANILO: When kids see
robots or think of robots,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.759
they probably think of
movies and cartoons,

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.770
and that's just not reality.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.797
Today cars are
built with robots.

00:02:15.797 --> 00:02:17.505
A lot of the consumer
electronics you buy

00:02:17.505 --> 00:02:18.669
is built with robots.

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.210
Tons of things are
built with robots,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.560
and they are not only
changing the world,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.314
they'll continue to
change the world.

00:02:24.314 --> 00:02:26.230
And if you take the kids
to actually show them

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.130
what they do, they
might get interested,

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.420
and they might want to
actually do stuff themselves.

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.960
So this is a LEGO brick
which controls everything.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.490
And there's cables connecting
to all the motors and stuff,

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.115
and they're letting
all sorts of stuff.

00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:52.754
Is it fun?

00:02:52.754 --> 00:02:54.570
GIRL: Yes.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.651
ALEX DANILO: What do you think?

00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:58.324
BOY: I think so.

00:02:58.324 --> 00:02:59.990
ALEX DANILO: I think
they're having fun.

00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:12.612
BOY: How do you program these
robots to be so efficient?

00:03:12.612 --> 00:03:14.070
WOMAN: The team
spent a lot of time

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.560
ensuring that they keep their
robots as simple as possible

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.070
because simple is a very
good engineering practice.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.282
BOY: OK.

00:03:23.282 --> 00:03:24.740
ALEX DANILO: What
did you like most

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.700
about the robotics competition?

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.410
BOY: I liked everything.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.550
Nothing was my favorite.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.430
GIRL: I liked making
the LEGO Rover.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.749
It was really fun.

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:39.540
ALEX DANILO: Right.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.025
So did your LEGO
robot go really well?

00:03:42.025 --> 00:03:42.676
GIRL: Yes.

00:03:42.676 --> 00:03:45.050
ALEX DANILO: Do you think
you'll build bigger robots when

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.146
you're a bit older?

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:46.904
GIRL: Yes.

00:03:46.904 --> 00:03:49.070
ALEX DANILO: There were
just smiles on their faces--

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.150
excited.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.890
It just opened their
eyes to a new world,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:56.890
and that world is the world of
technology, and it can be fun.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.150
And unless you see it for
yourself, you can never know.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.620
OK, so there you have it, kids.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.905
The First Robotics
Competition is a great way

00:04:04.905 --> 00:04:05.780
to get into robotics.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.060
These little ones, they
can make LEGO robots.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.847
The big kids can
make bigger robots.

00:04:09.847 --> 00:04:10.930
So what do you guys think?

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:11.900
Shall we go build a robot?

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.800
BOY AND GIRL: Yeah!

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.000
ALEX DANILO: Come on.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.550
