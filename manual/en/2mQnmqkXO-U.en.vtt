Hey everyone this is chad from gadgetguruhd.com
and as all of my subscribers know, I've been

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.990
pumping an absolute ton of content out on
the GS5 and HTC One M8 with comparisons, tutorials,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.209
and much more.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.610
But in today's video I'll be giving you all
a run down of some of my favorite and most

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.430
useful features on the Samsung Galaxy S5.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.660
Instead of just briefly running through about
ten or so, I'm going to be doing an in depth

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.230
look at those that I felt were most worthy
of mention.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.340
And if one of the features that really caught
your eye wasn't on this list, then be sure

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.740
to get back at me in the comments section
down below.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:41.680
Anyway, these are my top five favorite features
of 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.620
the Galaxy S5, enjoy!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.310
1.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.010
Waterproof

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.700
Now without a doubt the coolest feature on
the Galaxy S5 is the fact that it's completely

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.220
dust and waterproof.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.510
I know most of you are probably thinking this
is probably just another marketing ploy, but

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:59.680
it really isn't.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.850
We have actually personally tested this on
the channel by completely submerging the GS5

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.340
in water for over thirty minutes and it worked
perfectly fine afterwards.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.850
In addition to that, we also did some underwater
4K video tests and water drop tests into 4

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.369
and a half feet deep water which is actually
a foot and a half deeper than the GS5 is capable

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.369
of going.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.889
So if you're interested in checking those
out, links will be in the description.

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:27.450
I know for a fact that sometime or another
during the lifetime of this S5 I'll accidentally

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.359
go swimming with it or walk into the ocean
with it.

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.869
It's happened to everyone and that's why I
think this is such a great feature to have.

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.569
Once you've completely thrown a phone into
a pool and poured a gallon jug of water onto

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:42.020
it, it's tough to want to use a device that
lacks waterproof functionality.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.649
Because of this, I'm looking forward to the
Xperia Z2, because according to Sony, it's

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.130
actually more resistant to water than the
GS5.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.319
In my opinion, waterproof and dust proof capabilities
are definitely the future of smartphones.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:54.319
2.

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:55.319
Fingerprint Scanner

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.020
Another one of my favorite features is the
fingerprint scanner.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.689
If you didn't already know, the Galaxy S5
actually has a fingerprint sensor built into

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.659
the home button like on the iPhone 5S.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.060
And yes, Apple did it first, so we shouldn't
have to see a complete war going on in the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.569
comments section of this video.

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.689
I think the whole concept of protecting passwords
and accounts with fingerprints are just very

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:15.689
cool.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.870
As of right now you can actually send payments
over PayPal and verify with your fingerprint

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.459
so the technology is definitely evolving.

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.269
Once everything is completely protected using
fingerprint technology, life will be so much

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.860
easier not needing to remember all of your
passwords.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.340
If anyone of you have used the fingerprint
scanner on the Galaxy S5, you'll know it's

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.769
not perfect, and I'll be the first one to
admit that because it just isn't perfect.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.599
One issue I did run into with the Galaxy S5's
fingerprint scanner was unlocking the device

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.269
with one hand, but I was able to solve it
by registering the side of my thumb several

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.299
times.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.620
But even with registering my thumb a couple
of times the sensor doesn't always read my

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.890
finger correctly.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.430
Part of it is definitely my fault because
I'll be racing to get into my phone to read

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.380
a notification and swipe too fast, or I won't
slide my finger exactly over the sensor.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.879
For me the sensor has been somewhat hit or
miss, but it's a very cool feature none the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.879
less.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.879
3.

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.879
S Health Suite

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.450
My next favorite feature on the GS5 is the
whole S Health app.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.250
Generally speaking I've never really mixed
my workouts with technology other than with

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.650
just a simple google drive spreadsheet, but
this S Health app is actually pretty darn

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.650
useful.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.239
It includes all the necessary information
for your average joe like yourself to get

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.610
started losing weight.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.560
And is there really any better way to combine
a love of technology with losing weight?

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.141
The S Health app will basically walk you through
everything with setting goals and whatnot.

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:34.120
It's essentially your one stop shop for a
built in pedometer, food log to track calories,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.450
exercise, and also check your heart rate thanks
to the built in heart rate monitor.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.930
One minor thing I really appreciate is the
clean modern user interface.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.800
You can simply swipe from left to right for
access to all the different pages which you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.629
can see here, or just go to the main page
which gets you access to your current stats

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.629
for the day.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.389
While my current goals aren't necessarily
to lose any weight, I definitely think it's

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.629
an awesome app for those that need the extra
motivation to start working out and getting

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.629
into shape.

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:00.629
4.

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.629
display

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.909
When it comes to the actual size and just
the overall look of a display you can't get

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.469
much better than the Galaxy S5's.

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:09.180
Now there were a ton of rumors and speculation
that the GS5 would feature a much higher res

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.269
2K display, and there's still rumors of another
samsung device that will launch with one in

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.790
the near future, but regardless of what meaningless
rumors are telling us, I can testify that

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.020
the Galaxy S5 has one of the best displays
I've used.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.000
It measures in 5.1 inches diagonally which
is just a slight bump up from the Galaxy S4's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
4.99 inch display.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.240
The great thing about the increase in screen
size is that it doesn't change the overall

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.800
dimensions of the phone by much, but it ups
the display size.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.070
I'm a huge fan of displays measuring around
five inches, anything above that starts to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.480
get into phablet territory and I start to
lose interest.

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.570
I've found that 5 inches is just about the
sweet spot for overall media consumption because

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.570
it keeps the device at a comfortable size,
while giving as much screen as possible.

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.090
As far as the actually video goes the S5 delivers
a vibrant, crisp, picture that just flies

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.380
off the screen.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.430
For me, the S4 was just a bit too saturated,
where this new one fits in much more pixels

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:07.510
per inch coming in at 432 and offers a more
realistic experience when it comes to color

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.510
accuracy.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:09.510
5.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.510
Camera

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.510
The camera is without a doubt one of the best
features on the S5.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.510
While it isn't the best of any device out
there, the GS5 is armed and equipped with

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.680
Samsung's whole suite of camera features that
were shown off last year during the Galaxy

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.750
S4 launch.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.990
But it isn't just the software that makes
the camera one of the major improvements over

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.640
the S4, it's also the hardware.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:33.020
Samsung claims that the S5 can take a pic
in around .3 seconds which is pretty impressive.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.110
Even though we weren't able to test this out
exactly, I found it took pictures pretty darn

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.800
fast without any blur.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.140
Also, the upgrade to a 16 megapixel camera
is a pretty big deal when cropping pictures

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.230
and bringing them up on the computer.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:49.090
They show up much sharper and cleaner than
phones like the HTC One M8 which only has

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.090
a 4 megapixel camera.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.220
Another one of the major improvements is the
implementation of 4K video recording which

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:56.430
is pretty awesome.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.500
The only problem is that once the video quality
is upped to 4k, you lose some features like

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.230
dual camera and also optical image stablization.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.860
I did do a 4k video test hand held walking
around so you can watch that video if you're

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.430
interested in seeing a real world test of
the video quality.

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.850
So those right there are my top five favorite
features for the brand new Samsung Galaxy

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.850
S5.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.430
Again, if there was a particular feature that
you really liked that wasn't on there be sure

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.770
to leave a comment down below, or let me know
on twitter @GadgetGuruHD.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.590
Thanks for watching everyone, be sure to give
this video a thumbs up and subscribe if you

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:39.760
enjoyed and I'll see you all in the next video.
