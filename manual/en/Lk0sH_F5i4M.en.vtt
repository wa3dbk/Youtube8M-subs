SenVal Theater: Gallia's Summer Festival.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.440
Buuhi~

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.720
Faldio.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
Touyo's garments are very interesting, don't you agree?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.980
Yeah.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.770
When you go to a festival in Touyo, traditionally you wear this type of clothing.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.140
Even so... why do we have to wear this?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.120
Come on, don't say that Ramal.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.410
Alicia and Isara went through the trouble of preparing them.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.740
A gentleman never refuses a lady's request.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:37.520
Hey everyone!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.910
Sorry for making you wait.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.930
Excuse us for being late.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.610
Aren't you two cute.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.430
You look great in those.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.260
Yeah.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.810
You're very beautiful.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.670
Really?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.700
I'm not used to wearing this, so it's a bit embarassing.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.330
Is something the matter?

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.950
Ah, no.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.170
It's nothing.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.650
Alright, shall we get going?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.380
Wow, there's so many people!

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.410
Castle festivals are amazing!

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.770
Oh, there's an unusual stand over there!

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.200
Wait up Welkin!

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.670
These are quite rare.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.720
You're still going on about bugs here?

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.480
It's a Madarawari butterfly!

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.260
You're very skilled.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.210
Thank you very much.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.240
That hurt!

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.930
He thought I was cute, so he gave me extra.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.880
Oh, it looks like some of it's melting.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.990
This store over here looks interesting too!

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080
Wait! You'll get lost.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.510
Smile everyone!

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.310
We sort of got separated from everyone.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:05.560
It's fine.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.810
We'll meet up with them once we get back to the gate.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.820
What beautiful fireworks.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.390
Yeah.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.270
Your Highness...

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.700
When will you be able to come?

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.160
