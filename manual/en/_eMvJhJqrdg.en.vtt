00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:02.726
 Giorgio Petrosyan

00:00:02.726 --> 00:00:31.769
-- Why didn't punch land?

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.379
I don't know why... when I observe other fighters, most of them have the same style.

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:58.228
Maybe the way I train is different from them, but I just fight my own way.

00:01:29.403 --> 00:01:37.639
-- I think Yamamoto is one of those fighters.

00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:58.048
Yamamoto is also aggressive. So I will be ready for the fight, and be perfectly prepared.

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:28.577
-- Is it easy to fight with an aggressive fighter?

00:02:32.266 --> 00:02:43.432
There's no one that is easy to fight, but I like Yamamoto's style.

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:22.742
--I think that your match with Yamamoto will draw a lot more attention that your previous fights.

00:03:23.697 --> 00:03:31.864
 I think he has an advantage because he is Japanese, and this is his home country.

00:03:31.864 --> 00:03:38.457
I have known of him for a long time. I'm sure he has fought in Italy before.

00:03:38.457 --> 00:03:55.094
The fight was at about 67kg, and he lost it. Anyway, right now the only thing I am thinking about is winning the match.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:48.580
-- Are you confident in becoming the Champion?

00:04:52.039 --> 00:05:10.069
I'm not 100% confident, but I do think I have a very decent chance.
