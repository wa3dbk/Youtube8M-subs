Hi, I'm Elvis Hillard. I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village, and today, we're going

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.830
to be making a dish called a French cassoulet.
These are the ingredients today that we're

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.200
going to be using to make our dish. You're
just going to use a couple of stalks of the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.622
celery right here. You're not going to need
that much. You want to make sure that you

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:22.860
take those leaves off of it. I'll show you
about that in a minute. A little bit of zucchini

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.270
and squash -- medium size, just make sure
it's really firm when you do purchase it.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.941
Make sure there's no bruises or anything like
that into it. You just need an onion. It can

00:00:33.941 --> 00:00:38.350
be a red onion; it can be a yellow onion,
Vidalia. Vidalia onions are really sweet,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.629
so that's a pretty good thing that you can
use. A little bit of butter, and you're going

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.529
to use a touch of olive oil. That's just going
to help to salty down your dish. Your tomatoes

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:53.980
 -- just use regular, old vine ripe tomatoes.
You can even use Roma if you want to. And

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.530
if you just don't even want to deal with it,
you can use canned tomatoes. I mean, even

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.479
like Rotel would be excellent in this dish.
Garlic, this is something that I always express.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.280
Whenever you buy garlic, make sure it's really
firm. You want to check it, and I mean, it's

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.530
not like you have to open it up to find out.
Smell it, check it. All your ingredients,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.159
you really want to just smell and make sure
that they just smell fresh, there's no weird

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.480
smell to them or anything. Fennel, we're going
to use one and a half of them in this dish

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:28.219
today. They come with this. You can also save
these stalks right here, save them for stock.

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.780
We've got fresh thyme. Make sure -- like a
lot of times when you go to a grocery store

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.219
and you start looking for thyme, you look
through those containers and they're all brown

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.009
and black and everything. The guys just don't
check them as much as they can, so I always

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.369
get my thyme from the very back of that aisle,
that line that they're all sitting at, some

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:54.219
bay leaves and then the beans. In this dish,
I mean, it's not like you're cooking red beans

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.240
and rice or anything, so you can just go ahead.
Your best option is to buy a bean that's already

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.640
cooked. Like these are just Great Northern
beans. You can get cannelloni. I mean, pinto.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.050
You can use anything you want, whatever you
prefer to use. These are basically the ingredients

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.360
that you will be using today. And to finish
it off, we just have a baguette that we're

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.220
going to slice and put on top when the dish
is finished. These are the ingredients you're

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.600
going to have to need.
