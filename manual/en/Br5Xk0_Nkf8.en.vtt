00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.810
[Darris McNeely] They say that most men will
not stop their car when they’re lost, driving

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.339
around, and ask for directions.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.090
It’s kind of a guy thing.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.150
I know – I’ve been guilty of that myself.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.779
Now ladies, there may be something that’s
peculiar to you that you don’t want to ask

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.460
help or directions for – I’m not going
to comment about that today.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.039
But let’s face it – it’s a human problem.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.279
Human beings don’t like to admit that we
might be lost, we might not know something,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.100
and we might somehow be inadequate and go
and seek understanding, go and seek help,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.840
and even at times, correction.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.800
Well, that brings us to the third key that
we are talking about in this series on how

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.949
to understand the Bible.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:56.010
Third key in this is to humbly seek understanding
and correction.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.059
Humbly seek instruction and correction.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.710
As we begin to study the Bible and understand
what God has in store for us.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:16.270
Instruction that the Bible is full of and,
yes, correction – to correct our lives,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.130
our actions, our attitudes, and make us more
like God.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.570
That, after all, is why you would want to
open up the Bible and begin to study it and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.570
read it.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.810
But recognize that we’re lost at times.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.740
We’re off on a different side street and
we’re not headed in the right direction

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.939
and we need to get directions.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.210
That’s where the word of God comes in.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.310
In Jeremiah 10:23 – a critical verse in
here to help guide us in this – it says,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.840
“O Lord, I know the way of man is not in
himself.”

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.649
Sometimes we need a bit of a course correction,
we need to be pushed back in line.

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.680
He goes on, “It is not in man who walks
to direct his own steps.”

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.810
We need God to help us in doing that.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.390
And so, as Jeremiah prayed here, “O Lord,
correct me, but with justice, not in Your

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.840
anger, lest You bring me to nothing.”

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.349
Make that a prayer as you seek to understand
the Bible and to let it – its secrets, its

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:24.349
revelation, its truth, its instruction, be
opened up to you by God.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:30.370
Make that your prayer to God, to teach you,
direct you, even to correct you, and go and

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.430
do that in a humble fashion.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.530
God will answer that prayer.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.030
You’ll be very surprised at what will begin
to be understood and opened up from the pages

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.190
of the Bible.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.560
I understand going to the word of God and
seeking correction is a challenging matter.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.210
And be ready for that.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.879
We, and you, will have some things revealed
to us that may be a little bit hard and difficult

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.450
to deal with.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.930
But understand this: God’s word can discern
our thoughts and our hearts and it can open

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.940
us up to a way of understanding exactly what
God has in mind for us as we read His word.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.470
So be ready, as you set out to understand
the Bible, be ready to seek and to take and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.370
understand that correction.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.060
That’s BT Daily.
