00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.940
Hey what's going on YouTube?

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.720
This is El Tiro, another tutorial Thursday
for you guys, representing Dance Saves Lives.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.480
So today's tutorial is going to be on how
to isolate an object and move around the object

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.290
in like a circular motion.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.470
I do want to say, I did not make this up.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.180
I have seen it in some big TV shows, like
America's Got Talent.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.280
And I've seen more than a few dancers that
have done it so I'm definitely not claiming

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.650
this as my move.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.860
But the concept of isolating an object is
definitely a fundamental or style of popping

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.920
whether you isolate in all kinds of ways.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.710
The concept of setting the object and then
opening around it, it think is a really cool

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.640
visual effect that every dancer should know
if they want to entertain an audience.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.120
So the first thing that I'm going to concentrate
on is keeping this hat in the center as if

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.020
it was hanging on like a knob.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.790
As I walk across, my arm is going to be moving
except my wrist and my hat is what we try

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.770
to isolate right in the middle.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.470
So this is definitely the tricks that you
need to practice in the mirror.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.000
If you get the feeling, if you're walking
and maybe kind of wobbling, that obviously

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
will lose the effect.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.479
Or if you're moving with it as well uh uh
no fuego!

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.471
So once you got that part mastered here, you
can start working on your fingertips which

00:01:59.471 --> 00:02:02.170
is really going to do all the work here.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.880
The hardest part is getting those fingertips
down because you're going to be kind of twisting

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.950
your fingers around the hat, kind of keeping
it in circles.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.380
It's almost like if you're twisting the hat
this way, the hat is kind of like the object

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.989
that will stay still, then you're hands are
on top, twisting your fingers as you try to

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:23.989
keep it here.

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.360
Before we try to go for the whole circle,
I'll break it down into parts like this part

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.620
number 1, straight here.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.440
Part number 2, rotate the wrist at least a
half quarter.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.389
Part number 3, coming on full in front of
the hat.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:51.760
Then turn, part number 4, now the wrist switching
a 180 degrees.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.370
We'll walk all the way out.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.340
And we'll switch again.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:10.750
So 
we got, 1 2 3 4 5 6.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:19.190
So there you go tutorial Thursday on isolating
an object and orbiting around it.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.600

me, post a video response and in return, I

Oh wait wait wait.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.630
You know I'd do it.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.540
Just keep practicing.
