00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.460
Hello everybody it's Maverynthia once again. Now you're wondering why I have Gish up.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:13.990
Well as you can tell, this is a semi response to Suraht.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:26.680
While he made a few good points on his rant. I think he was missing some very major points on why it's bad.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:37.970
Like especially starting with Gish. He covered the other- THAT /other/ game quite well in my opinion. That game that shall not be mentioned here.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:49.580
I'm not going to be playing this game because my joypad doesn't work with it, or I should say it doesn't work with my joypad. So, screw it! It's a broken game to me.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.620
New player. Name: Crap.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.620
I'm going to show you the opening, and here we can see that's the girlfriend.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:16.790
With her eye closed a smile on her lips her chest being exposed with some kind of weird thing behind her.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.020
Yeah anyways, continuing on with the whole captured girlfriend trope that's now sexualized.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.000
New game: Normal.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.510
OK see "Gish isn't your average hero in fact-- in facts he's not your average anything.. see Gish is a ball of tar."

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.400
While on a stroll with his lady friend Brea. Lol, Brea Tar Pits.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.700
La Brea Tar Pits. "A shadowy figure emerged from an open man hole..." How convenient.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.730
"Pulling her away..."

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.340
Notice her large breasts being emphasized by the tar.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.500
"and into the ground below..."

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.200
Yup.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.400
He really likes women doesn't he? No, he doesn't.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.150
"Gish quickly jumps into action."

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.880
OK I'm going to let this finish, because this needs to finish.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.910
"Live isn't easy when you are a.. TWELVE. POUND. BALL. OF. TAR."

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:39.020
A grown woman is kidnapped and she can't fight off the tar beast, but a twelve pound ball of tar can.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:55.450
This is just as bad as those games where a fully grown woman is captured by whatever, yet an eight year old boy has to come and save the day.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.090
*Keyboard and joypad noises trying to get it to work*

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:11.060
That's the major point that I felt Suraht was missing. Is the we have the twelve pound ball of tar versus a fully grown woman.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:19.040
Once again she's completely helpless. She doesn't have, like limbs or anything she can use to fight back.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.230
Has to be saved by a freaking BALL OF TAR.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.710
And that's really what I wanted to addendum to that one.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.590
And here we have the other game, Super Meat Boy, which my controller actually does work with. Fancy that.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:54.290
Anyways this is the other part of what I don't think Suraht emphasized in his rant that actually is probably more important than the first bit. Probably not more important, but certainly is of an importance.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:03.240
*screen switching and level selecting*

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:10.600
OK. Here we go. He just punched her in the face.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:19.840
Now I know most of you are like "What's up with thaaat?" Violence against women in a serious problem.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.320
And if you can't see that, YOU have problems.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.620
And this just doesn't happen there.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.980
Happens here...

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.970
and pretty much every other level you start out with.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.240
Here.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.210
And again, he kicks her.

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.210
There we go.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:06.460
Ohh a super mega ultra punch to the face! Have we hit enough of these girlfriend's yet till you get the message?

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:21.510
He does the Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) pulls-her-to-him-and-then-uppercuts-her.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.420
Yeaaah. This guy's a real winner.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:43.710
Yup. Does pretty much well every kind of imaginable fighting move against her.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.800
And she's just standing there.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.460
Doesn't just kidnap her like, Princess Daisy (Super Mario Land), Princess Peach (Super Mario Bros.).

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.460
I think it's Peach (AKA: Princess Toadstool).

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:07.060
Yup! Have we hit enough girlfriend's in the face yet, I think I've made my point here.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:15.460
This guy is just, an outright misogynist. Here we have violence against women.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.760
That's like the worst kind of offense.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:28.540
I mean, Dr. Fetus could just kidnap her. Just grab her and go away, which you know kidnapping the princess show a lack of-- (imagination)

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.420
Why does he need that here? Seriously Why?

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:40.040
Is she a threat? Are you saying she can fight back? I mean she's obviously not fighting back. She's just standing there.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:48.460
Now now you can say "Well that just makes Dr. Fetus all the more evil!" No it.. NO.. just NO!

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.050
"See he just flagged us off!" NO.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.500
This kind of shit, you see it in pretty much well every other game.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:06.440
And it's time it stops. This just proves a bigger point that, yeaaah.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.100
The final thing about The Binding of Isaac...

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.780
If anybody, if you know the whole legend of Isaac. It was the father that was sacrificing the son.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:32.400
Here, in that is the mother. Let's just say she's described as hideous, disgusting and bloated.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:43.260
And women a lot are called fat, ugly and slutty. That's actually a website.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:50.710
So, yeah, even in The Binding of Isaac we can see his misogynistic tentacles.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:08:05.070
And that pretty much well all I have to add as an addendum to Suraht's rant is just emphasizing, yeah the games are pretty bad and the games themselves show it.
