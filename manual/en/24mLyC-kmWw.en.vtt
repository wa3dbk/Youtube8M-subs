00:00:00.273 --> 00:00:04.402
(low, tense music)

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.378
(reigns jingle)
(horses' hooves crunch snow)

00:00:21.842 --> 00:00:23.737
- Got room for one more?

00:00:23.737 --> 00:00:24.835
(gun clicks)

00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:30.001
(music with a steady beat)

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.719
They call him The Hangman.

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.373
(chain rattles)

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:39.930
When the handbill says "Dead or Alive,"

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.347
the rest of us just shoot you in the back

00:00:41.347 --> 00:00:42.928
from up on top a perch somewhere,

00:00:42.928 --> 00:00:44.834
and bring you in dead over a saddle.

00:00:45.192 --> 00:00:48.170
But when John Ruth, The
Hangman catches you...

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:50.388
You hang.

00:00:51.252 --> 00:00:52.184
- Get him, boys!

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.998
(dramatic music)

00:00:57.651 --> 00:00:59.440
- This here is Daisy Domergue.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.236
She's wanted dead or alive for murder.

00:01:03.532 --> 00:01:05.188
When that sun comes out,

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:07.447
I'm taking this woman to hang.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:11.120
Is there anybody here,

00:01:11.427 --> 00:01:15.009
committed to stopping me from doing that?

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:18.473
- Well, well, well, looks
like Minnie's Haberdashery

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:20.429
is about to get cozy
for the next few days.

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:21.684
- Yes, it does.

00:01:21.684 --> 00:01:26.380
(dramatic music with a beat)

00:01:30.136 --> 00:01:31.372
- One of them fellows,

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:35.842
is not what he says he is.

00:01:37.961 --> 00:01:38.706
(gun clicks)

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:40.024
- Move a little strange?

00:01:40.377 --> 00:01:41.476
You gonna get a bullet.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.157
Not a warning, not a question.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:46.035
(gunshot)

00:01:46.035 --> 00:01:46.815
A bullet.

00:01:50.898 --> 00:01:52.016
- Yee haw!

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:53.543
Now we're talking!

00:01:59.176 --> 00:02:01.193
(laughs)

00:02:01.193 --> 00:02:02.973
(gun clicks)
(gunshot)

00:02:02.973 --> 00:02:07.772
(whistling music)
