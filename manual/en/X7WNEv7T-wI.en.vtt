00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.704
Marc:So here's a quick and accurate way

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:11.103
to install hinges without measuring

00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:12.264
and the only thing we need to do

00:00:12.264 --> 00:00:14.679
is transfer marks from
one piece to another

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.852
and it's incredibly
accurate and very quick.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.941
It does require, however, a little bit

00:00:18.941 --> 00:00:20.837
of planning on your part to make sure

00:00:20.837 --> 00:00:22.638
you know exactly how you're going to be

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:24.392
doing this later on down the road.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.365
Now in this particular example,

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:29.456
I've got mortises already
in the side of my cabinet

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.541
and I need to transfer those locations

00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:33.525
of those mortises to the door so that

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:36.637
the hinges line exactly
the same location on both.

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:38.269
If it's even slightly off,

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.624
those hinges are not
going to work properly.

00:00:40.877 --> 00:00:44.041
So the way that I like to do
this is by using center lines.

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:46.164
Instead of marking the absolute start

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:49.069
and stop location of
each hinge and measuring

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:50.868
and trying to transfer those numbers,

00:00:50.868 --> 00:00:53.060
I'm doing everything based on center point

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.660
so that if I align this little
jig that I made for my router,

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.500
if I line that with that center point,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.780
the base of the router starts and stops

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.849
based on where I have my stops placed.

00:01:03.893 --> 00:01:06.804
But all I need to do is line
up my center line on the jig

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:08.888
with the center line on the work piece.

00:01:08.916 --> 00:01:11.061
So if I can transfer the center line

00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:14.300
of these existing mortises
here to my new door

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.289
and then put the jig
onto the door like so,

00:01:17.477 --> 00:01:19.380
I should be able to get the mortises

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.480
placed in exactly the right position.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.564
It all starts by placing the door

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:26.853
in the location that we want it to be.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.794
You see, we could measure this and try

00:01:28.794 --> 00:01:30.594
and mark it all out, but for me,

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:32.378
the dummy proof way of doing this is

00:01:32.378 --> 00:01:34.394
to make sure that the door is in exactly

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.993
the position that we will want
it to be as a final result

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:41.682
so I stabilize it and
immobilize it in position

00:01:41.682 --> 00:01:43.710
so that I can transfer
the marks accurately.

00:01:44.016 --> 00:01:46.511
Now you can use little
thins trips of veneer,

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:48.847
of, you know, drum sanded strips

00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:50.179
of wood if you wanted to.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.063
I just have an old feeler
gauge set that I'm using.

00:01:53.063 --> 00:01:56.011
I just took it all apart and
I'm just using these as shims.

00:01:56.135 --> 00:01:59.583
The idea here is to shim
the door so it's centered

00:02:00.213 --> 00:02:02.035
in exactly the way that you want it.

00:02:02.839 --> 00:02:04.571
Okay, I put one set at the bottom.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.199
It doesn't matter what the number is.

00:02:06.706 --> 00:02:09.127
It just matters that your door is centered

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.999
and completely immobilized.

00:02:11.643 --> 00:02:12.948
The metal ones are a little bit slippery

00:02:12.948 --> 00:02:15.471
so that's probably the
only disadvantage here.

00:02:16.763 --> 00:02:18.256
Okay, so I have it at the bottom

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.534
and now I'm going to
insert these at the top

00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:22.847
and that's going to lock
everything in place.

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:27.583
See?

00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:31.079
Now it's not going to move.

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:34.371
And then from this point, it's as easy

00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:36.608
as transferring that
center line to the door.

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:43.148
Now with these center lines in place,

00:02:43.148 --> 00:02:45.971
all I need to do is attach my jig,

00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:47.488
start up the router, and go.

00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:49.731
And I can be absolutely certain that

00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:51.484
those hinge mortises are going to be

00:02:51.484 --> 00:02:53.767
in the exact location
that I want them to be.

00:03:05.524 --> 00:03:08.455
Okay, one down, one to go.
