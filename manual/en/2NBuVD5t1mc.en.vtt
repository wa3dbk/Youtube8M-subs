Hi my name is Mike and I'm here today to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.000
show you the new Makita. These are heated

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.119
jackets which is great during the winter

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.619
time, especially in the high altitudes.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.660
It's got several features that really

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.110
make it a nice feature, a nice 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
jacket. It works with the 18 volt Makita

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.460
lithium-ion battery which just slips on

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.070
and you can put it in this small pocket

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.510
on one side of your jacket. Okay the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.520
jacket itself turns on and you've got

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.390
your your buttons to control the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.140
temperature there. So it's on, it's on

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.469
high, now click it again, medium and low.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.159
So you can set the heat it has. Let me

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.170
turn it off here, okay. It has several

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.329
heating zones and you can tell where

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.940
they're sewn in. Patches are on the

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.719
jacket itself so that tells you that

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.440
heats on the back and on the sides. Also

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.900
something else that I didn't mention on

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:17.340
this charger, if you look on the charger

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.010
itself it has where to go, it has a USB

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.290
port so you can hook your USB port into

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.450
charge your iPad, your Android device,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.490
your Kindle, whatever. So it's got that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.490
feature also which is very helpful.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.080
Okay so

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.880
maybe jacket it's very comfortable,

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.710
form-fitting, it's knitted around the

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.740
sleeves, it's a high quality jacket.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.110
You're talking about $200 for the jacket

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.960
itself, that's not including the battery.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.850
So you have to buy the battery extra but

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.979
once again it's a great value if you

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.700
have Makita stuff. Now this would be a

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.700
wonderful addition.
