00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.340
Namco is almost always the first thing to
pop into my mind when I hear someone say “arcade

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.340
game.”

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.110
The company has produced more great arcade
titles than just about anyone.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.110
From Galaga to Pac-man, Xevious and Dig Dug,
Namco dominated the arcade age with some of

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.410
the best games ever made.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.320
Now recently, Namco’s best success has been
as a publisher, with titles like Dark Souls

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.900
under the Namco Bandai label.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.640
That’s not to say that they haven’t developed
some great titles like Tekken or the too-harshly

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.050
critiqued Star Fox Assault, but Namco’s
best games were released many years ago, and

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.620
they aren’t afraid to point it out with
their Namco Museum games.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:57.950
This is Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for
the GameCube.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.500
Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary is a really
simple title.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.049
When you start it up, you’re immediately
greeted with your choice of Namco arcade game.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.290
Pretty much anything you could think of is
available.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.500
Both Pac-man and Ms. Pac-man, Dig Dug, Galaga,
Galaxian, Xevious, Pole Position 1 and 2,

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.440
Rally-X, Mappy and several others.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.390
Now, I just reviewed an Atari arcade collection
the other day, and although that was on a

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.600
handheld console and this isn’t, the amount
of content is just stunning.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.310
I was trying to think of any games they missed,
and I just couldn’t.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.560
In fact, the only thing about the collection
that I didn’t care for was that Galaxian

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.560
was included.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.310
Galaga is a game that bested its predecessor
in every way, and it’s always curious to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.280
me why Namco always chooses to include both
of them on these collections.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.030
While the amount of content on the disk is
incredible, the GameCube’s controls do not

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.810
do the games any favors.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.920
Pac-man and Pole Position are especially tricky,
as neither the analog stick or d-pad seem

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.180
to want to cooperate.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.060
It really depends on the game, though.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.880
While titles like Rolling Thunder and Bosconian
feel a little sloppy with the GameCube’s

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.710
controls, Dig-Dug, Rally-X and Xevius all
play excellently.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.710
It’s strange to see, as the issue doesn’t
even seem connected to particular genres.

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:16.950
At museums, some people like to sit back and
enjoy how well art has stood up over time.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.700
That’s what makes things classic, and why
the items are in the museum in the first place.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.890
For the most part, these games do just that.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.231
With a few, personal exceptions that I won’t
mention, as they are just my own tastes, every

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.010
game on this disk is just as much fun as when
it first came out.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.370
My favorite Namco game is Dig-Dug, and blowing
guys up with that pump is still a blast.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.740
The visuals of the original arcade games also
remain unchanged in this collection.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.390
Every game looks exactly as you’d remember
it, and the game audio also stays the same.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.660
It’s kind of charming to hear how Namco
used some similar sound effects in different

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.530
games to accomplish different things, and
just because your brain sees something different

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.810
happening, it doesn’t sound the same.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.310
Namco was the king of arcade games back in
the day, and Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.510
is a terrific collection of the best Namco
had to offer.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.930
Maybe even get your older siblings or parents
to give it a try and see which games they

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:15.590
remember.
