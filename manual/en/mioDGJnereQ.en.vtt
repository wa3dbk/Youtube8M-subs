00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.110
THIS WEEK AT INTERIOR…

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.210
SECRETARY JEWELL WELCOMED AMBASSADORS FROM
THREE PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS TO WASHINGTON

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.520
THIS WEEK, WHERE SHE HOSTED A PANEL DISCUSSION
ON THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE THROUGHOUT

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520
THE REGION.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.450
THE SECRETARY SAYS THE PACIFIC ISLANDS ARE
ON THE FRONT LINES WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.340
CHANGE, AS RISING SEA LEVELS THREATEN THEIR
VERY EXISTENCE…

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.110
ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INSULAR AREAS ESTHER
KIA-AINA SAYS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL REQUIRE

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.950
A GLOBAL RESPONSE.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.510
FAILURE OF NATION STATES INTERNATIONALLY TO
DEAL SERIOUSLY WITH THE ISSUE OF CARBON EMISSIONS

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.080
IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR
ALL PEOPLE IN THE WORLD, NOT JUST THOSE IN

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.620
THE INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES THAT HAVE LARGER
MASSES, AND CAN PROBABLY DEAL WITH CLIMATE

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.440
CHANGE ON A MORE LONG-TERM BASIS.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.040
THESE ISLAND NATIONS ARE LIVING CLIMATE CHANGE,
THEY’RE BREATHING CLIMATE CHANGE, THEIR

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.570
FOOD SECURITY IS IMPACTED, THEIR CULTURES
ARE IMPACTED.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.640
I’M LOOKING TO THE CONFERENCE AS AN AREA
WHERE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE TECHNICAL KNOW-HOW,

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.810
FINANCIAL RESOURCES, TO TAKE ON WHAT WE HAVE
TO SAY AND WHAT OUR ASPIRATIONS ARE AND HELP

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.100
US TO BUILD THE RESILIENCE WE NEED TO COPE
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.090
A NEW REPORT THIS WEEK SHOWS A MAJORITY OF
STREAMS IN THE CHESAPEAKE REGION ARE WARMING

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.090
UP…

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.679
AND THAT INCREASE IS DRIVEN BY RISING AIR
TEMPERATURES.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.670
THE FINDINGS ARE BASED ON NEW USGS RESEARCH
PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL CLIMATIC CHANGE….

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.700
THE ACTUAL TEMPERATURE INCREASES MAY SEEM
SMALL -- WATER TEMPERATURES HAVE GONE UP ABOUT

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.770
TWO AND HALF DEGREES SINCE 1960, AIR TEMPERATURES
LESS THAN TWO DEGREES -- BUT SCIENTISTS POINT

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.520
OUT EVEN SMALL INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE CAN
HAVE A REAL EFFECT ON WATER QUALITY AND THE

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.329
ANIMALS THAT INHABIT THE REGION.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.080
YOU CAN FIND OUT MORE AT USGS.GOV.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.990
AND SECRETARY JEWELL THIS WEEK ANNOUNCING
NEW TOOLS TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES BUILD

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.859
RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE CHANGE…

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.200
HUNDREDS OF DATASETS FROM NUMEROUS FEDERAL
DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.340
INTO TWO THEMATIC DATA HUBS FOR “ECOSYSTEM
VULNERABILITY” AND “WATER,” AND ARE

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.360
NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE TO THE PUBLIC FOR FREE.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.470
POOLING ALL THAT DATA INTO ONE LOCATION WILL
MAKE THE INFORMATION MORE ACCESSIBLE AND IS

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.830
PART OF THE PRESIDENT’S CLIMATE DATA INITIATIVE
TO SPARK PRIVATE SECTOR INNOVATION.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.860
THE NEW DATASETS ARE AVAILABLE AT CLIMATE
DOT DATA DOT GOV.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.850
AND DEPUTY SECRETARY MIKE CONNOR THIS WEEK
ANNOUNCED IT’S A MAJOR MILESTONE FOR THE

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.960
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND THE WESTERN
SOLAR PLAN.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.720
BLM RELEASED ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS FOR
THREE PROPOSED UTILITY SCALE SOLAR ENERGY

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.140
PROJECTS IN THE DRY LAKE SOLAR ENERGY ZONE
IN CLARK COUNTY NEVADA.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.250
ALL TOLD THOSE PROJECTS WOULD GENERATE A COMBINED
480 MEGAWATTS OF ELECTRICITY.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.540
USING A LANDSCAPE LEVEL APPROACH, THE REVIEWS
WERE COMPLETED IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS, OR

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.660
ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF THE TIME UNDER THE PREVIOUS
PROJECT-BY-PROJECT SYSTEM.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.180
READ MORE AT BLM.GOV.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.069
