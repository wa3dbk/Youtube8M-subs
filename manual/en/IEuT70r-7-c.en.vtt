00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.900
The 18 Watch-Out situations are part of the
backbone of wildland firefighting operations.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.180
Together, with the 10 Standard Fire Orders,
they act as guidelines to help firefighters

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.400
with the decision making process.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.460
In the late 1960’s, the 13 situations that
shout Watch-Out, were developed as a tool

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.980
to help firefighters be more proactive, rather
than reactive, in hazardous situations.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.680
In 1987, 5 more Watch-Outs were added to the
list, and they were renamed the 18 Watch-Out Situations.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.660
The Watch-Out Situations are dynamic, and
need to be continually referenced throughout

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.010
an operational period.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.360
They can be used as trigger points, or, help
recall a past experience that you can apply

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.260
to the current situation.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.730
To be effective, firefighters should understand
the meaning of each Watch-Out, and know how

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.920
to apply them during a wildland fire.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.420
Memorization, is not enough, when it comes
to the 18 Watch-Out situations.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.840
The Watch-Out Fire
It was 0430, and the Captain was not happy.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.040
An hour before, he woke up to a phone call
from the District Ranger.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.939
The Ranger told him to round up some engines
and head out to a reported lightning strike

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.759
fire, spotted by a lookout.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.091
The Ranger said there had already been enough
large fires on her district that summer, and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.280
she did not want another.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.420
When the engines arrived on scene, they couldn’t
see any smoke or fire, “probably because

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.920
it’s still dark”, the Captain said to
himself.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.940
The Rangers' instructions and assignments were
not clear.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.740
She told the Captain to go find the fire,
and they would decide what action to take later.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.380
The Captain and the other engines had 
arrived from different states just yesterday,

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.220
so there were already unfamiliar with weather,
and local factors that influence the fire behavior.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.080
And now, they were in country not seen in
daylight.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.240
“What a way to start the day”, the Captain
mumbled.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.560
The Captain introduced himself to the firefighters
and told them to split up and hike around

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560
to try and find the fire.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.980
He realized the firefighters were uninformed
on strategy, tactics, and hazards, and safety

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.900
zones and escape routes had not been identified.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.320
But he wasn’t going to waste their time
with those until he knew the fire location.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.440
Around 1 o'clock, the weather was getting hotter
and drier.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.680
The Captain finally saw the smoke coming from
the bottom of the drainage.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.520
Because of the difficult terrain, he couldn’t
see the main fire, and wasn’t in contact

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.780
with anyone who could.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.760
And he had no communication link with the
other crew members as well.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.440
The fire had not been scouted or sized up,
so he decided to hike down and take a look.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.239
When he got down there, he was relieved to
see the fire was small, in the shade, and

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.519
just smoldering.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.739
The Captain was tired from the long morning,
so we decided to have lunch, and take a nap

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.600
near the fireline, before he started to mop-up.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.180
The Capitan woke up to a fire that was now
very active.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.020
The wind had increased and changed direction, fanning flames.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.200
He needed help.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.520
Luckily, he was able to contact some firefighters
who were back at the engines, located on the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.920
road above him.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.860
The Captain told them to start building fireline
downhill, towards the fire below.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.180
He warned the firefighters there was a lot
of unburned fuel between them and the fire.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.420
He started attempting a frontal assault on
the fire, but the fire was more than he could handle going direct.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.520
The Captain and decided to start digging line
up towards the firefighters coming down.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.700
Unfortunately, he started constructing fireline
without a safe anchor point.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.560
The firefighters digging above were on a hillside
where rolling maternal started to ignite the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.400
fuel below, where the Captain had no anchor
point.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.920
He started getting frequent spot fires across
the line.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.580
The fire was now out of control.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.780
At this point, the Captain knew he and the
other firefighters were in real trouble.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.970
Everything was happening so fast. He didn’t
have any safety zones identified, and even

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.780
if he did, the terrain and fuels would make
the escape to the safety zones very difficult.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.050
He frantically contacted the firefighters
digging down the hill, and yelled for them

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.840
to pull back to the engines, because the fire
was racing their way.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.640
As the shocked firefighters ran up the hill,
they could feel the heat from the wind and

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.550
the flames at their backs.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.750
The Captain was now surrounded by fire, he couldn’t

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.480
believe what was happening.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.340
Suddenly, the winds died down.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.100
The Captain saw a gap in the flames and jumped
through fire.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.620
He scrambled up through the black of the scorched
hillside.

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.420
As he crested the hill, the Captain’s heart
sank.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.760
The engines along, with the deployed fire
shelters, were engulfed in flames.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.400
He tried to get to the shelters, but the heat
was unbearable.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.200
The Captain dropped to his knees, tears mixed
with sweat.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.360
Thinking about the firefighters, his mind
filled with guilt and grief.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.400
He’d been careless with their safety, and
now they’d paid the ultimate price for his mistakes.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.060
The nightmare had become reality.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.280
Then, out of nowhere, he heard voices.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.880
He thought it was his radio, but when he turned,
he saw firefighters rushing through the smoke towards him.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.340
They had not been inside the fire shelters.
The high winds had ripped the shelters from their hands.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.280
The firefighters grabbed the overwhelmed Captain,
and led him down the escape route, to the

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.920
safety zone the firefighters had established
prior to the blowup.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.600
Looking back, the Captain realized he’d
took the 18 Watch-Out situations for granted.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.819
He vowed never to forget the lessons he learned
that fateful day on the fireline.
