Hello everyone. My name is Tasha and welcome to Heart of Tarts.

00:00:03.174 --> 00:00:09.070
Today on the show we will be making an ode 
 to the most disgusting Halloween Candy ever made.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.618
Candy Corn. Oh my gosh, it is so bad. 
 It is worst than Christmas fruit cake.

00:00:14.618 --> 00:00:17.722
It is worst than Easter Cadbury Creme Eggs.

00:00:17.722 --> 00:00:24.360
And it is worst than the Fourth of July Red, White, and 
 Blue Gelatin molds. It is that bad. It is really bad.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:31.863
I was watching Chris Pirillo's vlog and his wife Diana 
 was just gobbling up this bowl of candy corn.

00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:38.811
Like "Oh my God, it is so good." And I am like no, no 
 it is not. I was going to do a Candy Corn Tart,

00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:41.642
but then I was like no I am not doing 
 anything for Candy Corn because it is so bad.

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:46.156
But once I saw that Chris Pirillo agreed with 
 me and my sentiment about Candy Corn,

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:50.548
I was like okay. I can do an ode 
 to this  disgusting horrible candy again.

00:00:50.548 --> 00:00:53.110
So let's get started on this recipe.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.166
We are going to start by preheating our oven to 
 350 degrees F. Then to a food processor

00:00:58.166 --> 00:01:04.337
add 1 1/2 cups old fashion oats along with 2 pitted dates 
 I used today. Just trying something out since the

00:01:04.337 --> 00:01:08.149
tart is going to be so bad. You know in honor of Candy Corn.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.671
Blend that all together until it forms a flour and then 
 we are going to add in 1/4 teaspoon salt,

00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:20.095
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, 2 tablespoons coconut oil, and 1/3 cup almond milk.

00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:23.032
To try to add more moisture since I am 
 taking away a little of the fat.

00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:27.688
Pulse that together until it is just combined and then 
 press it around a 9 inch tart pan.

00:01:27.688 --> 00:01:31.774
I hope you had on clothes.

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:35.523
To make our filling, I am using one honey crisp apple and 2 bananas.

00:01:35.523 --> 00:01:41.260
I am going to make a puree in my food processor. 
 Peel the honey crisp apple in honor of fall.

00:01:41.265 --> 00:01:46.310
I love honey crisp apples. Core it, put it in 
 the food processor with the two bananas.

00:01:46.307 --> 00:01:48.130
Blend it all around and then pour it into your tart crust.

00:01:48.384 --> 00:01:52.810
Spread it around in an even layer and then we 
 are going to get started on our topping.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:57.050
I looked up a little bit of history on Candy Corn, because 
 I knew it had to be one of those old time

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:04.290
candies that should have been phased out when we 
 got new technology to make nicer flavored things.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.750
The story goes that candy corn was invented in 1880 Pennsylvania.

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:17.320
How could the same state responsible for Hershey's Chocolate, you 
 know Hershey's Pennsylvania, be responsible for Candy Corn?

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:22.010
How could this be? My brain explodes in like awfulness.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.960
These two just do not go together.

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.020
For our topping, we are going to use three lemons and two oranges.

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:32.180
If you are smart, you will look up 
 a video on how to supreme citrus,

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:37.700
but I am going to do it by but because 
 once again my obsessive compulsiveness just sings

00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:40.060
when I get to do this intricate hand work.

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:45.280
I get to peel it off, then I get to take 
 the white membrane off each one of the segments.

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:49.530
It took me like two ridiculous hours to do 
 this, but I was so happy.

00:02:49.528 --> 00:02:57.560
I was in the flow. I was finding my bliss and my 
 nirvana while I did this intricate work. It was so good.

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:02.440
We are not going to my the individual cones on candy corn, 
 because that would be paying too much honor and respect.

00:03:02.435 --> 00:03:06.070
We are just going to do a ring pattern in the same colors.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.810
So for the outer ring of yellow we are going to use our lemons.

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.860
And, for the inner ring of orange, we are 
 going to use our oranges, duh.

00:03:13.864 --> 00:03:18.900
For the direct center, for our white. I am 
 just going to use a banana slice.

00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:25.850
I was just going to leave it empty, but it looked really stupid 
 and the apple banana filling wasn't as white as I needed it.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.240
So I just stuck a little banana right there in the 
 center. In the hole and it turned out great.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.260
It looks pretty. It looks awesome. And if you want to add 
 a little salt, because citrus taste very good with salt,

00:03:37.265 --> 00:03:43.730
you can sprinkle on a little salt if you want to. It is a 
 little sad to say that this filling also made my crust soggy.

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:49.250
The apple just had too much moisture and the banana 
 just wasn't creamy enough to conceal it all.

00:03:49.248 --> 00:03:53.920
Not as bad as our pear filling from the 
 other day, but not so good either.

00:03:53.925 --> 00:04:00.850
But it is all an ode to this horrible horrible candy. So I can do 
 whatever I want today. I can make as many mistakes as I want

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.930
and keep it moving.

00:04:01.926 --> 00:04:06.080
Candy Corn definitely had to be a trail and 
 ERROR on the way to Hershey's chocolate.

00:04:06.082 --> 00:04:09.670
It was just a little bump in the road on the way to Hershey's.

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:11.420
But it is jut that. It should have stayed back 
 there in the past. You know when you

00:04:11.421 --> 00:04:16.040
go over a bump and you don't look back. You just leave 
 it back there where it was? That is Candy Corn.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.210
Don't look back. Just look away. It does not exist.

00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:24.480
And is lemon an offensive fruit to ask people 
 to eat raw? Yeah. It kinda is.

00:04:24.482 --> 00:04:28.290
But guess what? It is not as bad as 
 Candy Corn. So we are still winning.

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:31.070
I like lemon, so that is why I used it.

00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:34.990
When I looked up the history of candy corn 
 I figured out why I don't like it.

00:04:34.993 --> 00:04:41.990
It is a mixture of corn syrup and fondant and 
 marshmallow fluff and as you all can see

00:04:41.989 --> 00:04:44.460
I threw Cadbury Easter Eggs under the bus before

00:04:44.455 --> 00:04:46.890
they have a fondant center as well.

00:04:46.888 --> 00:04:50.320
I know when they roll out fondant for 
 cakes, I don't like that either.

00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:56.310
So any time fondant is involved in me eating it. 
 It is going to be a disaster.

00:04:56.311 --> 00:04:58.980
If you like fondant, you probably like candy corn.

00:04:58.983 --> 00:05:02.250
So Diana, you will probably like that fondant that you put on cake.

00:05:02.248 --> 00:05:07.990
You know that plastic sheath that they cover cakes with and think 
 just because it is edible you are suppose to put

00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:11.430
it in your mouth. No no no, play dough is 
 edible too, but you don't see me eating it.

00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:15.780
Thank you so much for watching today and hopefully I have encouraged 
 you to hate candy corn as much as I do.

00:05:15.775 --> 00:05:18.470

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:22.490
If you hate candy corn, but love me, which you 
 probably don't by the end of this video,

00:05:22.486 --> 00:05:24.050
subscribe to my YouTube channel.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.270
And if you really care, share it with your friends. Especially if 
 you want to encourage other people to hate candy corn.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.600
Join the alliance. Bye.
