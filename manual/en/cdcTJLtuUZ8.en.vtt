00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.740
I leap to Patagonia. The sea bathing this
shore is full of nourishment for the colonies

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.000
of wolves, seals, sea elephants, and penguins.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
At the same time the place is full of nourishment for others.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In mid February the most dreaded predators arrive: killer whales.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It's a family, with calves... Its main focus is not seals or wolves but
sea elephants that are in breeding season.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
In the face of the enemy, vigilance is heightened.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:30.500
The killer whales communicate with one another through sounds. These allow them to hunt from wolves to sharks.
An elephant has decided to venture into the waters

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.700
Believing perhaps that the killer whales have disappeared deep into the sea.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.400
But they have not left. They're still prowling.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.000
The female in charge of the pack has spotted
him and goes back.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.509
The elephant tries to do the same but... too late.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.300
I cannot say for sure, but it seems to me there is wailing on the shore.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.500
Young killer whales participate actively.
They are learning to hunt and attack the elephant while learning to fend off his attack.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Although the male sea elephant is a mammal
of great size, it's difficult for him to face one of the ocean's most intelligent predators.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.400
The death of this animal pains me, not because

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.400
he will die (killer whales do not live on algae) but
because of how long it takes for him to die. They are in no hurry.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.000
It's over. Rest assured, I will never set foot in these waters.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.620
