BURCU KILINC: I think technology gives a chance to us to learn more things about the cultures and the world around us.

00:00:15.148 --> 00:00:23.323
SHAI TAL: Technology networks actually create a human network that can go across borders and cultures and lines.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:32.065
I?m from Israel, and yesterday was the first day of my life meeting someone from Palestine.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:35.001
It's a life-changing experience for me.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:46.012
KHALIL CHERKI: MYTecC is the Mediterranean Youth Technology Club, which is based on technology as a way, and a shortcut, to build bridges between different cultures.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:08.501
SHAKED SHILO: We use the web tools, like Facebook, and we do projects for students from one country and another country to introduce each other and to see the country, and understand the country, and understand the culture.

00:01:08.535 --> 00:01:12.872
So they're interviewing each other, thinking about values that they believe together.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:22.916
XXX: Getting closer and closer and understanding each other, and destroying stereotypes -- these are the special tools of MYTecC.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.885
SHAKED SHILO: People will see that everybody is human.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:35.895
We can talk with each other and maybe the border will be broken, and we can travel wherever we want, and we can talk and be friends with whoever we want, and nobody will tell us that is not OK.

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:42.869
I think the biggest impact of the program is just to leave the prejudice out and see each other as human beings.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.043
KHALIL CHERKI: I'm sure I'm speaking with everyone when I say that we are new people thanks to this initiative.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:02:02.388
OSNAT TAL: My wish is that in ten years, all of our students who are now 14 years old, will be great friends and will not feel the gaps between one another. 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.259
And they can visit each other, and maybe there will be peace.
