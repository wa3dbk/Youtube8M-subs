00:00:03.716 --> 00:00:05.716
Here is the small parking lot, where one can park, when coming to Sangstrup for an expedition.

00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:20.901
Behind the cliff, visible just before, but fogged over now,is an other parking lot, 1or 2 km away, at Karlby Klint,

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:21.798
which is the cliff one might glimpse through the fog,

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.772
and between the two cliffs is a small beach, where Sangstrup Klint starts right here.

00:00:44.683 --> 00:00:50.340
Not many places in Denmark have exposed lime cliffs

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.959
The formation seen here, is the same as at Møns Klint

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:03.144
and the same as in the Aalborg-area 

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:07.800
where Aalborg Portland makes cement,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.666
useing the lime material

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:16.338
for cement production,

00:01:17.516 --> 00:01:20.920
It is the same formation that surfaces at Møns Klint,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.368
At the east coast of Djursland,

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:25.735
and in the Aalborg-area

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:36.515
It is said that German warships during Second World War,

00:01:36.515 --> 00:01:42.620
test-shot their cannons into the cliffs,

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.790
out from the sea, Kattegat, and if one is lucky,

00:01:47.788 --> 00:01:53.300
one can find rusted cannon-ball holes in the cliffs,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:06.580
This might be the leftovers of a cannon ball hole,

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:14.650
and here we have a couple of holes

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:17.480
which presumably are cannon ball holes,

00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:25.330
round another outcrop

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:34.350
so if on likes to go for a walks in peace and quiet,

00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:31.140
In winther this area is totally empty,

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.470
actually in summertime there aren't very many people either,

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.810
this is actually an interesting place up here, 

00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:47.940
I am looking like mad for something that resembles nice fossils, 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:54.500
a couple of years ago I found a really nice stone,

00:02:54.496 --> 00:02:55.860
that I have brought with me, 

00:02:55.856 --> 00:03:03.350
and will show, but it could be fun, if more or less 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:04.180
on the spur, on a trip like this, 

00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.540
might find something worth showing

00:03:06.538 --> 00:03:14.260
the cliffs are broken down continuesly by the ocean and frost and thaw,

00:03:14.257 --> 00:03:24.400
new million year old cliff-faces are exposed all the time

00:03:24.405 --> 00:03:33.960
which can contain all kinds of stuff, ranging from 
 something that only slightly resembles a fossil

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:34.820
to really fine things

00:03:34.818 --> 00:03:43.360
This nice bit, was found on the beach here,
